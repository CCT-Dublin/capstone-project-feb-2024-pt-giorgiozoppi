239,Wonderful celebration visit,"My Mom and I stayed at Mount Juliet, in the Hunter's Yard, for three nights on a trip to celebrate her retirement and 65th birthday, which the hotel marked with a special treat. The room was clean, large and well appointed, with nice decor. The bed was really comfortable. The staff were helpful and friendly. The breakfast had the usual items and the restaurants had limited dinner menus, but the food we had was tasty. We enjoyed the movie theatre, spa treatments, and the grounds of the estate. There were other activities available as well, which we didn't book.  There is a shuttle service between the two hotel locations on site. Not a walkable location as there is little outside the grounds, but it was easy to get a taxi to Kilkenny for sightseeing if you ask reception. Kilkenny has a few tourist activities, but is pretty small. We downloaded the Free Now app and it worked great to get a taxi from Kilkenny back to the hotel. Jerpoint Abbey is a nice little historic site just a short drive down the street. There is plenty to do if you are looking for a leisurely, relaxed break. It may not be your thing if you are looking for a hotel/area for lots of tourist sightseeing/activities. My Mom was disappointed there were no longer equestrian activities, and found the pool too cold. Otherwise, it was a perfect stay.",5,2024,10,14
239,Outstanding Hotel,"This is such an outstanding hotel! Just returned from one night. I cannot recommend it  highly enough! The staff in every part of the hotel are exceptional - every one smiling and greeting you. Check in was super, lovely reception area, rooms were above and beyond, heated bathroom floors, and also with the extra addition  (which is so welcome) of a fridge with a choice of sparkling or normal Ballygowan water and also a coffee machine and tea making facilities. Had dinner in the Hound, once again super meal, super service. 
Lastly the breakfast this morning was superb! Such a wide and varied array of food. One of the only hotels I have stayed in where you get real orange juice!! The selection for the fry was also wonderful and also noted there was no grease on any of it. A chef cooks your eggs how you like, toast is plentiful as are the coffees. Big shout out to Mary who was the hostess for breakfast. When she heard I was heading off on a long car journey, asked me if I might like a coffee to go! What a lovely little send off! 
Honestly this hotel does not fault on any level. Can’t wait to return!",5,2024,02,23
239,A little disappointed,"We were on a driving tour of Ireland with friends. We had arrived on the ferry from Fishguard so arrived fairly late at the hotel. We had visited this hotel on a similar tour in 2015 and were very impressed with the exceptional  quality of the service. On this occasion, whilst the service was good it was less than outstanding. We had to walk from the carpark to reception and search for someone to get our bags. Service at the reception desk was slow and it was nearly 7:40 pm before we got to our rooms and we had dinner booked in the Hound restaurant for 8 pm. We had a nice room and bathroom facilities were good. Dinner in the Hound was OK but not up to the level we had expected. Breakfast was mainly buffet including the hot food where we had expected this to be freshly cooked. Overall a little disappointed compared to our previous experience.",4,2024,09,26
239,Excellent guided tour of Manor House by Sean,Guide Sean provided us with a detailed and thoroughly enjoyable tour of Manor House. He was very knowledgeable and shared great detail on especially the stately Manor House and Hunters Yard.His sincerity and passion for this majestic estate was evident throughout.We really enjoyed ourselves.,5,2024,09,25
239,Worst 5 star stay,"Stayed here for one night with my
Boyfriend and was not a good experience.

We booked to Stay in mount Juliet but little did we know we weren’t staying in the Manor House , but the courtyard hotel in the property. The Manor House and all facilities from the Manor House was closed off due to a private function so bare that in mind when booking with this place as they don’t tell you in advance.

We phone that week to book into the lady Helen restaurant to be told we can’t as it’s a private function and can’t access the Manor House.. only for we rang we would have never known.

They promised to up grade our room over the confusion.. however they never did.

 When checking staff struggled to understand and apologised for not upgrading…

We had a family member ring in advance and give a voucher as a birthday gift to be left in the room with a card… was never done.
They paid for this voucher and yet staff just didn’t alert us of this.
Thankfully we knew in advance and rang reception when it wasn’t in room…
So if we didn’t ring we wouldn’t have gotten voucher even though it was paid for???-

If you are a five star hotel all staff employed should be fluent in English.
If you’re coming to this hotel to experience Irish culture don’t bother. Not one Irish staff member worked for the two days we were there. Was disappointing to not encounter one Irish staff member to discuss our issues with. The members of staff we brought the issues to , had trouble understanding and were very incompetent to deal with it.

When dinner time came we could
 Had more problems. The waiter came to take order after sitting around for ages and split the candle over my partner and burnt his leg with wax…again the lack of English speaking caused more frustration.

The bar in hunters yard was also very disappointing nothing exciting.
We had been looking forward to use the whiskey bar in mount Juliet but again was closed off to public ..

We went to the pool the next day and jacuzzi was closed… it was just a very bad five star experience.

It’s not worth going.
I’d recommend spending your money and going to a better hotel With Irish staff to experience Irish culture and better quality of service.
Was shocking.",1,2024,09,23
239,Lovely period hotel in Kilkenney,"Very nice but short (one night) stay at Mount Juliet.  The rooms are lovely and ample in size.  We stayed in the Manor with a river view and it was lovely.

We ate at the restaurant at Hunter's Yard which was simple but quite good.  Note that it is a very long walk, but they provide a shuttle.  We had drinks in the Manor bar which was very good, as was the complimentary breakfast. 

The staff was also friendly and accommodating.",5,2024,09,23
239,A special countryside retreat with 5* service!,"a beautiful classic estate retreat convenient to Kilkenny and Waterford.  Amazing property, attentive staff, fabulous F&B- our only regret is not spending more of our two week vacation in this location!  Special shout out to Sean the resident historian who provided us a cool history lesson on the estate, the local area and offered great recommendations.  We thought we were joining a group activity fireside chat, instead just my wife and I received special treatment over a great cocktail and learned about the area from a native craftsman and master storyteller- it MADE our stay!!",5,2024,09,12
239,One of the most beautiful Autograph Collections in the Marriott Inventory,"We stayed at this location for 5 days at the end of August ""on points"", but were treated as though we paid top dollar. We are Marriott ""Titanium for Life Elite"".

It is an Autograph Collection Estate for sure. From check-in (Sophie and Caitlin from the back office were very helpful pre-check-in) to check out we had a wonderful experience.

The Tone at the Top at this Mount Juliet Estate, Autograph Collection must be extraordinary because every and all services were simply GREAT.",5,2024,09,12
239,Must stay at this stunning property!,"Love, love, love this hotel! We were wowed the second we drove on property! 

We had a hunters yard double queen room and it was spacious and overlooked a stunning courtyard. The hotel hallways are breezy and airy, which gave it such a nice atmosphere. Beds were delightful and so comfortable and the hotel had proper turndown service. We loved the heated floors in the bathroom!!!

The spa and fitness area is lovely. They have a huge indoor pool, jacuzzi, steam and sauna room. We didn't get a treatment but will next time for sure!

Ate breakfast and dinner at the Hound and it was great. 

It is worth noting that the property is huge and there is so much to see! Sadly, the entire manor house was reserved when we were there which was a bit of a letdown as this holds lady Helen resturant, the movie theater, and one of their bars. We had to ask if it was closed when we arrived and would have liked to know if this was the case prior to arriving. If you are visiting during wedding season on the weekend, would suggest calling to make sure it will be open. The outside of it was beautiful though! 

We were short ride away from Kilkenny and it is a must do! Staying at this hotel has been a highlight of our trip so far and couldn't recommend it more!",5,2024,08,31
239,Spectacular!,"Picky traveler here.  SPG  Lifetime Titanium, so we r well traveled and , yup, I compare every hotel detail by detail. I can honestly say that the Mountain Juliet is a pleasure in every way.  The buildings and grounds are exquisite. The walking trails were easy and beautiful.  Golfers paradise. The staff is exceptional.  You will want for nothing. It’s not like staying at a hotel, it’s like staying in someone’s county home.  We preferred not to stay in the main house and we were extremely happy with our choice.  Beautifully decorated, good food.  Don’t miss the Priory ruins nor the Irish National Stud Farm nearby!  Whether cash or points, don’t miss this one!",5,2024,08,26
239,I wish I could stay forever!,"Stunning property a short drive outside of the center of Kilkenny! When we drove in, it took our breath away! The grounds were so vast and green! We did not golf but it looks like an amazing course. We stayed 2 nights at the Hunter’s Yard and it was so peaceful and relaxing. We got there a few hours before we could check in and the staff was so wonderful! They instantly booked a tea reservation for us at the main house. They offered to take us over in the house car but we opted for the short and scenic bike ride on the complementary bicycles they have on site. The main house and views were unreal! They gave us seats right by the window, where you could see a sleepy creek, horses and rolling hills! The house tea was refreshing and was a traditional experience, making feel like I was right in the middle of the Bridgeton set! After, we had plans to explore the Kilkenny city center, so staff make sure our luggage made it to our room when it was ready. When we arrived back, the room was luxurious, with more beautiful views! We also had a sweet welcome note from staff and delicious chocolates. Our reservation also came with a wonderful breakfast in the morning! The Hound restaurant is so cute and we got a great seat in the sunroom, overlooking the golf course. The breakfast buffet had anything and everything you could want, whether you were looking for a true Irish breakfast or wanted to create your own. There was also a select entree menu if you didn’t want the buffet. This was a wonderful way to wake up and relax before exploring the community and grounds! My only regret is that we didn’t stay longer to experience more of the amenities! We have stayed in many Marriotts and Autograph hotels and this is on the top of my list!",5,2024,08,17
239,Amazing grounds and an overall amazing place to stay.,"Amazing grounds and a fabulous hotel.  The Hound is a great bar to relax after golfing, playing tennis, or just walking the amazing grounds!.  Went fly fishing on the grounds which was great and in a beautiful river that is exactly what you'd expect from Ireland.  Rooms were great, we stayed in the Hunters Quarters (something like that) part of the manor.  It's the old horse stables but much more like staying in a hotel rather than staying in a house/manor.  Went falconing at a nearby falconry farm which was a huge highlight and were very close to Kilkenny which is an amazing little village.  Again as I found throughout Ireland, the only thing lacking was the service at the restaurants.  Lots of very young servers who got a lot wrong on our orders.",5,2024,08,16
239,"Not cheap, but 'Head and Shoulders' above many of its competitors!","Booked in for a one night break, and stayed in the 'the yard'. Rooms were fine, well appointed, and complete with tea/coffee making machine, fresh milk, and complimentry water. We found the staff very pleasant, at reception, Johnie Keane and Paddy. Sean, was conducting some story telling in the Manor House, and we spent a very enjoyable hour with him, swapping stories, lies, and the rest. He is a real asset to the hotel.
Dinner was perfectly adequate, and staff were attentive.
breakfast next morning was a 'grand affair', with a choice of very diverse dishes to satisfy any taste. One little complaint was that the tea pots were very large, and consequently went cold very quickly. Maybe a tea/coffee station could be installed, allowing customers to access replacement hot drinks at their convenience?",4,2024,08,15
239,Warmest Welcome in Ireland,"From the moment we arrived for our two night stay, we were blown away by the stunning setting and excellent and genuine warm welcome we recieved from the team of staff. 

We played 18 holes of golf on a first class course. The staff in the Club House could not do enough for us. Eddie, Paul, Rosie and Megan in particular, made us feel at home instantly. Their warmth, eagerness to assist us with anything we needed was outstanding.  Their knowledge and expertise of the surroundings and the advice given to us of all the fantastic amenities and activities was greatly appreciated. 

Eddie and his team paid such attention to detail and he even went as far too take us on an impromptu tour of the grounds when he offered to take us to our vehicle to collect our clubs! These amazing hosts literally went above and beyond to ensure our stay from start to finish was superb.

In regards to the standard of overall service.......it was so good that we ate in the Club House on both nights. The staff are attentive, authentic, respectful and friendly. We arrived as strangers and left as friends.

The food was outstanding and of a very high quality. Bruno was a joy to meet and his advice on the choice of cuisine was spot on. Andy and his team of chefs absolutely outdid themselves. The culinary prowess executed in Mount Juliet leaves you hungry for more.

It is so difficult to put into words the experience we have had overall. A first class hotel with first class service and amazing staff. Thank you for making this stay memorable, enjoyable, relaxing and filled with such laughter, warmth and excellence. We cannot wait to come back.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",5,2024,08,07
239,Fabulous birthday stay!,"First off, when we arrived, we were met by James at the complimentary valet and Antonio, who took our bags to the room. At the Hunters Yard reception, Saoirse noted it was a special birthday and acknowledged my Marriott Bonvoy status. She arraigned for an upgrade to a lovely room looking at the walled garden. 
The property is beautiful! The gardens, and manor house bar with the view of the Stud farm 🐎 was a highlight. The bed was comfortable, breakfast was very good and service personable and professional. Lucy at reception was also most helpful with information regarding the lovely Medieval city of Kilkenny which is a short 20 minute drive.
I highly recommend the Mount Juliet Autograph for a restful and enjoyable stay…⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5,2024,08,04
239,A MUST VISIT !...,"Just back from Paul & Sarah's wedding event & from start-2-finish; it was absolutely fantastic in every way.  I booked our room in the Manor House thinking that's where the Wedding Reception was taking place but on checking-in, realised the reception was in the 'Hunters Yard' a few minutes across the estate!.  A quick chat to the manager on duty & room was quickly transferred; efficiently and with a smile - ""that's customer service""!..  The issue was of my making, but they took ownership for resolution - ""hats off folks - it was greatly appreciated..    The staff; the service; the food; the room (.. the bed was sooooo comfortable !....); the breakfast etc... everything was so perfect and that's what makes the venue special !..      The wedding was absolutely cracking & the venue most certainly added that touch of class to the whole celebration (it's very evident that detailed planning went into the creation of a lasting memory; one of the very best weddings we've ever been so lucky to attend)... plus - whoever invented the ""Residents bar"" should be honoured on a special day each year... was so much fun (.. never known so many folks to know the words of all the songs & they rattled it into the very early hours).   Thank you folks - we'll definitely be back and that's a promise... this time to the Manor House - our early afternoon coffee/munchies (and G&T's) were badly needed before hitting to road back to Clare (wasn't driving !).  THANK YOU... THANK YOU... THANK YOU..",5,2024,08,03
239,Fabulous resort with something for everyone ,"We had two fantastic days at the resort. Everything we experienced was of the highest quality - food options, pool, walking trails and the accommodation in Hunters Yard. There were a number of things that were available that we didn't get to such as archery, horse riding and tenni. There is something for everyone and the staff were extremely friendly and efficient. We also enjoyed a great chat with the resident storyteller Sean who explained the history of the estate from its initial build to the present day position. We will definitely return and having not played the golf course on this occasion, it will be a must do next time around!",5,2024,08,02
239,Gem in Ireland and worth every penny,"Mount Juliet Estate is a gem tucked away in the lush Kilkenny countryside, blending old-world charm with top-notch amenities. Staying here felt like stepping into a luxurious slice of history (we kept calling it Bridgerton), especially with the look of the Georgian Manor House. The horseback riding experience was a standout, allowing us to explore the sweeping estate and scenic trails in a truly unique way. It was not just about the ride but also soaking in those tranquil views that made it memorable. The staff were genuinely friendly, making us feel right at home from the get-go. The food was the best we had during our trip of Ireland.  Truly a gem.",5,2024,07,29
239,"Spectacular grounds, some service less than spectacular.","The grounds and activities are absolutely stunning! The local staff (valets, golf shop, archery, fishing guides etc) all clearly take great pride in their work as well as offering warmth and hospitality. It is very clear who is there genuinely and desires to reflect well on the estate and who is there with a more “corporate” mentality. For a brand that wants to deliver a unique, elevated experience — subpar service from staff that don’t have skin in the game will not deliver the desired results. The overall environment of the estate is outstanding, but the level of service from some (not just 1 or 2) didn’t match the exterior.",4,2024,07,17
239,Great experience!,"Beautiful setting, grounds and atmosphere for our short stay at Mount Juliet compounded by the lovely staff who were very helpful. We had our 7 month old with us and had a travel cot provided which was perfect and everyone made our stay as easy as possible! They also provided a small birthday cake for my wife in our room which was a lovely touch and we couldn't have asked for any more, I would highly recommend a stay to anyone!",5,2024,07,16
239,Welcoming stay at Mount Juilet,"We stayed for one night in the Manor House and we were so relaxed leaving the next day it was as if we stayed for a week. All staff were welcoming and friendly. We had a gorgeous meal in the Lady Helen restaurant,  all courses were delicious and beautifully plated. We had a walk in the morning before sitting down to a wonderful breakfast.",5,2024,07,14
239,Amazing weekend,"Possibly one of the best hotels in Ireland. Service was impeccable and food amazing. Surprisingly this was also super value for Monday. Apart from the standard poor value of a glass of wine in Ireland which is true everywhere, it is difficult to find anything to fault at this place !",5,2024,07,14
239,Exceptional place,"From them moment we arrived the staff were excellent rooms exceptional 
Can not say one bad word about our experience 
Food top class 
I would recommend mount juliet estate 
Staff were excellent 
Very helpful 
Will definitely be visiting this stunning place again",5,2024,07,11
239,Disappointed with our stay,"We were disappointed with our stay. The grounds and facilities were beautiful. The room was well appointed and clean. However, the service was dreadful and some of the employees were downright rude and condescending. Every issue that we encountered was met with “not my responsibility.”  

We were most disappointed with the false advertising regarding kids activities. The website boasts a kids club that is open all day that you can leave your kids at. My husband and I were looking forward to dropping the kids at the kids club, and enjoying a meal or two by ourselves. But during checkin, when I inquired, I was informed, the kids club is closed for the duration of your stay. I got the impression that the kids club is not open at all, not just during our four day stay. We then asked for directions to the equestrian center and walked over there with our three young children (after a red eye flight from the states). It was closed. When I asked reception why it was closed, the response I got was, it’s not our responsibility. It would have been nice if someone had told us it was closed when we asked for directions. 

We then went up to the room and changed for the pool. When we walked into the pool reception, the staff immediately informed us that the pool was closed due to a hygiene issue. The pool remained closed for most the day, and the kids were starting to get frustrated with being dragged all over the resort and everything being closed. 

We also encountered an issue with the archery, where reception knew nothing about it and said we had to talk to reception at the pool, and when we got up to the pool to ask about archery, the staff there similarly knew nothing and said we had to book archery and go to our allotted time in order for us to get our questions answered. But our question was whether my child was tall enough for archery - and something tells me that if we had booked and she was too short, we would have been charged for the session anyway. We declined this option, so yet again, another activity was unavailable to us. 

This hotel is definitely geared towards couples rather than families, but if such is the case, they need to revamp their advertising towards families. When I see a kids club advertised, I assume this is an appropriate place to come with kids. We ended up spending the rest of our trip doing activities outside the resort (although we were able to book with the equestrian center and had a great experience, but as I was told, the hotel is not responsible for the equestrian center). I would not return here in the future unless it was just a couples trip.",3,2024,07,11
239,Stunningly beautiful.,"Mount Juliet Estate is the finest hotel that we have stayed in, it is breathtakingly beautiful and the staff are the nicest, friendliest people. Breakfast each morning was wonderful in the beautiful Lady Helen restaurant. Anne Marie is a breath of fresh air and is so warm and chatty, nothing was too much trouble for her. At dinner in the Lady Helen, Katie, Dearbhla and JB the sommelier, ensured that we had the ultimate dining experience. At reception, Simone, Emily and doorman John were all so friendly and helpful. The Hound Restaurant all deserves special mention, the food and service were exceptional. There is so much to do in this wonderful estate, cycling, equestrian centre, archery, table tennis, snooker etc. etc. The resort also has a great fitness centre and swimming pool. We were lucky enough to meet Liam Ryan, the Rooms Division Manager. It’s so heartening to see a young man with such a passion for the hospitality industry. We will definitely be back and would highly recommend everyone to book Mount Juliet.",5,2024,07,07
239,"Incredible setting, awesome room and fantastic service.","Hard to explain the grander and luxury of this place. The main house was unfortunately unavailable as there was some sort of EU meeting going on so security was everywhere (super nice, but clear that you don't get to drive down that road). We stayed in what was called Hunter's Yard which was really comfortable. This is a golf and equestrian estate sitting on over 500 acres. The drive up the main driveway itself was breathtaking. 

Our room was huge and had a couple of seating areas and a nice view into the woods. The bed and pillows made it hard to get up in the morning. Honestly, one of the most comfortable beds anywhere. Bathroom floors were heated so no ""marble shock"" when you walk in barefooted. 

Breakfast was wonderful but dinner was even better. We were only there for two nights and we ate dinner there twice because the food was so good. 

This place isn't cheap as our room was around $800/night... but for us, well worth it for the quiet, setting, service and food. 

During one of our dinners, my wife didn't really like the food she got and I casually mentioned that to the waitstaff who insisted she order something else and not continue with what she initially ordered. No questions, no issues... just really good service. 

The place was so beautiful and elegant, it made you just feel good to be there.",5,2024,07,03
239,Lovely property,"We stayed just one night upon arrival to Ireland. The hotel is about 1.5 hours from Dublin and an easy ride. We stayed in the manor house while our friends stayed in Hunter’s yard. It’s about a 5
Minute walk between the buildings. The manor house is older and had a lot of charm. The room was comfortable and a nice bathroom. They have turn down service and made our stay comfortable. We enjoyed a drink at the bar on the lower level. We also visited Hunter’s yard for lunch and breakfast. They also have a bar which had live music on Saturday night. There is a gym and they also have walking paths and bikes around the property. However, one note is that they also have horses on the property and the trail we took to walk was covered in horse poop which made it very less enjoyable. A part of group took the archery lesson for $35 euro each and enjoyed it. We opted to take taxis to/from downtown as the hotel outside the hotel is narrow and we didn’t want to risk driving at night. Downtown Kilkenny was lovely as well. Overall, I would recommend staying at this property, and would have loved one more night here this past stay. Great Marriott points redemption.",5,2024,07,03
239,Very good.,"Exceptionally well kept and manicured setting, and if you like golf, then you're in for a treat.

Room was good, albeit that I did mention it was a tad difficult to negotiate the shower as a person with a disability. The evening meal (I think the restaurant is called the Hound, but not in the Michelin restaurant) was average at best. However, the morning after, the breakfast in the same venue really was excellent. 

The setting is wonderfully relaxing, and a great place to stroll around. The staff were also particularly friendly and professional. Definitely worth walking or taking the buggy to the bar that overlooks the river.

We visited the stables, and the guys there were so accommodating, taking us around the site.

Lovely place, but I suspect golfers would get the most out of it.",4,2024,07,02
239,Very pleasant stay.,Beautiful hotel in wonderful setting. Main house very luxurious. Hunters Yard more suitable for families and adjacent to golf club. Super breakfast selection. Our room(250) was a little tired and needed repainting. Small bathroom with only a shower and no bath.,4,2024,06,29
239,Beautiful estate ,"Overall, we very much enjoyed our stay at this beautiful estate. The majority of the staff is wonderful, friendly, and customer focused. It started with the lovely welcome by Patrick as a first impression after driving up to the estate, and continued throughout our stay with staff at the hound restaurant, the bar, the Club house and of course our first class experience at Lady Helen, which I'm happy to review separately at TripAdvisor. Lady Helen was a truly remarkable evening, both culinary and customer service wise. 
Back to the estate:
I'm also calling out Antonio, whom we met multiple times throughout our stay. He is a true asset, and his manorism and friendliness are remarkable. Same for David and last but not least a big thank you to Lisa for addressing our equally hilarious and embarrassing reservation 'Odyssee' with Lady Helen in a very positive, friendly, and professional way. 

The room at Hunters Yard was very nice and beautiful decorated, although, personally, I would have loved and appreciated a drawer or at least some shelving. It's quite uncomfortable and messy to life out of 4 suitcases, but this is just as a small suggestion for possible improvement of an already wonderful room.
Breakfast is very nice and offers a sufficient selection, including cooked to order dishes.
As already mentioned, the resort itself is beautiful, and 3 days were not enough to enjoy all they have to offer. It all ended with a beautiful horseback ride along the river this morning. 
The only downside was an arrogant Front Office Manager who denied a request to extend our confirmed 12.00pm check out by 15 minutes ! 
Other than that, we can highly recommend MJEstate and would certainly consider again when we are back in this beautiful part of the world.

239,Great relaxing experience with great food and friendly professional staff.,"Had a 3 night stay with breakfast. Also had dinner at the Hound Restaurant, tasting menu and afternoon tea at the Manor House. Wonderful experience in all cases. Very friendly and courteous staff with great professionalism. This is a very relaxing environment with great outdoor views and walks. Electric car charging on site was also a great bonus.",5,2024,06,25
239,Excellent from start to finish,"Excellent stay from start to finish. This place is immaculate all the buildings are newly renovated and kept in perfect clean condition. The room was spotless, the breakfast and dinner were amazing and the golf course was so well maintained. Would highly recommend visiting here there are also lovely walks in the grounds",5,2024,06,24
239,Memorable time at Mount Juliet,"We thoroughly enjoyed our girlie day out at Mount Juliet and we have Anne Marie at the Manor House to thank as she went above and beyond to make us feel like we were truly special. She gave us an excellent tour of the house, provided us all of the information on the walking trails around the estate, made us a booking for food at the clubhouse and treated us to tea/coffee, scones and homemade cookies on the lawn. Anne Marie is truly an asset to the staff here and we had a memorable time. Thank you from the three amigas.",5,2024,06,23
239,4 star at best,"There is lots good but also lots not so good about Mount Juliet.  We stayed in Hunters Yard and initial impression when we drove up and our car was taken was positive.  Reception wasn't busy at the time and to say the person checking us in was disinterested was an understatement.  Not what we were expecting from a 5 star establishment.  She seemed more concerned with hearing whatever messages were being relayed through her ear piece and doing work on the computer than being focused on our checkin.  We were there to celebrate my birthday so my husband had indicated our arrival time and asked if possible for early check in.  I know this is not always possible.  We mentioned it on check in and were told that it was 4pm check in but she would ring us if the room was ready early.  At 4pm we still had no call so we returned to reception and straight away it was .... oh I was just about to call you....  
The room is lovely, bed comfortable, bathrooms nice.  Some basic things again that were not 5 star.  The dressing gown in the room had all frayed edges to it.  I went to make a coffee and found the empty paper from the previous person for a cup of tea.  I went to take a shower and the water was lukewarm.  I rang down to reception and was told it would be hot in 10 mins.  It was - but at this stage I needed to get ready for dinner.
We had lunch in the Stable Yard and it was nice - limited menu and 4 star level.   Staff were very good.  
Dinner in the Lady Helen that night was amazing - this made the trip and if we hadn't had this experience would have left Mount Juliet feeling like we had paid alot of money for a 5 star experience but received 4 star at best.
Breakfast the next morning was a standard buffet service - the eggs were undercooked and the bacon was some weird smoked flavour, mushrooms over cooked and bland.  Selection in the continential section was ok - all the pastries were undercooked and doughy however.  If you wanted something different, there was an extra charge - €18 for eggs benedict for example.  Which considering the price of an overnight stay in the hotel, is just ridiculous. 
Checking out and again a disinterested person on reception - ""do you want a copy of your bill"" .... 
The over all impression of Mount Juliet is that there are too many staff in certain areas and not enough in others.  Training definitely needs to be improved for Reception.  Better checks of the rooms done before guests check in and a big improvement needed in the breakfast.",3,2024,06,20
239,Great Stay at a Beautiful Property,"Had the pleasure of staying at Hunter’s Yard in late May 2024. We got off to a rough start when we first arrived because for some reason, my long-standing reservation through the Marriott website did not download to the hotel system.  We had just arrived on a on an overnight flight from Toronto and were told we had not booked a room.  That was ultimately straightened out.
The room was beautiful and very comfortable. I loved the fact that you could open the patio doors and get fresh air into the room.  We had one dinner and two breakfast in the Hunter’s Yard restaurant and the food was really good. Still keep thinking about the butter! 
All in all very positive experience and would definitely return. And I would definitely email the hotel a few days in advance to confirm the reservation.",5,2024,06,16
239,Beautiful & relaxing,"Beautiful rooms & surrounding area,   also very quiet & peaceful as it overlooks the Golf Course.   Breakfast included was very good with a wide variety to choose from,  there were also a couple or restaurants to choose from for dinner.  Comfortable beds & linens.  Highly recommend.",5,2024,06,13
239,Unforgettable Anniversary Celebration at Mount Juliet Hotel,"I recently stayed at Mount Juliet Hotel with my girlfriend to celebrate our anniversary, and it was a truly wonderful experience. We have made great memories together, thanks to the incredible staff and beautiful surroundings.

A special thank you to Martin and Antonio from the front office guest relations team—you guys are amazing! The reception was warm and welcoming. Our room was spotlessly clean and offered a stunning view, thanks to the hardworking housekeeping team.

The Hunters Restaurant exceeded our expectations. They organized a surprise for my girlfriend that made her very happy. Thank you to Liova Loeve and Daniela Silver for the excellent service. 

Mr. David at the golf club house was incredibly kind and helpful, adding to our enjoyable stay. The team at the afternoon tea, including Holy and Jonathan, made our time there even more delightful.

I highly recommend Mount Juliet Hotel for anyone looking for an exceptional experience. Thank you to everyone who made our stay so memorable.",5,2024,06,12
239,Unforgettable Stay at Manor House,"We stayed in Mount Juliet  Manor House Hotel in March 24 and it was truly a Wonderful experience 
Everything is to a very high standard from the food, service, attention to detail, and a luxurious stay
But the one thing that impressed me the most was the phone call I received about 4 days before my stay to ask me ‘ what kind of room would I like’ I have never ever received a phone call to make sure our stay was comfortable and to our needs 
We got a super luxurious room on the ground floor which really suited us 
We dined in the Hound which was most enjoyable 
I can’t recommend this place enough and we intend to return in autumn, if you want to relax, enjoy wonderful food , get in some walks, have a spa treatment which I did as well, you will not be disappointed 
I am going to post some photos as well
Kate , Donegal",5,2024,06,10
239,Service building to match the magnificent Manor House.,"The Manor House is absolutely gorgeous. We had a great room at the top with a wonderful view. Our room was comfortable as was the bed. We had to request different pillows but led us meeting Oksana from housekeeping who was a delight and nothing was too much trouble. 

David who greeted us in the driveway also had a beautiful service ethic. The reception team was kind but didn’t possess the warmth of David and Oksana. The small office doesn’t help as you feel like you are intruding. I wonder if reception would be better in the opposite room next to the bar! It’s more comfortable, much larger and allows Isabella and the morning gent more opportunity to provide a warmer manner. Since everything revolves around reception, this area is so critical to setting the mood. 

We ate at The Hound on our first night … the food was delicious but we had a couple of concerns about the wine and water jugs (refer my separate Trip Advisor review). 

Breakfast in Lady Helen was lovely. Beautiful views over the fields opposite, the food was well portioned and tasty. The service was efficient and the Irish lady who served us on the first morning had a delightful manner. 

Walking around The golf course and grounds was a tranquil and relaxing experience. 

We enjoyed our 2 nights at The Manor House.",4,2024,06,09
239,Relaxing & reinvigorated by the whole experience.,"The location, with the championship golf course is inspiring - even if you don't play golf.  The ambience of the dining room & the quality of the food was of a high standard.  The staff really made you feel welcome & at home. 
We will definitely return to Mount Juliet.",5,2024,06,08
239,This hotel has the WOW factor and one that we would return to!  One Night was not enough!,"Wow....I'm not sure I can adequately explain how beautiful and tranquil this hotel is to stay at.  We stayed only one night and wished we had time to stay longer.  When we return to Ireland this will be our definite itinerary top destination.  The golf course is stunning, the on-site restaurant ""The Hound"" was very good for breakfast.  We had great service from the staff.  The rooms are typical size, bed was comfortable.  We stayed in Hunter's area but walked the property and enjoyed drinks on the lawn in front of the mansion.  We peaked into the downstairs pub and wished we had time to spend in there!  Kilkenny is a beautiful countryside town and add it to your list of places to go!  We also were entertained by on-site story-teller, Sean!  Wonderful and is quite knowledgeable about the property and it's former owners/history.",5,2024,06,08
239,Fantastic,"Came to Mt Juliet with high expectations and was not disappointed.  The grounds and amenities were world class.  I came from Dublin City Center in an attempt to get the full experience of Ireland.  The staff were attentive to every need and left nothing  in the imagination.  With a Nicklaus design golf course and host to a past Irish Open you could see why.

Will be a return quest",5,2024,05,25
239,Highly Recommended,"Exceptional service and a truly beautiful property situated in the Irish countryside. Although a main attraction is the golf course on the estate grounds, there are many walking trails and areas to explore.  Excellent food and relaxing atmosphere.  Would certainly return for another stay if the opportunity presents itself.",5,2024,05,23
239,Family wedding,"I cannot give enough praise to staff in this hotel , it was an absolutely amazing experience . I attended for a Family wedding & the staff could not have done anymore for us , especially the wait staff during the meal , nothing was to much for them . The hotel itself was so relaxing , spotless and the room was absolutely gorgeous.The pool was lovely and the kids had great fun . The breakfast was delicious and if there was something that we wanted that wasn't out , the wait staff got it for us . Everyone at the wedding all said the same the staff made the day for us all.We will definitely be going back soon ,such a wonderful stay . Thank you",5,2024,05,21
239,5☆ TREATMENT,We stayed here over night for a friend's wedding. It's such a beautiful Estate. We got there early and our room wasn't ready but the staff were so nice to take care of our bags and that aloud us to go for a walk around and have a drink while we waited for or room when the room was ready the called my phone to tell me which i taught was great we got to the reception and a lovely man took our bags to the room with us it was 5 ☆ treatment. He told us where everything was the pool the garden and told us we could use the bikes free of charge we were disappointed we didnt get to use the facilities as we had to leave early the next morning.Breakfast was included we went for breakfast about half 10 and I have to say it was lovely there was a lot to choose from and at the time it was I actually thought there wouldn't be much left but there was plenty the food and it was still hot we really enjoyed it. When we came to the dining room we were shown to a table and asked if we wanted to dine inside or out it was so nice and clean the staff were so nice our tea and toast was brought to the table but the rest we had to help ourselves it was a great spread.The room was lovely and spacious and clean the bed was comfortable to sleep on and I loved there was a choice of a separate bath and shower I also loved the room had doors open up to the lovely garden. We would definitely stay there again. So thanks to Mount Juliet staff we had the best time well done,5,2024,05,16
239,Pre wedding stay,"Huge thank you to all the team at mount julliet, we stayed here 2 nights before our wedding and we were made to feel very special. We were kindly upgraded and gifted treats in our room. Dinner and breakfast was amazing. Such a beautiful stay ❤️.",5,2024,05,16
239,Just magical,"That's the word that kept coming to mind during our stay here. I had high expectations even before arriving and the hotel and staff did not disappoint. I booked a standard room at the Hunter's Yard and was pleasantly surprised to see I had been upgraded to an executive room. But I really wanted to stay at the Manor House so I requested to redeem a couple Nightly Upgrade Awards I had and luckily my request was granted. We were assigned the Earl of Shannon room. It was on the 3rd floor, right in the center of the building and provided a marvelous view of the river behind hotel.
The check in process was smooth and thorough. I unfortunately don't remember her name but I was surprised she remembered mine during our stay. We had reservations for the afternoon tea and that too was wonderful. We got seated by the window so we had a lovely view of the river and the horses while we dined on delicious little sandwiches, scones, and other goodies and enjoyed our tea. The complimentary breakfast was also grand. There were plenty of options to choose from and I was kind of disappointed I wasn't staying longer so that I could have tried all the options. We walked the grounds to enjoy the peaceful surroundings and enjoyed seeing the various features around the property. The hotel also offers complimentary bicycle rentals so I took advantage of that and did a nice ride around the area including around the golf course. The room itself had that old estate charm and feel which we loved while the bathroom was modern and decked out in marble. Oh and they had a delicious little cake loaf with a welcome note waiting for us in our room when we checked in. Service all around was top notch. Unfortunately, we were too tired from our exploring during the day that we weren't able to check out the movie theater or the bar.
Staying here was a nice respite from our other stays in the cities and we felt like we were old timey royalty while we were there. I would absolutely look to book a stay here again on our next trip to Ireland.",5,2024,05,15
239,luxury,"you can really see how the upper crust lived back in the day in Ireland here at Mount Juliet.  beautiful manor house and
lodge. great restaurant and amenities.  golf. horses fitness.  the views to
the river are nice.  walking around the estate is very peaceful",5,2024,05,13
239,Brilliant for restricted diets & managers were lovely.,"Magnificent dining experience in Manor House. I have a number of severe allergies & a very restricted diet. Eating out is usually a bit stressful. I emailed ahead of time that there was nothing on the menu for me to eat. Jimmy the manager made sure to have options for me & looked after my food extremely well, so I could relax. He then forwarded my details to the managers in the other restaurants who took great care for my other meals. Especially liked that there was Chia pudding for breakfast!",5,2024,05,11
239,Luxury stay,We came for a golf tournament for my husband and arrived a day early to settle in (and for him to play a practice round) the service was exceptional - from the warm cider on arrival to the friendly staff at evey meal. Fully deserving of the five star rating,5,2024,05,09
239,Top Notch Experience,"From the moment of arrival to departure we were treated with utmost care, dignity, respect and felt like royalty.   We loved walking the grounds!  The restaurant for breakfast was top notch with spectacular view of grounds!  We did not get a chance to spend time at the pool area because of time constraints with our plans but was able to peak in and walk around and all I can say is wow was it tropical feeling and inviting (next time I will definitely plan time to enjoy it).  Already have it as a place we will return to and have already recommended it to friends and family!  Thank you to staff for the hospitality and experience there!  Top notch!",5,2024,05,06
239,A Magical Place,"This property is magical. We had intended it to be home base for two days in the region, but my wife and I could easily have spent our entire time on the estate. The facilities are beautiful and the staff uber competent and friendly.",5,2024,05,02
239,One of the best,"Just stay here! It was flawless start to finish. Great food, lovely room. Every touch considered. Great for kids and families, make sure you find the playground.",5,2024,04,28
239,Family Meet Up,"The location, space and facilities were outstanding.

The staff were exceptional and were always on hand to answer any questions and help out.

The disappointment was the food. We were a group of 20 (ages from 12 weeks to 70) so for convenience we ate in the Hound Restaurant for 3 nights. 
We found the menu very limiting, there were no specials of the day, a lot of the meals too salty and were uninteresting.  
The Staff in the Restaurant were very helpful and kind and did arrange for a bespoke salad on the last evening for 4 of us.

Overall we had a lovely few days and look forward to returing in the future.",4,2024,04,25
239,A fabulous memory maker!,"First class property and staff. They made us feel like we were truly special. The buildings, rooms, and grounds show extraordinary concern. Our room was well appointed with every possible need at our fingertips. Lovely, lovely, lovely...a delightful stay!",5,2024,04,19
239,Disapointing,"Our experience was poor given the reservations team messed up our booking when making a change to dates on a sap package booked. This left us to incur unexpected costs. Customer service is very average, unfortunately. The food and location are positives.",2,2024,04,17
239,Gorgeous Estate with Spacious Rooms,"Mount Juliet Estate is gorgeous. The staff are professional and courteous. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. If you are a golfer, it's a perfect spot. We ate at the Hound restaurant on the grounds, and the food and service were excellent. Highly recommend.",5,2024,04,16
239,Wonderful hotel experience,"We were happy to have booked here. Stunning location, peaceful and beautiful. We weren't here to golf (fabulous looking course!) or ride (stud farm and equestrian events nearby) but instead used the hotel as a base from which to explore the surrounding countryside. Everything about the room was lovely, from linens to appointments. Shower was amply roomy for my very tall husband; chairs weren't too low for a slight handicap. We were treated with a small cake with local honey on arrival; enjoyed the bar on one occasion, the dinner on another, and had spectacular breakfasts both mornings... way too much breakfast! But it fortified us for the day. Service was superb.",5,2024,04,16
239,Pleasant,"Booked the Mount Juliet for a special occasion. Enjoyed our stay for the most part. Staff extremely helpful and friendly throughout. Room beautifully furnished and very comfortable but quite compact. Bathroom again beautifully finished and furnished but also compact. Enjoyed the cinema, bar and seating areas. Also enjoyed pleasant cycle around the estate. Booked dinner in The Hound restaurant. Loved being driven the that part of the estate by really friendly chauffeur. Restaurant staff amazingly attentive. Loved the starter, dessert and wine but very disappointed with our steak main course. Breakfast  in The Lady Helen room was lovely.",4,2024,04,13
239,A true 5 star experience,"Just back from 2 night stay.
We had such a lovely time.
Room was lovely ,with 2 large double beds and lots a pillows and a nice view.
Very nice bathroom, rain shower, no bath ,but i don't need a bath when am away as i like a nice shower after swimming and so on, am sure you can ask for a room with a bath if needed. Food in the lodge was wonderful for lunch and dinner. You have to go to the club house for lunch during the week ,but for me it was not the best lunch compared to the lodge.
Breakfast was everything you would want.
But it was the staff that make our stay so good. I just cant say enough about them. Warm and friendly and nothing was a problem.
Pool was warm and inviting for a non swimmer like myself, sauna and steam room were great also. I think it needs a few more loungers around the pool. We all had facials, the therapists knew what they were at, wonderful. 
You can stay in the Manor house also, but you are free to go up and soak in the history if you are staying in the lodge. they have a great cinema in the manor house also.
So all in all it was a true 5 star experience",5,2024,04,10
239,Serene 5 star retreat.,Luxury accommodations where no detail is overlooked.  We loved afternoon tea at the Manor House overlooking the estate.  Dinner at the Hound was in the beatiful enclosed patio overlooking the golf course.  A truly magical experience. Thank you!❤️🙏,5,2024,04,09
239,Wonderful property and lovely staff.,"This Marriott is one of the best I’ve stayed in. Everything from the estate, the staff, the rooms and facilities were five star. We travel a lot as a family and this stay was everything we hope for in Marriott properties. We would stay again as a family or as a corporate outing.",5,2024,04,09
239,5 star plus wedding venue in paradise," Spectacular venue for a wonderful wedding . All staff exceptional. A special mention for Karim and Oscar at the front desk. The wedding room and food was sublime . Bedrooms of a very high standard . Highly recommend this hotel for a magical wedding ",5,2024,04,06
239,Manor House Mount Juliet - 5 star all the way!,"We loved the tranquility of our experience. From the moment of our warm welcome with apple cider, the amazing customer service, the lovely cinema, the list is endless…but the Lady Helen dining experience was something we will remember..your staff are just incredible and we will be back! Thank you Sean & Eimear White",5,2024,04,05
239,Amazing!,"Mt Juliet Estate is an exquisite property and experience. The staff, very helpful and responsive. The accommodations beautiful and the grounds were spectacular , dining and food quality as well!  We would go there again and again! Highly recommend this as a part of your Ireland experience!",5,2024,04,05
239,A hidden gem just outside of Kilkenny,"This place is an absolute gem. So unique and special. We stayed at the Manor House. It felt like we were staying in a super cool historic castle. Our room was spacious, extremely comfortable and spotless. The coolest part of this hotel is the basement. The basement has a bar and a cinema with comfy leather chairs and footrests. Grab a cocktail, have popcorn and watch a movie!

We also played golf and had fun, although it rained quite a bit. The course is very nice. 

We did a quick workout at the gym. Not much of a gym but it was a worthwhile visit after a day of Guinness! The golf and the gym are located in another area of the property called the Hunters Yard, which also has hotel rooms. It looked very nice.",5,2024,04,01
239,Lovely Easter Break ❤️,"I came here on Easter Sunday with my parents and it was such an amazing stay. The service was excellent from check in to check out. I’d like to thank Liam for the gorgeous room and lovely Easter treat😋. It was much appreciated. Antonio from Concierge was very helpful and we couldn’t be more happy. Unfortunately, I couldn’t remember the names of the lady from reception and our waiter from The Hound Restaurant, but I’d like to thank them for the exceptional service they provided🤩. Would definitely come back again!",5,2024,03,31
239,60th birthday celebration,Our family stayed in Hunters Yard in Mount Juliet for our sisters 60th birthday. From the moment we arrived until we left we were treated like VIP guests. The staff were exceptional and couldn't do enough for us. Look forward to returning soon.,5,2024,03,31
239,#BeyondThePale at Mt Juliet Estate,Impeccable hotel and the friendliest staff. It was such a charming and welcoming experience to stay at hunters and visit the estate grounds. We rode bicycles through the property and the equestrian and golf courses and enjoyed the manor and its grandeur. The staff went out of their way to make out stay memorable.,5,2024,03,30
239,Fabulous,"We had such a lovely stay at Mount Juliet, everything was perfect from start to finish.
A special thank you to Patrick who greeted me on arrival and  Annie, such a fabulous waitress. We had lunch at the Manor House and dinner at Hunters, all beautiful
We had the most wonderful time",5,2024,03,29
239,Wonderful hotel.,"The hotel is absolutely lovely. The grounds are fabulous. The staff were ever so nice. The food was really good, we ate in The Hound. We will definitely be returning for a longer stay. It was one of the nicest hotels we have stayed in. It is without doubt a 5 star hotel.",5,2024,03,29
239,5 star experience from start to finish!,"Fantastic 5 star experience. Just back from a wonderful weekend with friends in Mount Juliet where nothing was too much trouble with all the little touches that make this hotel stand out. Thank you to Patrycja for making this weekend extra special. The food was amazing in the Hound with delicious cocktails after in the bar with great entertainment.  Will absolutely be back, sooner than later.",5,2024,03,27
239,Fabulous Mount Juliet,"Sublime stay in Mount Juliet last Saturday night . Staff are wonderful from check in to check out we were treated like royalty. Nothing was too much trouble . Lovely cosy ambience throughout the Manor House . Lovely bars , dinner in the Lady Helen was excellent. Perfectly judged tasting menu with excellent service made our anniversary really special . Breakfast on Sunday morning was divine ,view from our window table was lovely . Very varied menu beautifully presented and served . Our room was very comfortable. Nespresso coffee machine and complimentary Ballygowan a nice touch . Grounds are beautiful so bring your wellies and go for a walk . In a word flawless , best Irish hotel experience we’ve had . A real treat we’ll definitely be back .",5,2024,03,27
239,Fabulous Estate,Would highly recommend Mount Juliet. The grounds are stunning and the rooms are immaculate. We stayed in Hunters Yard and visited the Manor House / both were fabulous. Having a coffee in the Manor House by the fire with some freshly baked cookies looking out on the grounds was a treat! My partner and I felt the service was outstanding. We will be back!!,5,2024,03,26
239,Exceptional Service - Gorgeous Property,"Stunning views of the Irish landscape.  Gorgeous and distinct property with history and character.  Exceptional service from the front desk team (Karim and Lisa) and one of the best F&B service levels I’ve seen at Marriott properties from their staff at the Hound Restaurant (especially Therese D.).  Staff constantly check in during the meal, from maitr’d, host/hostess, waiters/waitress, bus staff…wonderful to experience.  Pool and spa are great. Lots of activities to do (including archery) and they have a nice billiards table to enjoy.  Strolls around the property offer serenity in the Irish countryside.  An absolute must visit property recommendation from a Lifetime Titanium Elite / Ambassador (2,700 lifetime nights at Marriott) not easy to please traveler.",5,2024,03,24
239,Fantastic stay,"A fantastic stay at Mount Juliet Estate! The staff were exceptional, and the food at The Hound Restaurant was superb. Highly recommend for a luxurious getaway. The ambiance was serene, and the attention to detail was impeccable. From check-in to check-out, every moment was delightful.",5,2024,03,24
239,Thank you for the warm memories 💚,"Myself and my daughter arrived to a warm welcome from Adam. He was amazing, showed us our room and explained all the features to us. Our room was warm and inviting with a great en-suite too. During our 3 night stay we felt so warmly embraced by all the staff, especially Bruno in the bar and his colleagues. (And the wonderful Remi). The food was to die for but our favourite was the afternoon tea!  A MOST!! The porters are the best! John leads a great team. David was wonderful too, even organized a movie in the cinema for us! Their recommendations were always on par! And Barry in reception with his kind dignified manner. 
I simply cannot thank the staff for all they do. It’s clear they are proud to work for such an amazing estate and this is clear with the guests interactions.
Thank you for creating such amazing memories for us 🙏🏼",5,2024,03,21
239,Wish we could have stayed longer!,"Wonderful stay at Mount Juliet! The staff was amazing, and so accommodating. They were there for our every need (and then some!) It was a great value for what we paid... the grounds were beautiful, and we loved the charm of the estate. Great breakfast each morning too. I only wish we had more time there! Highly recommend Mount Juliet for your trip to Ireland!",5,2024,03,17
239,Average,"Honestly, I enjoyed my stay at Mount Juliet. The room was amazing and the receptionist Simone was amazing with everything. A young fella named Jacob helped with our bags and carried them on the third floor, told us even more about the history of the Manor House, and surprised that he spoke to us in our native language of Russian and both where very welcoming and understanding.
However, the manager wasn't pleasant to the workers in the Manor House and was rushing them around like animals, one mistake was made and he wasn't happy, UNACCEPTABLE!! Seeing how workers are treated at Mount Juliet and being rushed like animals is really unacceptable.  
Hound restaurant is expensive but the food is fab.",3,2024,03,16
239,"Very, very nice","Stayed for two nights midweek and despite terrible weather, we had a great time. Lots to do on the estate- great walks, bikes available, pool table, tennis court, golf. Probably lots more we didn’t see as the season has barely started. We ate in the Manor house at midday, the golf club on the first evening and the Hound on the second evening so had a good cross section of food-no complaints at all. I have to say that the staff are all so lovely from the guys at the gate (Patrick) to the lovely housekeeping staff (shout out to the young girl doing the rooms-so pleasant and thorough) and the young guy in the Clubhouse. They seem to be enjoying their jobs and I hope the owners/managers know how much the attitude of the staff contributes to the guest’s enjoyment of the hotel. My only very minor complaint is there is no bath in Room 240 but I forgot to enquire on booking-I’m sure I could have booked a room with a bath if I had asked. We enjoyed the chocolates given in the evening’s turn down service. Overall, giving Adare Manor a run for its money-at a more affordable price.",5,2024,03,14
239,Wedding anniversary,"Amazing, professional and welcoming staff in all areas. Great value.Food was delicious.Hotel is spotless through out and  a extremely comfortable bed. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and the hotel kindly gifted us a bottle of processco with a hand written personal card from management ...really lovely...beautiful grounds...staff are excellent...Spa treatment was amazing but spa area is a little outdated",5,2024,03,11
239,Lovely night away,Top class service from the minute I arrived . Prompt & early check-in is always a welcome. Very hot steam room at the pool which I loved. Definitely shower in your bedroom as the dressing room facilities at the pool aren’t great. Very attentive staff at the bar & the Hound Restaurant. Fantastic breakfast next morning. Will definitely return.,5,2024,03,08
239,A great experience,"From start to finish we thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Mount Juliet. We were greeted with an offer of valet parking and the luggage was taken to our room. We stayed in a king room in Hunter’s Yard which was tastefully decorated with a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was small but overall was fine- the shower was very powerful. There was complimentary tea, coffee, biscuits and still/sparking water in the fridge. 
We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and when we came back from the pool, there was a lovely complimentary cake waiting for us- what a nice surprise. Classy. 
We got a complimentary lift up to the Manor House & enjoyed a few pre dinner drinks in the drawing room area. The staff were welcoming and attentive. We were collected in time for our dinner reservation back in the Hound restaurant. We enjoyed a gorgeous meal - my husband saying it was “the best ever”. We enjoyed a pork shoulder to start, ribeye steak and trout for mains. We were too full for dessert but they came out with bite size brownies for us- again, such lovely touches made our overall stay so special. 
My only slight disappointment was with the breakfast experience. It was a buffet style which I was very surprised to see. Now the cooked food was very nice, tasty and hot but I would have expected it to be ordered from the table and for it to be served up fresh to you as opposed to one queuing and “help yourself”. 
One other thing I didn’t particularly like was that one could order additional items for breakfast such as Eggs Benedict for €18 or Brioche toast for €16! Pricey and unwarranted imo. Breakfast is breakfast-include whatever you want to offer in your overall B&B hotel rate. 
Neither of us liked the brown bread, unfortunately it was way too dense for us. Overall there was plenty of cheese, ham, fruit etc and a lovely pastry section to choose from. 
The staff in reception, bar, restaurant, pool area, valets etc were all so friendly and welcoming.",5,2024,03,04
239,A near perfect stay,"One of the most relaxing weekends I've spent at any hotel. 

The staff all are lovely and friendly and can't do enough for you. Loads of facilities on the estate to keep you occupied, or loads of places just to sit and relax. 

I stayed in the Hunters Yard and thr rooms are fine, spacious enough and well equipped. The pool looked very inviting (I didn't bring swimming trunks) and the spa relaxing. I didn't play golf this time, however I have on numerous occasions and I can saw with confidence, it is my favourite Irish golf course (and I've played many). 

We ate in The Hound Restaurant and this is the weak link in the overall experience. I found the food very very rich, everything seemed to be cooked in loads of butter and/or cream, including the veg. I had the steak and found it somewhat bland. 

Breakfast was similar, the scrambled eggs again were very rich, but everything else was good and loads of selection. 

The Manor House has a nice place to sit and relax while reading a book/paper, however there is no similar place in The Hunters Yard, as the reception area is quite small. 

Overall a fantastic experience and one I plan on repeating very soon.",4,2024,03,04
239,Par 5 all the way at MJ,"Fantastic stay in a fantastic place, with great food and great staff. The Manor House, Hunter’s Yard and Jack Nicklaus Golf Course are just top drawer. A five start resort at good rates…nice walks and other options for the non golfers…cinema in downstairs Manor bar is also a nice addition",5,2024,02,28
239,The Hound dinner,"Excellent food and service 

From the moment you walk in to the Hound Restaurant you are greeted  by excellent staff , which warmed my heart immediately! Taken to our seats and offered water and a drinks menu.
Then the food!!! Absolutely amazing! We had goat cheese salad for starters and steak for mains  all extremely tasty and cooked perfectly!
Deserts that followed were equally as good. Definitely be going back to this wonderful restaurant . I wish I could stay in the hotel more often!
The staff was extremely professional during our dinner and we couldn’t wish for better valentines date ! 
Thank you !",5,2024,02,27
239,Amazing,"My partner brought me here for my birthday and I wasn't sure what to expect.
I must say I was in awe from the moment I drove onto the estate.
The room was beautiful and the bed was so comfy.   I was even left a little cake and a note wishing me a lovely birthday.
The staff were so attentive and checking to make sure you were okay and if you needed anything . The hotel and grounds are beautiful.  
Definitely can't wait to come back again .",5,2024,02,24
239,Mixed ba,"We went to Mount Juliet for the first time in February 2023 and loved it. On the back of that, we decided we would make it an annual trip for us and go all in this time with dinner in the Lady Helen, Afternoon Tea etc and stay for a full weekend. It was a much more mixed experience this time.

The positives were:
- Room was top notch as expected
- Staff at reception were very friendly
-Meal in the Hound Restaurant was brilliant
-Housekeeping were friendly and did a great job
-Great live music in the Saddle Bar

Unfortunately there were a number of things which tainted my experience. In the hotel's defence, I did not raise them as problems at the time as I did not want to draw my partner's attention to them and bring an air of negativity to our weekend.
The things which I felt took away from the experience were:
- Changing rooms in Pool/Gym area were not kept clean and anywhere near the standards as at the same time last year
- The men's bathroom in the Saddle Bar was disgusting on the Saturday night. I appreciate this can happen between cleaning but it stayed that way for the night, despite some customers pointing this out to bar staff and the sheet in the bathroom being marked as having been cleaned/attended to in this interval
- The gratuity I had marked down on the bill for the Saddle Bar was misrecorded or over entered in the system. I noticed this when paying at reception the next day but as my partner was with me, I didnt point it out because I didnt want to take away from the weekend. I hope this was a genuine mistake.
- Afternoon Tea in Lady Helen restaurant is really disappointing - simply not worth it. Sandwiches are pretty basic. Best to just book lunch and have some of the delicious scones.
- I left my airpods in the hotel room which was completely my own fault. I rang the hotel the next day to ask them to check for this and had to ring to remind them to check twice over the next couple of days before I heard back. Thankfully they found them and kind of hilariously, they sent me a payment link for the 5 euro for the postage which I was surprised by, considering that our total bill for the weekend was in excess of 1500 euro. I was really disappointed that I had to keep calling them about this and didn't hear back sooner.
- Breakfast has deteriorated in the last year - as other reviews will point out. An 18 euro charge for an Eggs Benedict or similar instead of the buffet or other included A La Carte options is ridiculous. I appreciate these breakfasts are more expensive to prepare but that price supplement is beyond reasonable, even for a 5 star hotel.",3,2024,02,23
239,highly recommend,"i would highly recommend MJ for couples or families, it was really enjoyable from start to finish. every single staff member we met was so friendly and helpful, always greeted with a hello. beautiful grounds, lovely to be able to grab a bike and drop at different locations. kids really enjoyed the kids club. i would also like to thank Angela in the spa for looking after us all so well, she really went above and beyond for us and we thoroughly enjoyed the treatments we received.",5,2024,02,22
239,A piece of heaven in Kilkenny!,"From start to finish our visit to Mount Juliet was, as always a most pleasure experience. Staff, room, food, atmosphere of the hotel are to an exceptionally high standard. There is nothing you to fault and we have stayed in both Hunters Yard and The Monor House, ate in both The Hound and Lady Helen Restaurants. We look forward to returning again later in the year!",5,2024,02,22
239,Amazing staff.... lovely place,Just back from a flying visit one night break away. Lovely surroundings and gardens and the staff were amazing.  They were only too happy to help and the attention to detail was fantastic.  Only found out the following morning that the Manor house has it's own mini cinema too. Would highly recommend a visit to this hotel,5,2024,02,19
239,Birthday stay,Amazing stay! The staff went above and beyond for our stay.  We already can’t wait to visit again! Food was absolutely stunning. We dined in The Hound restaurant. Lots of options for breakfast also. Spa facilities were great. Nice little touches throughout our whole trip.,5,2024,02,19
239,Great location for a family break,"Super few days enjoying Mount Juliet - staff warm, welcoming and helpful from start to finish. Extra touches such as soft toys for kids on arrival and chocolates at turn down were greatly appreciated. Kids enjoyed the pool, playground, fairy village and horse riding. Big hit all round!",5,2024,02,18
239,Great for a restful break,"Really beautiful hotel, rooms so clean and nice. We stayed in the manor house as opposed to the lodge, and would deffo do it again.
Food was fantastic in all of the different locations to eat, breakfast too.
Pool and spa facilities are great, and the gym has great modern equipment.
Little bit of a walk to the pool from the manor house, but a lovely gentleman will drive you up if you like.
If golf is your thing, it looks great too... but we dont do golf and never had a set of golf bats :D 
But the grounds are beautiful and lots of lovely walks (just wish it rained less!)
What made it though was the staff, friendly, helpful, very professional, but not false at all. And I mean that about every member of staff we had dealings with.",5,2024,02,15
239,Wonderful character,"Overnight stay in the Manor House for Valentine’s Night & dinner at the wonderful Lady Helen restaurant. 
Had a gorgeous room overlooking the river & wonderful cocktails in the 1757 bar before dinner . The staff are all incredibly friendly and knowledgeable.",5,2024,02,15
239,Dream stay for our engagement !,"We stayed in the Mount Juliette Suite to celebrate our engagement, and the entire team took great care of us! The hotel is absolutely stunning, with plenty of outdoor activities available. We were warmly welcomed by Barry at the reception, who offered us a delicious hot drink, and the room was incredible! The housekeeping team prepared roses with a bottle of Prosecco and chocolates for the occasion ! 
We dined at Lady Helen that evening, and the dishes were beautifull and excellent. Thanks to Jonathan, Jean Baptiste, and Rémi for their professionalism and for making our engagement night exceptional ! 
The spa team was very welcoming, and we thoroughly enjoyed the Hot Stone massage! 
Dinner at The Hound was also very good, and Frazer took excellent care of our table. 
Thanks also to the two valets, John and Patrick, who were very kind and accompanied us throughout our stay ! 
We will never forget our engagement at Mount Juliette. Thanks to the entire team and the beauty of the place, we had a memorable stay, so thank you a thousand times ! We will definitely come back",5,2024,02,11
239,Poor communication to visitors regarding spa appointments.,My zero rating comes because a spa day was booked for me as a birthday present. I got to the appointment and was told I could not be given treatment as they required a doctors letter. I was never told directly by the person who booked about the requirement. I have been to many treatments and this has never been enforced for a minor condition. At least we did not have to pay.  But I do not recommend this spa to anybody.,1,2024,02,10
239,Perfection in relaxation and indulgence,"Our 3 night break was excellent from start to finish.Beautiful room,excellent food and extremely relaxing.Staff were very friendly,efficient and made our stay very comfortable.We have stayed several times over many years and the standards remain very high in all departments.",5,2024,02,09
239,Without a doubt the best hotel in Ireland,Went to Mount Juliet for a special birthday.  We have been to a lot of hotels and this was one of the best.  Stayed in the Manor House during a very cold few days but it was so warm and cosy everywhere.  The staff are amazing - when I made a mistake with my booking it was not a problem and sorted in a moment.  Thanks for a lovely stay and you can tell the Chef thanks for the Brioche recipe - it worked a treat! We will be back soon.,5,2024,02,07
239,Great Country House Hotel,"Superb facilities, fantastic food, professional and welcoming staff.
The breakfast is the best I have ever experienced, cooked to order and nothing is too much trouble. Both The Hound and Lady Helen provided an excellent meal as would be expected.",5,2024,02,07
239,Wonderful visit,We stayed in the Manor House in a beautiful and spacious bed room and bathroom.  All the Staff we met were extremely friendly and helpful. We had a delicious lunch and drinks in the bar looking out over the river. We had the 7 course tasting menu in the Lady Helen and it was amazing.  I could not recommend it highly enough.,5,2024,02,02
239,Excellent Hotel,"Excellent Hotel in the countryside . 
We had a very nice room with shower bathroom ( very good interior design) .
The hotel has a good service both the front desk and the room service .
We had an excellent dinner in the old building  restaurant and  a very good breakfast in another restaurant .
The hotel has a beautiful golf course , but we had no possibility to try",5,2024,01,30
239,Tired - only OK,"The room was nice, with a garden view and a good size room. In the bathroom the floor of the shower was heavily stained (yellow in colour) and the plug release in the bath was broken (visibly hanging out of the bath).

We went to the clubhouse for lunch. The calamari was flavourless and tasted frozen (€14). The water jug was filthy, as were the glasses on the table. The salt and pepper shaker was sticky from ketchup I believe.

For dinner we went to the Lady Helen 8 course tasting menu at €140 per person. In our view extremely overpriced. Nice ambiance but the food was only OK...for 140 each I expected much more.

The staff were extremely friendly and the bar area was lovely for a drink beforehand.

Before dinner we had been told a lift would be organised back to the hotel for us but after dinner there was nobody to assist so we walked (only 3 mins so not the end of the world).

The breakfast was OK. Although for the room rate I would have expected eggs benedict to be included (its an additional €18 if you want something like that). Also the first plate we took for the hot breakfast was visibly dirty.

Overall the hotel felt very tired and it felt like things were being neglected. The staff were lovely and it's a very nice place but wouldn't be rushing to go back.",2,2024,01,27
239,Lovely night away,"If you need a relaxing night away mount  juliet is the place . 
The staff couldn't do eneough  for you also the bed in this hotel is so comfortable  .  Breakfast was fabulous We arrived at 4pm made feel very welcome great from that point to check out  . Wonderful staff it all comes down to the great staff the hotel has",5,2024,01,26
239,Fabulous location,"If you are spending time in SE Ireland then this is a great option. Well located for Waterford. A roaming estate with beautiful buildings and decor, well appointed, great bar and superb food. A treat for all the family. 

A roaring fire and a pint in the winter is a great take away.",5,2024,01,21
239,OK,"Stayed at this hotel in early Jan the last few days of Xmas for a spa break with friends.. Our stay was pleasant but expected so much more from this hotel...
The interior of this hotel is absolutely stunning.. Modern bright, our room was fabulous, comfortable and exceptionally clean.. Housekeeping staff very plesent and accommodating.
We had breakfast both mornings. . Breakfast was very average, well below average and not what id expect in a 5 star hotel.. Chef was very rude to us and told us when we asked her for an egg to go to our table and place the order from ther.. although she was standing there doing nothing, her manner was not nice.. Also a manager in a suit on one of the mornings was very inappropriate, giving out to staff loudly, could hear everything,not that he was trying to be discrete about it.. you could see staff wer tense and on edge when he was around.. Not a nice atmosphere to be having your breakfast in and again highly inappropriate and very arrogant of him. 
The spa definitely lacks the spa luxury.. Basic.. No proper relaxation room after treatment its basically just a sitting room..majority of staff foreign nationls,which can be hard to understand esp at reception, lacks that warm welcome. Hotel was nice, we had a nice stay just very much lacks that 5star luxury. We expected more. Will I return? Probably not.",3,2024,01,18
239,Excellent Weekend Getaway,"Amazing weekend. The hotel and surrounding were stunning. The staff were excellent and the food (both the Lady Helen and breakfast) was exceptional. thank you to all staff, for a great weekend! I would highly recommend a stay at the Manor house to anyone looking for a hotel for a special occasion.",5,2024,01,16
239,Great stay,"A great stay. Everything was perfect. From the huge bath, soft bed, heated floor in the bathroom, the relaxing spa and the great views.  
The food was delicious and the staff were very friendly. 
Overall we were very happy and refreshed after our stay.",5,2024,01,12
239,Give it a miss,"Sheets are uncomfortable, matress soft. 
Staff we’re appalling. Food was poor. 
Manor House was not open to GUESTS while we were there and! The manoir house restaurant and bar was closed due to not enough guests? The only employee there who cared about guest was Oscar. Upon leaving I was not asked if I even enjoyed my stay. Five stars ???",1,2024,01,10
239,Fantastic weekend,"Blessed to be invited to such a stunning place for a wedding but the views were only the start. It was a great hotel from start to finish, great service, great room, amazing food (some stuff I wouldn't normally eat but I think I'm converted well worth trying everything) and just a great weekend had by all that I came with.",5,2024,01,10
239,A sublime piece of irish excellence,"This was our 2nd stay & again is simply the best hotel experience I have ever had in Ireland. The Manor House is the perfect mix of luxury and amazing hospitality with also being incredibly comfortable. It is my heaven and I would recommend it to anyone who wishes to experience the best of Irish country house grandeur & out of this world  hospitality, food and comfort. The lady Helen is Michelin starred for a reason and the staff are all so friendly and helpful. Particular mention to Jonathan, Dearbhla, Adrian and Rene who were just exceptional. I was lucky to be taken care of the wonderful Mary in the equestrian centre and could not compliment her and the set up enough for riders of any experience. I cannot wait to go back again- many times!!",5,2024,01,09
239,Mount Juliet is a gem. ,"Mount Juliet is a gem. It has everything you would want and expect from a five star hotel. 
The rooms are beautiful and restful. The food is excellent. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. There was something for all of our family, swimming pool which was warm and great for the children and adults alike, sauna, steam room and spa all lovely. 
The grounds are wonderful, you can take a stroll by the river or go for a run and feel safe. Horse riding is available too. If you are travelling with children it’s worthwhile bringing their bikes. 
Kilkenny  city is close by and worth a day trip for sure. I would  definitely go there again. ",5,2024,01,02
239,Family Christmas at Mt Juliet,"We had the most fabulous family Christmas at Mt Juliet- the 4 night Christmas package. We stayed in Hunter’s Yard and loved the rooms- spacious, elegant and contemporary but in keeping with the beautiful old building. The food was superb but it was the service and attention to detail that made the trip so memorable. We loved the archery lesson that was included- gave some great family rivalry. We also loved the family photo taken by a professional photographer and then put into a silver frame as a gift. We loved walking around the estate and our children made good use of the pool, gym and sauna. The spa was booked out- we learnt for next time we needed to be more organised and book ahead. The whole experience was so memorable- it was worth every cent. ",5,2023,12,31
239,Picturesque Estate in County Kilkenny ,"The Mount Juliet Estate is absolutely beautiful and as picturesque as one can ask for. We stayed here during the beginning of our European honeymoon (we are from the US) and it was the perfect way to begin. We stayed in The Manor House which was beautifully decorated for Christmas. Getting a taxi to Kilkenny was easy and we had a wonderful time at the local shops and pubs. 

I highly recommend MJ for any occasion. We look forward to a return trip one day!",5,2023,12,31
239,Such a wonderful place that we came back before our trip was over,"This hotel is absolutely beautiful and everyone that we interacted with was top notch. We arrived early in the morning and Jimmy caught us outside and helped us get checked in. We had just come off a flight and reserved an extra night to make sure our room was ready. They whisked our bags away and took us right to breakfast. When we went to our room after breakfast the curtains were drawn and the heater was turned on. They really thought of everything and provided wonderful service. 
The grounds of the hotel are absolutely stunning and we enjoyed a stroll around the property after breakfast each day. We stayed in the manor house and it was a real treat and I would definitely recommend purchasing a room here. We were lucky to be upgraded with a Suite Night Award into a garden suite with terrace. 
We enjoyed our time here so much that after spending some time on the west coast of Ireland we came back to enjoy the luxury and relaxation. They were very accommodating to us again and helped us apply another Suite Night Award to stay in the Manor house but facing the river this time. Both rooms were beautiful and we enjoyed both for different reasons.
We will absolutely come back here again and recommend it to anyone staying in Ireland. ",5,2023,12,28
239,Christmas family trip,The hotel was so festive for the Christmas season. All the staff from the front desk to the restaurant were fantastic. The pool was beautiful as was the cinema. The food in both the club house and the hound was amazing. I would highly recommend a stay here. ,5,2023,12,28
239,Everything you could wish for and more!,"Absolutely everything you could wish for and more! Staff were so friendly, genuine and accommodating. The duel experience between the Manor and Hunters Yard lends itself to both a Downton Abbey and a contemporary experience in one place. Facilities more than met expectations and the Spa treatments were out of this world. Hotel rooms are top class, well maintained and spotlessly clean. ",5,2023,12,26
239,Adult Family Vacay,"My husband and I stayed here for a short visit with our adult daughter. We chose it because it was a Marriott. We will be going back for an extended stay because it is the coolest Marriott we've stayed at yet. If you can handle the cost, I'd highly recommend this place. The staff is everything you'd expect at a 5 start resort. We look forward to going back to explore the 60-acre grounds, fish, relax in the spa, eat some more amazing food, and soak in the ambiance of the estate!",5,2023,12,10
239,A wonderful night in Mount Juliet,My wife and I managed to get away for a single night and we could not have picked a better destination than Mount Juliet Hotel in beautiful Co. Kilkenny. We stayed in the Huntsman part of the hotel which used to be the old stable yard but has been wonderfully restored. You can feel the history dripping from every wall and they really have managed to combine the old with the new. The staff were so kind and friendly and the dinner that night in the Hound restaurant was fantastic. The restaurant is really cosy and overlooks the Estate's famous golf course. After dinner we retired to the Saddle Bar and were entertained by a very talented musician who was able to sing songs on request and interact with his audience in a Graham Norton sort of way - he was great. Our only regret was not having enough time to visit the old Manor house but maybe next time.  ,5,2023,12,06
239,Superb experience at MJ,"Everything about our stay at MJ was just perfect. From the server helping us select from a truly wonderful dinner menu, the concierge helping us out with our electric charger and sharing in the staffs family Christmas celebration. 3rd time in a year we’ve visited and cannot see a reason to go anywhere else.",5,2023,12,05
239,Mount Juliet Estate - top notch !,"All of Ireland is amazing, but this property ranks among the very top of our favorite places.   What a beautiful property, amazing staff and detail to attention was above and beyond.   Your decor and Christmas decorations were beautiful.  Thank you all so much for our wonderful holiday at Mount Juliet Estate.  ",5,2023,12,05

239,Super stay - exceptionally friendly,"We spent two lovely nights in the Manor House at Mount Juliet.  Jimmy was an exceptional host - possibly the best front of house manager we have encountered anywhere - and the rest of the team were all excellent.  There was a lovely friendly atmosphere and the Christmas decorations were beautiful.  

We had a great suite which even had its own Christmas tree.  The bathroom was newly refurbished - sparkling marble and separate bath and big shower.  There was a very comfortable four poster bed in the huge bedroom.  

We walked along the river and over to Hunters Lodge and the clubhouse where we had a coffee on both mornings.  We preferred the Manor House and would recommend it if you like a more traditional, intimate feel to your hotels.",5,2023,12,03
239,Pure luxury ,"We had a most sumptuous break away that was so relaxing it felt like we were away double the time. The staff could not have been more friendly or helpful. The food was delicious and a lot of it locally sourced. It was also delightful to see them champion local and beautiful craftsmanship such as Nicholas Mosse and Jerpoint Abbey. 
A very special place indeed!",5,2023,12,02
239,Absolutely brilliant ,"So here it is from start to finish! We arrived at approx 5.30pm and the entrance with the Christmas lights was beautiful. We then went to reception and were booked in by such a pleasant receptionist. The reception area is really ambient..its the kind of place you could sit comfortably with a book for the day watching the world go by. We arrived at our room on the ground floor and its not often I'm impressed by a hotel room but I have to say this was top class! Beautiful room and bed and a fabulous bathroom with separate shower and bath. Duvet turned down with a chocolate on each side and two bottles of Ballygowan water on the bedside lockers. We made our way straight to the pool and pretty much had it to ourselves. Lovely pool, sauna and steam room. Back to the room to chill for a while and the  onto the bar. The bar is so relaxed and comfortable. While there was only a handful of people there it was cosy with a wood burning stove. The barman was obviously a whiskey enthusiast and his knowledge of the subject was most interesting to listen to. We retired for the night to an exceptionally comfortable bed and pillows! The following morning we went for breakfast which was absolutely delicious. The chia pudding was amazing. We then went for a leisurely walk around the grounds before checking out. The grounds are kept so well and there was an army of caretakers clearing up fallen leaves. I dont play golf but the golf course looked pristine. I was completely blown away with Mount Juliet in general and I have to say the staff were so friendly and nothing was a problem which is something I have not experienced in a hotel in a long long time. We will most certainly be back in the not too distant future. ",5,2023,11,30
239,Not as good as the previous visits,This was my 3rd stay is recent years and the lady Helen restaurant was excellent as usual but the manor house experience is now lost as in the past few weeks they now shut the lounge area at 5 in the evening and everyone has to get a drink in the 1757 bar which is basically in the cellar and is nothing like the old manor house lounge area feeling where before after a lovely meal in the Lady Helen you could sit in front of a homely fire and relax on the big sofa’s and have a night cap. Not sure why this is but the main reason you stay in these old houses is to experience the beautiful old lounges/study’s etc. and not to be limited to the cellar bar that you could get in any 3 star hotel?   ,3,2023,11,29
239,Magical stay at Mount Juliet ,I had an amazing stay at Mount Juliet from the amazing friendly staff to wonderful food and the most beautiful room. I will definitely be back and would highly recommend. The added bonus of the Christmas decorations being up added that extra magical experience. Thank you to everyone at Mount Juliet for a fabulous stay.,5,2023,11,28
239,Modern luxury with the elegance of a bygone age.,"Always a joy to stay and eat in the Manor House.  The elegance of a bygone age but with all modern conveniences. As ever, dinner in the Lady Helen restaurant was a real treat. It's easy to see how they have held onto their Michelin star for 10 years. A great breakfast in the Lady Helen the next morning to send us on our way. We hope to keep coming back.",5,2023,11,27

239,Very Festive ,"The Manor House was like a Christmas Wonderland. The reception, bar and all area's were full of Christmas trees and lights. Our room  was lovely with a beautiful bathroom. We had dinner in the hound restaurant which was very good and then went into the bar and enjoyed the music later. All the staff are very friendly and welcoming. Breakfast in the Lady Helen room was very good and we enjoyed a lovely walk around the grounds after it.",5,2023,11,26
239,A beautiful place,If you ever stay at Mount Juliet you must take a walk around the magnificent estate. There is something to see around every corner. Add in the beautiful rooms and the wonderful food and you can look forward to a memorable experience. An experience enhanced very much by the people who work there. They are so pleasant and very professional. I hope to return very soon. ,5,2023,11,23
239,Mixed Service with 5 Star Prices,"A little bit mixed, some parts of the experience were excellent and 5 star, others were not. Stayed a Fri and Sat in November, not far off €1,000 spent on the estate over the weekend so should expect consistency.

As we walked towards the hotel the head concierge ran over and insisted on bringing our bags, really good start and check in was really good; Simone on reception was warm and welcoming and helped get our room ready a little bit early which is always a plus and not always possible. Bedroom was lovely, modern clean and warm.

Had a quick bite in the Clubhouse next door on the Friday, all good there but we were refused entry at the door on Saturday as it's reserved for Golfers only, quite bizarre that hotel guests can't visit the bar for a coffee on a Saturday at 4.30pm, it was mostly empty there too!

We borrowed the free bicycles for a tour around the estate, not the easiest estate to navigate but still very nice and scenic, a somewhat unfriendly valet handed the bikes over, not much engagement from him which was unusual given the concierge was clearly top class.

Swimming Pool in Hunters Yard is clean and nicely decorated, water was quite cold (other guests mentioned this aswel) and there was limited seating around so didn't spend too long here.

The Manor House is separate from the larger Hunters Yard Hotel, 5-7 min walk, or a car transfer by Bruno (I think ?) Each time, he was fantastic; warm,  funny and beyond helpful.

The Manor House has a surprising quirk; the lovely warm Majors Bar closes at 5pm with only the 1757 Bar serving at night, it's in the basement, cold and dark with only one warm table next to the fire, which naturally gets occupied first. I noticed a lot of other guests were leaving here to move to the Saddle Bar in the Hunters Yard instead, which is small so limited seating available - when we enquired about why the Majors Bar closed at night, it was suggested that staffing two bars is expensive, funny how the accommodation prices don't reflect restricted service offering.

We had some drinks in the Saddle Bar on Friday, some staff were good others came across a bit unfriendly and not engaging at all. Ross the musician was fantastic both evenings.

Dinner in the hound on Saturday was exceptional, Chloe and Danielle both fantastic staff (as were others) so really happy with the experience there.

Breakfast in the Hound both mornings was excellent, although on Sunday our table was cleared as we were at the cold buffet and having asked for our coffee back a tea was brought instead, I know a simple mistake but in the context of generally mixed service I think it's just another example of not 5-star.

Check out was disappointing, Simone again excellent on the desk and ordered a valet to take bags to the car, after waiting about 4-5 mins (and Simone calling the valet again despite also dealing with other customer's) we just left ourselves, a disappointing end and the same unfriendly valet from previously walked past us as we carried our bags out to the car, not good!

Overall, mixed, somewhat disappointing and not 5 Star treatment.

239,Overnight stay in the Manor House,"We attended a wedding in Hunters Yard which was most enjoyable. The food was terrific and the staff could not have been nicer. However, our experience during our overnight stay in the Manor House left a lot to be desired.

Since bringing this to the attention of the hotel, I have been contacted by Mark Dunne who has very graciously apologised for the shortcomings we experienced as a result of which I am happy to give Mount Juliet a positive rating. ",4,2023,11,14
239,Simply terrific for a weekend away,"Mount Juliet Estate is simply terrific. The property and the rooms are fabulous, the food and spa were excellent and the staff are among the friendliest and most helpful we’ve encountered anywhere.  Highly recommend the Manor House, which feels like a step back in time. Terrific for a relaxing weekend away.",5,2023,11,12
239,Rural luxury,"Outstanding example of a period home with excellent facilities on stunning grounds in rural Ireland. I pick out the detail of original sash windows and high ceiling splendour the history and log  fires with delicious food and the warmest hospitality. Quality of this nature is rare. All outdoor activities are provided for and although we didn’t stay in the hunting lodge - the families all seemed to love their accommodation and pool. The tennis court is one area that needs attention (resurfaved).
The walks along full flowing rivers are therapeutic and I couldn’t recommend this place enough for those that want to experience escape!",5,2023,11,12
239,MJ Stay,"We had an amazing two night stay at Mount Juliet hotel. The hotel is divided in two parts with the main accommodation block and bar, breakfast and dinner area in the Hunters yard section. Very well appointed with spacious and very clean rooms. Beautiful views of the grounds which are stunning golf course with manicured lawns surrounded by mature trees of the estate. Breakfast was lovely with a great selection cereal, fruit or hot breakfast with optional eggs to order. Nice coffee selection at no extra cost.",5,2023,10,29

239,"Elegant, Charming, & Romantic Getaway","My wife and I came here and stayed for a couple of nights during our honeymoon trip to Ireland. The estate was beautiful, the staff were all very kind and helpful, and the service and food was impeccable. We had the best time chatting with Eddie at The Clubhouse. We would definitely enjoy coming back for another stay the next time we find ourselves in Ireland.",5,2023,10,19
239,Wonderful,"We had a delightful two night stay in the Manor House, which had a lot of character. Beautiful view over river. On site restaurants we’re not quite as a good as we hoped but didn’t detract from overall experience. Excellent service including complimentary EV charging. Would definitely return, particularly if golfing. If you’re looking for a modern room rather than a historic house, I’d stay in Hunter’s Yard.",5,2023,10,19
239,Modern rooms & gorgeous grounds - check in / dining and drink concerns,"The good:

The grounds and the rooms at the Hunters Yard are magnificent - clean, modern and tasteful. Radiant floors in the bathrooms were a nice touch and welcomed. While we only had a night here we had the opportunity to take a lovely stroll before dinner to explore.

Breakfast was plentiful and staff pleasant. 

The not so good:

1. Service / Check In 

When we arrived; the valet / drop off area was full of hotel vehicles and other vans, meaning we had to walk from the car park with our luggage. We passed several staff and not one offered to assist with baggage. For a five star hotel, the service just wasn’t there on check in, especially coming from the Killarney Park Hotel and the Muckross prior. 

The reception didn’t immediately offer to assist in making dinner reservations, but said if we wanted to make them to call - but the restaurant at the Hunters Yard was fully booked. I asked her to make a reservation and she did after prompting. We’re in our 30s but staff was much younger and maybe some formal training/professional development opportunities would be beneficial. 

2. Restaurants, Bars & Room Service

Online and at the hotel, several bars and restaurants are listed. Unfortunately not all are open/functional.

A large reason we booked this hotel was due to the 1757 cellar in the Manor House and the cocktail bar at the Hunters Lodge. Neither was open - both are closed and only available 2 nights a week, that was disappointing and hours should be posted on the web upon booking, false advertising otherwise.

We dined at the Majors Bar as it was the only restaurant with availability - the Hounds was already fully booked when we arrived. The food was OK - nothing to write home about, but did the job.

One last item to note, unlike the other Five Star hotels we stayed at during our time in Ireland, we received no pre-call to ask if we would like to book at the restaurants prior. This wasn’t an issue immediately, but it became clear that bookings were needed when we were left with just on dining option. 

Overall:
If we found this hotel at a discounted point or dollar rate we wouldn’t hesitate to stay again, but would come in with significantly different expectations and ensure the restaurants/bars we were interested in visiting would be open. ",3,2023,10,09
239,A little bit of heaven on earth at Mount Juliet,"I recently stayed for one night in Mount Juliet estate with my husband to celebrate my birthday.
I have never felt more welcome to any other hotel from the moment we stepped foot on the grounds until the time we left.
All the staff were eager to help whenever they could.
We went horse riding one of the afternoon’s and we’re pushed for time as we arrived later then expected and a member of the golf staff kindly told us to jump on his buggy and dropped us down as it was a bit of a walks from the hunters yard where we were staying.
I never caught his name but it was this kind gesture that really impresssed me.
I also mentioned to a lady at the desk it was my birthday and that evening there came a knock on our door a gift of a bottle of Prosecco !! I am still over the moon after how well we were looked after.
We ate in the clubhouse that evening and the food was outstanding. Again we were looked after so well by the manager there and staff.
The grounds are spectacular to walk around. So much to do different activities like archery , golfing , hiking. 
I wish my stay was longer as I would have loved to try the spa area and do more activities.
The hotel itself is decorated really tastefully and is spotless clean. Our room was also beautiful the bed extremely comfortable. I find it hard to drop off in most hotels I slept like a baby here.
The bathroom was exquisite. Loved the tiles and the spacious walk in shower. It all felt so luxurious. I am already thinking of when I can return to Mount Juliet ! I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone wishing to feel pampered.",5,2023,10,03
239,Just a lovely time in the heart of Ireland ,"This is an all-around excellent property! While I didn't play golf there, I can unequivocally state that the course is in outstanding condition. We ate at the amazing Lady Helen, a very solid one Michelin starred restaurant. Our amazing suite rounded out the experience. Next time, I'd like to try the Manor House. Staff was wonderful. This is a very well-run estate.",5,2023,09,28
239,Lovely but Lonely,Lovely spacious grounds and well appointed hotel on an extremely beautiful golf course. Unfortunately a very long distance from the main town and any other activities. Would only stay here if golf was something you must do. If just traveling through the area then better to stay in the main town to enjoy a variety of restaurants and tours.,4,2023,09,28
239,5 star hotel resort in the Irish countryside but close to Dublin.,Great hotel in the Irish countryside 90 minutes from Dublin. One of the best golf courses I have ever seen. Great restaurants and bars. Guest rooms were quiet and clean.  Staff was very friendly and helpful . 5 star stay all around.I would highly recommend.,5,2023,09,24
239,Great Hotel,"Well run hotel .. super staff . Attentive , friendly and accommodating .. location is amazing ..brilliant ambience .. lots to do .. horse stables are fantastic and adds to the country experience of a Manor House ",4,2023,09,24
239,Mixed,"A very mixed experience. The hotel is extremely busy, queue to check in and check out. Staff are young, enthusiastic but not well trained.  So all slightly chaotic! 
Checking in, I asked what time the room would be ready (my mother was celebrating her 80th), don’t worry we will call you. No call and I dropped over at 4pm and the room was ready from 3….and said why didn’t you call.. sorry we are busy!!  The rooms are really beautiful, well laid out, lovely furnishing and sheets etc! Really lovely touch with Prosecco and chocolates in mums room! 
Breakfast was average, another queue and nothing special! Very disorganised, there is a bit of a weird smell in the restaurant. Coffee was served split …  Just not a 5 star experience, so maybe the 5 star is The Manor? That was closed for a wedding!",3,2023,09,24
239,Amazing location,"Absolutely loved our short visit. We only had time for a one night stay which included dinner at the club house and drinks in the saddle bar. Amazing entertainer in the bar!! Would have loved to golf, ride or fishing the spa but had no time. 100% class.",5,2023,09,24
239,Amazing! ,"Beautiful place , fantastic location. The rooms are immaculately clean! Front of house and concierge team extremely friendly! 
Great price for 5 star hotel! Perfect place for families with children. Will be back! ",5,2023,09,19
239,Wonderful stay at an old manor house,"We stayed for one night in August 2023 as part of a self-drive tour though Ireland. We're not golfers so one night for us was sufficient to enjoy the grounds of the estate and facilities. I am sure we would have enjoyed two nights but beyond that we would have run out of things to do.

It's a little bit out of Kilkenny so chances are you will be eating at the estate. There is a wonderful Michelin star restaurant in the Manor House which we really enjoyed and were fortunate enough to book a half board meal plan as it was substantially better value.

The grounds are truly beautiful and it is delightful to walk around, weather notwithstanding.  It was also very pleasant having a drink at the hotel bar overlooking the estate. 

Our room in the Manor House appeared freshly renovated so looking at the other recent reviews, it appears that there may be some substantial variability amongst the rooms so take this into account when booking.  The Hunters Yard section of the hotel is a 10 minute walk from the Manor House through the grounds and is home to the golf club, the gym (which was good) and a large indoor pool. We were impressed with the facilities.

Despite being a Marriott property there was no recognition of status but that's a pretty first-world problem at a place like this. On the whole, we really enjoyed our one night stay, but we would hope so considering it cost us 700 Euro.

",5,2023,09,19
239,Beautiful estate surrounding by golf  course,"We really enjoyed our stay, staffs were very friendly. Loved the design and decor and the bed was so comfy with a fresh premium linen. The food was delicious with excellent service. We definitely will be back for future visits.",5,2023,09,18
239,Relaxing Weekend Break,"We stayed for two nights in September. We met Patrick & Vincent on arrival, who were a joy to deal with and quickly escorted us inside away from the rain. They quickly followed us inside with our bags & our car keys after parking our car for us! The checkin was quick, and friendly with a young lady from France who was able to book our dinners & golf. 

The room was spacious and modern. The young concierge staff in the lobby area were very helpful in driving us down to the Lady Helen restaurant in The Manor Building and David sharing some information in the history of the estate. We really loved this bronze sculpture in the lobby area.  

The manor building is a beautiful old house, full of history and very elegantly furnished. 

We dined in both the Hunters Hound restaurant and the formal  Lady Helen in main house. Both were delicious with excellent service. Nigel is the Hunters bar was particularly friendly. 

Overall great value, and a really relaxing and luxurious stay.",5,2023,09,17
239,Wonderful tranquil escape and great place to stay near Kilkenny!,"My wife and I stayed at Mount Juliet Estate (Hunter's Yard) for regretfully only one night after a hectic week in London. We arrived 7 hours late due to flight cancellation from London to Dublin that day, so we did not have as much time to explore this glorious 500 acre estate as we had intended to. But we wish we had booked 2-3 nights here as it is a fabulous place to unwind, relax, and take advantage of the many activities they offer here. There is a championship golf course, an equestrian centre, archery, and miles of hiking trails throughout this beautiful, tranquil landscape. Also on site is a Michelin star restaurant, another quality restaurant, and a bar with a cool ""country estate"" vibe. 

The room we had at Hunters Yard lodge was exceptional in every way - it is updated (modern amenities, heated tile floors in bathroom), but still retains that Old Irish Estate style with classical decor and incredibly comfortable beds situated in a large room. 

The breakfast provided was typical hotel fare with both hot- and cold-buffet options, as well as a few made-to-order items available. The food was very high quality though, and a great way to start the day.

We would highly recommend staying at Mount Juliet Estate anytime you are in the Kilkenny area of Ireland!",5,2023,09,16
239,Breathtaking property,"Our stay was wonderful! We really enjoyed the spacious, clean accommodations and the beautiful and well-maintained grounds. All the staff were professional and helpful. We had afternoon tea at the Manor and breakfast at the Hound restaurant. Both experiences were lovely. I also appreciated the complimentary chocolates for being a Bonvoy Gold Elite member and a note from the manager wishing us a great stay upon arrival. I will definitely return to this property when I'm in the area!",5,2023,09,15
239,Wonderful 5 Star Experience,": Myself and my mother attended a recent wedding at Mount Juliet & we had a wonderful time. The welcome was so friendly from the moment we arrived - the room was immaculate, extremely comfortable & relaxing. The wedding reception was in beautiful sunshine & a truly enjoyable evening was had by everyone. A wonderful memory that we are still chatting about. Thank you Siobhan, Mark & team for looking after us so well.",5,2023,09,15
239,Front of house staff abrupt and rude!,"While home from London to spend quality time with my son and family, we were met by what I would describe as the most rudest and unapproachable front of house staff member, she said we could not eat in restaurant yet never gave alternative, which we found to be the bar that served nibbles! I popped out to take a phone and she turned around and kept looking me up and down until I went back into the bar to my family. 

Bar staff were fantastic! Aine and Nigel ( I think ) were so helpful and the food was delicious.",3,2023,09,03
239,Excellent Stay at the Mount Juliet Estate,"From the minute we arrived, the staff were very friendly, helpful and efficient.  Breakfast was great with lots of choices. Rooms were really spacious and very well equipped.  The gym, pool and steam rooms were conveniently located and pleasant to use.  Our family stayed for 3 nights and attended a two day wedding.  I would definitely recommend this hotel. ",5,2023,08,31
239,5 Star Luxury at its best….. Truly Amazing,"Just home from a 2 night stay at the hotel, travelled with my sister in law & niece, 
From the moment we arrived until the minute we left the service was amazing. 
Staff were so friendly and attentive to every need.  We dined in the Hound Restaurant on day 1 & the Club house on day 2 and the food was beautiful, not to mention the beautiful views from both dining room’s overlooking the golf course.  The pool was a highlight for my 10 year old niece and the secret garden and Fairy Village which was just magical.
We stayed in hunters yard but before leaving took a brief tour of the Manor in all its glory with a definite promise to return and stay in the coming months.
This hotel really exceeded all our expectations with its calm peaceful surroundings and amazing staff.  

",5,2023,08,29
239,Friendly service without carefulness,"My experience in Mount Juliet as a Platinum member: I must begin by commending the overall friendliness and cleanliness of the hotel. In particular, Lisa from the Guest Relations team was exceptional in her prompt and professional responses. Her efforts to accommodate my requests were truly appreciated. 

The porter David was also a standout. His attention to detail during our hotel buggy tour, including stopping the car for us to take pictures for us and printing the history of the estate was a delightful touch. I believe he would be a great fit for your Concierge team.

However, my stay was not without its hiccups. I found it difficult to get in touch with the Reservations and ""at your service"" teams. No replies were forthcoming to my emails and I had to track down the Guest Relations team myself.

Whilst Lucy at the reception was friendly, the communication about our room upgrade was not clear until after we had already settled into our room. The Guest Relations team also overlooked delivering Prosecco to my room, and the letter addressed to me had the incorrect honorific. Thankfully, Lisa managed to rectify these issues swiftly.

The room itself had a few maintenance issues. The light above the shower was dim and the rain shower head was leaking, leading to a flooded bathroom floor due to a blocked drain. 

As for the room service, the menu was limited to western cuisine, despite the clubhouse offering Indian food. We ordered two medium-rare ribeyes with fries, but what arrived were overcooked steaks with mashed potatoes. Considering the extra €10 tray charge, the meal did not meet our expectations.

Lastly, there was an unfortunate mix-up with our Segway booking. We ended up waiting for 10 minutes before the front of house manager came out to apologise and offer us a buggy tour instead, which was our only option as we are checking out the next day.

In conclusion, whilst the service from certain staff members was commendable, there are areas that could use improvement. Specifically, communication across teams, maintenance of the rooms, and diversifying the room service menu could greatly enhance the guest experience.",4,2023,08,28
239,Old aged facility in need of renovation!,"Dated aged facility not deserving of Marriott Autograph Collection status. Indifferent front desk reception personnel. Room reservation months in advance stated ""Courtyard View"". We were assigned a room overlooking a road - no courtyard or garden to be seen anywhere. Small bathroom - shower water leaked onto floor due to no door on the shower. Your Marriott Titanium Elite status means nothing here... stay elsewhere.",2,2023,08,15
239,Hugely Disappointing.,"After trying a sister hotel of Mount Juliet last year I had high hopes for this one. unfortunately the stay throughout was hugely disappointing. We've visited other 5 star hotels since the pandemic and at first glance I could see this wasn't up to standard. We were offered a room for someone with disabilities without being told until we got into the room and realised ourselves, whilst this is not an issue whatsoever in general, it would have been nice to have been made aware. Hotel felt a little tired in places and the staff in comparison to other 5star establishments were not up to par (besides two girls in the dining area) Dinner was a complete let down and after booking dinner in the Hound early (6.30) I found desserts were already sold out (on top of items ""not available"" in the clubhouse earlier) Dinner was underwhelming to say the least especially when a Michelin star restaurant is on location. I don't think I've ever sent anything back but I had to send back the desert, a mud pie, which was what we both thought a gloried frozen chocolate dessert, I was a little shocked to be honest however the waitress was very nice and understanding and it wasn't an issue (although we were charge €22 for this) finally, the TV in the room was broken and housekeeping thought it was a good idea to knock at 9am on doors to begin a clean up which I found bizarre. Overall, hugely disappointing and I'm glad we had a voucher kindly given to us to our towards the overall stay otherwise I would have been extremely annoyed paying the prices they are charging to stay here. We did receive a 10% discount on check out due to the tv being an issue etc but I didn't bother mentioning the meal the previous night. At that stage we just wanted to leave. Anyone looking for a 5 star experience, The Cashel Palace Hotel or Trump Hotel in Doonbeg know how to do it with class.",2,2023,08,09
239,Would you pay Euro 900 B&B to stay for 2 nights in this room ?,"We thought by selecting a suite and it being a 5 Star hotel it would be a very high standard but unfortunately, we were wrong.  

Maybe we were unlucky with the room but luck doesn't come into some of the issues with this room.  

We were offered 2 other rooms but for very different reasons (mobility) and they were unsuitable for our needs.
 
1)    Stained carpets, shabby curtains
2)     Broken light fittings
3)         Wallpaper coming off the wall
4)         Crack in window
5)          A couch which was not very 5 Star
6)          Stains on the ceiling
7)          Insects on the floor which were not removed despite the room being ""cleaned""
8)     It was advertised as a ""Garden View Junior Suite"" - it didn't say you would need to be extremely tall to see the garden over the wall from the small concrete patio
9)          The patio was overlooked by other rooms 
10)     There was a bee hive in a gutter/eaves over the patio with a swarm of bees some of which were lying dead on the patio 
11)         The door to the patio could have done with being painted!",2,2023,08,02
239,Never wanted to leave,"One of the loveliest hotels in the world. Gorgeous setting. Room was impeccable. Food wonderful. Staff was attentive and lovely. Gardens are magical. Equestrian center was a huge hit with our daughters. Wish we could have stayed longer! Visit the glassblowing and lost city nearby, as well as Killkenny. ",5,2023,07,28
239,John was wonderful.,"It's the manor house or golf experience if that's what you're looking for.  It's a beautiful, rural property and the rooms (and bathrooms) are very large with a nice sitting area to enjoy the view.  It's very mellow and relaxing.
We went horseback riding along the river which I absolutely recommend, even if you don't stay at the hotel.
However, it is very far from Kilkenny so if you want to experience that you should stay in town.  It was a 25 minute wait for a cab then 20 minutes back into town.  40 EU there, 40 EU back, and we did it twice a day.  John actually took me once because a cab couldn't make it out, so that's when he became my favorite person.",4,2023,07,24
239,Gorgeous Hotel & Estate,"Fabulous hotel and wet facilities. The bedroom was spacious and the bed was super comfy. The only downfall was the slow service in parts of the hotel. However, David Byrne was very helpful and couldn't do enough for us. I'd definitely recommend a stay here. ",4,2023,07,24
239,"Amazing Staff, Grounds and Amenities! ","I simply can not say enough about the staff, facility, Chef, Tenders, and what a beautiful golf course!!  The property was clean, safe, and had anything in the world you are looking for!  .  A true Ireland experience and very affordable in the end.  I will leave this short, must do, you will not be disappointed!!!   We will be back to visit Mount Juliet and Kilkenny soon!  (Engagement Trip) ",5,2023,07,20
239,Beautiful Estate with wonderful Service,"We recently (July 2023) spent three nights at Mount Juliet during our 2nd visit to Ireland.
The location and estate are beautiful with so many activities and walks/gardens.  We began our stay in the Hunters Yard, the larger of the facilities on the property.  The room was large and well-appointed but due to a minor electrical problem we were moved to the Manor House for our last two nights.  The staff at Hunters Yard were outstanding, especially Oscar, the front office supervisor who so graciously suggested the move and upgrade to the Manor House.  He and our fabulous porter watched over us and took care of every detail (even providing a comfortable arm chair to accommodate my bad back and recent hip replacement).  Nothing was too much trouble.
The Manor House was a lovely experience.  The room was perfect in every way with a view onto the front garden area.  The dining room was closed but we had an amazing dinner on Monday evening in the bar with views over the fields with the mares and their frolicking foals.  We were even blessed with a rainbow.  Breakfast was wonderful with many choices.  
Every member of the staff should be commended.  They treated us like beloved family members and looked after our every need.  Look forward to another visit in the future.
",5,2023,07,18
239,Spectacular Hotel,"Absolutely outstanding.    The rooms were extremely clean and comfortable.   The property is amazing--garden paths, equestrian, golf, etc.     I only had breakfast at the hotel,  which was great.  Service was very good and all of the staff were friendly and extremely helpful.     Among the best hotels I have ever stayed.",5,2023,07,13
239,A lovely family break,"We recently stayed in Mount Juliet for a family occasion.  We stayed in the Hunters Yard which met out needs perfectly.  It is a beautiful location and the staff were so attentive and friendly. We had a family room which was nice, it overlooked an enclosed court yard which was great for children to play in. While the swimming pool was lovely and warm, it was disappointing for a 5 star hotel to have no jacuzzi. The pool itself was relatively clean, however there were sections in the corners that needed attention.  While the food was average in both the restaurant and the clubhouse, the service was excellent. The concierges were very friendly and always so willing to provide assistance including advice on the beautiful walks around the estate. Overall, a very enjoyable stay. ",4,2023,07,12
239,Magical,I highly recommend Mount Juliet. We had our wedding vows renewal at the Manor House. If I try find one word to describe the experience I would said magical. The hotel is one of the best in the world. The staff were so amazing. Jimmy made our event run so smoothly and went above and beyond for us and for all of our guests. I really recommend this venue for your special occasion. The rooms are incredible. The restaurant is impeccable and very deserving of the Michelin star. A choice of bars for evening drinks. The fisherman’s bar was amazing atmosphere and so warm and inviting. A real Irish feel to it. . Then breakfast was unreal watching horses galloping around the fields as if wild. Throughout the duration of our stay we were all treated like royalty. Every member of the staff looked after our every need. I just want to turn back the clock and go back. To everyone who looked after us I say thank you. Mount Juliet gets 5 stars from us all. ,5,2023,07,08
239,Wonderful Option,"This was a wonderful place to stay.  Obviously it is slightly more remote, but presumably you are staying for relaxation, golf, etc.  The rooms are very well appointed, the staff is exceedingly helpful and the food is good.  This is a more expensive option for the area, but a delightful choice if you are there for golf or general enjoyment.  I would certainly recommend.",5,2023,07,07
239,Genuine Irish Hospitality,"Absolutely beautiful location and the Manor House I elegant and understated - no flashiness here just style.
Our room was spacious and comfortable with a river view and beyond to the neighbouring horse stud. Marble bathroom well appointed with a deep bath and seperate shower.
Breakfast is excellent with option from the full Irish to something simpler like poached eggs on toast. 
Dinner in the Lady Helen was a treat - we did the 7 course with wine pairing.
But what really sets Mount Juliet apart is the service - understated and genuine. The staff all seemed to be showing their true selves rather than some faux Irish bonhomie we had experienced elsewhere. Nothing was too much trouble and you felt like a valued guest.",5,2023,07,02
239,Lovely property - don’t miss the equestrian center!,"Beautiful estate and great place for first stop in Ireland. Take time to enjoy the amenities - l would recommend a two night stay so you can check out Kilkenny as well. Breakfast was great, riding bikes around the estate was fun and our kids LOVED the equestrian center. Signed up for a ride with Clodagh and she was incredible. ",5,2023,06,30
239,Absolutely brilliant ,"Attending a wedding here. The venue, staff, facilities, food and drink are all 5 star. 
Our room was very spacious, the bed comfortable, the bathroom very bright. The surroundings were beautiful, you can go for a walk or take in a round of golf.
The food was delicious and the staff were so helpful and informative. Would love to visit here again...",5,2023,06,30
239,"Great grounds, horrible staff.","An absolute joke.  While the grounds and room itself were amazing, the staff was another story.  While here, we were tracked down not once, but four times and accused of not paying our bills at various restaurants and bars.  We showed bank statements to prove that we paid.  We even had signed receipts.  I don’t know if they have an utter dislike for Americans or if they’re just rude.  Do not waste your money on this place.  Cannot believe we were treated this poorly in what’s supposed to be one of the best places to stay in Ireland.  ",2,2023,06,30
239,"Corporate hotel, you can do better in Ireland","This is a corporate hotel. The website is misleading, leads you to believe you are staying f in a castle.  The hotel has no character or presence.  Staff are wonderful.  Rooms and bathrooms were tiny.  No place to unpack.  Unless you are really into golf and riding, this place has nothing to offer",1,2023,06,25
239,What a memorable trip,"The whole trip start to finish, nothing short of absolutely magnificent.
We went to lady helen for the 9 course tasting menu, can I just say credit to the chefs for all course what an experience absolutely fabulous. Also mentioning the staff at lady helen from the moment we arrived to the moment we left they were so attentive. Our room was beautiful, breakfast was fantastic and the service there was also top notch. 
In the hound bar the young man behind the bar was lovely and very pleasant he made fabulous Gin Fizz even though they were not on the menu. 
If you wanted something else it was never an issue.
We walked and visited the equestrian center.
I got this stay for my mam for her 60th birthday and what a special trip it was.
Will 100% recommend this to all. 
Don’t hesitate book it, I promise you won’t regret it. ",5,2023,06,23
239,"Quiet hotel with huge grounds, good for walks. Good alternative to staying in Killarney.","We booked a Hunter’s Yard kingsize room with garden view.
The room wasn’t available until 16:30 and the room we received wasn’t quiet what we expected. It overlooked the back street not the garden. The bathroom was also very small. The most annoying thing about the bathroom was the ventilation which cannot be turned off. 
Apparently although we asked at the reception no one seem to be informed that this is an automatic ventilation which is centrally controlled and is on time basis from 09:00-20:00, so at the end of the day it will eventually go off.

The Hound restaurant has a lovely view overlooking the Golf course and the service was very good.
Breakfast is also served here if you have a room in the Hunters Yard. Very good self service selection and you can also order eggs, bacon etc.
The hound bar is quite rustic and has also good service.

The Golf Clubhouse also offers drinks and light meals.
The service here is extremely slow.

On the whole we enjoyed our stay and can definitely recommend the hotel.
There are several walks on the grounds which are really beautiful.
Perfect setting for a few days.",4,2023,06,22
239,I didn’t want to leave! ,"What a beautiful place. I had a wonderful stay. Hunters Yard room, super clean, comfortable and with all the amenities you need ( including gorgeous Bulgari bathroom products!). All the hotel staff were welcoming and helpful, in particular thanks to Paddy for helping with my bags with enthusiasm and a wonderful smile! Breakfast and dinner in The Hound were both excellent. The meeting room in the Manor House and lunch were both superb and we were so well looked after by Jimmy. Thanks to all for a super stay! ",5,2023,06,19
239,Great stay at Mount Juliet,"We had a great stay at Mount Juliet. The staff, especially Jim, made every effort to ensure we had a terrific time.
There is a lot to do here, so be sure to do your research in advance. 
Horseback riding on site was fun, as was tea-time and golf. The restaurants are excellent, and there are also good offerings nearby in Kilkenny. Check out Ristorante Rinuccini.",5,2023,06,12
239,Beautiful property ,"We stayed 2 nights in the Manor House at Mount Juliet. Lovely house, very nice room overlooking the River Noor and beautiful horse fields.

239,Like visiting your wealthy Aunt and Uncle's estate,"We booked this hotel in early January for a March stay for three nights.  In early March I went to double check the reservations and found out one of the nights had been canceled.  Neither the reservations staff at Mt. Juliet nor Marriott central reservations could tell me why it had been cancelled and even worse could not restore the night as they were fully booked.  We changed our itinerary around and found a different hotel on the coast for the last night.  When we checked in the desk agent said -- three nights, right?  This is despite multiple emails to the hotel directly trying to straighten out the reservation in early March.  By then it was too late to cancel our other reservation so we enjoyed just two nights.  The front desk agents were helpful, breakfast in the Hunters yard was wonderful, we used the bicycles for a lovely ride through the grounds and we enjoyed our ground floor room in the Hunters yard with opening doors onto a patio.  We enquired about archery but ended up doing that at a nearly leisure center instead.  Once we got to the hotel we had a lovely time but the reservations staff dropped the ball in our opinion.  We would return the next time we are in Ireland.",4,2023,06,05
239,Pretty but missing the mark on the basics,"Beautiful.   Yes.   But missing the mark on the givens on a hotel of this caliber and we've stayed around the world in a wide variety of accommodations to compare and contest. 

Comfy bed,  pleasant staff,  lovely breakfast.  But here's where things derail.

Bathroom floor flooded after two people showered back to back.   No hooks in the bathroom to dry your towels ( just one directly in line with the shower).  No place to plug in the hairdryer in the bathroom so I had to wait until my husband was up so i could dry my hair in the main room.   

There is a Beautiful pool area with steam room and sauna yet no hot tub?  (All these little alcoves giving you that impression yet nope.) Plus inconsistent with their policies in this area.   Some people were asked to wear swim caps,  others not, or told to rinse off?  

I also requested non feather pilllows as I'm allergic to feathers.   They promptly brought me two new pillows.   Great!  Silly me didn't check until I went to bed at 11pm only to find they brought me more feather pillows.

By that time no one was at the the front desk so I had to sleep on a balled up bathrobe.  Not happy. 

I would not go back. ",3,2023,05,29
239,Amazing day out,"We go whenever I visit Ireland family etc...My family worked and lived there pre war. Estate Workers. Stunning estate. Trully magical. Pure Irish charm. Lovely scenery. Great to hear my uncle waxing lyrical about running the butter as a 5 year old. Pointing out each door outside, and where it lead to. ",5,2023,05,29
239,Amazing place with a great staff,"Absolutely Excellent service, from the moment of check in till the Check out. Everyone is going above  and beyond to help and please you. By far the best customer experience offered so far via 5 star hotel in Ireland. 

Thanks everyone for the great customer service. We stayed at the hunter’s yard, had our breakfast there and I would like to thank everyone especially for bri’ Orla, and Mary they are  great, please keep it up.",5,2023,05,23
239,Mount Juliet Estates - As nice as it gets,"This is a beautiful place, as nice as it gets. The grounds and golf course are as beautiful as the hotel itself. Our room was very comfortable and up to date. Had a heated bathroom floor which was a very nice touch. Highly recommend it. The gardens are a must see.  The breakfast buffet was excellent with a wide variety of choices.",5,2023,05,22
239,"It did the job, but wouldn't rush back","I stayed here for two nights as part of a larger group. Check-in was chaotic, including initially being given details of other guests. Not all rooms were ready upon arrival and it took more than an hour for all rooms to be ready, despite arriving after the start of official check-in. The problems persisted after check-in when it became necessary to talk to another member of the group and reception thought I was asking to speak to a member of staff. 

If you do stay here, phone ahead and enquire if there is a large group checking in at the same time. If there is, don't bother trying to check-in until the large group have cleared.

Dinner and breakfast in The Hound were good and plentiful on both evenings and mornings. ",3,2023,05,22
239,Luxury in County Kilkenny ,"Wish we could afford to come and stay more regularly because this is a magnificent place to rest up, play sport and holiday. Supreme golf course (Irish open held here last year), magnificent walks, along the Nore river for example, in the spacious  grounds, bikes available, a class spa treatment centre and pool, delicious food, fabulous rooms and friendly helpful staff. Approx only 15 minutes from Kilkenny, a buzzing large town with lots of great eateries and attractions. Visitors from home and abroad will simply love this place.
Cannot thank everyone we met but Oscar on reception, Bri and Mary on breakfasts, Frances (a legend!) running the golf and Kevin, such a gent, the starter for the golf course and Angela and Valerie in the Spa.
Despite all the luxury and wonderful facilities it’s the staff who always deliver.",5,2023,05,19
239,Ladies night,I went to Mount  Juliet estate late November time as I was celebrating my friends coming home to Ireland for a few weeks . We dined in the hound restaurant as the menu looked very pleasing when we searched it online. We were greeted by a lovely gentleman James. He was ever so accommodating for each of us. I went for the celeriac and apple soup and for mains I had the 7 oz fillet. The meal was outstanding . I have to mention how much of a credit James is to your team of staff. I could see the restaurant was very busy and he remained calm and professional at all times. He went through the menu and explained everything to us. We felt very comfortable with such a friendly kind and charming face.  Thank you James staff and chefs who looked after us all night.  We will be back again soon.  The coctails for to die for also. ,5,2023,05,13
239,Heritage Five star,"Super stay at Mj in the Manor House with a garden view room. Really beautiful property surrounded by lush grounds. I used the pool which was quiet once the kids left the pool at 6, did a few walks around the grounds. I’ve also stayed at  the Hunters Yard, the difference in the Manor and Hunters yard is MH is a heritage property with all the quirks while hunters yard is a new build (c2005), go for a Manor room if you can!",5,2023,05,01
239,Tea for Two !,"We visited for afternoon tea yesterday afternoon. We were celebrating a ""significant"" birthday and had a really wonderful experience. We were seated at a table looking out over the river and the tea room was beautifully decorated. The service was outstanding and we were really well looked after by all the staff we met over the course of the afternoon. We highly recommend the Mount Juliet Manor House Afternoon Tea experience. ",5,2023,05,01
239,Pricey but nicey!!,"Very enjoyable stay. Rooms in the Hunter's Yard were spacious and the beds were so comfortable! 

Very nice leisure centre which is always a bonus.

Well worth popping over to the Manor House for a nice afternoon drink! Also recommend a walk down by the River Nore.

Cost of stay was pricey enough especially given it was for early week. Menu was a little limited and also pricey. Having said that, Food was very nice.",4,2023,04,26
239,Beautiful Manor House ,We had a wonderful stay in the Manor house . Beautiful large room with lovely sitting area and large bathroom. All the staff that we met were very friendly and professional. The food both evening and morning was excellent with great variety on both menus. Looking forward to going back again .,5,2023,04,16
239,Great place for a family break,"Stayed in inter connecting rooms for my family of 5 at Hunters Yard. Good sized rooms, like that the room with the king bed had a bath. Well appointed room with bath robe, slippers, water and lovely toiletries. No turn down service at night but Michael came by each evening to check if anything was needed and we’d often get an additional towel. He was a pleasure. 
Staff at the hotel are really great - really contentious and thoughtful. 
Breakfast buffet was delicious. Excellent warm food and good choice of cold too. The kids enjoyed the pancakes that you could order from the menu and this was always quick. We ate at the Hound several times for dinner and lunch and liked the vibe of the Club House which was a little more casual for dinner and cheaper. 
We did fishing with Dan and he was excellent. It’s good value IMO and a lovely way to just be in the Irish country side. My kids had a great time. 
They had fun at archery too and one of the kids did a three day golf camp we were fortunate to catch with our timing and Sean was wonderfully patient with the kids and our son loved it and seemed to learn a lot. He just wants to play more now. 
Pool was nice and liked that they weren’t strict on the hats. Sauna and steam could be bigger but worked very well. It was rainy Irish days so I’m sure people were just availing of something to do. 
Booked movie theater in the main house before arriving only to learn it’s for over 18s. That’s a bit of a shame that on a wet day they can’t facilitate kids with parents and some conditions to keep the cinema clean. Would be good if archery could be done in a barn or something on a wet day - felt sometimes we were a little lost in the rain but when the sun comes out it was fab. 
Highly recommend the estate and would go back and Hunters was terrific with family. 
Thank you to all who made our stay so nice.",4,2023,04,15
239,"Amazing hotel, stay and golf course","My fiancé, I and two other friends went and did a stay and play in at the beginning of this week and we couldn’t fault it at all! The only negative we had was that we didn’t stay of two nights. We arrived down on Monday at 1:30, knowing our room wouldn’t be ready until 4, but we went to fill in and sign the paper work and low and behold our room was ready and waiting. We had a big king sized bed in hunters yard and my god, it was the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in and the shower pressure was incredible!! We had a 2pm lunch booking in Majors bar and after we settled into our room we were driven down to the Manor House by the loveliest driver with no hassle at all. We had a lovely meal overlooking the paddocks and then took a stroll back to hunters yard to relax. We scoped out the warm up areas for golf the following day and the range itself was beautiful. We went for drinks in the saddle bar, service was a little slow but we didn’t mind as we were just enjoying our surroundings and our conversations. We had the most amazing burgers ever in hunters for dinner. My fiancé wanted another one before we had even left. We woke up had a lovely relaxed breakfast, not just a buffet but a full menu aswell, and then had to head up to our room and pack! We checked out and headed down to the club house to check in and get our cards and range tokens. The golf course was very long but beautiful and extremely well maintained! 
Honestly wish we stayed two nights! Would definitely recommend! And if going down to golf, we had the birdie package which was extremely good value for money! ",5,2023,04,08
239,Nice hotel but overpriced,"Stayed here for one night. We had a family room quite spacious, very clean , great shower. Breakfast was good. However this place cost us €311 for a night it was overpriced. I wouldn’t be in a rush going back unless you are there to play golf there is no point splashing out the cash on this hotel. Checkin was 4pm. Which was very late and kids weren’t aloud in the pool after 6pm.",3,2023,04,07
239,"Very Friendly staff , Beautiful Grounds. Let down by Swimming Area","TheKing size  room in Hunters Yard was lovely and spacious, bed extremely comfortable. 
All the staff are very friendly. The  restaurant attached to Hunters Yard felt a bit dated, food was fine. We found the sauna and steam rooms to be far too small   and the Ladies dressing room is  of a poor standard   , not at all  what You would expect for the prices charged.",4,2023,04,06
239,Nice hotel / service needs improvement ,"The grounds and facilities of the hotel you couldn’t fault. Service in the hound bar is nowhere near 5 star but. We ate here for lunch / dinner and both times left waiting to order and nobody comes over after your food is served to check if all is ok. Service is not up to standard from the staff / management for a 5 star hotel.  Pint served with about a quarter of it missing from glass. 

Also for the spa / leisure facilities you would think there would have been a jacuzzi. It’s advertised that kids are not allowed into the pool etc after 5pm. Loads of kids splashing around well after 5pm when we were there. We didn’t mind but this may not impress others considering the price you are paying. 

Hotel is kept very clean and the grounds and gardens are very nice. Cinema to use free of charge / bicycles and plenty more . Breakfast was very nice also plenty of choice. The hotel has potential with improvement on management in the hound bar.

Went to the 1776 bar beside the cinema and the difference in service and staff was substantial.",4,2023,04,02
239,Beautiful Afternoon ,Beautiful surroundings in a stunning location. very easy to spend and afternoon here. The afternoon tea was delicious with plenty of variety's of sandwiches and sweet treats. We will be back again! Wonderful time ,5,2023,03,30
239,Pleasant stay but overpriced,"We stayed in a junior suite which was very spacious with a big, comfortable bed. In the tea/coffee section, a few extra mugs and teaspoons would have been helpful. 

The en-suite was newly renovated and hosted a large shower, bath and a stunning Victorian basin.  However, the towels were hard and smelt bad. I expect clean and fluffy towels at a 5 star hotel. There was only one toilet roll in the bathroom on the first night for a family of 4 so we ran out before it was replaced. Also, while the bathroom was beautiful, there was no place for toiletries - a practical design feature that was omitted during the renovation. 

The grounds and the Manor House generally were beautiful. The house manager, Jimmy, was excellent and very welcoming but staff friendliness and general hospitality was inconsistent throughout our stay.

The Lady Helen restaurant was fantastic - the food, wine and service were top class. The amuse-bouche stole the show. 

The dressing rooms in the swimming pool were very disappointing. With only two tiny benches to change, I had to sit in a small toilet cubicle to dry and change my 9 month old baby after coming out of the pool as the benches were occupied. This was a big let-down for me. 

While the house was very accommodating in providing a babysitter for the two nights we were there, they did not provide the same babysitter for both nights (which we had requested). We were very happy with the sitter we had on night 1 and she told us she had been available to babysit the following night but the house had assigned someone else. This was very frustrating.

Overall, it was a pleasant stay but there is room for improvement. ",4,2023,03,21
239,Good but needs management attention.,"Arrived around 4pm and struggled to figure out if I was at the right place as the place is a golf course hotel and the names are not obvious.

Anyway, at check-in I reminded them that I was a Bonvoy Titanium member and wanted a nice room.  I was assured that I had a lovely room, only to discover that it was a regular room.  Fortunately, they quickly assigned me room 301, a large corner room which was very nice. Even had heated floor in the bathroom!

The staff quickly moved the welcome Prosecco and chocolates to the new room. Given how empty the hotel was, I don’t understand why they didn’t pre-assign an upgraded room or a “select suite.”

Had dinner at the hotel.  Surprised to discover that the were out of JW Black!  Food was good. Service excellent.

Next morning’s breakfast was good but not memorable.  The buffet doesn’t reflect “ Autograph Collection.”",4,2023,03,18
239,Incredible!,"What an amazing spot.   This is a 5 star hotel for sure. We had a beautiful room and it was a lush and lavish experience from the arrival, the beauty of the hotel, the quality of the room decorations and the lovely view on the courtyard.  Breakfast was served in a room that overlooked the estate and everything was top notch.   ",5,2023,03,18
239,Wonderful! ,"Fab hotel, really nice staff, amazing grounds, and brilliant food. Was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. 

Our room was spectacular to, King Suite River view in the Manor. Spacious and luxurious. 

We only ate in the hound as we had a baby with us, and it was really good. 

We will be back! ",5,2023,03,16
239,Top class hotel,"Super hotel. Fabulous staff, location,food rooms and  bar entertainment.  The rooms are big, comfortable and well planned. The staff were more than friendly and so helpful in every way. .Nice relaxed feel to the place. Would highly recommend. ",5,2023,03,14
239,Overnight Stay at Mount Juliet,"My wife and I stayed at Hunters Yard at Mount Juliet on March 7th.  We had an excellent experience - the accommodation, food and general ambience was superb.  The staff were friendly, courteous and professional.  Overall, we felt that the trip was excellent value-for-money.  We would have no hesitation in recommending the hotel.",5,2023,03,13
239,Recent visit to Mount Juliet,Myself and my husband stayed in Mount Juliet  last Friday night. (March 2nd) From the moment we arrived we were treated by their friendly yet professional staff. We stayed in hunters yard and our room was on the ground floor with easy access to reception. We dined in the Lady Helen Restaurant which was a hugely memorable experience.  The staff were lovely and all dietary requests were accompanied. I truly couldn’t fault anything. We had breakfast delivered to the room. The food was great and everything we ordered arrived perfectly. I hope to return to Mount Juliet very soon!!,5,2023,03,12
239,First trip,"Just returned from a 3 night stay with my wife and 7 month old child. Staff throughout the hunters yard ,manor house and clubhouse couldn't have been more helpful,friendly and professional. We stayed in the hunters yard we had a beautiful room and the hotel was spotless throughout. Breakfast was great each morning. This was our first few nights away in over a year and to be honest apart apart from all the positives above we were disappointed to learn on arrival about certain  areas of the hotel been closed and the golf course. Why this disappointed us so much is that I had rang a few days beforehand to see was the hotel fully functional by the staff who answerd the phone .it  was expensive to stay the few days and we wanted everything to be right . Great staff tho ",3,2023,03,11
239,Fantastic stay and excellent value for money,"Three of us stayed at Mount Juliet last week availing of one of their superb mid week deals.  The accommodation was luxurious - but beds, excellent sheets.  The staff were super friendly and helpful.  The food was utterly amazing.  We took a long walk before breakfast and the grounds are amazing.  Great value for money and a luxurious experience.  We're booking two nights next year!",5,2023,03,01
239,5 star experience,Once we checked in the service from the staff was top class . Always friendly and willing to help . Nothing was too much to ask . The room was spacious and comfortable. The food at the hound was 5 star ⭐️. The breakfast at the Manor House was excellent 👌🏻. ,5,2023,02,20
239,"Nice hotel, shame about the bath!","Very nice hotel plus golf/equestrian complex where I stayed in one of the large and comfortable rooms in a converted stable block. Loses one star, however, for the extremely underwhelming bathtub to which I retired during the evening... It turned out firstly to be too small for anyone aside from a lebrecaun to properly submerge themselves in and secondly to be impossible to fill with hot water because the mixer tap boasted maximum setting of ""lukewarm.""",4,2023,02,16
239,A must visit!,"Really big clean rooms with stylish decor and a bath. Great pool, spa facilities. And a gym. The food in hunters yard was 10/10 dinner (steak and the deserts)and breakfast had a large buffet choice and table service hot breakfast. Lovely cocktails beside the fire after dinner. Scenic walks around the gardens too!",5,2023,02,13
239,Disappointing- not a 5 star spa ,"My friend and I went for massages as a treat. We booked via email and the commutation was terrible with one word answers on emails and no greetings etc. we did hesitate but decided we’d go ahead anyway. We had to book the pool separately to use before treatment, which is unusual  for a 5 star. We had to buy hats for pool and the pool had a lot of chlorine, we found unusual again for a 5 star. The treatment itself was fabulous and however afterwards there is no relaxation area and your handed a cheap gift bag with plastic bottle water from Lidl. We were disappointed and while the treatment was lovely, there is no value in it. ",3,2023,02,03
239,Gail Flynn,"We had the most fabulous stay for a special occasion recently and It was a lovely experience. The ambience,the rooms,the setting and the tasting menu was just unreal,we didn't leave a bit of it. 
The staff were so friendly and knowledgeable about both the food and the wine, and then to top it off -breakfast was just as nice followed by a lovely walk in the grounds. It was a lovely treat and I can't wait to visit again.",5,2023,01,31
239,Good. But not 5 star,"I went with my wife and son for an overnight it was ok. Staff friendly. Lunch was nice. Dinner my steak was over cooked I asked for medium l, expected it to be perfect being a 5 star restaurant. Not a deal breaker. No jacuzzi which was disappointing. Menu for dinner isn’t the best. Only veg they do is brassed cabbage, so no vegetables with my dinner. Breakfast was ok plenty of choice . They forgot to book dinner for us but they sorted it. Overall it was ok but I expected better for what we paid. Had far better quality in 3 star or 4 hotels. We paid €440 for one night, was it worth it?… no. Paid €310 in another 4 star hotel and it was out of this world. I would rate mount juliet 3.7 star at best.",3,2023,01,29
239,Stunning in winter,"I attended a wedding in December set amongst the beautiful Christmas decorations. The main house is absolutely gorgeous and the staff very welcoming whether in the formal rooms at ground level or downstairs in the cellar rooms.
The wedding dinner in Hunters Lodge was fabulous and again everything went like clockwork. The staff are particularly obliging.
The bedrooms in Hunters Lodge aren’t huge but are very comfortable particularity if  you have a countryside view. Beautiful trees!  
We will be back for our 4th visit soon!",5,2023,01,16
239,Eddie in the clubhouse went above and beyond,"We had a beautiful family wedding here in December 2022. The grounds, hotel, staff and food were beautiful. We had a fabulous stay and everyone had a ball. 

A Particular mention must go to Eddie, the manager in the clubhouse. Unfortunately for him he bumped into us in Thomastown the day after the wedding when we were unable to get taxis back to the hotel. He went above and beyond to find someone to taxi our whole party back when he really didn’t need to. Many thanks to Eddie, his wife and the lovely girl in the clubhouse who helped us out too. It is staff like Eddie that make stays in hotels extra memorable. 

Looking forward to a return stay soon.",5,2023,01,13
239,Perfect Christmas stay,"Our family just finished up our 4 day Christmas stay here and I am sad to leave.   The staff here are wonderful and incredibly welcoming.  They were so kind and thoughtful and we felt at home right away.  

Food - the food here was amazing!  It was the main reason I chose this place over others and it did not disappoint.  Everything tasted fresh, homemade and well done.  I am very glad I packed my stretchy pants for this visit.  One of my favorite things is the dessert trolly at the end of each dinner.  

Room - We stayed in 2 junior suites and they were large and very comfortable.  

Property - The entire property is beautiful.  We played at the playground, took archery lessons, swam at the pool and had a trail ride.  

This was the first Christmas since having children where I felt relaxed (my oldest is 14)!",5,2022,12,27
239,Wonderful Winter Wedding,"We stayed here for 2 nights for a family wedding and we were blown away by the whole experience!
The first night we stayed in Hunters Yard, for some pre-wedding day drinks and food with close family/friends and it is such a magical place, especially at Christmas - I highly recommend visiting at this time of year! 
The only thing we both noticed was that there are very few signs on the way to the hotel so it's a little tricky when it's night time/dark as the country roads are so narrow and the turn appears out of nowhere (even with our satnav on!) Even driving up the grounds toward the hotel is a bit confusing so I think it could help to have some more signposts for guests.

We had food and drinks in the Hound Restaurant and Saddle Bar. Staff were super friendly and attentive. Absolute must-try: the Guinness brown bread. I would have happily eaten a whole loaf!
It was really quiet and relaxed the night we were here (a Wednesday) which was lovely.

The room was gorgeous, it had all the amenities (and then some). The mini fridge was stocked with 2 large 750ml bottles of water. The bathroom floor was heated!! Incredible joy upon realising this on the middle of the night bathroom visit while it was minus degree temperatures outside! The bed & pillows were so comfy and even though it was a late night I had a fabulous sleep. We ordered breakfast room service and it was delivered on time which I was incredibly pleased by (so many hotels deliver earlier than the time requested) and everything was super hot and freshly prepared.

After breakfast, we moved over to the Manor House (the location for the wedding) where we would be staying that night. Staff were so helpful and informative on this and advised us the night before that if we were running late or worried to just leave our bags in the room (packed) and they would bring them across for us. We managed to be ahead of time and bring them across ourselves. Checking in at the Manor House was as easy as the night before (we had already checked in for both nights but just needed to collect our new keys etc). I was blown away by the Manor House. So classic and old school, no lifts just beautiful staircases and so gorgeously decorated for Christmas, honestly the perfect backdrops for wedding photos! The wonderful porter (I think his name might have been Thomas, I'm so sorry I can't recall, as he was just so lovely) insisted on carrying our bags for us, which was so helpful as we happened to be on the top floor. He was so friendly and chatted with us the whole way. Absolute gentleman! 

The room was just amazing. We had such a huge space; living area, bedroom and huge bathroom. The design is so vintage and elegant, it felt like living in a fairytale. Again, it had all the amenities, including a Nescafe machine and a lovely selection of pods. The bed & pillows were so comfy and snug. 

The whole day went so smoothly for the lovely Bride & Groom which we were so thankful for, the manager Jimmy was excellent and so attentive, he called to the Bridal Suite a number of times to check on everything and keep the bride informed of timelines etc. He was friendly and jovial with us and the other wedding guests all day, right up until we moved down to the private bar after dinner. The food was incredible, very fancy, as you'd expect from a Michelin-starred restaurant, all so well cooked and flavoured. Staff were so organised, every person on the table was served at the exact same time as staff lined up behind us and placed plates in unison. Minute details that make all the difference. 

The underground 'nightclub' area, 1757, was such a unique and cool surprise for the after-dinner party. It feels like a really cool speakeasy! Another special shoutout to Vincent, the barman, he was attentive and so much fun. We all had the best day & night and throughout the whole stay staff could not have been more helpful, attentive or pleasant. There was a shuttle service, on demand, for any guests staying over at Hunters Yard. It was an incredible experience and one I would highly recommend to anyone considering a unqiue wedding venue or even a private function. 

Absolutely incredible! I will absolutely be returning for another stay.",5,2022,12,16
239,Top Class Service,We had not stayed in Mount Juilet since 2005 but the service is still as good as it was then. The Staff are top class. We stayed in the Manor House which is special and where we had a super breakfast with a view of the river. The previous evening we dined in the Hunter's Yard Restaurant and again the service was excellent. The meal was good but maybe the menu could have had more variety particularly for vegetarians.,4,2022,12,16
239,Beautiful Property,"We stayed at this stunning property at the end of November for my husband's birthday. Overall, it was a great stay and we enjoyed ourselves. This property is huge and it is beautifully decorated. We were greeted with a bellboy who helped us with our luggage immediately. The lady at the front desk (unfortunately did not get her name but she had glasses on and was there throughout our stay in the afternoon until 11pm) was very friendly and accommodating. She was a great help during our stay. We had a room in the Manor's House. There were some slight electricity problems but it did not bother us at all.. The car service throughout the property was a nice touch, especially when it gets cold and rainy. Nice walks around the property.
 
We dined at all the outlets in the property. Afternoon tea was lovely. We had a nice spread and the lady changed some sandwiches for me as I was pregnant. The service in the bar was impeccable, very attentive. The only bad experience was in The Hound. We dined there twice, both times we had the dry aged rib eye. The sauces were served cold which was not to our liking.. Second time we were there we also had the mushroom risotto but the mushrooms were already sour and I threw up in the middle of the night...

We dined at Lady Helen and had a nice corner table. We loved this room and the subtle decorations. Service in Lady Helen was great and the waiter and waitress could speak to us in French which was nice. It was stated that I am pregnant and they would adapt my menu. However, some dishes were not.. Especially the cheese plate. It was not so much of a problem but as a michelin star fine dining restaurant, we expected more thought to be put into that.. Breakfast was lovely, the service was cheerful and it was a very nice selection. 

We enjoyed the spa area as well. It was located at the Hunter's Yard but the car service dropped us there whenever we wanted to go there. The changing and shower area can be cleaner. The showers were stuck and not very clean.. 

We left the property relatively early at 7:30am in the morning. I have to say this.. The lady at the reception (not the lady who checked us in) was not helpful at all. We left our luggage at the reception before going to breakfast. She did not stand up or even greet us at all. No help with our luggage, we had 3 pieces of luggage. After breakfast, I returned the room key. She did not bother to ask anything about our stay, ask anything nor help us with our luggage. This was an awful way to end our stay. She did not even stand up or help us with our luggage on the way out... 

With that being said, we will definitely still come back again. But the management should definitely put in a word to that lady at the reception..",4,2022,12,09
239,Best accidental find ever!!!,"I could write a long winded story about how completely enchanting Mount Juliet is, how staff members like Johnathan, the 2 Paul's, Brian and Vincent make you feel like you're long lost and dearly missed family members they haven't seen in years, or that the Micheline Star restaurant is nothing short of excellent and the immaculately kept grounds and Nicklaus golf course is fairytale-esk, but I wont. I will simply same this; it was one of the best 50 hour vacations I have ever had and I seriously can not wait to go back. It is a very special place and you have to go and stay there to know what I mean. Thank you for the wonderful vacation within our vacation.",5,2022,12,08
239,Mount Juliet,"We had the most beautiful visit to Mount Juliet.The staff were most welcoming and the hospitality was magnificent. Our meal was unbelievably good ,our accomodation perfect and the overall friendliness of the entire staff was exceptional. Hats off to the chef.... Amazingly good ribeye steak. Really looking forward to our next visit. Marcella and John.",5,2022,11,30
239,A wonderful stay,"This was our third stay at Mount Juliet and it won't be out last.  Such an amazing hotel.  We have stayed in Hunters Lodge which is beautiful.  The rooms are so well appointed and spotlessly clean.  The food is beautiful and service excellent.  All of the staff are so friendly and helpful - really adding to a perfect break.  Looking forward to our next one!

239,Beautiful location,"A lovely location. Really well decorated, very fresh and fantastic food. Rooms are perfectly appointed. The best hotel I’ve stayed in the south east of Ireland, Service could be a little sharper - would be my only challenge.",5,2022,11,12
239,"Beautiful , relaxing, very friendly staff","Very friendly staff, perfect and lots of choices for breakfast in lactosefree! 
Beautiful estate, nice surroundings and ideal to recharge your batteries. 
Easy trips to visit Ireland from here .
The first room was not well cleaned but solved immediately and they offered a new room that made our trip just perfect.",5,2022,11,12
239,Won’t be returning!,"The reason we picked this hotel and the Manor House is that we believed it was newly refurbished. Unfortunately only the bathroom was to the expected standard. The room was large but dated with stains on the furniture and carpet. There was no minibar, no radio, not even a pen to fill out the room service options. No USB ports to charge our phones. The bar is not at all warm or welcoming with a lovely new bar downstairs only available for private functions. Breakfast was disappointing, no buffet selection for fruits, berries, cereals etc. we did have a glass, why a glass I don’t understand, of fruit, but the selection in the glass was poor. Lunch was equally as disappointing. We paid €1,060 for 2 nights  b&b, a high end 5 star price for a mediocre 4 star offering",1,2022,11,11
239,Fab 2 day break,"Hotel is just so relaxing, great facilities, kids club so good and one my son keeps asking to go back to. Thanks to all your staff in kids club. Lisa looked after my booking and initial check in, everything went seamless. Only criticism I would have is on busy times hard to get booking for food. We were just 2 (me and my son) - golf club was booked out, main restaurant booked out….room service it was, but was still great. Can’t wait to return",5,2022,11,05
239,Mostly a great experience but a couple of things we were disappointed with,"Mostly a great experience but a couple of things we were disappointed with. 
The positives:
-the breakfast was out of this world. The selection of food was amazing the cooked breakfast was so tasty and the service was brilliant. 
-the grounds were stunning, we took a walk up to the Manor House and it was so picturesque 
-the doorman David was so friendly and helpful
-the overall decor and feel of the place was stunning and everywhere smelled amazing 

The negatives:
-really there was only one negative and that was dinner in the hound. I think for the price we paid, we did not get the experience we had hoped for. From the get go when we came to the restaraunt there was more kids than we were expecting, however it was midterm so understandable and not the restaraunts fault. But we were celebrating my birthday and our anniversary which I had told the hotel about in advance. We were seated right next to a door which led to the outside which was constantly being opened and closed it was so cold! They brought our steaks and gave us both the wrong ones, again not a big deal but we had to swap over ourselves after figuring out. And then they brought us the wrong desserts. Some waiters were better than others but the overall vibe just wasn’t great for the money we paid.
-the leisure centre was packed with kids, not what you expect from a 5 star hotel, again mid term! So not the hotels fault but maybe they could have a designated time for kids during school holidays so that other people could get the enjoyment from it too. 
-the maid service knocked on our door twice in the morning time even though we were checking out. I just don’t see the point in disturbing people in the morning when you know they are checking out that day!

239,mixed feelings,"We stayed at Hunter's Yard. Let us start with the positive aspects:
+ the food was really good in the evening
+ breakfast was delicious as well
+ service was brilliant in the restaurant (Hound), especially Mary was amazing, so professional, friendly and always a recommendation on hand for things to do
+ the estate itself is well maintained and gorgeous
+ bellman David was more than welcoming and helpful upon arrival
+service at the clubhouse was extremely friendly as well
+ food at the clubhouse was also very good
+ the pool Is nice
+ hotel itself is beautifully furbished 

the negatives mostly evolve around the room

- the room was way too dark, the fact that one light wasn't working, didn't help
- the mattresses need to be replaced asap, putting a blanket underneath the sheets does not make up for the matresses' poor condition
- the foldaway bed for our son was more a hammock than anything else. Cannot believe that a child over 10 could comfortably sleep on it

 the biggest issue was the houskeeping:
-  one day they didn't come at all
- the glass top of the desk has not been wiped down once during our 6 day stay, 
- sometimes the day blanket, pillows were not placed on the bed but remained on the floor 
- the floor of the bathroom has not once been vacuumed during our stay. it was clean when we arrived, but after 6 nights there were obviously quite a lot of our hair on the floor, nobody cleaned that 
- the tub was cleaned only once to maybe twice . once there were our son's small toys in the tub and it obviously was too much trouble to remove those 5 things from the tub since our son's blue bath gel was still in the tub and on the side of the tub  (this remained there until our son's next bath), tub was then again not cleaned, blue bath gel again remained for another day, until we took another bath (that blue color of the gel is extremely easy to remove, only have to rinse it once)
- I am not sure if there usually is supposed to be a turn down service, we had one, but only once, which was confusing
- quite a lot of cobwebs between desk and wall, no reason not to clean it, there's probably 30cm space between the desk and the wall, could easily be reached 

I think there were a couple of people from housekeeping who at least really tried, room was made up quite nicely once, but the rest seemed disinterested in the guest, also when met in the hall. 

I do believe that it would have been a better idea to stay at the main house and even though we were not at all happy with housekeeping we absolutely loved the people in the restaurant and during breakfast. They are very professional and extraordinarily welcoming and friendly!",3,2022,11,02
239,Mount Juliet Estate Ireland,"Check in:
Awkward.

Room: 
A bottle of prosecco was in room, would have been a nice touch except for the fact that the prosecco was in a bucket of room temperature water. The little box of chocolates was a nice touch.  

Multiple stains all over the carpet in the room was off-putting. Each time you walked anywhere near the wardrobe it shook very hard making an unsettling noise.

Breakfast: 
Lovely breakfast options,  fresh, tasty. Molly was sweet.

Grounds:
Beautiful

239,Simply stunning,"We stayed 4 nights in the Hunter's Yard at Mount Juliet Estate and we were delighted. We had friends staying at the Mannerhouse and we decided we were better off at the Yard as it was close to the ""cheaper"" restaurant and the Spa!  The room was delightful (except was lacking in shelve or drawer space - four days calls for quite some clothes for us women!) and we enjoyed the very friendly atmosphere of the staff. We even received a bottle of bubbly when someone found out it was our wedding anniversay! Thank you all.  The grounds are stunning as well and I'm sure golfers much really appreciate the hard work in upkeeping such impressive grounds.",5,2022,10,28
239,A 5 Star Hotel with a 3 Star Service,"For a 5 star hotel, we were quite disappointed with the level of service we have received so far. 
We went for a visit up to the Manor House for a drink when we arrived. There was a wedding arriving shortly afterwards so we were instructed to go down to the hotel after we finished our drinks. This was understandable but the manor in which ALL staff approached it was beyond rude. 
So we decided to go down to the Sandle Bar for our lunch while awaiting our rooms to be ready. The staff again were extremely rude and in no way professional in their manner. They had very little options behind the bar and for any dietary requirements for a 5 star hotel. We received our food and requested cutlery numerous times as they were forgotten about. I would imagine cutlery on a table is standard in a 3 star hotel once you have placed your order. A member of staff eventually came back but just with 2 sets of cutlery for a table of 5. Which just started the cutlery request all over again. The food was fine.
Upon checking in, we had to go out in the lashings of rain to our cars only to find that there were no umberellas and the concierge had gone home for the day at 4pm check in time. Maybe I am silly but thats like sending the chef home at dinner time. 
The only saving grace is that rooms are quite nice and clean. As business people, we pride ourselves on keeping a happy staff.  It is evident to see that the staff are very inexperienced and maybe unhappy in their environment. This has definitely been the worst '5 star' hotel we have ever stayed in and this is our 4th 5 star breakaway this year. We never complain and have never wrote a review on trip advisor before, I think this says enough.

239,"Incredibly helpful and warm staff, great location and amenities","We were traveling from Dublin to Killarney and so were only able to stay here for a single night, but what a lovely night it was.  The grounds themselves are full of walking paths (baby pheasants!) and we had a lovely afternoon exploring.  We had booked breakfast before we arrived but decided we wanted to have dinner on site and the staff were wonderful about helping us decide where to go and making arrangements for us - the food was lovely.  At the hotel, the rooms (and views are lovely, but the best part of the experience was the staff itself.  From welcoming us when we arrived to pointing out good walking paths to helping my husband take care of me when I was a bit under the weather the next day, the staff were kind and responsive and no one more so than Jimmy, the General Manager.  It's a bit of a trek to get there but we'd go back just to be so well taken care.",5,2022,10,07
239,World Class Service In A Pristine Historic Location,"We made the most of our visit to Mount Juliet: breakfast, dinner in Lady Helen, food and drinks in every option, walks and a picnic on the grounds, massages in the spa and exploring nearby activities. Every interaction with the hotel and staff was flawless.  Exceptional among the outstanding staff was Maryann who was effortlessly everywhere, befriending every guest and anticipating our needs. 

We stayed in the Manor House. Beforehand I was concerned it would feel dated, on the contrary it felt perfectly preserved but still historic, as if it had been built yesterday. Our room was spacious with a large luxurious bathroom down a small staircase. 

The breakfast was a ""buffet at your table"" with delicious choices all for the asking. Lady Helen's 9 course tasting menu was remarkable. The grounds were beautiful and peaceful. We stayed during the week and it was as if we had the Manor House to ourselves. Unfortunately you may need to book meals and spa treatment months in advance, especially if the hotel is occupied by a large group such as a wedding party, but the staff was quite helpful with navigating this.",5,2022,10,02
239,First Class in all respects,"Beautiful hotel, stunning views, great service, outstanding food. Mark and his whole team provide an outstanding tailored experience for your needs and requirements. Nothing is too much trouble and they give you exactly what you need and when you require it. The ambience is fantastic and the whole experience is one that makes you want to return again and again! All round first class!!",5,2022,09,20
239,A Lovely Experience ,"Beautiful Estate - My partner ia golf mad and I bought him this stay for his Birthday along with a round of golf. The hotel itself and our room were beautiful, the staff were very friendly and the golf course (according to him) was a superb golf course. My only problem (and a minor one at that) was the transport to and from Kilkenny City. It was about 25 minutes by taxi to Kilkenny, and taxi's were hard to get. A courtesy bus or taxi would be perfect here. Other than that, we really liked Mount Juliet. ",4,2022,09,14
239,Stay and play - 5 stars ⭐️,"Stayed 2 nights and played 3 rounds of golf, simply fantastic. The clubhouse, the hound, golf, bedrooms, swimming pool and service all 5 stars.  Everything was perfect and booking again for next year with a bigger group. 
Few lads from Cork",5,2022,09,10
239,Beautiful place,"Spectacular grounds. Stayed here for two nights to explore the area but also indulged in all of the on site amenities and options ranging from golf, fly fishing, spa, equestrian, tea, etc, etc. Every member of the staff was so welcoming and helpful.  5 stars all around with the exception of the food. It was a star below expectations given how amazing the rest of the resort was. ",5,2022,09,03
239,Outstanding comfort and service,"We regretted only being able to stay one night....we have stayed in many good hotels across the world and this stands comfortably alongside them. 
Comfort, ambience and quality of staff all excellent. Not cheap but worth every penny",5,2022,09,03
239,Very Accommodating Hosts,"We were traveling through Ireland and had booked a night's stay at the Mount Juliet Estate. Unfortunately, I fell ill and we had to cancel all of our plans and fly home. The hosts at Mount Juliet were very understanding and canceled our booking without penalty.  We will definitely plan to stay at Mount Juliet when we return one day!",5,2022,09,03
239,Marriott 4 Star Hotel at 5 star price with a twist,"I booked a two night stay Sunday and Monday.... to play golf on the estate Golf Course.....was excited to stay in the Manor and enjoy the dining in a Michelin restaurant.....was very disappointed to find out that my 240 Euro ($300) a night bought me a room in the Hunters Yard (what I rate as a 4 Star) Marriott Hotel (and the Michelin Restaurant at the Manor was closed on  Monday)...... I guess I didn't understand that the Manor was separate and not my lodging...Good Marketing!!! My 7.am  Irish breakfast was served cold on a cold plate with rock hard black and white pudding.... Irish Pubs in the US serve better.... Dinner was excellent but again served on a cold plate... Cleanliness was excellent overall except for the Toilet in my Bathroom....not pretty...under rim not cleaned in a very long time...not acceptable..The overall experience was not a luxury hotel but the grounds are superb....it is not easy to get to the property because of narrow winding back-roads...property is remote.... and certainly not worth the effort or price...... In hindsight, if  I paid $500+ per night for a room at the Manor (if available), it would have been as advertised.... That will teach me a lesson!!! Golf Course was empty until about 10.30 so I got some great golfing time. Watch out for the ground staff as they ignore you and don't step back to let you play....poorly trained. Had wonderful weather and  the estate is magical.  I am an experienced traveler..... Fool me once and shame on me!!!!",3,2022,09,03
239,Easy Paradise on the Emerald Isle,"My family of five (kids 10, 7, 5) enjoyed the pleasure of a weeklong stay at Mount Juliet in a Rose Garden Lodge we booked via Airbnb. We also met up with some friends who stayed at the Hunter’s Yard on property at the same time. Mount Juliet is spectacular - rolling hills, trails, golf, river, etc. I reached out to the estate in advance of our stay in an attempt to book some activities like pool time (this needed to be pre-booked because of Covid-19), Kids Club, fishing, and golf. Cíaran O’Dwyer, a guest experience manager, reached out immediately and stayed in tofu with me for several months to ensure everything went smoothly. 

Over the course of our stay we enjoyed both a full round of golf (just after Mt Juliet hosted the Irish Open!), golf lessons for the the kids (so much fun with a simulator), lake fishing (there’s also fly-fishing for folks with more patience/experience), horseback riding on property with MJ Stables, falconry with Hawkeye Falconry at the Lyrath Estate (if all participants are aged 10+ this can be done at Mt Juliet), massages at the Spa, many afternoons at the swimming pool, dinner at Michelin rated Lady Helen while the kids were in Kids Club, dinner at the Hound, multiple meals at the Clubhouse, and lunch/high tea at the Manor House. Suffice to say we experienced almost everything the property had to offer and can’t wait to return some day for more! We also enjoyed excursions into Thomastown as well as to nearby Jerpoint Monastery and Kilkenny city.

Our stay here was part of a multi-week European vacation to the UK and France, but the children can’t stop gushing about Ireland and Mount Juliet.",5,2022,08,31
239,Pleasant Surprise!,"We only booked a couple of days at the estate as we were exploring Ireland. We now wish we'd stayed here longer. Our room in the Manor House was comfortable and elegant. Our son stayed in the Hunter's Yard and it was also a very nice room. We loved the grounds and the horseback riding. Dinner at Lady Helen was phenominal and an experience we thoroughly enjoyed. Food at the golf club and the other restauarant was also very good. The staff everywhere was very helpful and attentive. We will definitely make an attempt to return for the golf, fishing and archery",5,2022,08,30
239,Excellent,"I love Mount Juliet. We have stayed here many times over last 20+ years. We love the ambience. The staff are first class, pleasant and attentive without being over bearing. The Manor House is superb and the other accommodation is also great, with very comfortable beds and well appointed rooms. 
The golf course is top class and a great challenge. Francis is a stalwart in the golf reception  and is always very welcoming",5,2022,08,30
239,Superb,I have golfed and stayed here several times post Covid and love the place. Staff are pleasant and attentive. Rooms are comfortable and well appointed. Beds are really comfortable. The whole place has a nice feel about it. Dinner was good and there was plenty of choice for breakfast.,5,2022,08,29
239,Wonderful Staycation,"We had a really lovely time at Mount Juliet. Curious about what the grounds were like we asked if we could be shown around. Head Porter John brought us around the estate on a golf buggy on a beautiful sunny day. He was extremely knowledgable about the history of the estate as well as current uses of Hunters Yard and The Manor House. Chloe was thrilled to see the hound puppies. 
Shane was great with us attempting archery and we were escorted to and from the activities by good buggy or courtesy car. 
We were close enough to drive to Kilkenny for an afternoon city break and catch up with some friends. 
Food was very nice, lovely swimming pool, tennis courts and pool room - plenty to keep us occupied. 
And they even managed to arrange a heatwave for us! 
We will certainly be back.",5,2022,08,25
239,Fantastic Experience - Well Cared for - Gorgeous Property,"We had a fabulous experience at the Mt. Juliet Estate. Weary from travel and the hustle and bustle, the Estate was a wonderful and luxurious way to unwind.  My husband and two children and I enjoyed the grounds immensely and took advantage of the many walking paths.  I had a wonderful spa experience and the kids loved the pool! The food at The Hound was excellent.
On our checkout day, we found our rental car had a nail in our tire - the front desk team went above and beyond to find a local repair shop open on a Sunday to assist us and even provided a personal air compressor from a staff members car to get our tire driveable.  We will be back for sure!",5,2022,08,23
239,Memorable overnight stay,"I stayed here with my daughter for her birthday.  We had afternoon tea in the Manor House which was delicious and very reasonably priced for children. 
Our room in the Hunters Yard was beautifully decorated and spotless.
Breakfast and room service was excellent. 
Every staff member was friendly and helpful. 
We will definitely be back.",5,2022,08,21
239,#marriott #bonvoy remove this property from your portfolio it’s not to your standards,Booked nearly 6 months in advance a junior suite with a balcony but on arrival was given a ground floor room in the “other” hotel on property which had only a portable AC unit hanging out the open window. Adding insult to injury I was informed for the two nights I was staying there were no reservations available for the restaurant in my hotel even though I had booked well in advance and was staying in the property.  Upon my protest a request was supposedly made to management and the chef for our second night.  No joy!  Also no consideration given to my Marriott status.  Basically tough luck so needless to say we won’t be back and will be scrutinizing Autograph collection properties more strenuously in the future.  #bonvoy #marriott #autographcollection #dontstayhere,1,2022,08,19
239,Perfect kickoff to our Ireland adventure!,"A bit late to this review, but we stayed two nights at Hunter's Yard in July and had a wonderful stay. The grounds were beautiful, the rooms were super comfortable and we had great experiences exploring the quaint Thomastown and Kells Priory while there. But the staff went above and beyond during our stay and I wanted to recognize that. We were without our luggage for the first day of our trip (thanks to the airline), but once they were located, the staff was so helpful in helping navigate the courier to deliver our bags from the Dublin airport.  I specifically wanted to call out one of the bellman, Martin was his name I believe. He was so friendly, helped make the best of a stressful start to our 2 week trip and even offered to drive out and meet them since the courier got lost trying to find the resort. We also booked a lovely hour of horse riding at the adjacent MJ Equestrian, which was amazing as well. Highly recommend Mount Juliet and look forward to returning in the future!",5,2022,08,18
239,The perfect place to escape to,"The most beautiful hotel we have stayed in. From the moment we booked our stay the staff went above and beyond to ensure our stay was perfect. 
Then from the moment we arrived the staff were exceptionally attentive and very friendly. The walls around the estate were stunning. The room we had was so beautiful. The food in the restaurants was amazing. I could not recommend this hotel highly enough. We can’t wait to book our next stay.",5,2022,08,16
239,The best luxury estate we stayed in Ireland,"Unprecedented customer focus and 5 star service. We very much enjoyed our stay at the Mount Julliet Estate. We had two rooms of which one was in the Manor House and the other one in the Hunters Yard hotel. We liked the Manor House slightly more as it has such beautiful bar and dining rooms. The Hunters Yard is also more designed for Golfers. The manager, I think his name was Jimmy, gave us lots of great recommendations for things to do as well made every wish we had become true, inclusive lovely movie evening in the Manor House private cinema. Had we known how nice this estate is, we would have surely stayed longer. It was by far the best of the four different hotels we stayed in Ireland. Thanks a lot to the service team of the estate!",5,2022,08,16
239,Incredible Venue,We had a wonderful stay at Mount Juliet.. Golf course is brilliant and the Spa treatments I highly recommend 🙌 Stunning grounds with breathtaking views for walks.. Hotel is so clean and staff very friendly and accommodating.. Highly recommend and we most definitely will be back for another stay ☺️,5,2022,08,08
239,Relaxed luxury in the Manor House ,"Having stayed almost a decade ago, we returned to the Manor House in Mt Juliet for a night away recently. The house is beautiful and meticulously maintained, as are the grounds. Service was excellent, yet not over the top as might be the case in other high-end hotels. Lovely relaxed vibe around the place. 

Enjoyed a treatment in the treatment rooms and a trip to the pool before an aperitivo on the lawn and a beautiful meal in Lady Helen. A delicious breakfast and walk around the walled gardens topped off a fabulous night away. Look forward to returning. 

The only negative is probably the lack of a full spa to relax in. ",4,2022,08,07
239,A Tale of Two Hotels,"I am a Bonvoy Titanium member so I stay in Autograph Collection properties quite a bit. 

This hotel is really two different properties. One is the lovely Manor Estate House, which is really nice, high end and quite Irish. The other is the Hunter's Yard property which is just an average hotel by any standards. 

The Mount Juliet would not upgrade us for our stay. We wanted to stay an entire week but they would not upgrade our room. So, we decided to move on after two nights and we are really glad we did. When we notified the front desk that we were moving on they did upgrade us for the last night. The first night was in Hunter's Yard and it was mediocre at best. The food, the room, the view, everything was sort of like staying in an OK but not special motel somewhere. 

The second night was exceptional in the Mount Juliet Manor house. The view, the room, the breakfast, the staff, etc. were all wonderful. 

The difference between the two areas or properties is VERY significant and not really worthy to be compared. 

If you can stay in the estate home then this property is worth it. If in the Hunters Yard then just move on and find another place to stay that is either cheaper or nicer. 

The golf course looked nice though I was not able to play it. 

Overall, our stay was only fair even with the upgraded night. The staff was nice in both areas but the service in the Manor was really good. 

We moved on and stayed at the K-Club and it was AWESOME!!! No comparison for just a little more and the golf courses at K-Club were fantastic!!!!",3,2022,08,06
239,Beautiful Estate,"Mount Juliet is one of the most relaxing hotels I have ever stayed in. The beautiful country estate is complimented by the restaurants,rooms and golf course. The staff are friendly and courteous. We have stayed on numerous occasions over the last 9 years. The more recent developments have been very sympathetic to the history and overall ambience of the estate. Any minor flaws are offset by the overall peacefulness and beauty of the surroundings.
My only recent concern is that the music from the new residents bar in the cellar of the Manor House is very audible in the Majors Bar. I appreciate than a Georgian house lacks modern soundproofing but it does interfere a little with the relaxing atmosphere of the Manor House.",5,2022,08,04
239,Do NOT BOOK! CANCELLED OUR RESERVATION 2 weeks before our trip!,"After much time and research in November 2021, we booked our final two nights in Ireland for our 60th Birthdays in July 2022 at Mount Juliet Estate. Imagine our dismay to receive an email requesting a phone call to CANCEL our reservation on June 16, 2022! DO NOT BOOK AT THIS HOTEL IF YOU WANT TO BE SURE YOU WILL STILL HAVE A ROOM.  

We were told on the call that someone had 'booked the entire hotel' (our reservations were made in November) and our reservation was cancelled! They said they could make arrangements at another hotel and would get us a discounted rate and have something in our room and pay for a dinner. After checking the website of the other hotel - we found the room suggested to be a regular, modern hotel room, not the Historic Manor House Room we had planned at Mount Juliet Estate. We asked about a Manor House Room at the new property, Lyrath Estate. Unfortunately, the Director of Rooms at Mount Juliet did not reply for several days, and after more time and research, booked a Manor House Room at Lyrath Estate ourselves. We are now less than two weeks away from leaving for our""Trip of a Lifetime"" and a bit panicked about finding something nice so close to the date! 

We never received another communication from anyone at Mount Juliet, despite numerous email inquiries. BOOK THE LYRATH ESTATE MANOR HOUSE ROOMS. Do not bother with a property who cares so little for guests as to cancel less than a month out. Turns out, the Manor House Room at the Lyrath was the largest and most beautiful of our entire trip - but were not booked by anyone at Mount Juliet. We were given an 80 euro ""credit"" for one dinner - which we had to verify with the Lyrath Estate. Apparently, quite a few of their guests that week also had their reservations abruptly cancelled by Mount Juliet. 

Perhaps, if the Director of Rooms had not completely ignored our emails after we let them know we had gone ahead and booked our own Manor House room, I wouldn't still be angry. Thankfully, the Lyrath Estate exceeded our expectations and our last two nights in Ireland were lovely and memorable. No thanks to the Unprofessional behavior of Mount Juliet Estate. Run away from booking here if you want to be sure you will still have a booking!",1,2022,07,30
239,"beautiful hotel, poor customer service though","we have stayed 3 night in mount Juliet . the hotel is beautiful and serenity is gorgeous,  it is the shame that the employees of the hotel are not very nice and customer service is not 5 star at all. you dont see any employees smiles at you or even do their job properly forget about going beyond which you expect from 5 star hotel.

we asked 3 times 3 different things from room service and the answer was always no, we even asked for Firm pillow and not only they didnt have they even forget to call us back and inform the guest. 
upon arrival no one even told us there is mannor and it is restaurants. ( the main building you see every where in images, remember mostly you wont stay there ,you wi end up booking hunter building which is very different than this image). 
morning breakfast , we never get our order correctly, always either some thing was missing or extra. as i mention attention to details were almost 0.
employees at front desk and even the manager were that great and accommodative as well, the only place we enjoyed was the clubhouse team for lunch and dinner the manager in the club house, he was great though.
we called for the concierge to collect our luggages and they never showed up so we had to take our own luggage down which is ok but the worst is when i was checking out the front desk lady said i already arrange your luggages to be picked up which really bothered me!
if is really shame such a beautiful and amazing place but we wont want to come back because of level of customer service.",3,2022,07,30
239,Destroyed 20% of My Holiday,"We stayed in Hunter's Yard for two nights; complained after and the management gave no indication that they changed anything; they bunged us a voucher as a reply (we are returning it; why would we want to relive our holiday.

This was the last of visits to 4 supposedly 5-star hotels in ireland:

*Positives*
In general the staff in the restaurants were very welcoming and cheery, we were impressed by the Lady Helen meal (michelin starred).

The room was clean and well finished though for its size possibly not worth what we paid for it (indeed, I noted that had we booked the room a day before we arrived rather than several weeks in advance, we would have being charged about 200 euro less a night).

*Negatives*

1) The reception seemed to be a disaster, very poor staff and poor welcome.

When we arrived we had driven more or less all day; so we arrived later than we had expected after 6pm (with a booking for The Hound resturant at 7pm).

2) At reception, we asked could we delay our booking to 7.30pm and were told “NO"" this was not at all possible. That the restaurant was booked out and no change was possible.    So, we had to rush to shower, unpack and get to the meal. For all the time we were in the restaurant it was half full; when we left it at 9pm it was still half-empty.
So, the reception were clearly lying to us.

3) They also did some weird stuff. The receptionist bellowed out our booking details out loud to the whole lobby, stating what we were to pay for both nights and requesting confirmation of this.    Seemed all a bit public and unnecessary.

4) I don't know whether this woman took a dislike to us, but I got the impression we were given one of the worst appointed rooms. We had specifically booked a more-expensive  ""garden view"" room thinking that it would be nice to look out on the golf course. But we ended up looking out on a delivery bay, cluttered most of the time with golf carts and reversing delivery vans (see picture A). The noise of reversing trucks and beer kegs being thrown around greeted us on returning to our room several times. Also, the area in the corridor near our room seemed to be a dump for towels and other stuff, like this was a place that no one went (see picture B).  This part of the corridor looked like this for the whole of our stay (on  3 separate days).
This is not a 5 star experience.

5) Then, the meal in The Hound was something else.  While the food was fine, we waited for an unbelievable length of time for it. We arrived as told in the restaurant at 7pm.   We gave our order at 7.15pm or so.   Starters arrived about 7.40pm and were finished by 7.45pm or so.   Then we waited for an hour for the main course to arrive…it came about 8.45pm or later.   So, we were effectively, 1.5hrs in the restaurant before we got our main course.  We were also surprised by the casualness of the dress of some of the patrons. A family group of 6 were squeezed onto a nearby table; they had two large teenage boys (rugby players?) who were dressed for the rugby field in shorts and sweat tops (this seemed to be their regular wear, as we saw them going into dinner the next night dressed in the same way; though happily with fresh pairs of shorts).   We were amazed that this was viewed as acceptable dress for an evening meal.  When we said this we were told "" that The Hound was a family restaurant"" as if we should have had our own rugby-teenagers, and that it was us who had the problem.

6) When we are checking out on the 7th of July at 10am to leave as quickly as possible; the receptionist (they one who was not too busy on her computer to talk to us), asked was everything ok.   We said “NO” and mentioned the arrival experience and the experience in The Hound, the woman smiled weakly as if she had heard this before but did not offer any comment or apology.   Seemed like a very poor service response.

So, we will never visit Mt Juliet again and cannot recommend.
When we emailed these complaints the guy that called me seemed not to have read the mail (cos he asked me to repeat it all) and said that he had not ""reviewed"" any of our complaints.  So, we had not checked them out or asked anyone whether they were true !  But, we could have a voucher (if we wanted) to come back and do it all again !  Eh....maybe....NO!",1,2022,07,26
239,A wonderful place to stay while visiting Ireland!,"We stayed at this hotel after our three-week tour to Ireland. It was the perfect place to relax and enjoy the beautiful surroundings. We highly appreciated the professionalism and friendliness of staff, the quality of food, the comfort of our room and the hotel atmosphere. For sure, we will be back to stay at this hotel in our next visit to Ireland. We recommend with absolutely no hesitation to anyone that wants to spend time in a calm, pleasant and beautiful place in Ireland.",5,2022,07,24
239,Unique surroundings and most attentive service.,"Old world charm with every modern amenity in a unique location surrounded by wonderful trees and manicured gardens . 
Service is impeccable friendly and attentive . 
Rooms are wonderfully decorated and regal .",5,2022,07,23
239,Overnight with golf.,"Fantastic experience,  golf ,food room and staff all to class. We had a overnight with golf package all went smoothly and the staff were very helpful. Sat outside in yard for an after dinner drink in lovely surroundings. Our room was perfect stayed during very hot weather air conditioning insured good nights sleep.",5,2022,07,23
239,Not Lost it’s Charm,"Mount Juliet under Marriott has not lost any of its unique charm. As ever a great welcome from all of the hotel staff, some of which have been there for years. The golf, riding and food are excellent.",5,2022,07,23
239,Best Property in Marriotts Portfolio,"This was our bucket-list trip to Scotland and Ireland-after attending the British Open we thought that nothing could compare. 
We were tired after 9 days in Scotland and arrived and we were excited to get to play where the Irish open was held. 
I cannot put into words the 500 acre property is not just a resort-it is a retreat. You feel like you are in a different world. Having stayed in most of the Autograph collection properties in North America -I can tell you that there is a high standard but this is above any place we have every travelled. 

The room was spotless and cleaned twice a day with fresh linens and wonderful coffee and tea.  The bathtub was so relaxing and the heated floor is perfect.
The pool is refreshing after golf and do try the steam room. It is so refreshing. 

We ate at all the restaurants-Lady Helen-the 7 course dinner was unbelievable. The scenry the service and every course seemed to be more deliteful than the previous one. I will be honest I was skeptic of the first dish with green foam -but I will tell you it was the most delish thing I HAVE EVER TASTED.  The wine pairings were perfect and while we were treated like royalty, it was obvious from the room that this was the standard at mount juliet.  We walked out of the restaurant after 3 hours and said -that just topped the OPEN.  It was not a meal it was an experience!!
The general manager came to ask if we were enjoying ourselves and offered some local suggestions to see-all turned out to be amazing. 
Where do you go these days where they take the time to recommend the local hidden gems and drw you a map.  
The hound we both tried the fois grois and shared the beef for 2. Again the flavors the service-you were infront of the golf practice area looking over some incredible views of Irelands hills and eating the most incredible meal. 
The curry in the club house it so tasty-and again; you are treated like they have known you all their lives. 
We felt welcomed

From the 2 wonderful ladies at the golf shop, who were helpful and friendly, Sharon at the front desk who always took the time to make sure you had everything you needed to the wait staff at Lady Helen/The Hound and Jacks Bar-and I cannot forget our chauffeur who would take uis by golf cart to the manor from the hunters yard. He was always so friendly. 
I cannot forget the breakfast and the lemon drops-again speaks volumes of their integrity knowing this is what they gave the staff for their children at Christmas! 

Mount Juliet has raised the bar in terms of service and quality. 

As we left with our breakfast boxes that Sharon had arranged for our early flight from Dublin-my hubby said we will never ever be able to find another place that comes close to Mount Juliet. 
We had 5 magical days at Mount Juliet and it was not enough. 

We will be back when the Open is in Portrush and I cannot wait to return!!!",5,2022,07,22
239,"Great Golf, Great Accommodation and Great Food","We are just home from a 4 night stay at the Manor House at Mount Juliet. The experience was sublime. Quite simply the best stay we have ever had anywhere. There were small problems. All overcome by staff willing and eager to please us. The Golf Course was in exceptionally good condition, the old house amazing, and the food and drinks were spectacular. Well done Mount Juliet you at the top of your game!",5,2022,07,22
239,Nice,A lovely hotel .a really nice job has been done on hunters yard.I had lunch there .the staff were excellent the surroundings lovely .The food was good not great .maybe it was my choice. I got a salad I could have done with some bread . My friend got chips so I ate some of them. I will go again .,4,2022,07,21
239,Not worth the money,"Quick sinopsus for those looking to get to point:

Reception staff on first day, told us we had a voucher, we said we didn't and subject dropped, rang down later to sort out when discovered was surprise voucher by family member. Receptionist was very unhelpful. Service not expected by 5 star 

Man bringing bags to room was lovely and helpful very friendly great customer service from him.

Receptionist second day much more helpful and pleasant remembered my girlfriends birthday was that day and even wished happy birthday, very nice to remember days after being told by family member who had sorted voucher.

Breakfast day 1 was long wait, 45 min wait, tables ordered after us served before us, was simple breakfast with nothin added or subtracted, inexcusable to wait this long. Ordered second toast but none delivered, breakfast cold and unpleasant.

Dinner service staff much better, waiter very helpful and helped us when we did not know some of items on menu. Food much higher quality very nice.

Air conditioning in room wasn't great, was told someone would be up but after 50 minute wait left hotel to get food and no one arrived for the rest of our stay.

Gardens and walk beautiful well worth walking the grounds

Golf course appeared well kept and nice but did not play, staff in pro shop very helpful and friendly

Cannot fault staff in hotel, except receptionist on first day everybody was lovely and helpful very pleased with this. Bad air-conditioning and bad food for breakfast was not expected. Food for dinner was good step up but would definitely reconsider having a breakfast here again

For people staying I advise going into kilkenny for breakfast much better options available for alot cheaper.

Would stay again but not in my opinion needs to improve to keep 5 star was not happy some aspects of stay for the cost but if could get cheaper would return sooner, needs to provide more for prices charged.",3,2022,07,20
239,Excellent location and overall experience!!,"Stayed in the “Hunters” section of the property.  Comfortable, modern and quiet room.

Enjoyed great food at both main restaurants.  Lady Helen 7 course tasting menu with wine pairing was particularly fun.

Very well-managed property.  We will return again.",5,2022,07,10
239,"Lovely property, but beware of there's a wedding!","We were here for 2 nights, but when we arrived we were shunted aside to await check-in as if we were part of a large group of wedding guests.  When we were finally able to check in, the receptionist insisted that our travel agent had not arranged for prepayment (first place this had happened) and instead of just making an imprint of my credit card, immediately charged $800+ to it.  She insisted this was a hold, but it was a charge.  We had lunch up at the golf course restaurant ( pleasant, but rather ordinary food).  Our room, unlike any of the other places we stayed was very small.  Again we felt like we were 5th wheels, and clearly the hotel didn't really know how to make non-wedding guests feel welcome.  It's a lovely property and if you're a golfer or ride horses, you'd probably love the place.  I did a separate review of the Lady Helen restaurant which is excellent.  And the woman who served us breakfast each morning was great and very efficient.  So, overall a very mixed experience here!",4,2022,07,09
239,What a wonderful place to stay!,"We loved our stay at Mount Juliet. As a family of six we were warmly greeted and accommodated. We had three lovely rooms in Hunters Court Yard right beside each other. The furnishings are fabulous. Everything was so fresh and comfy with added luxuries like heated bathroom floors. We were late arriving and in spite of closing the kitchen,  they prepared  room service for us. The next morning we enjoyed breakfast in the garden room overlooking the golf course. Our waitress was patient and doting. We loved the hot chocolate in the duck blue Churchill cups. We then biked and walked the grounds and swam in their pool. The gardens are gorgeous. The fairy trail was fun for us. We also received a warm welcome and impromptu tour of the manor house- complete with the history of the estate. John Walsh head porter is a treasure trove of stories and history. He was truly a gentleman even helping me find my way back to Hunters Yard. We didn’t want to check out. Had we known about all the amenities and the warm Irish welcome we would have planned to stay longer there. It was really a grand time. Their staff should be commended. We will recommend this place to all who travel to Ireland.",5,2022,07,06
239,Great Property depending...,"Mount Juliet is lovely - best suited for golfers, horse-back riders, and getting married. Perhaps less so for individual travelers. If you happen to visit during a big wedding, it's likely you will feel like somewhat of an ""extra"" - welcomed, yes, but the wedding party will be the focus. Mt Juliet is a bit out of town, so diversions other than the pastoral sort are few. The restaurant ""Lady Helen""  (Michelin One Star) is worth every bit of its star. It is totally first rate. We ate there twice and were very happy. ",4,2022,07,05
239,Wish we could have stayed longer!!,My husband and I spent one night at the Mansion and thoroughly enjoyed our short stay. Our room was gorgeous as were all the communal areas within the mansion. Breakfast was delicious as was the room service we ordered for dinner due to our late arrival. We enjoyed walking the property the next morning - lovely and peaceful - we would have liked to have stayed longer. Service throughout was exceptional. Our titanium status was recognized with a lovely welcome gift in our room.,5,2022,07,04
239,5 star comfort and satisfaction!,"Stayed at the Hunters Lodge for a few nights. My Titanium Elite status was immediately recognized with a gift upon arrival in room. The room had a King bed with down comforter and down pillows. There were USB charging ports available on each side of bed. Room had Hot tea and Espresso coffee available, as well as, a refrigerator stocked with complimentary water and milk. There were robes and slippers for a luxurious bathroom. Bathroom had large soaking tub, huge shower with rain shower head, makeup mirror and HEATED tile floor! Bathroom was well lit and stocked with Elemis spa products.  Overall, the room was immaculately clean, quiet, comfortable and made for the best night sleep! This Autograph Collection Is in the country yet has lots available for family. It was the perfect place for relaxation and unwinding. The staff was attentive to every request and provided best customer assistance!!  We even got to visit the Fox Hounds! My husband and I are  in Ireland for 38 days and after 2 1/2 weeks this was a perfect place to exhale! we were so impressed, we are staying again prior to our departure.  If you are in the area of Kilkenny, do not miss this luxurious, peaceful place to stay! !",5,2022,06,29
239,"Average hotel, poor food","We stayed here for two nights as a part of a larger family gathering in June 2022. We stayed in Hunter’s Yard and really enjoyed the room, swimming pool and playground.
The breakfast was average although the staff were very nice.
We ate dinner in the club house on the first night  which again was average and over priced (20e for a very basic burger and chips) although they did give a 10% discount as they couldn’t seat our party as per our booking.
On the second night we ate as a large group (20+ people) in the Hunter’s Yard restaurant.
It was a set menu for 55e each, which did not include coffee/tea or any sides. The options were extremely limited, the lamb was listed as medium but was very rare and two out of three desserts were inedible.
Some of the staff were exceptionally nice at dinner but some were clearly overwhelmed.
We also went as a group of 15 to the Manor House for an evening drink and the although we had called ahead to see if they could accommodate us and were told we could head over the manager was quite short with us.",3,2022,06,27
239,SO DISAPPOINTING!,"Checked in on a Friday. I had requested an early check in of noon, as arriving from overseas, but was denied that request and not allowed  to check in until 4 pm.  (I am a platinum elite marriott member).   I also used a suite upgrade award.  However, I was not given a suite upgrade or anything that looked similar to pictures on website.  it was, in fact, a downgraded room in my opinion, and a waste of my valuable suite upgrade certificate.   Unfortunately for us, the hotel was setting up for a wedding, and most areas were closed.  We couldn't get food or drinks at restaurant, as they said they were too busy setting up the wedding.  I wish I had known this, as the hotel is remotely located away from town, and would have never stayed there.  The nice part was that the grounds were quite beautiful and most of staff friendly.  However, I would advise not to go on weekends, or if you do, be sure to inquire if any events going on so you won't be disappointed like I was.  Also, don't waste your suite upgrades here.",1,2022,06,23
239,Disappointed to say the least,Went for a treatment in the spa and dinner after. Staff that were doing treatments were wonderful. Facilities a huge disappointment.  Steam room not working ... we were offered packets of chocolate peanuts after treatment even though they were fully aware one of us were vegan. No relaxation room after treatment and was offered a cold reading room... not very relaxing and definitely not five star but staff did whatever they could to compensate. Went to the hunters restaurant after where my daughter ordered a vegan pasta dish as very little on offer. It arrived luke warm. My food never arrived! Staff did only charge us for our wine when we requested the bill with one person leaving hungry. Definitely not five star. Disappointed to say the least on both spa and restaurant but Staff did try there best to compensate us.,3,2022,06,18
239,Simply the best! Megan and Henry are heroes!,"Just left today after my amazing 7 days. Readying a few review that are negative I do not agree with. This was my first international vacation in my 47 years, trip of a life time. Our room was beautiful and cleaned to a high level. The even tea in the lobby was a nice touch. I had so many questions and Megan in the evening at the front desk was so sweet. She walked me through alot and great advice. Every evening she would inquire about my day and took an interest. Over hearing my worries about parking in Dublin, Henry over heard  and gave me great advice on parking. He even printed up directions, bought to my room and helped us figure out how to charge our phones.   2 morning we had early tours and Megan offered to have an express breakfast ready for us.  EVERY member from the front desk, heath club, bell men and breakfast staff are so caring and professional. Thank you for a wonderful trip and much needed mental break from the US! Thank you Megan and Henry!",5,2022,06,14
239,Beautiful estate and grounds,"Wonderful three night stay at Mount Juliet.  You can stay at the Manor, but we chose to stay at the Hunters Yard over by the golf course and restaurant (The Hound) because we thought it might be quieter.  Be sure to walk the grounds, explore the walled garden and enjoy the beauty of the surrounding area on foot.  If you have time, book a tea at the Manor or eat in the Michelin star restaurant.",5,2022,06,13
239,Wonderful one night stay,"We recently had a one night stay at this fantastic hotel and will definitely be returning but for a longer stay next time.  The staff were so nice and helpful and from the minute we arrived we really felt the five star experience. 

We stayed at Hunters Yard where our room was clean comfortable and very spacious. We had lunch breakfast and dinner at The Hound where the food and service was top class. We enjoyed drinks in the bar after dinner and the barman there deserves a special mention. His attention to detail was excellent and he had a lovely friendly manner chatting with all the guests. 

The grounds around the hotel are really beautiful and it was nice to stroll down to the Manor house for a drink before dinner where the staff there were also very pleasant and friendly. The golf course and driving range are an added bonus at the hotel for any golf enthusiast like my husband who enjoyed using the driving range.

Our stay at Mount Juliet really was a memorable experience and we are already looking forward to returning there before the end of the year.",5,2022,06,11
239,Most enjoyable stay,"A very good experience with most welcoming,efficient and friendly staff. Very good food with excellent service. Rooms are spacious, comfortable and very clean. The ambience of Mount Juliet provides a very relaxing stay.",5,2022,06,11
239,Excellent as always,"I have stayed at Mount Juliet several times over the past year.  Each stay seems to exceed the previous one (which is impressive as they are consistently excellent).  The Lady Helen is outstanding (food quality, service, and atmosphere).  The Hound is also excellent in the same regard.  The rooms are beautifully maintained and house keeping is as close to perfect as you can get.  The most outstanding aspect is the staff.  Across the board, everyone seems to excel at customer service.  A special thanks to Laura who is the Front Office Manager for her commitment to insuring each guest has an outstanding stay.  I am really looking forward to my next visit.",5,2022,06,09
239,Just had to say……Don’t stay!,"Very poor service throughout,  shocking in fact, especially at meal times, nowhere near the standard one would expect. All in all a very disappointing stay in Mount Juliet, there’s no way I would recommend you to. No atmosphere , friendliness, or basic customer service. A major let down, a trip we were looking forward to, for quite sometime. The grounds are exceptionally nice, if you could perhaps, camp out in your own tent? You’d make a better breakfast anyway yourself, outside, Delete if this is on your bucket list",1,2022,06,09
239,Afternoon Tea - Surprisingly Disappointing Service,"Speaking with with a staff member that morning before we travelled, I was delighted with the care and attention she took to make sure we would be accommodated, I was impressed by her professional and friendly attitude. I was looking forward to visiting for afternoon tea, confident that we would receive the same standard as had been shown in the telephone conversation. We arrived shortly after 3pm, at 3.05pm. A gentleman took our name and said it was for a party of 3, correct. He then had a discussion with some of the staff about where to seat us, all except one seemed unsure of where we were to go, and the girl who spoke up was ignored. As guests, we did not need to witness this. He then proceeded to march us through, to another room, where he announced that the table was set for 4. It was not the warmest of welcomes. I was not sure did he think we were a party of 4 that only had 3 present.. but in fact we were originally a party of 2, the phone call earlier in the day was to see if we could add an extra person (for lunch) which we did. Our afternoon tea, booked for 3pm, arrived some time around 4pm. An hour is a long time to wait. At that stage I already had to ask for a menu twice, staff went to get one after the first request and did not return. Eventually, around 3.40pm the menu arrived and we ordered. The sandwiches were lovely, as requested and delicious. The cake pop also. The rest of the sweet treats were fine, no real flavour from some, but the passionfruit dessert was very nice. Tea arrived with the afternoon tea, and we would have welcomed a refill. At no time did anyone approach to ask how was everything. If they had, I would not be writing this review. A lady did approach us twice in the 35 minutes before the menu arrived, to ask how was everything, and I did say we would like a menu, but she did not bring one. I would like to have seen her once we had received our afternoon tea, and could have sorted out issues there and then. Curious as to why only 1 side plate was served, surely one for savoury and one for sweet is usual? It might seems like I am nit picking here. The service did not live up to expectations by any means. I do not hold the staff responsible, they can only be as capable as their training enables them to be. I hope you up the training to include all staff looking after the visitors, and a smile and the swift delivery of a pot of tea upon arrival can go a long way to make visitors feel welcome.",2,2022,06,07
239,Skip it.,"The bed was heavenly. The grounds are beautiful. The river is lovely. Lots of activities for all ages. 
The staff however, overall, were not friendly. There was one waiter that we had a breakfast that was nice. Other than that, they were not; very disappointing. When I asked about euros (needing to exchange currency) I was told to drive to the nearest ATM/bank 20 minutes away. (And if was a national bank holiday weekend.)
The spa was just ok; the girls were friendly, but both my husband and I were not impressed by the massage. They seemed weak. 
Reservations HAVE to be made to eat on the property~otherwise, you must drive the 20 minutes to the next town/village. We ate in the Clubhouse Bar. We were seated outside. The sign says it is for members only. There were many members both inside and out. They were easily heard complaining about Americans, Indians and other foreigners that come to visit their club. 
Not one single person said hello to us. 
We fished as well. It was nice to be outside. Our guide was very nice.",3,2022,06,05
239,Not impressed with Mount Juliet,"I was a guest with my daughter on 2/3 June and I was so disappointed, it didn’t live up to its 5star rating, I like to go to luxury hotels regularly becouse it dosnt suit me to travel abroad and unfortunately this hotel couldn’t compete with others ,  the food at Dinner and breakfast was poor, coffee cold, had to return cooked breakfast as it was unpalatable, the egg white running on the plate etc etc, my daughter asked for toast twice and never got any…the pool and pool area is underwhelming ……..the positives were the mini facial we both had was a very pleasant experience, the grounds are gorgeous and we enjoyed the sunshine there…we had lunch in the golf club before we left, where the food and service was excellent …..
    Overall experience was not particularly good so I won’t be rushing back…",3,2022,06,04
239,Afternoon Tea Not what One Would Expect,"We had Afternoon Tea to celebrate my sister in laws 50th birthday. Have to admit was disappointed; service poor: food, particularly dessert element  just ok! Staff obviously distracted by wedding party; had to ask twice for clean plates; walk to bar in order to pay; not what we expected",3,2022,06,03
239,Not even close to a 5 star,"Having stayed in 5 star properties before, this hotel doesn’t even come close. It’s tired and shabby, both the shared guest spaces and the rooms. Fixtures and fittings all seem to be coming off in the rooms. And the staff don’t provide the level of service expected from a 5 star property where guest satisfaction should be the ultimate aim. For example I arrived at the lift with my two young children and two large suitcases where a young employee was waiting with a bucket and mop….and instead of him offering me the lift, he just got in and let the doors close behind him! Also the hound restaurant and the bar area have a lingering musty smell…clearly a deep clean needs to be done here. Overall a very disappointing experience, will not be coming back or recommending to anyone I know.",3,2022,06,03
239,Wonderful!,"We stayed 3 nights here on our trip to Ireland. The grounds are amazing. Sometimes when you see pictures of a hotel you a little dispointed when you get there. This was the opposite. The pictures don't do it justice.  The staff was so nice and helpful, always asking if we needed anything. We used the spa and golfcourse. We we stayed in Hunters Yard becuase the rooms were a little more modern that the main building but the main building is beautiful.  We ate breakfast there each morning and it was very good and they gave us bags of pastries to take away. We ate one night at the golf  clubhouse and  the steak sandwich and burgers were very good as was the Hunters Yard restaurant.  It's about 90 min from Dublin 20 min from Kilkinney so it's a little secluded.Rooms have AC which is is plus.  But if we ever return to Ireland we will be back.",5,2022,05,31
239,Wonderful family experience ,"Modern, clean, spacious room. Great to see sustainability considerations, for example, the room Slippers were not covered in plastic. 
Fabulous food...cooked to order and served promptly. Recommend the fillet steak in the Hound Restaurant.  
Beautiful walkways and scenery...very instagrammable!
A trip to the spa is a must for some wind down time.
All staff, from reception to bar were very approachable and more than helpful.  
Definitely recommend and will definitely return. Happy guest!",5,2022,05,31
239,One of the best most charming places I've every stayed at!,"If you're visiting Ireland I would highly recommend staying at the Mount Juliet Estate. I can't stress enough how nice everyone there was and it is incredibly beautiful and charming. 

Jimmy was more than helpful before our stay there and while we were there! He helped us with our plans, showed us around, drove us on a golf cart to our archery lesson afternoon tea and was just the best! Also, John was so kind and helpful. He picked us up from our shuttle, took our bags and made it so easy for us. He drove us around the estate and gave us a great tour of the hotel, sharing with us the history of the hotel and walking us through the beautiful place. They are just amazing and so welcoming. Some of the nicest people I've ever met. 

Also, the breakfast was so delicious, you could order whatever you want and it was included with the stay and they even had a complimentary bottle of Prosecco when we first arrived. We had the best time and i can't wait to come back to this special, beautiful, amazing place and for such reasonable rates too for the service and accommodation. I would highly recommend this and can't wait to return :) ",5,2022,05,25
239,Absolutely amazing property.,We stayed 2 nights during our amazing 8 night tour of Ireland.  Beautiful grounds with great walking and biking trails-bike are complimentary...Bonus!  Gym and spa were excellent and very clean.  room was clean and very comfortable.  Restaurant food was delicious.  Entire staff was always pleasant and attending to our needs.  Would highly recommend and would stay again for sure.,5,2022,05,24
239,Meanness and review of policy advised.,"My nephew was chosen to play Senior Cup golf against Mount Juliet on Sunday May 8th of this year. He does not currently drive and asked.me would I accompany him to Mount Juliet which 
is a 30k drive and act as caddy. 

Our club was surprised when only 4 green fee vouchers facilitating practice rounds was made available by Mt Juliet. 5 players are on a team and usually  teams have 2 substitute  players also in case a player or players become unavailable on match day. The matches are on a home away format played on the same day and time.
My nephew rang and booked a tee time for the previous Thursay and informed Mt Juliet that he would be using one of these green fee vouchers for a practice round.. 
He booked a time of 12.20.
When we arrived at the pro shop and introduced ourselves the young pleasant lady told us that a practice.round using a green fee voucher can only be redeemed after 4pm, meaning we could not use the voucher to play during the tee time we had booked..
We expressed surprise and mild annoyance. 
My nephew asked why he had not been told this when he had made the booking and had made it clear when booking the purpose of the game.
The young lady said she would check it out.
Having spoken to someone in an office behind the desk in the pro shop she apologised but said that was the club policy.

Having played.many times.in Mt Juliet  we agreed to pay the 125 fee for one person so that my nephew could get in a practice round as we were not going to wait around till 4 pm.
We arrived at the first tee and met the starter who asked were we.gling to play out of 1 bag ! 
I accompanied my nephew on his round and enjoyed the fun we had but to be honest both of us would have preferred  if I was also playing. 
W booked the 12.20 slot as there was very few bookings around that time and we wanted to have some added time looking at greens from different angles etc.
My family has stayed in Mount Juliet often in a party of 8 or more and we have all enjoyed fantastic food and been greeted by exceptional.staff who have added hugely to our enjoyment of our trip. We have played golf also and enjoyed the course.
To be blunt,  the current management of Mount Juliet golf needs to review its current policy of allowing practice rounds on its course after 4pm.
There was plenty of slots available on the day and there is no excuse for the way that we were treated.
It strikes of meanness and is totally out of kilter with how golf courses in Irelad meet and greet guests.",1,2022,05,20
239,Very Enjoyable,"Stayed at the Hunters lodge for 1 night with a round of golf. Was extremely satisfied with the experience. 
Played golf on day of arrival and had a quick bite in the clubhouse before setting out - food was good and service friendly and efficient.
Reception were super helpful and efficient throughout our stay and answered all queries - special shout out to Laura who was particularly helpful.
Room was clean, comfortable and nicely appointed - eventually found the complimentary water and coffee in the press.
Dinner in the Hound was a delight and if anything the menu undersold the excellent flavours and presentation. Have every intention of returning later in the year which is the best recommendation I can offer.",5,2022,05,11
239,The Best of Ireland,"Mount Juliet Estate is actually two hotel properties under one umbrella. Together they make one of the most delightful and charming properties in all of Ireland. The Manor House with more traditional and spacious rooms harkens back to the elegance of a bygone era. Hunters Lodge is beautifully modern and bright. It in no way resembles a hunter's lodge but a beautifully appointed, smartly decorated hotel.  The color scheme is wonderful, the rooms are ample, and incredibly comfortable. The in-house spa has a large number of services, and the health club and pool are a treat. These two hotels sit on one of the most gorgeous golf courses in Ireland. The Clubhouse is the casual of three restaurants on the property. Eddie Devane, The Clubhouse Manager, is the epitome of what excellent customer service should be. Make sure to try their version of Cookies & Cream ice cream! Breakfast in the morning is made to order and very good. Gemma, one of the servers is a ray of sunshine and a wonderful way to start your day. From the moment we arrived at the property we were met with warmth, engaging kindness, and an obvious sense of pride the staff has for their workplace. Annemarie of The Manor House gave us a tour, answered questions about the area and property, as well as printed material for us about the history of the property. From the moment we stepped up to the Hunters Lodge we knew it would be a wonderful stay. We were met by local porter Martin who gathered up our luggage and cheerfully got us sorted out. Later at sunset he gave us a golf cart tour of the grounds. The waterfall and walled gardens, the bucolic River Nore, and the row of stunning maples at the putting green are just a few of the breathtaking sites of the property. We loved seeing the hound puppies and field of hounds in the early morning. The rooms were a great value but overall, our stay was an even greater experience. This property is home to the Irish Open yet feels as neighborly and welcoming as any small-town club. We can't wait to stay again and experience the kindness and approachability of the staff. The only thing we would have liked to see more developed is the menus in all the restaurants and the breakfast selection be expanded upon.",5,2022,05,10
239,Nice but not 5 star,"We have just returned from our baby moon and had an overall nice stay! I will start with the positives, the staff are really lovely and highly experienced and we found the check in/ check out and service to be very good and efficient. The grounds are beautiful and the Manor House which we stayed in is quite nice. 

I would agree with others reviewers in saying that it does not have the appearances of a 5 star though. Reasons being, one of our bedroom windows looked out onto an area where old baths and general rubbish was being discarded, there were two small tables in each window, both with a thick layer of dust on them. The bed was uncomfortable. The pool area was a bit grubby in all areas. 

The food is okay, lunch was standard,  the coffee at breakfast is from a nespresso machine which I wouldn’t like. The fruit salad was basically just apple, I think there was one piece of pineapple in it. 

I think Marriot need to invest a little in the hotel, give it a good clean and a refresh, with the prices we are expected to pay in Ireland these days, people will not accept let downs which can easily be avoided. Despite this, we did enjoy our stay and I probably would give it another try in the future.",4,2022,05,09
239,Definitely not a 5 star hotel!!,"Stayed here for two nights and we were very underwhelmed. Other reviews have mentioned poor arrival/check in. The room was tired, no bath in an executive king room. Small bathroom with fire exit door directly onto corridor which meant every word spoken was clearly heard. Saturday morning at 8am several loud conversations on the hallway outside our room. 

Couldn’t get a table in the Michelin restaurant (was told we were on a waiting list but then found out restaurant closed for private wedding - why not be honest?)  had we been told we may have not bothered to stay at the hotel at all. 

A few previous reviews have mentioned over charging - check your bills we had £270 of additional golf costs on our bill and despite giving them proof it was all prepaid the receptionist was decidedly condescending! 
We had stayed at The K Club, Old Head and Adare Manor on this trip so expectations were high but sadly came crashing down at this hotel. Marriott need to spend some serious money to bring this hotel to an acceptable standard. It’s more 3* than 5* and we won’t be re-visiting",3,2022,05,07
239,A really great short break.,"We recently visited Mount Juliet for 2 nights - staying in the Manor House. 
It was a wonderful experience from the initial reception, breakfasts in the Lady Helen restaurant and dinners in the Hound Restaurant in the Hunter's yard.
All staff were very effecient, helpful and polite, without being over fussy. 
Facilities were really good - we availed of the pool fcailites and were also fortunate to get to play golf, in sunshine in April - the course was magnificent, many great holes !!
Hopefully we'll get the chance to go back again soon.",5,2022,05,03
239,Perfect overnight getaway for a couple,"Not a single thing for our night away from the kids could be faulted here. Room was superb (in the Manor House), Lady Helen restaurant was so beautiful, service was top class, spa was relaxing and overall our favourite part was the peace and calm that surrounded us for the whole time we were there. Breakfast was a cut above the rest too and a lovely civilised noon checkout time! I can’t wait to go back again as soon as I can!",5,2022,04,30
239,Midweek Mount Juliet Stay,"We recently stayed in Mount Juliet Estate for two nights and it’s safe to say we were blown away from start to finish. 

We were greeted by Kate and Laura at check in they were nothing but pleasant and accommodating. We received a complimentary  upgrade as we were celebrating our recent engagement. Kate had also organised for a bottle of Prosecco and  some petit fours to be in our room upon arrival which was a lovely gesture. Both Kate and Laura are a credit to MJ and certainly make your stay feel extra special. 

Our room was beautiful and so comfortable. We spent hours wandering through the grounds of the hotel. The hotel has something to cater for everyone from nature walks, golfing, fishing, horse riding, spa treatments, swimming pool and complimentary bicycles to cycle through the grounds. 

We ate at the hound restaurant both nights and our dining experience was fantastic. We met Hannah from MJ on both nights in the restaurant and she was so pleasant and a breath of fresh air. Hannah clearly runs a tight ship as the service was brilliant. 

We also met Jimmy at the restaurant during breakfast and he is also a credit to MJ. He takes the time to ask how has your stay been and also gives great advice on things to do around the grounds. Jimmy had told us about the hound puppies which are on site (which must be a hidden gem as not many people knew about them) and residents can go to see them in the fields. 

In summary, we had a fantastic stay and we loved every minute of it. The staff of MJ combined with the beauty of the grounds make for a fantastic stay and we will most certainly be back again.",5,2022,04,27
239,A highlight of our first travel since the pandemic.,"Our family finally ventured out into the world, choosing a 6 day trip to Ireland, flying in and out of Shannon on the west coast and working our way back and forth, via the scenic route, to Dublin. We are husband and wife and teenager and pre-schooler (!), so finding something for everyone was foremost.
We spent the first 2 nights and days at Mt Juliet estate, in Thomastown outside of Kilkenny City, in the south/central/east of the Republic. I had last been to MJ 20 years ago for a professional conference and had very fond memories of the estate (and golf course), so I was happy to experience an equally enjoyable trip this year. Not much had changed since 1998, in a good way. We stayed in the manor house, which is the heart of the property, but only 100 yards away is the Hunter's Yard, where most of the rooms may be and 2 more casual dining areas and perhaps the pro shop are situated. The staff were fabulous, the rooms and common areas impeccable, and the food and drink terrific. We splurged on the 7-course meal at Lady Helen's in the Manor House; my wife and teenager are special foodies and we all loved the experience over 3 hours that passed too quickly. Daytimes we explored Kilkenny and environs and wandered the estate and partook in activities such as archery, with Shane.  
We were at MJ during the week after Easter, so the property was bustling, but still peaceful and not remotely crowded in any sense. It was particularly family-friendly, but remained upscale without being snooty.
Lastly, I was aware of the complaints in some negative reviews here on Tripadvisor, but our experience was not in any way consistent with those reviews. MJ is not inexpensive, but a visit here, especially in my view in the Manor House, can be a lifelong memory. I didn't bring my clubs this time, but I do remember the course is great.",5,2022,04,27
239,Very relaxing night away  and looked after so well by all the staff,"We played golf and stayed in the Hunter's Yard on Sunday last.  From check in to leaving, it was such a lovely experience.  We cannot thanks the staff enough for how they looked after us.  Rooms are really comfortable, Breakfast was fabulous, as was dinner but would have liked a few more choices for dinner.  We will definitely be back.",5,2022,04,27
239,Pat Sheehy,We stayed in the Hunters yard for a family get away (6 adults and a child).The location and facilities were top notch and the staff could not  have been any more helpful. We really enjoyed our breakaway and now plan on making it an annual event,5,2022,04,21
239,Superb,"This is the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in. Absolutely everything about it was wonderful from the setting to the room to the staff to the food and everything else. As my partner said, “Other hotels should send their people here to learn how to hotel.” Perfection.",5,2022,04,21
239,Not a 5 star,"Planning another trip to Ireland but I will be bypassing this place. It looked wonderful but looks can be deceiving. The restaurant staff needs to be trained. They forgot more than they remembered. Cold steak, cold vegetables, and burnt toast in the morning. In hind sight it was all a bit comical; the price for comedy was too dear. 

I will say Miss Sharon Walker contacted me via email regarding my lack luster experience. However, when I gave her my phone number she nor anyone else bothered following up. Not really surprised 

Caveat emptor",1,2022,04,16
239,April 2022  Visit to Mount Juliet,"A beautiful mid week stay in Mount Juliet. We had booked a one night stay in Hunters Lodge, our stay was so enjoyable that we decided to stay an extra night. A special mention to Sharon in front house Reception who made us feel special and looked after, a true professional.

The service was exemplary, 5 star quality with a down to earth approach. Delicious food and beautiful scenery.

Highly recommend Mount Juliet for a memorable treat.

Aisling and Niall",5,2022,04,15
239,Hidden Gem,Stayed here with my sister for a treat in March. The grounds and house are absolutely stunning. A golfers paradise. Breakfast was lovely and overlooking the putting practice green. Staff so lovely and helpful. Pool is lovely and would only be made even better with the addition of an outdoor tub. Hotel is immaculately clean as are the rooms. Very much look forward to returning.,5,2022,04,11
239,Wonderful Experience,"We felt very looked after from start to finish. The staff are absolutely fantastic and make the visit extra special. All very polite and make an effort. John the porter is a beautiful person and made our trip.
Rooms are high spec, extremely comfortable and very clean. The staff take pride in their work.
The food in Hound is delicious. We had the fillet steak with smoked mash, spinach, cabbage and carrots, all of which were perfectly cooked and very tasty. Service for dinner didn’t match the high standards throughout the rest of the property. Service for breakfast was excellent.
The clubhouse is fabulous along with the excellent service.
I had the full body massage by Laura. She was absolutely lovely and an excellent masseuse. The goody bag was a lovely touch.
Staff at the pool are also fantastic and made us feel very welcome. It is spotless and well maintained. We love the reservation process which makes the experience special as the pool is quiet and very relaxing.

The grounds are stunning and feel magical. I loved the walks. 

We cannot wait to return.",5,2022,04,10
239,Amazing Estate!,"My Family and I just returned to the U.S from our first, and hopefully not last, trip to Ireland.  
We stayed at the Marriott Mount Juliet Estate for part of our trip. 
The entire Estate is absolutely gorgeous. The property is rich in history, yet modern amenities. 
The Golf Course and grounds are breathtaking. We went horseback riding and made use of the bicycles and toured the property. I can’t even express how well kept everything is and how serene and wonderful it was. It was very secluded, yet a short drive into Kilkenny. 
The entire team from Mark, the General Manger to the Guest Service Associates, the Restaurant staff and  the groundskeepers and housekeeping all went above and beyond to make our stay more enjoyable. Even the gentleman that came around in the Evening asking if we needed water or extra towels, could not of been more pleasant. 
We met David, our first night, not exactly sure of his position, but he always seemed to be on hand to help us whenever needed. He gave us a lovely narrative on the history of the property, which we throughly enjoyed. 
I did not get their names, but the kind woman that checked us out and the gentleman she was working with at that time, were absolutely delightful and went out of their way for us. 
Spotlessly clean hotel. Food was delicious. 
Top class experience. Would highly recommend to anyone.",5,2022,04,01
239,10 out of 10,"From the moment we arrived to when we left a top class experience.

The reception staff were friendly and efficient.

We stayed in the hunters yard and there is a lovely serene atmosphere. The rooms are very comfortable and good value for money.

The staff were excellent, especially the restaurant manager who looked after us very well for breakfast. Bar staff were friendly and efficient and the dinner in the “hound”was first class with really excellent service, nothing was to much bother.

Great facilities on site, our nieces had a horse riding lesson, they really enjoyed the experience and they loved the swimming pool
and the bikes on site

So in summary, well done Mount Juliet we had an incredible stay.

John & Graziella Schuster",5,2022,03,31
239,Waste of Money,"The service was ridiculous. The doorman didn't come to collect our bags when we checked-in although he was there, we also had to pull our bags to our room as well and when we tried to check-out, he didn't bother showing up to our room after we made the request and waited. A simple service like getting the laundry done turned into a disaster with housekeeping confused about collecting the bag, and then getting random calls about my laundry not getting washed at all and lastly, I was overcharged on two separate receipts for the same laundry and had to speak to reception twice. The chairs and tables weren't clean in the Clubhouse with food on the chairs and tables, and staff taking a long time to see to us and sometimes they forgot what we ordered (this happened on two separate occassions). We discovered a towel with a large brown stain in our toilet, and made housekeeping aware that we found the unused dirty towel.",1,2022,03,30
239,This is pure luxury!,We loved our two day stay.  Visitors from home and abroad will love it too. Accommodation really good as was the service. A few minor issues but all easily sorted out by the most friendly and helpful staff. The food was supreme and the golf course just magnificent. We were blessed with great weather. Home of the Irish Open again this year. Too many staff to mention who were excellent to name them individually.,5,2022,03,30
239,Superb getaway venue with friends,"We were a group of seven that stayed at Hunters Yard in March. Keeping seven strong minded women happy is not an easy feat but Mount Juliet/Hunters Yard achieved the impossible. Rooms were lovely, grounds were stunning and staff excellent. Food in the hound was fab and bar staff were very pleasant. Reception staff were delightful, friendly, efficient and helpful. 

Afternoon Tea at the Manor House was a beautiful experience and staff there were very attentive without being intrusive.

All in all, a wonderful experience x seven. Thank you. Looking forward to a return visit soon.",5,2022,03,29
239,Incredibly Bad Trip,"The hotel staff were completely inattentive to the point that when I called the reception multiple times, no one picked up or I was verbally told to wait until someone could get back to me. The chairs and tables when we had breakfast were very unclean and the waiter forgot our order. The hotel was a waste of money: I will never recommend it to anyone.",1,2022,03,28
239,Five Star Welcome .,"At reception we were greeted with a smile & a frendly helpful welcome .

Our room , wow the view on to the estate was beauitful, in our room was a had written card welcoming us back to the estate a warm thoughtful message from Mary what a lady kind helpful alway s see the person , Mary goes the extra mile each & every time we visit the estate

239,"Great hotel, wonderful food in beautiful, relaxing and quiet environment","I’ve been wanting to try and visit Mount Juliet since it joined Marriott rewards/Bonvoy about 3 years ago. After visiting this week, Mar2022, not only did it not disappoint but it lived up to my expectations and more. 
Stayed in Hunters Yard where the rooms are relatively modern and very comfortable. Comfy bed, good bath & shower and a nice view of the courtyard from the bedroom. It looks like rooms recently renovated with new cleaning standards kept. 
The food throughout the estate is great. Breakfast and evening meals in the Hound are very good and you’ll be well looked after and well fed by the team. 
The theatre and experience plus amazing food of the Lady Helen restaurant make an evening meal a memorable event that is more than worth it.
With the great weather this week, I even got to enjoy afternoon tea outside on the lawn at Manor House; definitely recommend if weather permits. Pictures included. 
The grounds of the estate are huge and worth exploring. It is not just the infamous golf course but a wider and wilder area to explore down by the river which I particularly enjoyed as well as the manicured gardens up by the house. 
Watching the gardeners cut the golf course grass whilst having breakfast in the Hound also an enjoyable experience. 
It happens across any hotel, no matter the number of stars or awards on the door, that problems can happen. When this happened for me, it was the way that Ty, Jimmy and the rest of the team resolved these quickly and with great professionalism that stand out for me in making this a great hotel. 
All of the team are local or live locally. Take time to chat with them and they will tell you all about the local area, the hotel or chat about anything really. They go out of their way to help you have an enjoyable stay.
Looking forward to coming back in the future.",5,2022,03,26
239,Absolutely terrible for the price involved.,"We went for our babymoon and feel like we got completely ripped off. Really appalling staff attitude in a lot of service areas. Overall just felt nowhere near the apparent 5 star mark when staying in the Manor House.

Dinner at the Lady Helen was nowhere near the standard you would expect. The lack of actual coffee opting for Nespresso capsules at a Michelin starred restaurant is just crazy. Especially when there is a fully functioning espresso machine there in the Majors bar.
Food was ok but not great for the price. Potatoes were served raw at dinner, wife's fish massively overcooked and the restaurant manager was appalling and condescending in the worst ways. The Sommelier was the one saving grace at dinner and he was exceptional.

General service at lunch was also poor, we had planned around the times given by reception only to be told they were no longer serving when we sat down an hour before the supposed end of lunch service. It just felt all over the place for the price.

The grounds are incredible and there are beautiful run and walk routes but I would say stay in Hunters Yard, which is a lot cheaper, rather than shelling out.",2,2022,03,26
239,Superb hotel in a wonderful setting,"The craic was mighty especially the archery. The rooms are a delight, wonderful bed the room is exceptionally clean and well maintained. The food especially the breakfast is fabulous. The archery and fishing are great craic. The new cinema room looks amazing as does the new cellar bar in the manor house.",5,2022,03,25
239,"Beautiful Hotel, service let it down","The grounds of the hotel are immaculate, the public areas are decorated tastefully and spotlessly clean. The swimming pool is very relaxing.

The check in staff were courteous and welcoming as were the ladies in the spa and swimming pool. 

On arrival, we were not offered valet parking or assistance with our luggage.

Our room(309) in Hunters Yard was spacious and clean however there was a flickering light in the bathroom and the coffee machine was in the wardrobe which was in a corner of the room with no light so once daylight had faded we needed to use our phone torch to use. 

 After checking in we we took a walk to the Manor House where we ordered a drink. There were three staff members. While the girl who served our drinks was pleasant, none of them made conversation with us. When we paid our bill we found the guy very sombre.

We had dinner booked inThe Hound for 9pm (the only time available). We went to the bar at 8 and again we found the staff very uninterested in chatting with customers. In the restaurant again staff showed no interest in engaging with us. We twice asked for a dessert menu but none arrived and when we received the bill we had to find a member of staff to settle it.

We both felt that priority from staff was given to international guests and that is a very big let down for me.

My husband booked this night away for my birthday based on recommendations from colleagues and he was very disappointment as it did not meet his expectations. 

We enjoyed our night but based on the fact that we did not feel the cost reflected the experience we would not return.",3,2022,03,22
239,"Exceptional service, beautiful grounds, excellent food.","I cannot say enough about our stay at Hunter’s Yard at the Mount Juliet Estate. Sharon with guest relations booked all our activities. She was kind and patient, their Butler was always at our service. We did archery and equestrian and both the instructors were fun and helpful. We also had a lovely tour of the grounds by Ciaran, who was very knowledgeable. A highlight was afternoon tea at the Manor house. We grabbed quick, easy and tasty lunch at the Club House between activities and booked dinners at The Hound twice. We tried everything on the menu and it was delicious, always cooked to perfection and well deserving of their Michelin Plate Award. I traveled with my husband, who was there for business and mostly met us for dinner (and a late night drink at the Pub, also on site), our two children ages 8 and 10 and my mother. This was one of the stops during our tour on Ireland and it was everyone’s favorite! 

This resort is part of the Autograph Collection by Marriot Bonvoy. Both my husband and I have Ambassador status which comes with many perks like welcome gift champagne in each room and a nice room upgrade.",5,2022,03,22

Food was delicious. relaxing atmosphere. Thanks to Martin for hooking up the EV charger for me and to the lovely lady who got a bobbin for my partner to Room 112. Apologies didn't catch your name. I have stayed in 5 star hotels in Ireland and this has to be my best choice to date. Well done all.

Many thanks to all at Mount Juliet, we will be back.",5,2022,03,21
239,Disappointing Sunday lunch,"Limited menu, poor service, 2 toasted sandwiches with fries which were tasty enough but nothing special at the same time,  2 desserts which were bland at best, 2 cold coffees, a coke and a pint, 75euro the lot. I had a voucher which expired during lockdown which they honored without question, pretty much the only positive",2,2022,03,20
239,Overall great stay 5* luxury,"+
Amazing hotel, luxury facilities and top service. Great breakfast, lovely swimming pool. Wonderful service. Suite was beautiful. Lovely bar with live music but wish there was something to nibble there. 
Can't say enough about the service received from the reception team, room service team and bellboy.
Great shower and bath.

Bed was uncomfortable unfortunately. 
Dinner Restaurant need to improve the food quality especially the meat quality.",5,2022,03,15
239,Not a 5 star experience,"Arrived 3PM Saturday 12/03/22 for a relaxing night away. It was raining heavily and we pulled up to the valet parking area to check in. Unfortunately no assistance was available, not even an umbrella was available. An elderly couple with mobility issues had obviously pulled in on front of us and were struggling to make their way into reception with a relative.

We checked into our room and immediately arrived down to The Hound bar to watch the Irish Rugby match.  We just managed to find a seat as a couple were leaving, however a number of guests had to be turned away as there was no where for them to sit.  A single, minuscule 40-odd inch TV was available for the whole bar, making viewing difficult.

Having settled, a pint was ordered. We were feeling peckish from the journey down and had  requested to see the menu for a snack, however, no food was to be served “at all”!
At least the pint was decent!

We booked dinner in the Michelin Star restaurant, what was sold as a Gastronomical experience.  A three course meal with a bottle of wine, costing €237 was far from a gastronomical experience, however it was well cooked and presented.

Breakfast was nice, however again the coffee machine wasn’t working so only pressed coffee was available.

The room was nice, clean and modern, however let down again by a broken Nespresso machine.

A recurring theme for our visit, the 5 star experience is definitely not available at this hotel. €662 for a night in a standard room with breakfast and dinner is extremely pricey for at most a 4 star hotel.

Having stayed in similar 5 star hotels we are extremely disappointed with the “luxury”experience and lukewarm welcome. We will not be in a rush back, a night in the Shelbourne, Merrion or Westin is cheaper and more luxurious with a guaranteed 5 STAR service!",3,2022,03,13
239,Watch what you're charged for,"I very seldom write a review but I really  need to tell people to WATCH WHAT YOU ARE CHARGED FOR.  The first thing was that we were charged for our dinner twice  but this should have been included in the package, and then upon reviewing our visa we were charged twice. You are given the option to ring reception when you receive your bill by email and pay over the phone.  You need to double check the bill before you pay",3,2022,03,08
239,Assistant restaurant manager,"Excellent service, from the check in staff to the restaurant staff. Jacobo the assistant restaurant manager was very accommodating and took the time to chat to us and made us feel so welcome! He is the epitome of what good service is and so helpful. The room was beautiful and the food was amazing. Definitely going back.",5,2022,03,02
239,Can't wait to go back!,"Loved our stay at Mount Juliet Estate! Our only regret is that we didn't stay longer! We booked it last minute, travelling an extra 70km than planned, but it was so worth it. 

Arriving to complimentary warm cider at check-in made an instant impression! All staff were so helpful and welcoming but a special shout has to go out to Laura on the front desk at Hunter's Yard. Nothing was too much trouble and she answered my many Qs with a smile. She also delivered a birthday card to our room for my wife when we were at dinner!

Room was super and facilities were well kept. Bar was great with the fire lit (although if I'm being fussy the Guinness was just ok!) and restaurant was good too. Dinner was enjoyable but considering the price we maybe expected a bit better. Breakfast though was fantastic and we then relaxed in the bar area afterwards with the fire lit again. The breakfast manager (I think) popped his head in to check we were ok and brought us more complimentary tea/coffee.

The grounds are fantastic and we were given a tour on one of the hotel buggies - great fun and John give us the really interesting back story on the families that owned the estate over the years.

Can't wait to go back and see the redecorated bar in the manor house and the cinema room.

Thanks for a great stay!!",5,2022,02,28
239,Issue,"I stayed at Mount Juliet Estate from the 11th-13th of February 2022 in Hunter’s Yard and I am just writing to express my dissatisfaction with my stay.

Firstly, when on review of my bill on Sunday morning I noticed that meal that my partner had already paid for on Saturday night in The Hound Restaurant was charged to my room. This is unacceptable as I may not have reviewed my bill as I chose the option to pay as I go upon check in and this may have gone un noticed to me and therefore I potentially could have been charged twice.

Furthermore, on inspection of my bank account later on Sunday evening, I noticed that the meal that I had already paid for on Friday night at The Hound Restaurant was charged twice to my bank account. I have made contact with hotel, alerting you of this fact and I would like it rectified as soon as possible (Please find attached copy of my transactions).

Lastly, to increase my discontent, the service at breakfast on Sunday morning was absolutely appalling. We ordered a tea, a latte and some toast as we sat down to the table which took some time to come and when it came, it was the wrong order and the toast was freezing. I then proceeded to order 2 bacon and 2 sausages and my partner ordered French Toast. I had to ask the staff 4 times about our breakfast as every table that came after us was receiving their orders before ours and on the last request the breakfast came but to my dismay both breakfasts arrived on the same plate. I advised that the orders were supposed to be on separate plates and then to be then given a tiny saucer size plate to eat my breakfast from.",1,2022,02,28
239,Worth the drive. Little slice of heaven.,"Our favorite hotel in the country for this trip. Ciaran at the front of house helped us get some hurling tips from Jason, who was fabulous!! Kids loved it so much. Also, big thanks to Jason’s mom for the fantastic hurling rule book. Such a wonderful and memorable part of our trip. A special accommodation for us- great communication and flexibility!! This is how service is done!! It doesn’t get any better. 

The property is without fault. Beautiful lobby and warm apple cider on arrival. Feels like a brand new hunting lodge in the middle of a dream.  Could have spent a week here easily. Every single person was warm and welcoming and never made us feel like we were inconveniencing them. They have bikes to use, billiards, ping pong tables (all very high end) 

Francis in the golf pro shop was adorable and made time to chat with us about all things! Easy to approach and lovely all around. 

Rooms and Bathrooms were amazing. We were on the second floor and the bathrooms were like something out of a magazine. Even the carpeting in the rooms was top notch. Heated floors in the bathroom !! Elemis toiletries and loads of fluffy towels, slippers, robes, welcome gifts, waters, and kettle, coffee maker, real milk and sparkling and still water…full refrigerated bottles. 

This hidden gem is amazing - worth the trip!! 

Breakfast is in a room overlooking the golf course, which was stunning. Everything was amazing. Honestly cannot be faulted. Love love love.",5,2022,02,25
239,"Amazing team, beautiful location","Hard to know where to start but the team at Mount Juliet are amazing. Knowledgeable, available and helpful yet discrete and non obtrusive. 

That adds the beautiful surroundings and buildings that make up the estate. Lovely walks, lots of space and a very relaxed atmosphere. 

Don’t miss the new “Theatre” in the basement of the Manor House. We were the first to use it and had it to ourselves for the weekend. Cool bar beside it and a great place to chill if, like us, your busy life prevents you from ever relaxing in front of a movie. 

Thank you to Mark and his amazing team.",5,2022,02,17
239,Perfection,"From start to finish it was a perfect. Sharon and Mary at reception, together with Ciaran in Guest relations, made our stay absolutely amazing. 
We borrowed the bikes and cycled around. Had a late lunch in the Manor House, service was exquisite. Dinner and cocktails delicious.
Great experience. Already recommending to friends and family. We will come back for sure :) thank you, Mount Juliet team, you're fantastic 🌟",5,2022,02,06
239,Gorgeous hotel and wonderful staff,The staff can't so enough to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. Complimentary bikes were available to explore the estate. Afternoon tea in the manor house was gorgeous. Would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2022,02,01
239,An amazing stay and a perfect wedding,"It's difficult to write this review without sounding hyperbolic - but in all honesty, Mount Juliet is the best place I have ever stayed in my entire life. My wife and I held our small wedding at Mount Juliet last month, and we and all of our guests stayed in the Manor House. 

What really blew all of us away was the staff and the service. Our whole party unanimously agreed: we had never experienced better service anywhere, ever. I want to call out staff members by name, but I fear I'd miss someone. Every porter, server, receptionist and manager made us feel like we were the only guests there. I've never felt more welcome or at home in any hotel. In the interest of not writing a review the length of a novella, I'll not go into every instance of the above and beyond service we received, but I will say the level of professionalism, courtesy and kindness was noticed and commented on by every one of our guests.

The wedding itself went as smoothly as we could have hoped, thanks to everyone involved. It was so well coordinated we didn't have to do a thing but go with the flow - which was strikingly refreshing after a year of planning the event. It was truly the wedding of our dreams, and that is thanks to everyone at Mount Juliet. 

Since we've left, everyone has told us they want to go back. My wife and I echo the sentiment and look forward to our next visit there. Needless to say, I could not recommend any hotel more than I can recommend Mount Juliet.

239,Fantastic,"We had a wonderful stay in Mount Juliet, we were treated like royalty by every member of staff from the moment we arrived. 
We enjoyed world class food in the restaurant at the Hunters Yard for two nights. 
The estate is simply stunning and we loved the walks around the grounds. 
I had a wonderful massage at the spa which I throughly enjoyed. 
Thank you for a wonderful weekend.",5,2022,01,24
239,Fab stay and child friendly,"We had a truly wonderful stay on December 27. We stayed in hunters lodge and we were upgraded to a garden view room. I am platinum elite with Marriott and benefits were recognized. We were assigned late check out too which was so helpful with a 3 month old who needs specific nap times! Loved that they had a specific baby changing room and a room with a microwave and sterilizer if you need for little ones. Staff were so attentive, friendly and helpful, we definitely will be back and can’t wait.",5,2022,01,03
239,Exceptional staff service went above and beyond Food excellent,"Wonderful welcome of mulled wine and hot chocolate 
Then Dave and Robert went above and beyond caring for me and my parents)  Superb staff Robert was so considerate drove my Dad around on the golf cart gave us a lovely tour and got a lovely fire going for my Dad when we were at the spa Exceptional food and loved the pool Cannot wait to come again!)",5,2021,12,13
239,Stormy Arrival,"Arrived during Storm Barra, thought we would have to cancel but not a second time, had to cancel last year due to Covid Lockdown. It was worth the wait. From start to finish staff were brilliant and attentive, could not do enough to ensure stay was excellent.
 Hotel facilities are great, and lovely spacious bedroom, and only regret is that we did not stay longer, its a beautiful estate with lots to do if you want to be kept active, or just relax.
The Hound restaurant was also great for evening meal and again staff really attentive.
Breakfast was in the Hound and lovely once again. Everything you would expect at a hotel like this and more.
Would definetly recommend and we have already booked a visit in Feb for my sons birthday.",5,2021,12,12
239,Mr Patrick W Guinan,"Good morning. 
Had occasion to stay on grounds of mount juliet Estate recently on a business trip.
I found the hound restaurant in hunters yard very expensive. 
We had dinner costing 33 euros for main course and no vegetables or potatoes for this price. 
We proceeded to order sides and each side cost 4.50 euros. 
I find these prices way out of line with similar high quality hotels. 
The service and staff were excellent except for the overall prices.",2,2021,12,09
239,24hrs of  bliss,"Myself and my friend booked in for one night, to catch up over dinner and relax. What can I say, from the moment we checked in to when we  checked out, we had the most wonderful time. The staff are what make this hotel, everyone of them wonderful and eager to help . A true asset to the  hotel and would make me return.
 
We wandered up to the Manor house ( we were staying in the Hunters Yard ) for a pre  dinner drink, and when we were finished the barman arranged for us to get a lift back down  in time for dinner in the Hound, the food was AMAZING.  With my starter I had some Guinness bread, and when I enquired about it, the waitress returned with an envelope containing the recipe ! 
Next morning after a wonderful leisurely breakfast , we headed for a swim ... well really a sit in the sauna and a  dip in the pool, before  checking out. Although it was only a 24 hr stay , I felt so relaxed and recharged.  I will be back, see you in the  New year,  and Thank you !",5,2021,12,08
239,Like Returning To Stay With An Old Friend,"My husband and I had a most enjoyable stay in Hunters yard last Sunday. 
The staff were warm and welcoming and did everything to ensure we were well looked after.
The hotel adhered to covid guidelines with mask wearing at all times and plenty of hand sanitisers.
That said there was still a lovely relaxed atmosphere.
It is one of our favourite times to visit Mount Juliet. The estate is always beautifully dressed for Christmas.
A big thank you to the general manager and the wonderful staff.
Look forward to returning in 2022",5,2021,11,30
239,Dinner in The Hound,"Wow, just had dinner in The Hound at Mount Juliet. Followed recommendation from our host, Tadhg, who recommended the Cote de Boeuf. What an amazing experience and Tadhg was there throughout the meal making sure we were good. What a great meal and a great host. Thank you Mount Juliet and thank you Tadhg. Top marks.",5,2021,11,28
239,Amazing from start to finish,Have stayed in quite a few hotels over the years yet none impressed me as much as mount juliett so much so that I contacted them on the Monday for a return quote!! The spa was fab - food superb- hotel cleanliness and ambience amazing!! I can’t wait to go back,5,2021,11,27
239,VIP Treatment,"We decided to stay here for the night to enjoy a little luxury we hadn't yet experienced on our trip and this establishment did not disappoint. From the moment we checked in we were treated as valued guests. Somebody went to our car to collect our bags and brought them to our room, which was very specious even with two queen beds. The front desk made reservations for us at Hunters for that evening. People wore masks throughout the property and in the restaurants unless seated. You could tell that restaurant staff was still learning as they seamed to be new, so we allowed some forgiveness on that end, but the main manager on the floor was always making sure everything met our needs, which they did.",5,2021,11,04
239,Very disappointing,"On a plus the grounds are amazing .Unfortunatly thats where the plus ends for us. 
Most importantly in the world we live in with Covid19 my wife and I , she is a nurse , were appalled at the lack of focus here. Not once were we asked for our vaccination certs . Even on check in .On Saturday , in particular , the golf course and hotel were quite busy and while dining in Jacks and having a drink later in the hound yet again no one was checking for vaccination certs. Now as I remember it recent changes did not drop the requirements for certs and contact tracing for indoor dining. Also a lot of guests moving around without wearing masks and no one addressing this issue. Individuals must take personnel responsibility but the hotel also has a duty of care.
Moving on as a 5 star hotel it sadly lacks luxury. We have stayed in many all over the country and this I fear is the poorest. There is no where to sit and relax or to read as the only option here is the bar or your room. The décor in our room was quite cold and with timber floors not what you class as luxurious. Something also that is very very poor is that you have to go out in the weather to access a bar or restaurant. How mad is that.  
Not very good value for money .",3,2021,11,01
239,Magical Irish Getaway,"My girlfriend and I spent a week at this wonderful property in rural Ireland.  We were seeking somewhere upscale and rural, and this definitely hit the spot.  We stayed in the ""Manor House"", and enjoyed the lovely river view and witnessed several shooting stars in the pitch dark sky.  Daily breakfast was delicious and varied, but had a particularly stellar dinner at The Hound.  Truly amazing Sea Bass, perhaps best I've ever had.  Spa facilities are top notch, and massages were excellent.  We intend on returning next year.",5,2021,10,25
239,Disappointed and waste of money,"We stayed for 4 nights, what a waste of money. The grounds were beautiful that was the only positive of our whole experience. Breakfast/dinner was burnt and the attitude we were met with was poor. We weren't offered fruit to start or coffee etc, only got it upon noticing other guests getting it, staff constantly forgetting our order and mixing things up. We weren't the only guests feeling this way, from chat with other couples we gathered this. It was for a special occasion and we have stayed in many 5 stars but there was absolutely no comparison. I understand covid is difficult with staff etc but the level of training with staff was no where near 5 star, and actually wasn't even fair on the staff themselves. Overheard the couple on the next table asking the staff had they even any training to which they just laughed. We went to the Manor House for lunch 2 days and that was a lovely experience but just highlighted how poor the Hunters Yard was. On the first night we were double booked for a table so asked to leave after 45 minutes, I understand human error but this was something we had really looked forward to. Basically felt like a waste of our money, we could have had a very similar experience in a 2 star hotel for a fraction of the price. After our first night we were just disappointed we had committed to another 3 nights. We love to play tennis - the grounds were in no way safe or suitable for play. We arrived down 2 mornings to people having made bookings - despite us asking at reception twice if we needed any booking. Overall a very disappointing experience that tainted a special occasion, that we still think of months later..",1,2021,10,21
239,Disappointing Customer Service,"I wanted to book an Afternoon Tea here for Christmas.  I emailed as I am in the UK and advised of the amount of people,  date and time desired.  I got an email confirmation back with the wrong time so I replied questioning this.  I just got the same confirmation email back.  After emailing again I advising that the time they gave me isnt suitable and if they dont have availability for the time requested,  I will jot be able to go ahead with the booking.  Following this I received a cancellation email.  No explanation,  no apologies,  just what looked like an automated cancellation.   I was already annoyed at this stage but the following day I receive an email asking me about a cake I have ordered for my daughters birthday.  I don't have a daughter!!  So throughout this whole correspondence the only time I get an email from an actual member of staff is an email for someone else!  Appalling customer service and I expect more from a 5 start hotel.  Disappointed as I have never had issues with Mount Juliet before.",1,2021,10,19
239,Beautiful Irish Country Estate 5 Stars,"Stand out country hotel and estate in beautiful Irish landscape. The friendly welcome and staff make this place even more special. There is an array of activities no need to leave the grounds everything and everyone is catered for.  We have been coming here for years and I must say this year was stand out and it was the staff that sealed the deal. 
My two girls spent hours wandering the grounds, looking at the horses, swimming, outdoor table tennis, snooker and great fun in the outdoor playground. 
Breakfast is 5 star and I’m loving the non buffet experience. 😍
Five star luxury Irish country retreat an hour and half from Dublin that won’t disappoint 🥰",5,2021,10,17
239,Perfect Birthday treat,"I booked this as a birthday surprise for my husband's 50th, we stayed in the Hunters yard just because I preferred the modern but classic rooms compared to the mannor house's decor.

We ate in both the hound restaurant and the Lady Helen restaurant, both meals were fabulous!

The 7 course tasting menu with wine pairing is an absolute must! My husband wouldn't be as into fine dining as me as he likes a big dinner with spuds! But even he enjoyed every course. We originally weren't going to go with the wine pairing but so glad we changed our minds as I really do think it made it more of an experience to remember.
(photos are of the menu and the courses I remembered to take a photo of before I tucked in) 

We had treatments booked with the spa but unfortunately my husband came down with a bit of a head cold so decided in light of covid19 he would cancel his massage, this was easily done and the staff in the spa were very understanding. I had the hot stone back treatment by the lovely Angela that was fantastic.

All the staff were so friendly and helpful, I had read quite a few reviews commenting on how rude and unhelpful the staff were... I seriously think these people were staying at a different hotel!!!

The room we stayed in was a garden veiw king room (room 215) and it was such a gorgeous room, we had both a large shower and a bath tub. 
My only complaint was that it wasn't actually a king bed but two singles together, but that is such a minor complaint it's hardly worth mentioning.",5,2021,10,16
239,Overall poor service,"The grounds of the estate and the rooms themselves were beautiful, clean and well kept. 

Unfortunately the service was very poor. While the staff were friendly overall there were many instances where it was clear that the vast majority of the staff were both new and badly trained. A good example is one morning our breakfasts (room service) not showing up and it taking 3 separate calls at reception to get a response from the restaurant to get breakfast sent to us. Additionally many of the staff at dinners were unable to help or answer basic questions about the food, menu items etc. Which considering the price of meals and the overall stay was both surprising and less than ideal.

A highlight of the trip was our meal at Lady Helen’s - which was spectacular - and our archery class with Shane, who was both great craic and an excellent teacher.",2,2021,10,16
239,Brilliant family stay,"First class stay at this brilliant hotel. Everything from the welcome at reception was to the standard expected at a 5 star hotel. The breakfast was brilliant and they even remembered where we had sat the morning before to give us the same table. The grounds are fantastic and the playground for the kids was a welcome bonus. We sat outside for dinner and we’re able to watch people on the practice golf course. We attended the pool each day with our kids and the place was being constantly cleaned the entire time we were there, we always felt safe. Really enjoyed our stay.",5,2021,10,15
239,Fabulous 5* break,"Myself and my husband stayed in the hunters lodge for our anniversary and it really was a treat. We arrived early and had a lovely lunch in the Manor House decor and all was lovely. From check in the service was top class Mary on reception was so nice. Our room was lovely the bed was so comfy, pro was the heated floor in the bathroom con some shelves in the room for clothes badly needed. Dinner in the hound was lovely but definitely the menu could do with an update neither of us are fussy eaters but not one starter was appealing so we opted for a steak and dessert the food I cannot complain about. Breakfast was lovely then a swim the pool was quiet and spotlessly clean. The big draw is the grounds we had a lovely walk all around followed by lunch in the hound. Dinner was in the clubhouse again a point missing for the food menu was nice but it tasted reheated very disappointing. This was followed by lovely drinks in a comfy cosy bar. All in all fab stay staff where amazing but the menu/food could do with an overhaul. We will definitely be back",4,2021,10,11
239,Luxury Accentuated,"Currently having a 3 night break and i can only describe it as the relaxation break of dreams. The staff are incredibly friendly and the rooms are extremely comfortable and well designed.
As 5* hotels go, this one if not fussy or pretentious but relaxed and calm. 
Had a treatment yesterday with Maureen in the spa and it was possibly the best hot stone massage i have ever had.
We had dinner in the club house, and in the hound and both experiences were great. We had wanted to book dinner in the Manor House but the chef takes Sunday and Monday off (rightly so), we were just annoyed with ourselves that we didn't forward plan and book for Saturday night. The club house was casual and relaxed and the hound was more formal and obviously more expensive. 
Breakfast has been tasty but a little disappointing in regards to selection. Cereals, or fruit would be a nice option. 
The pool is really nice but could do with a little update or a good cleaning in the dressing room / shower. 
Aside from my criticism, i can't wait to return and I will be recommending to friends and family.",5,2021,10,11
239,A beautiful hotel and location just missing in a few key areas to make it outstanding,"So first the great bits about the Manor is its stunning location overlooking the river and beautiful downstairs lounge areas and dining room and outside sitting.
The Lady Helen Michelin restaurant was outstanding and each of the courses a real delight and they catered for my wife who is a pescatarian with an equally outstanding tasting menu. All the staff were also friendly and responsive.
So the reason for no outstanding rating was the fact they just missed too many things that give you that 5* especially at these prices. The room was tired and the bath /shower having mold on the wall. The bed and sheets just weren't as good as all the other 5* we stayed in, the Henry hoover at the top of the stairs that we have to walk past every day, the fact the room wasn't turned down (all these points were raised with reception) So great estate, great golf and great food but just not 100%",4,2021,10,09
239,A Perfect Stay!,"My wife and I stayed for one night in Hunters Yard.  I really wish it was for longer  We had a very relaxing stay from start to finish.  The grounds are beautiful and it was a very pleasant experience, slowly walking around the estate and taking in the beautiful surroundings.  Our babysitter was unavailable last minute so we had to bring our 10 month son.  The excellent staff quickly arranged a Garda-Vetted baby-sitter for us who stayed in our room which allowed us to have evening dinner and drinks.  The extremely professional staff truly did save the day!  The service was  excellent and it really did feel like a treat.  We will be back and next time will stay for more than one night for sure!",5,2021,10,02
239,Relaxed 5 Star Experience,"Myself and my husband stayed at Hunter's Yard for one night in September.  It was truly a fabulous relaxing experience.  We arrived early but were lucky to be able to check in.  We then strolled up to the Manor House and enjoyed a lovely lunch in the bar there.  After lunch we walked for hours around the estate, meeting a fisherman on the river and having a chat, which was lovely.  Our dinner was booked in The Hound for 7.30 so we had a drink beforehand on the terrace there.  It was lovely looking out over the golf course in the evening sunshine.  Dinner was part of a package and we really enjoyed it.  To round the evening off we walked back up to the Manor House, just a five minute walk and had a nightcap in the bar, served by a lovely Basque lady.  It was warm in the bar so we sat at the back of the house where there were rattan tables and chairs.  It was a beautiful evening and in the quiet darkness you could just hear the river below the house.  The next morning after a swim in the fabulous pool we had a table on the terrace in The Hound for breakfast served by another lovely lady.  The breakfast was delicious.  All the staff were friendly, chatty and courteous.  We could not fault our stay.  We will definitely return.",5,2021,09,30
239,We Miss Our Ann Marie,"We spent 5 wonderful nights in August.  Great experience at check-in and helpful staff at the Manor House assisting with bags both at check-in and check-out.  Very nice gentleman took my wife and I down to Hunter's Yard by cart and told us about the grounds and hotel on the short trip.  

We ate a late lunch in Major's Bar shortly after check-in and that is when we first met Ann Marie.  Ann Marie provided excellent service and made us feel most welcome.  We ate several meals at Majors Bar and breakfast at Lady Helen's.  With the exception of her one day off, Ann Marie was there to greet us and make sure we were properly taken care of.  Food was excellent at both.

Had an opportunity to play a round of golf during our stay.  It was a great experience on a great course.  Club house staff were friendly and prompt providing club rental.  Facilities were excellent and starter was extremely friendly and helpful.  What a pleasure to play the course.

Don't miss an opportunity to walk the beautiful grounds on the estate.

Only regret is that we did not capture the names of all the staff that treated us as valued guests.  Thank you to Ann Marie and the great staff we encountered during our special time at Mount Juliet!",5,2021,09,22
239,"Lovely hotel, except bar service","We stayed at Hunters Lodge which is a lovely hotel and the accommodation and setting lived up to it’s description. Our room was a little dark but otherwise great. The reception staff were extremely helpful which included running us into Thomastown to meet relatives. The only issue we had was with the service provide in the bar, particularly from one of the barmen who was downright rude. After waiting some time to be served he eventually wandered over. My husband asked what the special craft and the barman looked at him as if he was an idiot and just pointed at the beer pump (as if we could read it from that distance). His attitude was extremely poor and totally lacking in customer care. I think the other barman tried to compensate for his behaviour by offering us a drink we hadn’t ordered (and didn’t want). It wasn’t the ending to our last evening at the hotel I’d expected",4,2021,09,16
239,Light years from 4 or 5 star,"I have stayed here dozens of times over the years but despite the changes in infrastructure the service has gone incredibly backwards, 
Prior to booking it was difficult to get an answer on the phone
Checkin was awkward and clumsy, only 4 of us in 2 rooms but incredibly difficult and a waste of time.
Golf course was excellent as always, my favourite course in the country. 
Food in clubhouse was very nice and service was good
Food in the Hound restaurant was good but grossly overpriced 
Rooms were lovely but showers only have a half door so floor gets flooded
Checkout was difficult and badly handled
Unfortunately I lift a couple of chargers behind me and they could not have been more unhelpful - 3 unanswered emails and 3 unanswered phone calls later and then they couldn’t be bother helping to locate them, it seems they just disappeared into thin air
Overall the golf is great but I’ve stayed there for the last time which is sad after dozens of visits over last 20 years or more
Will definitely return to play the course but until they get rid of the chain and revert bad to a well run personal hotel I won’t stay again 
Checkout was painful",2,2021,09,09
239,Not  5 Star Experience,"Stayed her with a group of friends when hotels reopened in July. 
Unfortunately we did not get the quality of food and more specifically the level of service that we would expect from a 5 star hotel. 

Starting with a positive - the receptionists on the desk at our check in/out were absolutely lovely. They worked so promptly and nothing would have been to big an ask for them.  Unfortunately this is the only time throughout our stay that we felt this.

We went over to the bar for lunch (@1pm) - when we arrived, there was no staff to be seen. 15 minutes later after awkwardly lingering at the door as we did not want to sit ourselves- we took a seat and then were greeted by  by a barman who didnt even know if they were serving. I had a spa treamtement at 2 - but almost an hour after being there we finally recieved menus so I had to leave while the rest of our group stayed for lunch.

It then took another 40mins to get x3 bowls of soup..this is unaccpetable in any bar/restaurant let alone waiting 1hr 40 for x3 bowls of soup in a 5 star resort.

We had a 3 course dinner on our package. The food in general was tasty-  with one steak being slighlty over cooked but the main issue we had was the service. I understand that the hospitality industry have greatly suffered during COVID and would like to highlight that hotels were only open 2-3 weeks at this stage so hopefully service has since improved; but for us - at no stage was our food quality checked, we sat with empty glasses for over an hour and we were also shocked to hear that you cant get a cocktail after 5pm?? This was mind boggling - and after struggling to get a bowl of soup at lunch - I cant imagine ordering a cocktail before 5pm would have gone well either. 

At breakfast, again we recieved slow service - it took 40 mins to get a pot of tea. Portions were tiny and if I had of been paying full price for breakfast I would have been horrified.

Hoping a lot of it was down to teething/reopening issues because the rooms and the grounds were absolutely spectacular but overall we were left feeling very underwhelmed by our experiences.",2,2021,09,09
239,9 courses to heaven,"Celebrated our wedding anniversary here with a 1 night stay in the Manor House and the 7 course tasting menu.  Check in was fast and our room was ready early, we where brought up to our room by a lovely fella who lives close to me in waterford, I'm sorry I can't think of his name. The room is small but it was lovely and cosy with views out to the garden. There was a lovely bottle of red wine waiting for us that was much appreciated. Dinner that night was in the lady Helen, we upgraded to the 9 course tasting menu with wine pairings. Wow, would highly recommend if you love your food and wine, but done eat or drink much beforehand as I really struggled after course 6 and had to get the rest of it sent to the room which again was really appreciated. The Manor House itself is just so beautiful and cosy would of loved to stay longer one night just isn't enough. ",5,2021,09,05
239,"If you like 5 star cuisine, don't visit on Mondays","This was my first time staying at Mount Juliet and the setting is really beautiful.  The grounds are lovely and whether you are a walker, golfer or runner there is plenty of space to be out in the open.  Really very lovely.

The rooms were good too with tea/coffee making, little bottles of shampoo, lotion etc., iron and plenty of plugs for devices.  In these covid times they also provided sanitising wipes in the room which was good.

Where it falls down badly though is the Lady Helen restaurant which is supposed to be Michelin star.  We ate there on a Monday night and it was a comedy of errors.  First of all we found we had been given two very different menus.  When we queried this, we were told one was a childrens' menu (€65 euros set menu!) and that the other menu was the correct one.  They replaced the ""childrens' menu"" with another menu, but again, they were different - one having sirloin steak and one with fillet steak!!   When we queried it, we were told again that there had been a mistake and the sirloin steak was the correct menu.  

The menu was really limited - sirloin steak, lamb, linguini or salmon.  I don't eat red meat and as most vegetarians know pasta is not very exciting as a vegetarian menu (the childrens' menu just had penne pasta).  So I opted for the salmon.  We were then told, no the salmon wasn't on the menu either, that there had been a mistake and the fish was, in fact, cod.  There was no price change at €29.  

I am not a big fish eater and really not a cod eater, but in the absence of anything else I asked for a half portion of cod.  The cod was cooked fine, but came with no sauce, just two tiny dots of a lime decoration on the plate and green beans.  Honestly I would have cooked it better at home and I am not a great cook!  

I understand the Michelin star chef doesn't work on Mondays, so as I say if you are expecting the Michelin experience, wait until Tuesday.  But the food was gastropub food at best and really disappointing.  In other similar places there is a fuss made of the meal - you usually got a little pot with a mixture of vegetables or something.  It was just very poor.

I know all hotels are struggling with staff at the moment, but many staff seemed to be new and stuck rigidly to hotel training.  As a result you didn't get the warmth you normally get from a 5 star place.

Overall, disappointing.",3,2021,09,01
239,Relaxing atmosphere ,"Spent the night in the hotel last night and had a fantastic time. The bedroom was perfect, lovely swimming pool, and great drinks in The Hound Bar.

Dined in the golf club and were made feel right at home by Eddie and his waiting staff. Very attentive, friendly and good craic. Could not compliment the staff highly enough!

Had calamari, chicken wings, steak sandwich and chicken curry. All unbelievably good....and good value too. Highly recommend the golf club.",5,2021,08,24
239,"A hotel in Transition, with some tough decisions to make…….",It’s decision time MJ needs to decide if it is a wedding venue with access to Manor House ( like Tankardstown/Castle Leslie) or a five star hotel ( like Adare/Drumoland/Ashford Castle) at moment it is certainly not a 5 star hotel with top facilities and resources available mainly to resident guests and not golfers/day trippers /and wedding guests - though staff are excellent they are young and undergoing training in ramp up post Covid period but far more worrying hotel rooms are poor and usual facilities seem to have been sold off to independently run  entities ( golf club/ equestrian/ hunters lodge etc) even main entrance is closed,3,2021,08,22
239,Wonderful Staff,"My wife and I had a wonderful stay in Mount Juliet.  It was my wife’s birthday and they even left a complimentary bottle of wine and a box of chocolates as a gift for her.

239,Not a 5 star at all! ,"Stayed here recently and I would honestly not return. I wish I had checked trip advisor before staying I really was expecting a 5 star experience which we did not receive at all.

When we arrived the check in the experience wasn’t over all great from the minute we arrived, room was late etc. The room we got was ok and was a bit on the grubby side and this was in the manor house, we weren’t overly impressed have stayed in nicer 4 stars around the country and abroad. 

We had dinner in the hunters yard and we both agreed it was not the nicest it was average being honest. We had to ask for the same drinks 5 times and our plates after we finished even after starters were left in the table for around 30 mins. 

If you stay in the manor house you have to go to hunters yard for the pool and after staying in a really well known 5 star in limerick where there was a max of 2 people in the pool I was shocked to walk in to yes a bigger pool but when I counted there were 6 adults and around 8 children running and jumping into the pool you could barely find an area to relax. 

Look it’s has nice gardens and you can go for a stroll but when your paying over €500 for a room per night it needs to be at 5 star level and mount julliet just doesn’t have it. ",3,2021,08,08
239,Beautiful location,"We had a wonderful overnight stay in mount juliette  we stayed in the manor house it is very relaxing and has a lovely ambience the bedrooms are lovely and a very comfortable  bed,we ate in lady Helen's restaurant, it was amazing  the food was delicious and the staff are very professional,the views from the hotel are spectacular also there are fabulous  walks to enjoy,if you want somewhere  special  to visit I highly  recommend  mount juliette",5,2021,08,07
239,Enjoyable Visit,"Stayed here last week and really enjoyed our visit .
We stayed in Hunters Yard and were really happy with our room .
You can go for a walk around the estate and the walled garden is most impressive.
Breakfast on each morning was   excellent  and staff very friendly and helpful .
We had Dinner out on the balcony in the Hound Restaurant one evening and it was outstanding with a great menu and food was top class .
 I must give a special mention to Jimmy Fitzgerald who could not do enough to make people feel more welcome .",5,2021,07,30
239,Golf society,"Course was in great condition just a couple of weeks after hosting the Irish open,considering the crowds and equipment etc placed around the course. The Starter was a lovely guy who went over everything with us.
Rang the halfway house to order food before playing the 9th no veggie burger or no meat options ah come on in this day and age.
The staff in the clubhouse were young and pleasant but had very little experience and this showed in the service,it took me close on 10 mins to pay for a mineral as they didn’t know the pin for the till and then the WiFi was acting up. Where was the duty manager to help them ?
I was starving after the golf and the portions were kid’s portions, it’s a clubhouse where golfers go so increase the size and everybody’ happy. We all Loved the course but said next year we will head away rather then having food there just not worth it for the price. 
Note : speeds bumps and “stop if golfers are on the 17th tee box are needed in both directions as when on the 17th cars are flying past not only is it off putting but it’s an accident waiting to happen.

Golf course 5 stars
Halfway house options 1 star
Clubhouse food and service 2 stars",3,2021,07,24
239,Outstanding!!,"Spent a day at Mount Juliet Estate this week and I must say I was highly impressed. From the impecible condition of the golf course to the staff and service at the Hunters Yard, I genuinley couldnt find a fault. Would recommended to any freinds, for both a golf trip or even just a weekend away, MJ Estate has it all. Keep up the good work!!",5,2021,07,22
239,Wonderful experience.,"This is our second visit to MJ. We loved it the first time and adored it second time round. Both visits were with some Covid restrictions were in place. MJ have ironed out any issues they had in 2020 (such as breakfast service) and the stay this time felt safe, welcoming and first class. The staff were fantastic! Many of them young but so incredibly professional and exceptionally friendly. 
We have to say a word about the company providing the electric bikes. This was the highlight of the trip! Such brilliant guys and a unique offering for a hotel. Absolutely fantastic!!
We hit the driving range, used the pool, played table tennis, walked and indulged in the delicious food on offer. Didn’t need to leave the site once! All in all an exceptional experience. Thank you to the whole staff team.",5,2021,07,16
239,"Amazing meal, cannot fault a thing.","Lady Helen was great - staff, service and food, cannot fault a thing, really enjoyed. Breakfast and Dinner! Also enjoyed our stay overall in Mount Juliet..  what a setting and what a beautiful house (we stayed in the Manor House).",5,2021,07,05
239,Extremely Disappointing - Staff very nice but poor service overall,"I stayed here shorting after re opening for a family event and was willing to accept some teething problems as a result of this. But overall this was poor value of money and the more I think the worse it gets considering the cost. This is a 5 star hotel with no where near 5 star service. This was a really disappointing given the family occasion it was. 

As highlight the staff are all very nice and helpful which did make it a pleasant experience and made us feel guilty complaining but in summary they were not in a position to reopen and should not have accepted the numbers if unable to provide the service.

The warning sign cam as we were checking in a guest was checking out and they were listing a list of complaints - I thought there is always one!

For reference we stayed in Hunters Yard - no complaints with the room or reception staff.

We had lunch in the Hound and it was pleasant but slow. The issues arose in the evening.

Firstly before dinner I had to wait 45 mins to get a drink after asking 4 times for some service - it was obvious there was not enough staff. We had dinner booked for 8 and on arrival table was not ready. We were asked to sit at the bar ordered a drink while the dinner table become available at approximately 8:35.

Table was booked for 6 people but we were clearly given a table for 4 with 2 seats at the end unable to move because of tables behind. Really annoying considering the table was booked for months in advance.

We ordered wine with the dinner order but by 9pm not only had the wine not arrived but neither had the drinks we order at 8:10 before sitting down!! There was no water glasses and basically no one available to ask for anything as all were running around. We eventually had to go to the Maitre' D to get some drinks and request water.

The food when it arrived was very good - and the kitchen seemed to be working efficiently with no delay in food - we just got out starters the same time as our aperitive. 

Similar experience for dessert when we ordered a cocktail. The desserts arrived but cocktail was delayed and we eventually got 40 mins later. 

We were all on a package but I discovered the whole dinner bill for all 6 of us on my room the next morning - obviously no details take on seating made it difficult but reception were helpful and removed the food from the bill.

On check out 2 other rooms were also making complaints and the reception desk were nice and helpful and did their best. They mentioned they would pass on the experience we had but that was the last we heard.

However for a 5 star hotel, despite the current environment it was a disaster. I was planning on staying again later in the year with the kids or for a weekend away but there are too many other places where I would rather now go and feel confident of getting the expected level of service.",2,2021,06,28
239,Lovely nite away,"Myself and my husband stayed at Hunters Yard in Mount Juliet.   The room was lovely and very comfortable bed.  The grounds are great as well and lovely walks there.   The staff there are really nice and very efficient.   We found this in all areas of the hotel which really makes a huge difference.
The food was just okay but we still really enjoyed our stay overall and would recommend this hotel.   On the day we stayed,  there was a really well known radio and tv presenter also staying there so this also highlights what a nice place Mount Juliet is",4,2021,06,26
239,Not a true Five Star,"My wife and I are just back from a two night stay in the Hunters Yard. Overall we had a lovely time , the staff most of whom were very young were very good and friendly. On our first night a Thurs night we went into Saddlers Bar , my wife wanted a Cosmopolitan cocktail but we were told that “Brian the mixologist had gone home” for a Five Star hotel this is not really good enough when nobody else could make one.
The room was good but not five star compared to the room we had at Powerscourt .The sheets were not changed for our second night and whilst I recognise COVID  restrictions it is still a lot of money €450 per night to pay for not getting this done.
The food in both restaurants was very good quality but the breakfast was only Luke warm.
The attention to detail and the room size and quality was just not there to justify a five star rating compared to the likes of Powerscourt , Lough Eske and Lough Erne.",4,2021,06,26
239,A relaxing stay,"We had a lovely two night stay. Enjoyed all aspects of the hotel. Lovely relaxed atmosphere. Excellent service and staff. Excellent food in both restaurants, with our meal in the Lady Helen being the highlight.",5,2021,06,19
239,Not 5 star worthy,"We stayed as a couple overnight in June at Hunters Lodge. The room was very good.
We had booked dinner at the Hound but had been directed incorrectly by reception earlier in the day to what turned out to be the back entrance. We entered and were left standing in the restaurant until we approached a waiter at a till and he directed us to the lady who was looking after tables. It was 8.25 and we had booked for 8.30. The table was not ready so we had to wait in the bar until we were called. Although we had some delay at the beginning of the meal, our waiter was very accommodating. His name was Andrew I think.

At breakfast the next morning, we were not offered toast and although I ordered it from a waitress it never arrived. Coffees were delivered without a teaspoon. 
Given the price charged, I expected a more upmarket and professional service.",4,2021,06,17
239,Fantastic stay lovely grounds,"Fantastic stay , beautiful surroundings and great staff.  My wife thoroughly enjoyed the horse riding particularly Freddie the horse she was given for her trek around the beautiful grounds.  We’d a great time and look forward to returning.  The food was fantastic and the service the staff were lovely.",5,2021,06,16
239,Attention to detail!,"Visited Hunters Yard week 2 after Reopening. Fantastic resort, building layout and housekeeping really excellent. Enjoyed the grounds and walks really impressed.
Dined in the Clubhouse and the Hound and it just let the experience down. The staff, most of whom are genuinely lovely are so inexperienced and quality of food was variable and the service at times chaotic, not really good enough at this level. Overall, I look forward to coming back but management need to work on training and service standards…. this is a special place that deserves that special finish!",3,2021,06,15
239,Friendly Staff,We stayed in Mount Juliet recently and were made most welcome by the receptionists! They were exceptionally helpful and always smiling and friendly! We had a small problem with our room as there was noise from some external machine and we requested a move which was sorted very quickly! The restaurant and bar staff were also very helpful especially Ger in the bar who was really enthusiastic and good humoured! Couldn’t do half enough for you! Will be back !,4,2021,06,15
239,"Fab stay, highly recommend","We’ve just returned from 3 nights in Mount Juliet and were really impressed. The rooms were great - stayed in Hunters Yard and super comfy. The whole place is really well set up for kids - gorgeous grounds, fairy garden, playground and the swimming pool is great. Food was excellent and in particular had dinner in the Manor which was outstanding. The hotel helped arrange babysitting and also a nod to the children’s afternoon tea which was a real treat for the kids. We’ve stayed in lots of hotels in Ireland with our kids and this was top class. Will be back!",5,2021,06,07
239,Spa treatments AMAZING,Had two treatments with Valerie She was amazing so professional. I had reflexology one day which showed up stress in shoulder area which she worked on the following day.  I left the salon on both days very happy and so relaxed. Back in August and will be booking with Valerie again,5,2021,06,05
239,Overnight Stay in Mount Juliet,"We had an overnight break in Mount Juliet just before Christmas and from the moment we arrived until the moment we left the care and warmth shown to us was unbelievable. With the restrictions, we feared it would be quite stressful but the staff couldn’t have been more helpful and made us feel relaxed and at home. It was just what we needed. Naia and Patrick went above and beyond and we booked a return trip before we checked out. 

The room was beautiful,  immaculately clean, cosy and warm. We had lunch in front of the fire in the main house. The food was beautiful, staff attentive and atmosphere very relaxing. Dinner in the Hunters Yard was a lovely experience. Looking forward to our return trip already!!",5,2021,01,24
239,Unhelpful,"I had booked to stay here during the month of January, before the booking got cancelled due to covid, I rang the hotel prior to inquire if they knew whether or not my booking would be cancelled or not or if I should reschedule, it was met with a very rude lady. She was just short of laughing at me when I asked if they knew whether the hotel would be closing or not. She was very short with me, rude and condescending. 

As it was a gift, I have already told the receiver they would be staying here, yet I’m debating to go elsewhere. If this is the reception customers get, I wonder how it must be in person. I’m terribly disappointed as this is my first encounter with this supposedly 5 star hotel.",1,2021,01,10
239,Disappointed at their customer service,"I have stayed at mount Juliet several times it’s gorgeous. Rooms are lovely , service is good & grounds are stunning. We are loyal and returning customers and have celebrated many family occasions. I booked their black
Friday rate as Xmas presents for my family for the end of January. The stay was cancelled under the current restrictions which I completely understand but the hotel
Won’t honour the stay for a different date. I followed up with an email 5 days ago to which I have not received a response. It’s very embarrassing to have to go back to family and explain. After spending some much money over the years in this hotel it’s disappointing and to not even acknowledge my email.",1,2021,01,08
239,Pre Christmas Break,"Have frequented Mount Juliet a number of times over the past 15/20 years or so, it has always been a favourite. we have stayed in the main House and in Hunters Yard.  Mount Juliet is aimed at the upper end of the scale and previously, lived up to that expectation.  This time, however, we were disappointed with certain aspects. 

We stayed in Hunters Yard, lovely warm room, on the ground floor.  There was not window in the room, a huge big double door looking out onto a green, but no access to fresh air without compromising security.  Furthermore, there was no privacy in the room, we either had to draw the big blackout curtains (not nice during the day) or anyone passing by could see in.  Some net /voile curtains I suggest. 
On the surface, Covid policies were excellent, unfortunately, this did not make it's way through practically. Tables in the Hound were not spaced out as they should have been, and still contained items that remained on the table from one customer to another. This we feel, was an un-necessary contact. 
 We ordered our wine and drinks, but our starter arrived before our wine. I asked that our starters be kept until we had our wine (expensive red wine which would need time after opening), the waiter walked around with our food in his hands, then plonked our plates on the table when the wine arrived.  Really not the standard of service expected or pitched at this venue. Perhaps new staff in need of training.
 Our breakfast table was actually dirty when we were seated, sticky marmalade on the table and side plate.  I pointed this out to the person in charge, she seemed not at all bothered that guests had been seated at a dirty table - it left us rather uncomfortable with the general hygiene and very bothered about Covid. We declined breakfast the 2nd morning & dined elsewhere that evening.
The staff were extremely friendly throughout, from reception to bar & restaurant and it is a lovely place to stay. However,  we couldn't help but notice a deterioration in the level of service provided.  Perhaps there has been a change of management?",4,2021,01,04
239,Great Christmas break ,"We stayed in the Hunters yard just before Christmas. Initially it seemed very busy and I was worried about the restrictions. However all safety measures were in place and we felt very comfortable.

The room was lovely and modern, with heating and aircon. The breakfast staff were nice and we really enjoyed dinner in the clubhouse. We also got treatments which were excellent. I would reccomend a stay at this hotel.  ",4,2021,01,02
239,Absolutely Outstanding ,"Went on a break away to Mount Juliet Estate and all I can say is wow.. from the drive into the estate it’s so luxurious. Reception could not have done enough through the stay and they were so helpful on check in. 

Food was absolutely outstanding from presentation to taste it’s 5 star. The restaurant was so clean and it had such a homely feel definitely something you would come back for. 

Honestly in a place that is perfect there was only one thing that made the stay even more amazing and his name is Steve Rochford. From start to end he made us feel amazing and was there on our beckoning call. His knowledge of the grounds of the wines and of the cuisine of the estate made him a total package. His professionalism from start to finish was second to none. 

I can’t thanks all the staff managers and Steve enough. Would recommend 10 stars if I could. ",5,2020,12,25
239,Exceptional stay,"Had such a fantastic stay. Besides getting engaged during our stay, we really loved everything about the hotel. The staff are a credit to the hotel. Every staff member we interacted with was so friendly and very helpful. Would especially like to mention Miriana, who was so lovely and very kind to us on the night of our engagement. 

The rooms were spacious and the bed was extremely comfortable. We dined in the Hound and the service was quick and the food was delicious. I can't recommend a stay here enough.",5,2020,12,15
239,Wedding,Stayed here for a wedding in October and everything was fantastic staff excellent food fantastic and breakfast fab thanks to Robert at breakfast very welcoming and friendly nothing too much trouble for him would highly recommend a this hotel adhering to All social distancing guidelines,5,2020,12,13
239,a 5 Star all the way,"It was very memorable!! The check-in was fast and efficient and it was nice to be able to check-out late.

The room was spacious with modern decor. We didn't use the coffee machine but it was handy to have it in the room as an option.

The breakfast spread was generous and delish!! Looking out to the the golf course, one can't ask for a better breakfast experience!

A massive thank you to Patrick in the concierge team in Hunter's Yard. He was very informative, efficient and entertaining. He made our stay feel special.

We were riding electric bikes to enjoy the scenic views around the estate and it didn't disappoint us.

We will definately be back!",5,2020,12,08
239,They have the best staff members.,"Spent a lovely weekend in the Manor house recently.The Manor is lovely and very festive with all the Christmas decorations. Room is spacious and clean. The breakfast, dinner at Lady Helene and afternoon tea were just superb. Plenty of options and they are very flexible in accommodating our needs and requests. 

With 500 acres, the hotel also offers so many options for activities. A short weekend wasn’t enough. 

Despite our short stay, we had a very excellent experience, thanks to their staff members. They are very friendly and provided more than five stars service from the moment we came into the hotel until the time we left the building to pack our luggages in our car. The service the provided is beyond excellent with the warmth of Irish. They are also very knowledgeable about the estate, the history and the service of the  estate. 

Patrick from Concierge did an incredible job in helping us and arranging bikes. He has a patient of a saint, as it was our first time riding  e-bike. He’s very engaging with us, very communicative and he was also kind to other guests too and ensured everyone had a great experience. ❤️

John, the head porter, was not only kind and very friendly. He went beyond in helping us, even went as far as the parking lot to help us. What a wonderful man! ❤️
 
There’s also Jonathan. He checked if we had a nice stay. He’s also very very patient with all of our requests and questions during dinner and afternoon tea.  ❤️

We will definitely come back to the hotel, not only to explore the nature around the Estate but also for the warmth welcome from their staff members. They made our short stay memorable. ",5,2020,12,07
239,Fantastic hotel,Arrived to a warm welcome for our two night stay.  Due to Covid we had already been in contact with the hotel to book breakfast times and dinner in the Hunters Yard and Manor House.  Room was spacious with everything you need.  Breakfast and dinners were great and the small gym served its purpose.  Book it - you'll not be disappointed!,5,2020,10,29
239,Mount Juliet saved our wedding,"Mount Juliet came to our rescue twice so we could have our wedding. First when our original hotel closed due to covid restrictions and they fit us in with only a couple weeks notice. Secondly when they allowed us to bring forward our date with only 36hrs notice so we could have music before the restrictions. 

Absolutely everything was perfect there. The food and accomodation were imbecile. The friendliness and professionalism of the staff is second to none. Our wedding pictures in the grounds are beautiful. Our families and friends can't stop raving about how good the day was.

A special thank you has to go the events manager Sinead Monahan. She organised everything perfectly and kept both us as relaxed as possible. She was an absolute pleasure to deal with and an example for any events manager to look to.",5,2020,10,26
239,Wonderful Stay at Mount Juliet,"My daughter, son and I stayed at Mount Juliet in October for  four nights. My daughter and I stayed in the Hunters Yard suite as we wanted to have a separate seating area in the room. The suite was fabulous, really large with two flat screen TV's a sofa and enormous bathroom. My sons room was a great size, and both rooms had 
lovely views over the estate. 
All the staff from the Front Desk, to housekeeping and all the servers were so welcoming with a genuine interest in making sure our stay was relaxed, calm and every protocol was taken to ensure and protect our health and wellbeing. All the staff went above and beyond in all areas of covid 19 guidance. 
We had a fabulous afternoon tea on our arrival and I definitely recommend it, the delicious cakes were amazing! The food in Hunters and in Major's bar was so good with a wide choice of menus. 
We cannot wait to go back, and would like to just say Thank You to all the staff in Mount Juilet for their professionalism and generosity of spirit in ensuring we had a truly wonderful stay. 

Stella Byrne",5,2020,10,18
239,Best staycation ever,"My partner and I stayed in your wonderful hotel for four nights we had only planned to stay for three nights but we were having such a good time we decided to stay another night!

I could not praise the hotel more! All the staff were so friendly and nice they all made us feel so welcome and could not do enough for us. Each staff member we dealt with were so mannerly and polite. In particular Jimmy the assistant manager in the hound restaurant his customer service was above and beyond. The food in the restaurant was really nice and service was quick. The breakfast was also amazing with loads of choice 

 The hotel room itself was amazing. We were also got a complimentary upgrade to a garden view room, which was mich appreciated. The house keeping staff were great they made sure the room was exceptionally clean everyday. They always left plenty of towels and toiletries 

Thank you all for making our stay so special and rememberal. It was definitely best hotel we have ever stayed in Ireland. It was great to be able to support local a business.

We will definitely be back for another local staycation",5,2020,10,16
239,Beautiful property - great service  and a world class golf course!,"We stayed in the Hunters Yard at Mount Juliet last month and had a wonderful few days. We were travelling with another couple and their young daughter and really enjoyed the stay.

The rooms themselves were fantastic, with loads of space and beautifully finished.  It sounds silly to say but the underfloor heating in the bathrooms is the best I've ever felt and I would love ours at home to be half as good!

We enjoyed our meals in the Hound restaurant and especially at Lady Helen which was top class. The girls were very impressed with the  treatments they received at the Spa but the star of the show for me was the golf course.

It's a real shame that Covid has denied them the chance to host this years Irish Open because everything about the course was first class - so much so that I'm already plotting a  way to get  back and play it again.",5,2020,10,07
239,Wow wow wow!!,"Stayed in the one of the suites in Manor House for one night, room was amazing! We were kindly greeted by Jamie on check in and he couldn’t do enough for us. We decided to order room service and he promptly took our food order and suggested some options when I asked for recommendations. Breakfast in the restaurant had a beautiful setting and again the staff couldn’t do enough for us. We booked our slot in the pool so it was quiet and relaxing, which I loved. I played a round of golf and it was probably the best course I have ever played, it took about four hours to complete the course with leisure. Check out was also quick and easy, again with the reception staff taking our bags and asking how our stay was. From arrival to check out each staff member we encountered was amazing!",5,2020,10,02
239,Just OK!,"In short, I thought place was nice! Swimming Pool etc not very impressive. Small, drab and not much to it. Staff very nice. Book well in advance for Lady Helens Dining! Some issues...wait 45 mins room service and then wrong order delivered. When correct one finally came, it was Cold! Asked for a table for one in Club Bar. Told none left. As leaving noticed a free table. Waitress said not available. Only I approached the Manager, I wouldn’t have eaten that evening! And on Check out, I was given the wrong bill, three times! Waited to see Manager. He said h would rectify problem. And then he gave me yet another bill with Room Service on it...which all my room service had already been paid! If he asked me once, he asked me four times would I like a bottle of Water, as if he was rewarding me! Annoying! Delayed by an hour, I finally received my correct Bill. Not very professional. Nice grounds. Not much colour ...just greenery. Much nicer Manor type Hotels to go to which actually DO have a 5 Star Service. This certainly didn’t! Will not return!",3,2020,10,01
239,"Poor facilities, NOT 5 Star or even close to it","Poor facilities, health suit is just a freezing cold pool nothing else to offer, gym is a small room with some weights and machines, tennis court looks neglected and overgrown, staff are very young and disinterested. Made a drinks order at the bar which was forgot about! Place is just running on an old reputation and a 5 star rating that can’t be up to date!

This place is not 5 star, might as well stay in a premier inn. 

Golf course and scenery is great but that’s about the only positive I can give. Reception staff were lovely also.",1,2020,09,27
239,Fishing trip made our stay,"Decided to treat ourselves as our trip overseas was cancelled,

We were checked in by nya who was the kind of lady you would expect to be greeted by when you enter such an establishment, extremely pleasant and a down to earth person , 

Breakfast was relaxing , nice quite atmosphere which I found to be a great start to the day ( we had breakfast in the Manor House ) , 

There were a number of activities listed but after recently seeing a magazine article on the fishing here we both wanted to try it , Dan the guy who runs the fishing here took us down to the nore and what was to follow was definitely one of the most relaxing and enjoyable experiences I have ever had , Dan totally broke down fly fishing into a simple format that we both picked up and managed to even catch 8 trout between us , a true gentleman and great ambassador for angling teaching us how to handle fish and how best to follow up on starting to become fly anglers, a huge thank you to him for his time and efforts ,

We followed our fishing trip with a walk on the woodland trail and saw a beautiful red squirrel , 

The days that we spent here were truly memorable bumping into some really nice people , 

When viewing the prices online it does seem pricey but for the surroundings and Caliber of the people we came in contact with it was worth every cent ,",5,2020,09,24
239,An Exceptional stay with Exquisite food,"We had stayed last year and decided to return for a relaxing weekend. 
Some slight changes while checking in with all Covid measures being taken very seriously which was good to see. Assigned a stunning corner suite in the Manor House overlooking the River Nore. The room was beautiful such amazing old world feel with big four poster bed & big bay windows overlooking the river. I had a great swim in the pool, the area has been given a makeover and feels nice and relaxing. 
Evening meal was had in The Hound restaurant. The view from the conservatory out over the golf course and surrounding hills is just a beautiful setting for dinner. Bistro style dining with simple and elegant food on offer. We retreated to the bar for some drinks afterwards, lovely evening had. 
Breakfast in the Lady Helen dining room is really nice. It's such a beautiful room to dine in with the simple tones and very high ceiling. All table service which was excellent and not left wanting for anything. 
My wife had a massage and was very happy with it. 
Saturday evening dinner was booked in Lady Helen's. This was the high point of our previous stay so a lot to live up too. We got seated and the experience begins. Amuse Bouche offered to get the palate going. Dinner was exquisite with the pigeon main course being the star dish for me. 
Such an amazing experience to dine here you really feel looked after and we left feeling totally content. 
The grounds of the estate are fantastic to walk around we did some great walks along the river and back through the grounds. The area on the opposite side of the river is unfortunately closed off due to Covid. It's a working stud farm so understandable it being closed off right now. 
If you can stay at the Manor house, you should do so!",5,2020,09,23
239,Segway,The segway experience is just the best staff amazing funny and safe well worth it never laughed as much and learnt and the sites on the grounds amazing thanks guys ya have to try it but be careful 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅,5,2020,09,22
239,Disappointing,"While the hotel and setting are beautiful, we were very unhappy with our stay from being unable to get a drink in the bar, after waiting half an hour for our drinks to arrive we gave up, and the noise outside our room from 11pm Saturday night  to 2 am Sunday morning was crazy. Add in two fire alarms, the wooden floor on corridor outside rooms that makes every sound very loud, high heels especially, and door needs to be sealed to try keep some noise out, I most have been woken 10 times. I did feel for anyone trying to settle young children.

Breakfast was very good, but limited choice on evening meal meant we had to head to Kilkenny for dinner.
Reception staff very friendly and helpful as my husband said in some areas it just needs someone to manage and oversee that guest are getting a 5 star not the 2/3 star we got, plenty more hotels in Kilkenny that offer far better service at better price.",2,2020,09,21
239,"Mount Juliet Estate, Thomastown, County Kilkenny.","I had stayed in Mount Juliet for two nights whilst attending a wedding and I would highly recommend it to other potential visitors. 

The staff are so welcoming and so helpful, especially Patrick and Alan whom I had dealt with a number of times. They are both gentleman and are a credit to Mount Juliet, as are all of its staff.

I would definitely revisit again as Mount Juliet is a fine establishment and I can not recommend it enough.",5,2020,09,21
239,Beautiful hotel,"Spent 3 nights staycation , and have to say from the moment we arrived to when we drove out the gates every aspect of our visit was 5star!

239,Excellent stay with amazing customer services,"This was my second time to stay at mount Juliet. The first time we had organised a work team day. We found the sales and events staff excellent to work with and everyone had a fantastic day/ night. This time, I returned for another stay with my partner and we were delighted to be upgraded to a better room which we really appreciated. Dinner and breakfast was excellent and we really enjoyed spinning around the estate on electric bikes. We will be back again!",5,2020,09,16
239,Amazing hotel fabulous grounds and brilliant staff ,First time visiting this hotel and what a treat. Service was amazing and so were the staff. Ate in the Hound restaurant food was fabulous and no rushing of food either which I find in a lot of country hotels.  Can’t wait to go back. 10/10 ❤️,5,2020,09,14
239,Weekend  break,We have just stayed at mount juliet accomadation is wonderful. Rooms luxurious and clean we travelled with 3 generations. We had a double room with walk in shower. Well laid out room looking into a courtyard. A/c was excellent with a nice touch of chocolates and wine on arrival. We ate In the hunters restaurant and also in the clubhouse. I would highly recommend the steak sandwich and the children’s fish and chips. All options for food went down well with our family. Breakfast is superb kids loved the pancakes they were a big hit. A big shout out to Laura at reception a true professional with a warm welcoming manner. Patrick also made the stay for great for our children with a grand tour of the grounds on the golf karts we learned a lot about the house and grounds Restaurwnt managers and staff attentive . Playground and swimming pool excellent for children. Book dining options and swimming times before arrival and your stay should run smoothly. Will definitely be back,5,2020,09,14
239,Mixed experience ,"We stayed here in Hunters Yard with our toddler for two nights with friends. I would say this is a gorgeous hotel and grounds but certainly not a 5 star experience if you have experience of staying at 5 star hotels, I’m really surprised by some of the recent reviews being so positive and wonder if we got unlucky. 

Positives;

- reception booking were super helpful and had arrange for us and our friends to have adjoining rooms 
- grounds are lovely for kids with gardens and playground 
- pool was gorgeous and allowed for booking kids hours so we didn’t have to be self conscious with an excitable toddler squealing! 
- hotel arranged babysitters for us and this was seamless, worked really well 
- Breakfast was lovely and service was good in the mornings 

Frustrations;

- impossible to get phones answered from the room. We rang about ten times 2/3 occasions and nobody answered so we had to go down and order food for the kids to the room, get a cot and some other things we needed. This was not convenient with children. 

- in general in Hunters Yard the stuff seem inexperienced and confused. At times things seemed to be a hassle, at other times they said they haven’t been working there long and don’t know, there was no 5* service along the lines of “I’ll find out and get right back to you”...they need training around service provision in a hotel like this. Staff in Manor House during a lunch were much more at ease in their job. 

- we really didn’t like the limited food options on menus, there were a couple of options for starter and main course (like maybe 3!) and the food was really really overpriced in our opinion. We ate in “St Helens” but it wasn’t the Michelin restaurant as it’s not available on a Monday, the food we did get was very nice but CRAZY expensive for having a few options. The restaurant was totally lacking in any atmosphere. Kids food menu had limited healthy options and was v expensive. 

- Babysitter didn’t have phone network in our room. This was very stressful for me because if she needed to contact me in the restaurant I was not confident that the phones would be answered. 

Overall I wouldn’t really come back here when there are other cheaper hotels where I have experienced a more “luxury” feeling and service. We did have a great time overall but only because we had young kids so the rooms and pool suited us and it was a gift from our friends so we didn’t pay full price ourselves. If I were here as a couple or had kid myself I would have been disappointed but maybe it’s a different experience in Manor House. ",3,2020,09,12
239,Superb,"Our first time visiting Mount Juliet and it was superb throughout. Everywhere we went within the estate, we experienced friendly, efficient and effective staff. The Hound is really good, where again the service was excellent. Covid controls were clearly evident and well operated in all parts of the hotel, but there was no delay or inconvenience as a result. My thanks to the Mount Juliet team for an excellent and memorable experience. We look forward to returning.",5,2020,09,11
239,Lovely stay,"My wife and I have recently returned from a break in this lovely hotel. We stayed in Hunters Yard and we really enjoyed our time. We ate in the Hound restaurant both nights and the manager Annmarie and the other staff went above and beyond to facilitate us as it was our first trip post-COVID which we were a wee bit nervous about. We had the same waitress on both nights, her name was Ciara and she was great and helped us feel very comfortable even though both nights were busy. Also have to mention the bar man Brian who was also very friendly. Overall we really enjoyed the experience, the grounds are just beautiful and we are already looking forward to coming back again",5,2020,09,09
239,Fantastic stay at an amazing hotel!,"Myself and my husband stayed for one night in this fabulous hotel last week, and we will definitely be back! Food and service was top class in the Hound Restaurant for dinner. The hotel has put so many procedures in place for Covid feel extremely safe, but they done it so well you would hardly notice them doing them. Room was amazing also! It was a getaway for my birthday and they had a lovely bottle of wine in the room on arrival and a lovely dessert plate in the Restaurant, was such a nice touch.
The only small issue I found was in the Stables for breakfast the next morning, selection for breakfast was poor, had run out of bacon and sausages, and just seemed very unorganised. 
But will definitely be back!",5,2020,09,08
239,Food was Brilliant.,"We stayed in the Mount Juliet hotel for 2 night's had a great time, the location is Beautiful the only thing letting the hotel down is the kit out of the Rooms.The bathroom had a smell and the furniture was not up to scratch.Photos taken from the window in the Room.",4,2020,09,06
239,Mixed stay with poor cleanliness,"Stayed with family for two nights in a courtyard room. Room was very comfortable with a separate check-in area from the main house. There is plenty to do on the estate with fishing, archery, horse riding and golf. Even though the hotel was full it was no problem organizing any activities, once someone eventually answered the phone (problems with the phone not being answered on a number of occasions). The archery was a highlight. The food in Hunters Yard was nice but put off by a mouse scurrying outside the windows, and also I had to return a glass of wine for what I suspect was the glass been cleaned with a dirty dishcloth. This was a consistent issue with my family returning cups and glasses for lipstick or coffee stains, from the bar, bedroom and dinning areas. Overall the cleanliness was poor with some staff not cleaning tables etc after use by other guest. There were plenty of posters and sanitation stations around the hotel. But given the covid situation this was unforgivable that junior staff appeared poorly trained.",3,2020,09,06
239,Stay Somewhere Else,"They call this a luxury 5-star resort- and believe me you pay the price for it- but we had a really disappointing stay and I've gotten better service and attentiveness from a Holiday Inn in all honesty.

Food was average (but very expensive), staff were essentially not even there (took hours to get someone to answer at the front desk just to ask for toilet paper), nobody ever answers the front desk phone so don't even bother, and the premesis was average in terms of amenities and the visuals of the property. The 'fairy garden' was quite a hike and really overgrown and unkempt as well. 

One big thing for me was at check-in (after waiting in a hot stuffy room for 20 minutes to do so) we didn't even get a map of the sprawling estate and were pretty much just left to our own devices to figure out what was available for us to do (I guess we'll just sit in the expensive room then).

This is definitely not a place for romantic weekends like we had assumed either. Lots of children kicking soccer balls right outside the outside room door and making ruckus in the restaraunts (which I normally wouldn't mind if we weren't hoping for a romantic luxury adult birthday weekend). 

As well, the pictures make the estate look very romantic but visually it's very underwhelming, particularly the main 'manor house' you see in the photos. I was quite dissapointed in that.

I'd recommend staying somewhere else for the weekend.

Ah and one last thing to really drive my lack of any type of good service- I sent a pretty scathing email about my stay right after check-out and a month later I received so much as an email back. Absolutely ridiculous, but I'm not surprised.",2,2020,09,05
239,Bank Holiday Family stay,"We visited Mount Juliet and for the first time stayed in the refurbished hunters Lodge. Rooms were lovely, swimming pool had reopened and although you needed to book it was easy to get times.
The restaurant offered good choices for the children although only one vegetarian option which not great for a 3 night stay. The fish was fabulous and breakfasts were full of choice.

Staff attentive and looking forward to returning again in October.",5,2020,09,05
239,Very good,"Stayed for three nights in Hunters Yard. Room / bathroom was very nice with nice products. Super shower. We ate in Hunters two nights, and while the menu is a bit limited the food was very good as was the service. Not sure why there are so many complaints about breakfast; we thought it was very well organised, well spaced out, the staff member running it was very friendly, plenty of choice - cereal, juice, rolls, pastries, cheese etc, yogurt as well as a cooked breakfast. Hot drinks and toast arrived promptly.  Pool was lovely if a bit chilly, and there was a good family changing room. We did the segway tour and it was great, the young guy who took us round was lovely. Grounds are very nice.",4,2020,09,04
239,Most Disappointing!!,"We were so looking forward to an absolute treat to stay in Mount Juliet and to be honest the experience from beginning to end left a lot to be desired. 
We checked in and were shown to our room in Hunters Lodge we had asked at reception were to go for a bite of late lunch and were told the Clubhouse, we queued there to be told as we were not members we needed to go to the Bar and the girl kindly walked us over. We queued again to be told they had stopped serving food and we should go to the Clubhouse we explained the situation and he said well we are not serving food now. At which point I said do you mean to honestly tell me that at a 5* Hotel we cannot get a bowl of soup and a sandwich he then showed us to a seat and we were served. Saturday evening we dined in The Hound and it was only average. The following morning at Breakfast I was astounded that in the current pandemic climate they were operating a Buffet style breakfast, surely it should be Table Service to minimise guests walking around and queuing. Poached eggs ordered and had to be returned as they were cold x 2.We walked the beautiful grounds and went for a swim in the Healthclub which again for a 5* Hotel was only average, in the changing rooms they were no bags provided for wet swimwear  so had to go to the HC reception with the wet clothing looking for a bag. This is just a basic requirement as far as I'm concerned. We dined in Lady Helen that evening and the food was fabulous although service quite rushed as only 1 person serving. Breakfast the next morning wasn't any better and upon checking out I spoke with the Manager who took my comments on board and assured me the Hotel Manager would be in touch to discuss my concerns and I continue to wait impatiently.",2,2020,09,03

239,Fabulous,"I've just returned from an overnight at the Manor House in Mount Juliet estate. I love to stay at Manor houses and castles but all to often its just the facade that is restored to its former glory while the rooms are the typical generic hotel accommodation, but not so in this beautiful authentic Manor house,it oozes elegance and charm and with very little imagination you can escape from reality and believe you are a guest of Lady Helen in a bygone age of gentle sofitication. Our room was stunning, so quite and comfortable and the river view was breathtaking. The service was what you hope for but rarely get, 5 star, impeccable. One of the highlights of the night was our pre-dinner drinks in the Majors bar we had lovely cosy chairs facing the view and the bartender made me the most delicious Brandy Alexander, life does not get any better. We had lunch and dinner in The Hound at Hunters Yard, the food, service and ambience was superb. The weather was lovely so we had the opportunity to make the most of the extensive and beautifully kept grounds and gardens. Breakfast at the Manor House was another elegant and leisurely experience but then it was time to go and as I reluctantly departed I knew I had experienced something very special.",5,2020,09,01
239,Lovely relaxing break,"We visited Mount Juliet for the bank holiday weekend,staying at Hunters Yard.
Fantastic staff who couldn’t do more to make our stay comfortable.
We dined  in The Hound for the three nights .Small menu due to Covid ,but nice selection and all our meals tasted good.Breakfast was served buffet style and served by staff and social distancing was observed .Masks worn by all staff and guests encouraged to do the same.Plenty of sanitizer available and room and public areas spotless..
Unfortunately we didn’t get eating in the clubhouse as it is reserved for golfers at the weekends but we spent some pleasant time observing the golfers from the terrace whilst enjoying a drink and also walked the estate.
We will definitely return",4,2020,09,01
239,Shocking breakfast in Hunters Yard,"Lovely place, grounds, and rooms in Hunters Yard.  We also have a fantastic meal in the Lady Helen - which was top notch.    Outside of the Lady Helen restaurant, the food was poor.  Dinner in the Hound was a very limited menu that appeared not to change, luckily we just ate here one night.  While slow to write a bad review (everyone can have a bad day) I did write to the hotel on my return to express my utter disappointment of breakfast.  No response from the hotel so hence the review.  Seems others on here had poor breakfast experiences and no response also.  Breakfast had no choice, was cold and service was chaotic.   Alot of staff seemed to be new on the job and untrained.

While Covid 19 restrictions require patience, I did not have this experience anywhere else.  A breakfast roll from the local supermarket deli would be much better.  What a pity.",3,2020,08,31
239,Very disappointing stay - not 5 star and overpriced,"We spent two nights at Mount Juliet last week. We booked into the Hunters Yard, which effectively is a separate hotel to the Manor House at Mount Juliet. Our room was lovely, very clean, comfortable beds. However, for a five star hotel, that charged €375 per person for 2 nights B&B this was incredibly disappointing experience. The food in the golf club was sub standard. We ordered the burger, the meat was inedible and we had to send it back. A burger from McDonalds genuinely would be nicer and better quality. To be fair, the staff changed our meal without any hesitation. However, it just should not have happened. On the second night we ate at the Hound. The menu is boring, limited and an extension of what's on offer at the Golf Club. Again, definitely not 5 star. Both mornings breakfast was chaotic, incredibly poor service and long waits - for example, we' ordered toast, tea, coffee, and eggs. And they came in that order, but with huge delays in between. The reason I am writing this review is I emailed Mount Juliet with this feedback and they didn't reply and subsequently learnt that a friend stayed there a few months ago and had the same experience and they stayed at the Manor. So, sadly, having had a wonderful stay here many years ago I will never return",2,2020,08,31
239,Fab stay,"Booked golf and overnight.  From the moment we arrived, the staff were superb.  Francis in the gold manager was so welcoming.

Annmarie in the Hound restaurant was so accommodating and ensured that we received the choices we wanted.’

Reception staff were so lovely too!

Thanks for making our stay so lovely!

Sinéad and Annette.",5,2020,08,30
239,NOT 5 STAR!!!,"My wife and I went on two 5 star staycations this summer. Mount Juliet was the first of these and we blamed Covid 19 for our disappointing stay.  However, having just returned from a top class hotel in Cork City, we now realise that the government restrictions are only a cop-out on the part of Mount Juliet to excuse sloppy standards, and below-par service, while still charging 5 star prices. We will not be returning.",2,2020,08,28
239,Ok ,"We had visited here before and found it very special. But it was just not as special this time. I think now with Covid we are all trying even harder at work and then we expect the same if we staycation, especially as we have no choice now but to staycation. 

Firstly we did not get the room we had booked due to a mix up but the room we had instead was very nice so that was ok. 

Although we were repeat guests the manager on duty made a big deal that as using our debit cards instead of credit cards we should pay up front for the full stay. 

He left it after a bit of discussion and then the next day apologized but to be honest it had really embarrassed us.I think he knew he had gone on a little bit too much and to be fair he nicely apologized. 

On arrival there was a nice bottle of wine left in the room as a gift with a nice welcome back note . This was a thoughtful gesture. 

I felt really upset as when I saw the house keepers  as they were not wearing masks. I think this is just bizarre. They are putting themselves in danger as well as us. I told reception and they said they would work on this which is good. 

The same menus were being handed out at breakfast each day and were neither freshly printed nor wipeable. You could see marks where they had been slightly bent and corners not fresh.

The staff’s visors also had crumple marks. I just think it’s important to look fresh. 

The soup of the day was cauliflower everyday which our 12 year old found very amusing and joked Gordon Ramsey would have an issue with that if he stayed there. 

The food in the Hound has improved . The food in the Lady Helen was not as good although still very nice. 

Generally people were friendly but not outstandingly so which they were on previous visits over the years. John the doorman was really nice. 

A big issue if wanting to relax is if the weather is not good the Manor drawing rooms seem to be set up for visitors for afternoon tea rather than for guests to sit and relax . I could be wrong but it did feel as if you should only sit if having afternoon tea. The lawn is beautiful and lunch was nice. 

Overall , everything was “nice” but we went home a night early. It just didn’t seem worth it to stay on another night.We missed home! They kindly didn’t not charge any cancellation fee for the last night .

239,"Amazing stay, special thanks to Sandra!","My husband and I stole away for a few days at Mount Juliet with our 3 year old son this summer.  The grounds are stunning, the staff incredibly friendly and accommodating, but honestly, the standout for us that made our getaway so special was the care and attention from their customer experience manager Sandra. From the moment we arrived she went out of her way to help us and make our stay memorable. She could not have been sweeter with our son and even helped him feel ok about going to their kids club (after so many months of not socializing during quarantine) so that we could have a romantic dinner on our own (which she also arranged). She left him a surprise of fairy dust in our room as he was super into their fairy garden (he's a NYC kid - gardens AND fairies? It was almost too much for him to comprehend!) and wine and sweets for us. This hotel is already spectacular, someone like Sandra makes it 5 star.",5,2020,08,27
239,Beautiful surroundings for luxury break,"We (2 adults) stayed for one night In Aug in the Manor House and would highly recommend Mount Juliet as an ideal location for for a luxury break away. Staff were all very welcoming on arrival, we were greeted by both the manager-on-duty Michael and the receptionist Clarice. We could see straight away that all COVID measures were in place and being adhered to by both staff and guests.  Check-in was efficient and within minutes we were escorted to a beautiful suite with a view of the river. As the rain held off we took the opportunity to go for a long walk down along the river and lakes and enjoyed the peace and tranquility of the grounds. There's a beautiful view of the hotel front from the riverbank. We came back to the Manor House and sat outside with refreshments from the bar and had a chat with Des about the history of the estate. We were so grateful that Des took the time to do this with us as it really gave us historical context to refer to for the rest of our stay. We were still discussing the stories Des regaled us with hours later over dinner! Dinner was in the Lady Helen restaurant with the ‘casual’ menu rather than the Michelin star menu which suited us fine. We had mains of steak and duck and both were excellent plus the bread accompanied the starters was top class. Service was prompt and attentive and we didn’t have to ask for anything. While the Manor House was fully booked, it never seemed too busy and it definitely had a calm and relaxed vibe in the restaurant and bar.Slept really well in the big king-sized bed and pillows/mattress were really comfy. Breakfast the next morning was served to the table (not buffet) and both the full Irish and eggs benedict were delicious. Despite the rain we went for another walk around the estate before check-out and visited the picture-pretty Rose Garden.  We could see guests partaking in Segweg/bike tours and horse riding and would definitely be something we would do when we come back with the kids. The hotel is located just outside Thomastown, Co.Kilkenny so easily accessible from Dublin, Waterford and Rosslare. We did a tour of the surrounding picturesque villages of Inistioge, Graiguenamanagh and St Mullins before leaving the South East. Overall it was a lovely overnight break in beautiful surroundings with excellent standards of cleanliness, food and staff who all went out of their way to make sure that we wanted for nothing. Many thanks to Michael and his team of staff for making it an enjoyable stay, we will be back.",5,2020,08,27
239,A real treat,"We stayed in Hunters Yard last Feb- it was so lovely, staff were so attentive and helpful- they could not do enough for you. The family room was airy and spacious and very comfortable. Go explore the ground- they are amazing.  Unfortunately the pool was closed for renovation but they did have an agreement with a hotel in Kilkenny that we could use the pool in their hotel complimentary which was great to have that facility. I would go back again- it was a real treat.",5,2020,08,24
239,"Good but mixed experience, Equestrian centre experience was exceptional","We stayed in the Hunters Yard in the last week in July, which was my wife, my Daughter and I. The hotel was fine and the Restaurant was good, although the dinner menu did not change in the Hound for the week we stayed. The quality of the Dinner was good but the breakfast was average. Our sense is that the hotel is not delivering a 5 star experience during these covid times. Our own experience in the 4 star Dunbrody House Hotel  (also during this Lockdown period) was much more akin to a 5 star experience than our Mount Juliet staycaytion. The staff were very helpful and friendly but do lack experience. Also there was a lack of coordination between the dining room and the back office as our dinners kept getting added to our bill even though we had a booked a rate that included a dinner. 

We have, however, rated the week as very good. Our daughter loves horse riding and we/she had a great week with Tara, Tommy and team.. Their friendliness, professional service and expertise are exceptional. We genuinely believe that this is a huge asset to the Hotel which does not appear to be marketed/publicised as well as it could be.

If we do return to Mount Juliet, the primary reason we will do so is to avail of these excellent equestrian facilities. Thanks, Tara, Tommy and team..",4,2020,08,23
239,A lovely property but the service really let it down.,"The hotel itself is very nice and has a lot to offer but our stay was let down really unnecessarily by poor service and organisation. 

The first issue was with the booking procedure, I had tried to contact the hotel using the phone number multiple times during business hours and I was unable to get through to speak to somebody. After reaching the Marriott phone menu and selecting a department, the line just rang out. 

On one occasion I rang three times before getting somebody which I found highly unusual as it was within business hours. 

When I finally managed to get somebody in reservations I booked the rooms and for some reason they were put on separate invoices which caused confusion upon check in and check out. When booking over the phone I used a visa to secure the room.

On check in I gave a different debit card number to be charged for the two rooms and the additional costs of the stay. This card number was taken down by the receptionist and all seemed to be fine. 

However when we checked out of the hotel I received a phone call to say that payment had not been taken for one of the rooms as the card number I used to book the rooms was on the system and not the updated one given at check-in. I then had to give the card details to be charged over the phone after we had returned home. This kind of messing around with booking and check in/out is really not something I would expect of a top 5 star property.

One other observation that I found highly unusual was the fact the breakfast was a buffet service with very poor social distancing being practiced in the buffet queue. 

This is the first 5 star property I have been to that doesn't have a hot menu for breakfast being served to the table and during the pandemic I would have assumed that would be the only option.

 It was surprising that a buffet was the only option and anybody could go up to queue for the buffet whenever they wanted resulting in people standing close together in line and nobody monitoring social distance.

The rooms were nice and the estate was beautiful but some sharpening up definitely needs to be done.",3,2020,08,22
239,Beautiful Manor House hotel,"Fabulous Manor House hotel with friendly staff and lots of activities. Had the pleasure of staying two nights 

Food was amazing - well cooked and presented both for evening meals and breakfast.

Whilst there the bar food offering was moved to the lady Helen restaurant for the night. Only downside to this was the slight delay in getting dessert but as soon as it was mentioned the desserts appeared quickly.

Room was being serviced on request due to covid but it was seamless. Bed was very comfy 

Fabulous Segway tour of the estate offered and it was great fun - highly recommend. 

",5,2020,08,21
239,Okay ,Mount Juliet is a five star hotel that’s why I am surprised about the service. I ordered a drink from room service and it took 45 minutes to get there and the breakfast was terrible but the dinner tasted delicious but don’t order desert I made that mistake - I ordered a cookie and I ordered tea and coffee and 3 of them were cold but the swimming pool was good.,3,2020,08,21
239,Very enjoyable on the whole but not perfect,"We just spent some time here and enjoyed it. We were quite excited about the golf facilities.. to play a round is very expensive but to use the driving range was very reasonable. The Manor is gorgeous and we were made feel very welcome.. overall we enjoyed the ambiance, attention to detail and professionalism in managing such a big estate which has a lot to offer. However we had two negative experiences and both with the barman/ ‘ bar manager’ ( two different men and evenings).. we found their manner most discourteous when we simply asked about a table and/a drink! Not a difficult issue one would imagine.. one gave us an abrupt ‘no!’ without offering us a kind word.. the following day, the same. The ‘manager’ made it very clear to us and audibly for the other guests to hear, that we were not getting a table but turning on his heel and off he went! Very embarrassing, also for his nice female colleagues who were helpful and nice. Perhaps both men are not happy in their job? I would imagine courtesy to guests would be one of the first things taught in College.. ? Very disappointing encounters..
Other than that all staff were courteous and friendly which one would expect.. especially as we did spend quite a lot of money there in the number of days we were there. Would I go back? Not sure.",4,2020,08,16
239,Wonderful Family Stay,We have just returned from a great 3 night family stay at Mount Juliet. Our room in Hunters Yard was extremely comfortable with great space opening out onto the garden. Spotless & well equipped made for a relaxing stay. Breakfast was lovely with lots of choice & great views over the golf course. All the activities from golf to segways & bicycles we did it all. A huge thank you to Mark & Siobhan for a lovely welcome & thank you to the entire team for making our family stay so relaxing & enjoyable. We will definitely return & highly recommend to everyone!,5,2020,08,14
239,"Very sadly, not what it was.","I write this review with great reluctance. We have been lucky enough to stay in Mount Juliet on various occasions as a couple and immensely enjoyed each visit. This is our first time staying as a family (with our 3 year old) and I am afraid it will be our last. 

While the wait staff are polite and friendly, they do not seem to be properly trained. For us, this has resulted in waiting a long time to place orders at lunch and dinner throughout our stay and in used plates being left unattended for some time after main courses. The fromer being quite tricky when a three year old is involved.

The food is still very good but is overpriced by comparison to even well known restaurants in Dublin, particularly when the level of service is poor, albeit friendly. 

I hate to say it as I'm sure it is not intentional but we felt conned after some meals as the pro rata prices are similar to the Lady Helen restaurant in the Manor House but are not matched by the quality of the food or the service.

On one occasion when we ordered some tea, we were served a cup that appeared not to have been washed. Instead, it displayed the froth marks of the previous coffee drink dispensed into it. 

Unfortunately, the main courses of the childrens menus in the Hunters Yard restaurant consist entirely of chips with, in effect, a side order of something else, such as chicken goujons. If we had eaten in the Hunters Yard restaurant for the entirety of our stay, our daughter would have had chips throughout.

However, the most surprising experience during our stay was that during a meal in the Clubhouse Bar, two of the wait staff that served us (while polite and friendly) were not wearing face masks/coverings of any kind and did not practice social distancing. 

This was very concerning given the Covid-19 times we are living in and as my wife is 5 months pregnant (and obviously showing).

I had considered mentioning something to a manager who came by and chatted to one of the wait staff but there seemed little point as he was not wearing a face mask/covering either.

It's such a pity to see a wonderful place let down by overpriced food and sloppy, if well meaning, service.",3,2020,08,13
239,Superb hotel,Fantastic hotel! Staff were so accommodating. We had delicious food in hunters yard and I would highly recommend the moongate mount Juliet gin! A stroll up to the manor house is a must as it has so much character.,5,2020,08,11
239,At best 3 1/2 stars,"I offered the hotel a right to reply before writing this review. They hadn't the courtecy to reply back.

Myself and my daughter stayed with you yesterday evening. We had high expectations as my husband has been with you on several corporate trips. All of his stays were of a high standard.

On this occasion however we were disappointed. Our experience was not terrible but just OK. Dinner was just OK. We were offered dinner at 6 or 9pm. We chose 6pm then were notified that 6pm was gone. We then received a call to say that 6pm was back on, but that we would be sitting in the bar. 
Breakfast was just OK. When we asked the young lady serving us, if the orange juice was fresh? she replied 'I think so'.
The room was just OK. Your standard deluxe room is quite basic, minimal channels on the TV and the tea tray had no breakfast tea and no little biscuit treats.

The indoor swimming pool was freezing.

I am fully aware that we are living during a difficult time and hospitality is changing. However you are still offering and charging for a Five Star experience but on this occasion you fell short. Two weeks ago I stayed in Castlemartyr and in February the Wineport. Both stays were wonderful and I left knowing I was given the five star treatment. Sadly we didn't have that feeling leaving Mount Juliet today.",2,2020,08,11
239,Disappointing Anniversary Break,"We had a disastrous start to our stay and made at total of 7  calls to reception in order to pre book dinner . The phone service was appalling and I got cut off several times. No one seemed to know what they were doing and it was a different member of staff each time .To say I was stressed before I even arrived was an understatment .And the booking was still incorrect when we arrived. There was no manager to speak to on any occasion either.   My daughter rang to ask for a bottle of wine to be delivered to our rooom for a surprise and she had the same experience with the phone service! 
However when we arrived we were introduced to Patrick the consierge who  brought us to view the restaurants and decide where we wanted to eat. We had booked the Lady Helen as we thought , but we were informed it was booked out and closed on a Sunday night , needless to say we were very disappointed.  Patrick was excellent throughout with lots of information and tips on the area. 

The food was excellent in the Hound restaurant and Annmarie and Rachel particularly looked after us.
Breakfast was well organised and felt safe. Again staff were very attentive. 
The room in Hunters Yard was very nice, clean and well equipped. However 1 hook in the bathroom was insufficient and one robe was removed from the room after use and never replaced. 
We came back around 3pm on Sunday and decided to have a snack in the clubhouse only to be told it was only open to members on a Sunday! We were not impressed with this as there was nowhere else to get food but to trek down the the Manor House and try to obtain a table outside. 

The fire alarm went off at 3.30am on our last night and we left the room and went to reception to be told it was a false alarm, no apology and we met people in the hallway with young children whom they had taken from their beds!

All in all the visit was a bit disappointing and it certainly didnt feel like a 5* hotel or treatment. It just felt like there was no one in charge and no one really knew what they were doing.",3,2020,08,11
239,Nice hotel in a beautiful setting ,Stayed in Hunter’s Yard Hotel as part of our staycation. Lovely rooms and well maintained. Reception staff were very welcoming and efficient. We ate in the Hound Restaurant and enjoyed it - good menu and great flavours. The staff at dinner were friendly but seemed to be very inexperienced and while the hotel may have only re-opened three weeks previous they definitely need additional training. The staff at breakfast on the other hand were much better. There are nice walks on the property and the scenery is beautiful.,3,2020,08,10
239,5 star surroundings 1star food 2 star service,"Absolutely stunning hotel and gardens. Nice quiet bedroom. Hotel adequately adapted to comply with Covid rules. Food was terrible. Had continental breakfast. Poor selection of food. The orange juice described on the menu as freshly squeezed was concentrated. Pancakes despite the chef telling another customer that they were freshly made were clearly shop bought and highly processed. They were served with little potions of nutella in foil packets and maple syrup not the berry compote as described on the menu. For lunch we were served gone off soup in the golf club though the bar manager did replace it free of charge with a toasted sandwich accompanied by a ""salad"" some leaves of which were also going off. Dinner in the bar restaurant was mediocre pub grub at best. Very very disappointing standard of food. When I asked to speak with a mannager I was told none were available that they would ring me later in the week. They did not. I called them. Still no manager available ro speak with me. I was told one would call me which unsurprisingly has not happened. I was more than shocked to hear that the AA had given them an award for the best hoyel. Clearly the AA have very low standards and I will not be putting any value on their so called awards in the future. 
If you're solely looking for nice surroundings then this is the place
for you but you're looking for nice food give this hotel a wide berth.",2,2020,08,10
239,Wonderful Family Break,"Just returned from a lovely three day break in Mount Juliet. I am surprised by the number of negative reviews as I would highly recommend this hotel and would happily return. The room was very clean and we were offered room service if we wished but didn't avail of it. We ate in The Hound twice and once in the Golf Club. All of the staff we encountered were friendly, welcoming and attentive. There were no delays getting food/drinks although the hotel was busy. The staff on breakfast were particularly helpful and responded promptly to every request. We had Afternoon Tea in the Manor House on the first day and liked it so much we had coffee out on the lawn every day in the beautiful surrounds. The grounds are lovely and we went on numerous walks, taking in the stables to check out the horses one day. My daughter loved the pool and we had no hassle getting a time slot on any of the days. All in all, a lovely stay and we will definitely return if we get the chance.",5,2020,08,09
239,Fabulous family break,Just home from a fabulous 3 night break with the family.our stay from beginning to end was first class.The kids loved the swimming pool which was very well managed.They loved the kids club and playground.Special mention to Patrick who looked after us very well.Looking forward to returning in the near future.,5,2020,08,09
239,Fabulous stay,"I really dont understand people, I thought due to the pandemic people would be kinder and nicer, this is not the case, more demanding and self centred. I stayed with 3 friends on sunday night. We had the best time ever. Service was second to none  friendly and efficient. It was busy but this did not impact our time. Dinner was casual in lady Helen but my god was it tasty, I had ravioli and duck oh and the best creme brulee I have ever eaten. Our room, the lady mary was spotless and elegant. Loved the bathroom products too. Towels were fluffy and so so luxurious. Breakfast was top notch, I highly recommend the boxty! We had a lovely stroll around the grounds after dinner, albeit a little tipsey. The colours were beautiful, the greens and the dark shades, just magical. Keep doing what you are doing and please don't mind the begrudgers, some people should just stay at home ! Special mention to Des, Mariana and Michael, I for sure cant wait to go back.",5,2020,08,04
239,Not a 5 Star and not worthy of winning the AA Hotel of the Year.,"First off the staff and team at the Hunters Lodge were all lovely; for their continuous friendliness and welcoming manner everytime they were met throughout our stay.  From first thing in the morning to late into the evening they were always smiling and welcoming.  Persons who stuck out were the guest liaison, Sandra ( she was very excited about me going horse riding) and Jimmy showing us to our table for breakfast, also Tara and Tommy in the equestrian yard who were very friendly and full of chat.

The welcome was living up to the article I had read the previous week about your establishment winning the AA hotel of the year award.

While the staff were lovely the same cannot be said for the room we were given.

Upon arrival in our room I went to open the balcony windows and noted a number of cigarette butts in the corner of the ledge.  While this shocked me I felt it could wait until I was going past reception again to mention it to front of house staff.

After this, I proceeded to open all the drawers and wardrobe to see what was where and being generally curious.  Can you imagine my surprise and disgust when i opened the draw beneath the kettle to discover used teabags and milk cartons,    Well this could not wait.  

I went down to reception and spoke  first a porter and then to the gentleman on reception that the porter directed me to.  While both did apologise for the incident and a housekeeper was sent to tidy both areas it did leave me rather worried.

I was offered a drink in the bar on the house while the housekeeper attended the room - this did not calm my fears / concerns. I did not accept the offer as I dont drink and I was uncomfortable to stay in public areas too long   Just how clean was the room? Had it been cleaned as thoroughly as they advertised?  And how could it have been cleaned thoroughly if such things were left for a guest to see.

Given the state of the room I and those I travelled with are at a loss to see how the establishment could be called a five star hotel, let alone be named hotel of the year by the AA.

Other points I would draw future guests to  - 

I dislike A/C and was delighted that I could open the balcony doors fully.  However, this presented it's own drawback.  Mainly being that as the room was situated above the delivery area we were woken both mornings by the sound of delivery and waste trucks reversing into the loading area, both mornings around 7am.  Not the nicest wakeup call when you are on holidays. 

Between these early wake up calls and the late night revelry by a small handful of guests out on the road neither my partner nor I got a good nights sleep either night.

My sisters room was on the ground floor and as such she felt that she had no option but to keep the curtains closed for privacy and also to keep the balcony doors closed and use the A/C for reasons of safety.  Even being able to tilt windows inwards would be welcome 
 
While you have hand sanitizers at all doors along with plenty of signage requesting one way systems and maintaining distancing the lack of guests wearing masks or face coverings was very uncomfortable, especially at breakfast time when not only were guests not wearing coverings they also did not maintain distance while at the buffet with some guests even going so far as to help themselves if no staff member was ready to serve them. 

Both my sister and I enjoy the outdoors and decided to go for a walk / run around the grounds.  My sister did obtain a map from the front desk but it had not been updated to show new builds and when out on the trails there were no markings, even a simple area to show the best route.  As some of the pathways lead to private homes in cul-de-sacs some simple markings would be helpful.  Notwithstanding current restrictions there are beautiful grounds that should be made accessible to all.  However, to only see markings highlighting that non-golfers were not welcome is off putting and negative.  I appreciate these signs are for safety but instead of just saying you can't go here or here, signs saying walk this way or follow this track create positivity.

All of the above was told to the hotel staff and manager - other than an apology nothing further was offered.  

I would recommend the Equestrian Centre, but the hotel itself - not a chance.",2,2020,08,04
239,Not a 5 star,"Stayed here for a night after getting engaged the day previous in The Europe...and what a let down. Rooms weren’t ready (which is fine, we were early)...had to ask was there somewhere we could leave our bags while we went for lunch. The bags were still there when we came back and had to lug them up to our room ourselves. We were seated by the manager in The Hound, he was so intent on making a show of how busy he was that he made you feel the opposite of relaxed, far too abrupt. The steak sandwich we got for lunch was pathetic, a tiny cheap cut of steak, not seared correctly on some cheap ciabatta, all for €17...you could immediately tell the lack of interest from the kitchen. Similar to other reviews our plates were left on the table for so long that flies started circling the table...the 5 waitresses were busy chatting. Thankfully we had booked the Barrow’s Keep for dinner that night. I went in to the pro shop then to ask how late the range was open...the older gentleman working in the shop barely looked up to tell me “it’ll be open as long as we’re here”...so I had to ask what time exactly, to which he replied about 7, and then looked back down. So rude that my partner actually laughed. We complained to the manager at breakfast the next morning, he took 70 Euro off our stay which was appreciated but his manner is awful and he was keen to blame everyone except himself. The lady on reception on our checkout was so professional and dealt with our issues really well...listening, sympathising and apologising. Management could take a leaf out of her book. Staff training is clearly a massive issue here. Completely unacceptable for a 5 star. Avoid ",2,2020,08,03
239,"Beautiful setting, Terrible service","We stopped into Mount Juliet today and were very disappointed with the whole experience.
Firstly, a walk around the walled garden was very sad, with an entire section completely neglected and overgrown. Having been in the garden for a fabulous wedding last year, it was quite shocking to see it had been let go so much.
We then strolled up to the Manor House where we spotted an empty table on the lawn and decided to see if it was possible to get tea and scones. We entered the property and were directed to the bar to inquire as to whether the table was free. Two staff members were there and the seemingly more senior of the two gave us a surly greeting. We inquired as to the possibility of tea and scones and were shrugged to a table ‘if we wanted’. We asked if it was a possible to sit outside and, while turning away from us, we were told if there was one there we could take it... we almost thought twice about the whole thing. The couple inquiring about a wedding seemed to be getting much better service.
The table was still free outside and another staff member helped us find a second chair with the promise of menus which never came. Staff came and went serving the handful of other tables and eventually a senior staff member noticed us trying to catch someone’s attention. He inquired as to whether we had been given menus (no), if we had just arrived (no), were we residents (no) and told that usually the lawn is for reservations only...(excuse me?) and an apology was given. We weren’t going to wait for menus at this point and placed our order promptly. We were promised it would be right out.
After a longer delay than necessary, a pot of tea and cups arrived and before we had the chance to act on a rising desire to leave. No milk and no scones, however the surly lady we had encountered earlier proceeded to drop the bill.
Milk arrived a few minutes later once requested. Still no scones.
Eventually, a waitress appeared with one scone and asked us if we had ordered two (yes). She then left with the only scone (!) and returned later with two...
We ate as quickly as possible, €20 lighter and thankful we weren’t scoping it out for a wedding.",2,2020,08,03
239,Far from 5 star service!,"I visited Mount Juliet for a walk on the grounds followed by lunch with 3 friends, and we were left shocked by the poor standard of service from a 5 star hotel. While the hotel was busy, staff were not run off their feet by any means, which, if that were the case, we would have been more lenient. Waiters continuously forgot about us. We ordered four ham and cheese toasties, which for €12.50 each, was basic, nothing special and one of which came without it's accompanied sauce. Our plates were left sitting in front of us for about 1 hour after finishing, we were never checked on or offered more water, etc. We then had to call over a waiter to clear our table and to ask for dessert menus. Our table was half cleared, but then we were left waiting for another 15-20 mins before it was fully cleared. We then had to call the waiter back to actually take the dessert order. These are all little things, but when combined, resulted in an unpleasant experience and we just expected better. Would not be in a rush back.",3,2020,08,03
239,Fabulous!,"Just back from a fabulous weekend in Mount Juilet.  I am baffled at how people are leaving less than 5* reviews. It is a challenging time for hotels and they have handled it perfectly,  there are new systems in place to protect everyone but it is all done discreetly and without taking away from the whole experience. We stayed in the Manor House and the room was lovely, the food everywhere was excellent and all working at the hotel were friendly and very helpful.  I couldn't recommend it enough,  it is a truly memorable experience and I will definitely return again.",5,2020,08,02
239,Absolutely STUNNING food and service,"Just finished the most delicious meal with my mother in The Hound. She had cauliflower soup and we both had a freshly cooked scone, jam and cream with tea. What a classy place. My mother has decided this is the BEST soup she has ever tasted. The scones... nothing is spared here. The scones are to die for. The views are stunning. The service is incredible, five star all the way. I would have taken a picture for this review but nothing lasted long enough to have it's photo taken! An experience that is all the more appreciated post lockdown. Kudos to the staff. Great job. We will have to stay see night to get the full experience.",5,2020,08,02
239,Restaurant and Clubhouse ....let's hotel down,"Just back from a three night stay in Mount Juliet.Hotel and grounds were very nice.we stayed in Hunters yard,room very nice .Reception staff spa staff, equestrian staff and bedroom staff all very heplful and very friendly,however the staff in restaurants and clubhouse a different story .... you have to call the staff for everything its like the waitresses / waiters walk with their heads down hoping not to get a job service here is appalling staff were grumpy and rude in cases slamming down drinks on our table because we went to the bar to order food because nobody was coming to our table in the clubhouse, barman cursing behind the bar in hounds bar not very pleasant at all its like there is nobody in charge in this area.We were told we had to vacate a table at a certain time we were finished at that time but waited a further 20mins to get a waitress to give us our bill and the maitre d hassled us again about needing the table. Its a pity the hotel lets itself down here a major part of a stay there and its nothing to do with covid either its just v unprofessional and just not 5 or 4 star service star almost more like fautly towers which is a shame as other than that a lovely place to go with family for a realaxing break.",3,2020,08,02
239,Great stay ,"We nearly had a rethink on this booking given a number of previous reviews by others and the value of the stay, but needn't have worried.

Covid restrictions have been sensibly implemented but this hotel still oozes class. We stayed on the Hunters Yard Hotel. Front of house staff were super professional, efficient and very friendly at every encounter. The room was spotless and while its clear that some fixtures / furnishing had been removed to minimise contact surfaces, the room is still clearly top notch from top to bottom and had an excellent Tv/entertainment setup. Decor, surroundings and the grounds are stunning. 

Dining options certainly have to be pre-booked, there is little scope for spontaneity, but this is not unique to this hotel and was also encountered when we ate elsewhere in Kilkenny. We dined in the Hound which was excellent, and were able to access the residents bar with reasonable time restrictions after.

This stay was a welcome treat for us and we would happily return in future. ",5,2020,08,01
239,Certainly not 5* service!!..,"Arrived to a beautiful hotel set on magnificent grounds, however the service we received unfortunately didn’t match the 5 star rating, the countless awards displayed and the 5 star prices! On the second night of our stay we ate in The Hound restaurant.... the service was simply appalling. We didn’t get our starter until 1 hour after being seated at the table, I ordered a drink which never arrived, after a half hour wait I had to ask for dessert menus, after another long wait I had to ask for someone to take our order for dessert, waited another half hour for dessert and after waiting a final half hour after dessert, had to go seeking the bill myself. The table next to us was left uncleared with food on the floor for quite a while during the early part of the evening, the waitress and manger did apologise a few times and made excuses for the service but yet from the outset never appeared to come near our table or make an effort to put it right. We felt like we didn’t matter! 2 drinks and the desserts were taken off the bill and the manager of the hotel simply said this was unacceptable and would raise it at her team meeting. Five star prices but not a five star stay! Have stayed in many 5 star hotels over the years and this is by far the worst dining experience! ",2,2020,07,31
239,Birthday celebration,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff were so helpful and friendly they even helped to book activities around Kilkenny for us. We ate in the Lady Helen restaurant which was a great experience. The shuttle from hunters yard to the manor is a great service that they provide. The manor and the grounds are just beautiful.,5,2020,07,29
239,Three Star Service at Five Star Prices,"I have very mixed feelings about our recent stay in Mount Juliet. There is no doubt that it is a truly beautiful place to stay but some of the aspects to our stay were below par. Covid 19 is the new catch-all excuse for everything but cannot be used all the time for simple mistakes in guest relations.

Pros:
-Magnificent setting with golf, walks and cycle paths
-Friendly, efficient check in/out with Louise, the most professional staff member we met
-Spotlessly clean, beautifully decorated bedroom and bathroom 
-Very comfortable bed (we slept like logs)
-Effective AC unit kept the room at a perfect temperature 
-Top class dining in the Lady Helen restaurant (see separate review)

Cons:
-No drinks available except in your room unless you are eating food. I feel some latitude should be shown for hotel residents with dinner reservations in-house, albeit at a later time.
-Ninety minute rule applies even in the Michelin Star restaurant, we had to order our desserts when choosing starters and mains 
-Room allocation. Plenty of empty rooms in the hotel yet we were given a room with a connecting door to another bedroom which was occupied by a family with two small, screaming kids. We were moved immediately, which we appreciated very much, but one has to question why we were given that room in the first place?
-Staff Training. We were shown to our room by a young man whose only comment upon entering was, “here we are”. No information was given about the room or the hotel facilities. My husband gave him a tip which he should have discretely put behind his back. Instead, he proceeded to open his hand and count it in front of us, cringe.
-Cleaning of patio. Obviously previous occupants of our room were smokers, there were eleven! cigarette butts right outside our door
-All businesses are trying to reduce ‘touch points’ but Mount Juliet have taken this a step too far in my opinion e.g. a coffee tray with no milk, no hankies in the bathroom etc So, if you want to blow your nose you must either phone Reception or use loo roll. Definitely not my idea of 5 Star luxury!
-Breakfast was bedlam. For me this was the straw that broke the camel’s back. Two teenagers were running the whole dining room. They were serving the buffet, waiting on tables, cleaning tables, sanitising tables etc etc etc. They were two very pleasant kids but they were completely overwhelmed with all they had to do. Where were the experienced wait staff??

All in all we enjoyed our staycation but it did not live up to our expectations. The simple reality in life is that when you pay more, you expect more. Mount Juliet sadly did not deliver five star luxury. They need to seriously pull up their socks, it’s a great place with potential in spades. ",3,2020,07,24
239,Excellent stay,"I see a lot of negative reviews on this lately but I must say we traveled and stayed for 2 nights and found it exceptional ..in the manor house anyway don’t no about hunters yard as we didn’t go there .. yes there was a few minor things but that is the same everywhere due to government restrictions ..all staff were extremely kind and respectful of all requests and made us feel at ease with there protective gear .. people need to realize the staff are risking there health to so people can enjoy nights away ... from check in  with Jamie to the concierge and the restaurant staff..a real delight .. but there was 3 people that really stood out and made our stay like heaven Ann Marie , Paul and Conor ... both mornings for breakfast with Ann Marie were a treat I must say .. and for the 2 barman Paul and Conor absolute excellent and complete gentlemen .. both were extremely busy up and down to rooms and to the restaurant and the bar and still found time to speak to people and get everyone served as quickly as possible .. it was incredible to see them so busy but still provide excellent service and people skills .. cocktails were fantastic and even made us some  not on there list ( above and beyond as one would say ) .. thank you so much to everyone for our stay and especially these 3 .. they are the reason we will definitly return again..pure peace and perfection on this lovely estate ... easily the best place we have been in Ireland ..",5,2020,07,23
239,Disappointed (and cancelled) before arrival ,"We booked during lockdown so we had a weekend to look forward to after the hotel opened. Additionally, we booked two
lunches and dinners (in both restaurants) and a horse ride at the equestrian centre. 

Unfortunately, on the eve of our trip, we have cancelled due to the disappointing customer service we’ve received to date, with booking errors, changes and disappointments. Despite giving the hotel multiple opportunities to rectify, they did not seem to care.

We have decided not to risk further disappointment (particularly after the recent negative reviews) and we’ve given our business elsewhere. 

",1,2020,07,23
239,Extremely disappointing,"My god what a let down,arrived in hunters yard reception at 4pm ,waited 50 minutes to check in a queue  that was so long to be told room not ready,eventually got to room ,rang leisure centre to be told our child couldn’t swim due to high volumes of numbers in pool,dinner reservations mixed up,menu in hound restaurant limited,tv in room not working,vending machine outside not working and the tipping point was the following morning,no changing room facilities open in leisure centre ,builders and painters present as myself and my child proceeded to go for a swim,dust everywhere,due to recent renovations,why open a 5 star hotel and charge crazy money when it’s nowhere up to scratch,disgraceful!",1,2020,07,22
239,Not worth the price for the service received.,"Really disappointing. Suggest you save your money and go to a reasonable 3 or 4 star hotel with the same offering. Really, if you are paying top dollar you would expect a half decent service, it's just not there anymore.",3,2020,07,21
239,Exceptional ,"Stayed in Hunters Yard and dined in the hotel on one night and the Lady Helen on another. Room was spacious, lovely decor. Couldn’t fault anything about the whole trip - lovely staff, great service, fabulous cocktails both in the hotel bar and the Manor House bar. The Lady Helen was exceptional - an experience we would love to repeat. ",5,2020,07,15
239,Cutting corners is not the way,"The Hotel and rooms are lovely but ultimately a three star experience and not worth it . COVID -19 is not an excuse to cut service levels to the bone . Your room is made up only if you ask , threadbare supplying towels , a limited though good ‘ a la carte ‘ which had four choices that didn’t change over 4 nights , no minibar or a menu alternative , no room service menu . It’s still a lovely hotel but with a service level that  a hundred other good iris hotels are offering for a third of the price",3,2020,07,14
239,Beautiful Country House Hotel,"We stayed here for 1 night at the weekend.  We were booked on a B&B basis in a Double room with garden view.  On entering the property we were met by a lovely friendly gentleman who promptly took our bags and brought us to the reception area where we checked in, our room was not ready but we didn’t mind as we sat outside on the terrace which was lovely.  We were told we couldn’t order a drink unless we ordered food, this was annoying as we had lunch just before we arrived and to be honest I don’t think this policy should apply to residents.  We ordered food and a drink each and it arrived a while later.  I will say that our impression of the hotel bar staff was that they were extremely busy and everything felt rushed.  Not much chat because they were under pressure.  We also noticed that no one washed down the tables after they were used, this was a bit unsettling due to COVID-19.  We believe that more staff are needed and more time is needed to clean tables etc. The breakfast the following morning was very nice but again lack of serving staff made this experience feel a rushed experience.  Maybe because they have just recently reopened they are finding their feet again, hopefully the service will improve. Overall a pleasant stay with beautiful grounds.",4,2020,07,13
239,Wonderful Hotel ,"I'm a little late with the review but better late than never they say. My partner and I spent two wonderful nights here in the Hunters Yard for the February mid term. 
The rooms are luxurious and quiet, the staff friendly and helpful, i really can't fault this place. 
We had afternoon tea in the Manor House and dinner in the Lady Helen, all sublime. A wonderful getaway and i cant recommend it highly enough. ",5,2020,05,19
239,A lovely overnight stay,if you are looking for a lovely overnight not too far from Dublin - look no further. Two options to stay - different eating options and some lovely options to just chill by a beautiful big turf (important its turf) fire. Even with the Corona virus issue all the staff were operating professionally but obviously taking extra precautions. I took one of the bikes and cycled around the estate...well worth the trip. Would defo go back and avail of the equestrian centre.,4,2020,03,16
239,Calm and relaxing,Just spent 2 glorious days at mount juliet.  The grounds are so beautiful and wonderful walks. They have the most amazing staff who couldn't do more for you especially Laura at reception Brian in the saddle bar and most especially the fabulous concierge Patrick.,5,2020,03,13
239,Liam O'Brien,"I cannot praise Mount Juliet highly enough, it is certainly well deserving of its 5 star status! 
Excellent facilities and grounds but these pale into insignificance to the staff and to the level of expertise they bring to all areas. 
Of particular note, I must mention Des McGrath - Customer Manager, this role insures guests are looked after but he also treats each individual as a friend. 
He enthralled our group with his impressive storytelling, you could hear a pin drop as he regaled us with the colourful history of Mount Juliet. You can’t train people to have this ability – you either have it or you don’t and Des definitely has it in spades….
 Another highlight was the food it was top class and service was excellent, very attentive especially with regard to guests dietary requirements – couldn’t fault it.
 I would not hesitate to recommend this fantastic hotel to anyone overseas or to a local like myself!",5,2020,03,06
239,Fab grounds and friendly staff,"A large group of us stayed at Hunters Yard and Mount Juliet for a big birthday. Staff were very friendly and helpful and not too bothered having four kids running round. Patrick, the concierge, was particularly helpful. While we were disappointed the pool/spa was closed for renovations the activities organised made up for it. Dinner in the Clubhouse was not great but dinner in the Lady Helen Michelin star was excellent (could have made a bit more of an effort with one of our party who had dietary needs). Lots to do within the grounds. Rooms were spotless. The bikes and fresh cookies are a nice touch.",5,2020,03,03
239,Cozy Saturday,Really enjoyed our stay in the manor house... a beautiful estate house with a warm atmosphere not only from the beautifully lit original open fires bit in terms of how at home we were made to feel for the weekend...the highlight was the story telling of the history of the estate from the year 1750 when Juliet Boyle came to the house up until the modern day owners... The history lesson was delivered in the main bar by Des McGrath who made sure the crowd was well informed and engaged at all times.... would highly recommend,5,2020,03,02
239,Not a 5 star,"Myself and my wife just spent a pleasant weekend in Hunters Yard. However since it is claiming to be a 5 star hotel I don’t think it meets these expectations.

The rooms and general decor are amazing as were the grounds of the hotel. Beautiful walks. We also really enjoyed our spa treatments.

The food is nice but fairly standard for the price you are paying. We ate in The Hound the first night and were underwhelmed for the price.

The 2nd day we ate in the Hunters Yard bar and had an unsatisfactory experience. We just made it before the cutoff point of 4pm for bar food which was great. However after finishing our dinner the staff refused to serve us dessert as the kitchen was now ‘closed’ apparently. We were told if we wanted dessert we would have to go over to the golfers clubhouse.

So in the middle of storm Jorge, myself and my 8 months pregnant wife had to go outside and over to the clubhouse to finish our meal ! Ridiculous! A bit of common sense goes a long way I feel. 

All in all I would say to temper your expectations as it is not near a 5 star hotel. We enjoyed our stay all in all but when you see the bill at the end you realise that you should be getting a bit of a higher standard.",3,2020,03,02
239,Great location with proper Irish welcome,"We arrived and greeted by Patrick the concierge who made us feel welcome and helped us with everything including keeping the kids occupied!

The food was fantastic and the staff were very friendly and helpful especially with 3 kids under 4.

The grounds are well kept and the playground is a great distraction. 

We would highly recommend to visit and will be coming back for a longer stay next time. 

Keep up the good work everyone!",5,2020,03,01
239,A Trip to Remember,"My Mother and I visited Mount Juliet for a couple of days for her birthday. We throughly enjoyed our stay. From the time we arrived, the staff couldn't have been more helpful and gracious. They went above and beyond and always had a kind word or greeted us, and made us feel welcome. The surrounds of the Manor House were beautiful, and the open fires in each of the rooms made coming in out of a chilly February day, cosy and welcoming. We had a walk around the stud on our second day. It was beautiful and the scenery was some of the best I've seen in Ireland. Later that day, we were lucky enough to catch Des in the bar, for his Fireside Stories at 5pm. If you happen to be in the Manor House from 5-6, Des' Fireside Stories are a MUST! He gave us the history of the Manor and the Stud in a relaxed and inclusive atmosphere. His knowledge about the Manor is second to none, and it was like the cherry on the cake of our stay. Des was very generous with his time, and we talked about how we enjoyed it for most of the drive home. We hope to visit Mount Juliet Estate again in the near future.",5,2020,02,29
239,Fantastic Hotel,"They gave me a room upgrade so that was a help, but it was just part of the whole experience of their staff going that little bit further than necessary.  The facilities and grounds are first class but I think with a good hotel like this it's the people who make the difference and I guess that comes down to good management.
They really go out of their way to help on every interaction without being pretentious or it seeming forced.  I cannot think of a better experience in a hotel in Ireland.",5,2020,02,25
239,Afternoon tea for valentines day,Had a brilliant couple of hours here. Wandered around the large grounds and manor house and had a scrumptious afternoon tea. Place was beautiful and had a lovely calm and relaxing atmosphere to it. Will definitely visit again and maybe stay a night. ,5,2020,02,15
239,lovely,"lovely grounds, manor house lovely, room lovely with garden,great staff with the exception of the breakfast manager quite abrupt in restaurant on first morning , everything with the stay went good, the last day we had room service for breakfast but when it arrived it had no cutlery, no butter, no cold milk for coffee, we tried to phone quite a few times from the room but could get no answer I even phoned 5 times from my mobile and no answer so as a result my mum went down to reception which kind of defeats the purpose of room service, but she met the breakfast manager she came to the room again not very nice she took away the tray and arranged to bring a new breakfast but was not best pleased as if it was our fault & she was looking around the room as if she was going to find the missing items from the breakfast tray anyway the whole situation was very uncomfortable, pity it happened,food was nice.",4,2020,02,12
239,Recent Stay,"Sent the following email to the general manger and two weeks later to reservations without any response to date from either. Disappointing!

My husband and I had a recent stay for our wedding anniversary on the 2nd January in the Hunter's Yard rooms (room ---). Firstly, I would like to commend your reception staff on a lovely welcome, especially Laura who was extremely helpful. Unfortunately, we had a few housekeeping/ maintenance issues with our room. On unpacking I found socks in the wardrobe that a previous guest had left behind. In addition one of the bathrobes was very tatty and torn. The bathroom taps were loose and the drainage in the sink was very slow. When my husband removed the sink stopper to allow the water to drain away the stopper fixture was filthy. I used a tissue to try to clean this and discovered that other than this one tissue the box was empty and clearly hadn't been replenished by housekeeping. There were a number of dirty marks on the shower and one on the bathroom door. There was only one mirror in the bedroom itself and when my husband was in the bathroom there was nowhere in the room for me to sit and do my hair or make up as the mirror is off centre when you sit at the desk/ dressing table. 
We had a pleasant stay, the grounds and buildings are beautiful, but these points in our room were disappointing and not what we expected from an establishment which had come so highly recommended to us and therefore I wanted to bring the same to your attention.
Yours Sincerely,
--------------------",3,2020,02,11
239,Christmas party ,We hosted our company Christmas party here in January. It was Amazing and so special. The food was fabulous and service top class. We were all really well looked after. Hunters Yard was a really cool venue and the staff could not have done better. Thanks to all. ,5,2020,02,09
239,Work over night stay in Mount Juliet,Stayed over night for a work trip. Absolutely gorgeous hotel. Ordered steak and it was utterly delicious. The rooms are lovely. The heating wasn’t on when I got in but the room soon heated up. Only the bathroom was still a bit cold. The grounds are beautiful and there are a number of walks on site. ,4,2020,02,04
239,My mum's wonderful 70th birthday party!,"Writing reviews of places I stay is not something that I would normally take time to do. I don't really know why, I read other people’s reviews so why not write my own! However, in this instance I would very much like to take the time to share with you the wonderful time me, my immediate and extended family had in January 2020. I picked Mt Juliet to celebrate my mother’s 70th birthday party and I was not once left thinking that I had made a mistake. The food, atmosphere, hotel, service etc. was perfect. I could not recommend the place more. The staff, from the porters to the restaurant, the managers, the front desk staff and the back room people was all a credit to the hotel. They showed me every courtesy that they could provide and as a result our night was (in my opinion anyway!) a huge success. Thanks again to all.

On a side note, Ross Kearley, the musician I booked was also a huge success and contributed in every way that he could with the verity of music he was able to conger up on the night. If you are in the need of someone to play at your party I could not recommend anyone more highly.",5,2020,02,04
239,Perfect stay ,"We stayed in Mount Juliet twice during January. This review is for our most recent stay. The Manor House and hunters yard are about 5 mins  beautiful scenic walk away from each other just as an FYI. Check in was quick and very friendly with all dining and recreation options explained to us. We stayed in the Manor House in an absolutely stunning room overlooking the river, we had the windows open a lot and the only sound to hear were the birds and river it was so peaceful. Every interaction we had with all staff members was extremely positive and many of them remembered us from 3 weeks prior. There are log fires burning in various locations which make it super inviting and cozy. Breakfast in the Manor House was menu service with a small buffet also and of a very high standard, we enjoyed everything we ate. We ate in the clubhouse on one evening. Laura was our host and was so kind and welcoming. The food was delicious and in the style of a bar food menu. On our second night we dined in “The Hound” restaurant and again the food was of a very high standard. The trout tasted like it had just been pulled from the river moments before serving and my husbands steak was cooked to perfection and very tasty. Again staff were friendly and attentive. We had afternoon tea in the majors bar and it was perfect. We take afternoon tea quite often and the sandwiches on offer here are some of the freshest and best we have ever had. The steak sandwich in majors bar is also incredible (staff here were as usual brilliant). The cocktails in majors bar where very well balanced and the “lady Helen” in particular had me going for another and another and another. The atmosphere in The major bar is relaxed, quiet and had that Manor House charm that we love. The bar in hunters yard (the saddle bar)is a bit more lively and had live music on Saturday night which was fun to switch it up for a while. Their drink selection is great and I loved and recommend the viper cocktail. The grounds are STUNNING with many long walks to take. We really enjoyed exploring the grounds and they are vast. We went to see the horses too which was lovely. If you’re a wildlife enthusiast there are many bird species to keep an eye out for. We even saw a peregrine falcon (wild) and also some buzzards. There is a lovely walled garden too which is worth checking out. We liked the leisure centre which is over in hunters yard. The pool was nice with a grotto. It was slightly unkempt but not to the point where I would take anything off my overall rating and besides it is about to be closed for renovation which will be welcome and I’m looking forward to seeing it. We communicated with Alan the hotel manager and he was so kind and accommodating. Alan if you’re reading this, congratulations on your fabulous hotel and well done to all your staff. Each and every one of them were delightful and a highlight of our stay and please do pass that on to them. It’s rare to have such a consistently incredible staff, I’m sure you value them all. Thank you for a perfect stay and we will be back soon",5,2020,01,31
239,Fabulous stay,"Stayed in Hunters Yard with my Mam and sister.It was fabulous, the girls on reception were so friendly and welcoming.Our room was beautiful and beds so comfortable.The grounds on the estate are stunning.We had dinner in The Hound,while the food was lovely my only complaint was the main courses were a little small.Breakfast was fantastic.Overall we really enjoyed our stay and will definately return.",5,2020,01,27
239,"Hunters lodge great.. Manor house, not so much. ","We stayed here for 2 nights as a young family with our 11 week old son.
We had booked for hunters lodge and booked a spa treatment. 

Hunters lodge was perfect, room lovely and modern, spacious on the ground floor as we had a buggy. Staff were fantastic, dinner at the hound was brilliant and just a general pleasant, laid back atmosphere. 
Pool was a little cold but still great and we took our baby for his first swim which was lovely, again staff in pool and spa fantastic and my treatment- a full body massage was great. 

We were asked to move on the second night to manor house as they were doing works in hunters lodge. Sold as an ""upgrade"" 
We were pretty relaxed and agreed to the move... this is where it went a bit wrong for us. 

Manor house is a VERY fancy. Its is not a place for relaxing with your 11 week old.
The first room they gave us was way at the back of the hotel up a narrow winding flight of stairs... not ideal with a buggy and a baby.
We asked if we could move somewhere more accessible. They found us a ground room with just a small flight of steps up to it.  Which was more manageable. 
I feel like really we shouldn't of had to ask for a ground floor room but mistakes are easy enough made and they were busy.

The room was not as comfortable as the modern hunters lodge and we found at night the emergency exit sign shone a beautiful bright green into the room..

The place was full of businessmen and much more formal. Paintings from the british aristocracy celebrating fox hunting just sort of summed this place up. Lovely for a formal occasion but this was exactly what we didnt want. 

It did put a bit of a dampener on our stay as we found it a little uncomfortable.

So overall for families I'd say go to hunters lodge and I would return again. But Manor House for just adults.

239,My fairytale weekend at the estate,Myself and my boyfriend visited this beautiful place last weekend. My  then boyfriend and now fiance planned a surprise proposal with the help of the most amazing staff team at the estate. They not only coordinated with the proposal curator that my fiance had picked but also went out of their way to ensure my fiance got what he needed to make the day extra special for us. At the end of a beautiful evening we had prosecco and chocolates waiting at our room to continue our celebration. We stayed overnight at the Hunter's yard and our room on the whole was perfect for a weekend stay. Rarely do you find hotels with heated bathroom floors! There is a lot to do for everyone at the estate. The breakfast spread was impressive which being a vegan I didn't expect! We decided to cycle around the estate in the morning through the picturesque area. We highly recommend the estate and we definitely look forward to visiting again in future. ,5,2020,01,13
239,New Year's Eve visit,"Arrived New Year's Eve@ 2.15 pm and our room in the Manor House was ready which was a good start. Had Al late lunch in the Majors bar which was excellent. Our room was fabulous, huge double bed in a huge space, large bathroom with underfloor heating. We ate in the Lady Helen restaurant that night and the food was the best meal we have ever eaten in a hotel. The service and staff first class as befits a restaurant of this standard. This experience alone was worth the trip. We adjourned to the Hunters Yard bar to ring in the New Year, celebrations were quite muted. Beautiful walks next day and dinner in the Hound, the food was good but service was slow and we needed to ask for dishes to be removed. We had been spoiled by our experience in the Manor House. Overall a pleasant experience.",5,2020,01,08
239,Good all rounder ,"The hotel has got some terrible reviews for service and I think this is harsh. Some of the staff are a little inexperienced but all are friendly, genuine and helpful. 

The room.
We had standard in hunters yard, it was smaller than expected but still sufficient with 2 double beds. The air con was tricky and I struggled so you should ask receptionist for help ( I didn’t)

Dinner
The restaurant in the old house was booked out so we ate in the hound. It was excellent. The duck terrine starter was unreal. Pork belly was also excellent. 

Breakfast 
There were issues with queues but I think this was more an organisational issue than capacity. The food itself was good but there were no extras that you would expect in a 5 star. It was not dissimilar to a good Novotel which was a little disappointing. 

The grounds
Lovely for a walk.

Kids club. 
The 2 girls were excellent and our kids loved the kids club. They can have their dinner their too if parents want to eat on their own. There used to be activities like a trip to see the horses or falconry but these have been replaced by a movie! That is a real pity as it is the kind of thing that sets Mt Juliet apart. 

The old house - Mt Juliet
It’s a pity but they seem to struggle with capacity and the place feels very full at times. However - the cocktails are great and the fella behind the bar is great. 

The hunters yard really misses a good drawing room. They have a residents lounge but it was cold and the fire not lit. You have to wonder why not when the place was nearly full. If this was made cosier, there may be less demand on the main house.

All in all though - a good spot, lovely grounds, nice staff, great food and a kids club included in the price- well worth a return visit.",4,2020,01,05
239,"Really disappointing meal at The Hound, terrible service.","We had a really disappointing meal at the Hound. Our food took over an hour, no one checked on us during this time or took another drinks order. After 45 minutes we had to ask if our food was on the way, a further 15 minutes later, as we were about to leave, it arrived. Our sides never arrived, we ordered more drinks once our meal had arrived, they didn't come, we asked again. The drinks eventually arrived, the wrong drinks... The food itself was actually good but the service was really terrible. Our drinks were taken off, plus a further 10%, however the manager had said that the mains would be taken off, they were not. There was little by way of apology, in fact we were told the problem was that we hadn't ordered starters...it should not take an hour for two medium rare steaks to be prepared. We will definitely not be back.",2,2020,01,05
239,Some parts great and some not,"Just back from 2 nights stay. 

The good:
 The grounds are amazing, lovely walking trails etc. 
The food is lovely and couldn't be faulted.
The bar in the Manor House is fab, great atmosphere at anytime of day.
The room we stayed in was lovely and everything was very clean as you would expect.

The bad:
The Spa / Pool is far from what you would expect, the pool is so old, dated and as a result looks unclean. The treatment I had in the Spa was fab as in the therapist was great but the bed squeaked with every slight movement, again it seemed dated and there was no element of luxury. 

Check out was a nightmare, if you put food and drinks on your room be prepared to have to check the most confusing bill on check out, we were charged twice for dinner in The Hound so an extra 115e. I noticed this and it was deducted however when I walked off I realised that there was only €6 difference between the ""wrong bill"" and the supposedly ""right bill"" we had just paid. I queued again for 20minutes and a new bill was printed this had a spa treatment on it that I never had for €106 (this wasn't on the first bill and the receptionist said it was added after we checked out which makes no sense!!) Anyway if I hadn't have double checked a second time we would have been over charged 106e. The reception is busy and one tiny table with one member of staff isn't enough, all in all it took us 45mins to check out which is ridiculous! 

We had dinner on the first night in The Hound, food was fab however everything came out super quick (too quick), 3 course meal was finished in just over an hour. This is a personal preference though and if you had children with you, you might be glad of the super quick service!

239,Beautiful setting ,"Went to dine here for an early lunch at The Hunters Lodge, food was lovely and setting was beautiful overall would highly recommend. My only complaint was the restaurant host/manager who unfortunately was very unfriendly and borderline rude, I understand he is trying to be efficient and to be fair he was, he knew the menu off by heart and was very organised and I would imagine is very skilled in many ways, but being stonyfaced  and acting like the customer  is a nuicance as opposed to a paying punter  is very off putting, when dealing with the paying public you need to be able to be both efficient and friendly. My lasting memory is bit tainted now because of this which is a shame. Top marks on everything else and we can all have an off day so  to the host I say   please smile a little  more it will work wonders for you 👍",4,2020,01,04
239,Incompetent Staff,"Recently stayed at this hotel and while the activities, spa and grounds were brilliant the customer sevice was a joke. Payment for the room was taken from me twice by receptionist who had no clue how to check someone in. Had to go to reception twice before my issue was taken care of, completely ignored the first time. Always check your bank account when checking in as staff appear incompetent and poorly trained!!",1,2020,01,02
239,Beautiful and luxurious stau,"A group of 8 of us stayed recently for our Dads 60th birthday. From the moment we arrived everything was just superb. The staff did everything they could to make our stay enjoyable. From the tea and scones by the fire, to a lovely lunch in our own private dining room, to drinks in one of the drawing rooms after dinner, we felt like royalty. Our beautiful rooms were in the Manor House, but we dined in the Hunters Yard. There was always someone around to give us a lift between the 2 buildings. The dinner was delicious. We participated in falconry and archery, both the gentlemen who led the activities were extremely professional and knowledgeable. Every single staff member we met was just so genuinely pleasant and helpful. The complementary touches for our dad’s 60th were lovely and so thoughtful. There was a slight discrepancy in our final bill, which was sorted out without too much hassle. We really splashed out on this special occasion but the experience was worth every penny in all of our opinions. Highly recommended for a rememberable break. Thank you to all the staff! ",5,2020,01,02
239,Absolutely Never Again....,"After visiting Mount Juliet several times before it was a no brainer to book this hotel for a belated New Years Day getaway.

I booked a King Room several weeks prior.

On arriving at 4pm I queued at reception for around 25 mins. Allocated a room but never asked for what time I’d like to be seated for dinner.

I was given the key and found the room was a disabled king room. 348 euros and not even a bath, a nice sink or shower head.

Back down to reception and waited another 20 minutes while they fixed the problem ....room 201.....another disabled room.....then room 150 a double room with the smallest bathroom in history.

Back to reception where the duty manager asked what I didn’t like about the rooms so he could ascertain what I wanted....seriously? I booked a king room. Big bed, big bathroom like my previous stays especially for 348 per night.

He insisted that they were fully booked and that it’s normal to be allocated rooms with disabled features....not even a mention of it at check in or at booking when there were plenty of rooms free.

With zero customer service and no satisfaction except to be walked around the hotel for an hour, I asked for a refund and heading back home  2 hours away.

Never, ever again.",1,2020,01,01
239,Can't get the basics right for families,"We booked a room for 2 adults and 2 young kids, and on arrival we were given a room with two beds and a shower (not ideal to try and put a 2 year old in a shower). We complained about the room as we expected a double and 2 single beds after spending €350 a night and specifically ordering a family room for 2 adults and 2 kids.  The only way they were willing to resolve this was by putting a cot bed into the room which had a mattress one inch thick and was so uncomfortable that our 4 year old couldn't stay longer than 30 mins on.  There are no extra touches for families which we didn't mind, but we expected that a hotel like this should get the basics right - the proper number of beds for a family and a bath for young kids, and not an expectation that everyone should 'bunk in and make do'. We definitely felt that because the hotel was busy that our complaints fell on deaf ears - on check out we reiterated our disappointment and we were given an 'oh sorry' and a shrug when they asked how are stay was.",2,2019,12,31
239,Excellent Hotel,"Mt Juliet was a treat that could not be faulted from start to finish. Check in was swift and we were met by very friendly staff. 
We enjoyed lunch in the clubhouse which was tasty and a nice atmosphere. Our room in Hunters yard was lovely. Nice and warm with a lovely bathroom. 
We enjoyed cocktails in the Manor house which as posted previously is not too far to walk. It's a lovely walk down surrounded by the golf course, nature and some houses. 
Back to the clubhouse for dinner as we were feeling relaxed and didn't want a big meal. The staff couldn't do enough for us. The service could not be faulted in the manor house or the clubhouse. 
Breakfast in Hunters yard was an extensive buffet which we really enjoyed. We didn't test out the spa or leisure club on this visit but as we will definitely return will do next time. 
Looking forward to another getaway to Mt Juliet and next time we will bring our kids.",5,2019,12,28
239,A Heavenly Break,"Step back into easy going style in the Grandeur  at Mount Juliet.
Divine Dinners in the Michelin Star, Lady Helen .
 A large fire in the Hall to greet you in the morning and Long leisurely breakfasts with staff that smile!!
Fabulous views across the River Nore and wondrous walks",5,2019,12,28
239,A little piece of heaven.,"Mount Juliet is my favourite hotel of all time. It’s a stunning glamorous period Manor House with magnificent reception rooms, fine dining, great walks and super comfy beds. However it’s the staff that were exceptional - the best I’ve ever come across. They all had just the right combination of professionalism & friendliness and could not have done more to make out stay an absolute pleasure (we never had to ask for anything, it was offered, and at the same time the staff never intruded). 
I treated my 18 year old daughter to the 7 course taster meal in the Lady Helen with wine pairing. This made for an exceptional (if expensive) evening. From start to finish the food was incredible and we both throughly enjoyed going out of our comfort zones with the wine. The vodka espresso martini at the end was a lovely surprise too. 
Dan & John drove us to the Hunters lodge and back to get to the pool area (as it’s was lashing rain). This really is the only downside to staying in the Manor House -  the trek to the pool area, but the staff more than made up for it. 
Although our room was not huge it was beautifully and tastefully decorated, it also had a stunning view and was very quiet. The bathroom was a little dated but again very comfortable. Top marks to the staff at Mount Juliet, we’ll be back. ",5,2019,12,16
239,Dreadful,"On arrival receptionist was in training so we were ignored for a while.  Got our room which was very badly laid out. L shaped room and tv was on wall facing the bed. Furniture to sit on was on the other side so of no use even when we moved it over. 

As the golf club was the only place open for food we went there.  We were ignored for almost 15 minutes. We tried to catch the waiters attention but he told us he had a big group and would be with me shortly. Others went to the counter for service.  We did too as the bill never came despite asking two people for it. Dreadful service. Chowder was good. 

Food in the hound for breakfast is a buffet.  However there is a menu. Take note if you try to order the full Irish you will be told to go and get it from the buffet.  Also if you order the scrambled egg with smoked salmon you will receive a small plate with smoked salmon ( no chives no dressing. Nothing) and told to get your own scrambled eggs. No tables cleared. 

Dinner in the hound was an absolute disgrace when you consider service.  We were just ignored. The staff are not interested. Managers seemed the same. 
Food in the lady Helen was good. Very expensive and not worth it in my opinion but the building is amazing although we needed a lift up and down as it’s too far from the hotel. 

I don’t know how this place has 5 stars?  ",1,2019,12,12
239,Main House for coffee and mince pies,"Thought we would start the festive season with a mince pie at the 5 star Mount Juliet in Kilkenny.
Terribly disappointed with the experience.
1.Poor quality mince pies
2.Tiny cups for coffee.
3.No visibility to lovely fire unless you were on top of it.
4.Price was outrageous

Christmas decoration dull and boring.

Don't bother going there. Overrated and is definitely not a 5 star experience.

Food in Golf club house terrible too.
I don't often post negative ratings but  from 2020 I'm not holding back.
",2,2019,12,10
239,Very poor for 5 star,"Stayed in mount Juliet for 3 nights , the only thing about this hotel that is 5 star is the golf , beautiful course and so beautifully kept ! The leisure center needs a serious overhaul , it’s really not 5 star quality , 3 at best !
The room was a good size and clean , furniture chipped , doors not closing on wardrobes , unable to push drawers in and out comfortably , attention to detail missing !
The lady Helen restaurant does not open Sunday or Monday night and the bar food menu is very very limited ! Hunters yard restaurant was fine ! 
Staff were very friendly , but to be honest I would not be rushing back",3,2019,12,08
239,Very good dinner ,This evening I was in mount Juliet in a restaurant called the hound and it was absolutely lovely I had the chicken supreme and the whites chocolate tart for dessert and I thought it was absolutely delicious. The staff were all very helpful. There was one in particular water called Ann-marie and she served us and she was very helpful ,5,2019,12,08
239,Terrible service and overpriced,Stayed for one night and upon arrival experienced awful service from reception. Basically just wanted to pay and leave. No information provided. Restaurant had a very limited selection and was freezing at lunch time. Breakfast also poorly serviced and again not a great selection. Quality of food served at breakfast could  be improved. Hotel was missing a lot to consider it a 5 star. No value for money. Will not be back.,1,2019,12,03
239,Dining in mount Juliet ,"Over the past 2 days I have been in a lovely resort in Kilkenny called mount Juliet and tonight I am with my brother and my dad and we are going to have dinner in the hound restaurant for the first time the menu looked great and the drinks were very good. Tonight I had chicken noodle soup and chicken supreme and I had an ice-cream sundae and everything was delicious all the staff were very helpful but  in particular a lady called Ann marie. She was very helpful and kind 
",5,2019,11,30
239,Leisure,"Amazing stay . Excellent, really tasty food. The staff could not have been nicer or more helpful. Hotel was warm and welcoming and beds to die for! Will definately return. 

About 15 minute drive from Kilkenny, where there are amazing places to eat, with a really good atmosphere. Loads to see and do around the area. The Manor house was lovely to sit around and relax too. 
",5,2019,11,27
239,2 star service at 5 star prices,"My wife & I stayed there for a weekend recently.  The grounds, rooms and facilities including the golf course are great but the staff and level of service falls well short of what you'd expect for a 5 star rating and 5 star prices.
Right upon arrival to when we checked out, we didn't get the warm welcome around the place you'd expect in any decent establishment. Coffee ordered in the lounge never arrived.  Staff in the bar were more interested in cleaning glasses than serving customers, staff in the leisure centre appeared inconvenienced at a simple enquiry for a towel  Upon checking out, the front desk staff just wanted to get the payment transaction done. When asked how it was, I said 'it was ok'.  No further enquiry was made except to hand me my bill. 
Stuff you might shake off in a lower graded establishment but not one claiming 5 stars.  Overall it had the feeling of a place that was understaffed, under trained and poorly run. Save your money for a proper 5 star hotel.",2,2019,11,25
239,"Beautiful estate, poor leisure centre","Myself and my husband recently spent a weekend at Mount Juliet estate in Thomastown, Co Kilkenny. We are both fairly active and like the outdoors so we chose Mount Juliet for our weekend away.  So we'll just go with the facts of our stay. It is a beautiful country estate with acres and acres of scenic parkland, walkways,river walks, woodland etc that we walked extensively and enjoyed the grounds immensely. It's so beautiful not to mention the fantastic golf course which we believe will host the Irish Open next year in 2020. 

Our room was very nice in The Hunter's Yard area of MJ and it is a very nice part of the estate having being recently extended and modernised we were told. The food was glorious and the overall ambience of the place is quite lovely.

But for us, being the active types, our stay was badly let down by the leisure centre. For a 5 star hotel the gym and pool area was a massive letdown. The gym is tiny with some equipment not working, cables left loose and unconnected and not a single tv working either on the wall or on the machines themselves. Why have equipment with TVs on them if they're not connected. Indeed talking to a member in there one evening we were told that since the refurbishment in 2017, the TVs haven't been reconnected.The  weights room was moved to the back of the pool area in a dimly lit cold area and even the weights themselves are all loose.Poor selection of weights too only up to 20kg. We finished up in the 'gym' and proceeded to the pool area and found the steam room to be rather dirty with yellow/orange gunk on the door handle and on the tiles. The wall is cracked and a big hole evident in one corner. It looks like a steam room that's not cleaned regularly but that could be just a timing issue we don't know. 

Overall we enjoyed our stay in Mount Juliet it really is a beautiful rural retreat with simply stunning panoramic parkland but the leisure centre needs a lot of work. ",3,2019,11,24
239,Perfect Stay,"This is an elegant manor home with a casual feel. I found it to be an excellent combination. The public rooms are formal with elaborate murals, gorgeous moldings, and historic paintings throughout. There are always fires burning in the foyer, library, and bar that add a warm and cozy feel on a cool day. The staff really shine here. They add as much warmth as the fires to any stay. The grounds are expansive and a pleasure to explore. Hunter's Yard provides excellent additional dining. One tip, book an executive room in the Manor House. They are much larger than the classic rooms and worth the added extra cost.  ",5,2019,11,22
239,Lunch time,"Hello, visited today with my daughter, we had a lovely lunch, she had goujons with potatoes and carrots, she loved it. I had black pudding croquettes for starters, fabulous. I had braised beef for mains with two types of potatoes and a bérnaise sauce. Wow, delicious, absolutely delicious. Well done to all in the kitchen, keep up great work. Special mention to ciara for great service. Been a while since I was down, and good to see food and service is still top notch.",5,2019,11,17
239,A fabulous relaxing break,"My husband and I stayed for 2 nights in the beautiful Manor House on the estate. Everything about this hotel from the moment we arrived when the lovely John helped us with our luggage to our room, to leaving the estate.
Oh my. What a fabulous relaxing setting both inside and out. The decor in the period house was beautiful, clean, warm and homely. Breakfast was absolutely gorgeous, especially the eggs Benedict. The food was so fresh and tasty with the staff and table service so helpful and professional, especially Annemarie. On our first night, we ate a feast in the Lady Helen restaurant, What a treat. Each course was sensational. I've never experienced anything like it before. The flavours complementing each other throughout each dish. We also ate in the Hunters Yard restaurant. The food there was perfect, especially the starters -i.e the trout and the goats-cheese. The service from the waiting staff was exceptional, and another Annemarie, couldn't do enough for us! I do hope that we'll return here again sometime soon.",5,2019,11,17
239,Lads golfing trip,This is a gem of a course and 5* resort. The food was excellent and each area had a great atmosphere. The golf at mount Juliet is equal to any of the best parkland courses in ireland. This is a championship course with slick greens and has not got a weak hole.,5,2019,11,16
239,Clubhouse madness,"I attended a meeting in the clubhouse Friday 15th, course was closed due to frost so there was probably 50 or so guests coming and going in the clubhouse. I spent over an hour there while waiter, mairead (I think) worked tirelessly trying to get through every guests order on her own.
For a 5 star resort I'm very surprised at how under staffed they are. No faults on our service as the waitress was superb just felt staffing numbers were so in adequate for a resort of mount juliet's reputation.",2,2019,11,15
239,The best afternoon tea,"We had afternoon tea upon arrival in the Majors bar - the views of the Nore river and estate were lovely. Staff were very friendly and helpful.
All of the food was delicious and very fresh. The best afternoon tea I’ve had, would highly recommend.",5,2019,11,11
239,Nice spa break,"I visited here with friends for a spa weekend away. We stayed in the Hunters yard which was beautiful. The hotel itself is well laid out with plenty of activities (swimming, golf, tennis, horse riding etc) and the staff were excellent. The rooms were spotless and decor was lovely. We each had Spa treatments performed which was really enjoyable. As a guest of the Spa we had access to the facilities. The pool is okay but became really busy with children from 5pm onwards, disappointingly there was no jacuzzi. Breakfast the next morning was nice for standard meat eating folk, no vegan options.",4,2019,11,10
239,OMG! Beyond beautiful!,This place is absolutely gorgeous!! The food is to die for! The room was great! Lots of places to roam and explore and things to do! It’s a little out of the way but sooo worth it! We went to The Ploughing while we were there. (Yearly event),5,2019,11,06
239,Beautiful Hotel,"Only had one night here, but what a gorgeous resort.  Service was impeccable - from the moment you check in.   We stayed in the Manor House portion of the hotel, and were upgraded to a Riverview King room overlooking the River Nore.  Had dinner at The Hound restaurant (while they have a lovely restaurant in the Manor House, we were looking for something more casual) on the property (but next door at their other hotel), and then drinks at The Major's Bar after.  All in all a wonderful, but short, visit.  I would highly recommend it for those looking for a little bit of pampering.",5,2019,10,30
239,Hotel stay,A beautiful hotel in large grounds and a 22 minute drive from Kilkenny. Their is a fantastic golf course and horse riding school on site. The rooms are large and well appointed and the service excellent. ,4,2019,10,25
239,Excellent,"Stayed here on a one night visit room was spotless as was the entire hotel we stayed in the hunters yard section not at the main house dinner was piping hot and beautiful served by a really friendly waitress the breakfast was also fabulous could not fault a thing. Do take in a walk in the wooded area they have maps at reception 
Do go and visit this lovely property you wont be disappointed",5,2019,10,18
239,Beautiful area,"We had a great stay at Mt. Juliet during a two week firstime Ireland trip. Nice clean rooms, good food and bar area, lovely grounds...even if you aren't a golfer! Close enough to the areas we were visiting. ",5,2019,10,13
239,family weekend,"We stayed in the main hotel for the weekend. Our room was excellent, at the top of the house.  We had a lovely bathroom but the bath/shower was difficult to get in and out of.
We had a lovely breakfast with all the choices that you would hope for in a 5 star hotel. We could not use the sitting room facilities as the weekend was booked out for afternoon tea parties [ both days ] and no facility was provided for guests, nor was any effort made to help us, once the staff were notified. There was no availability in the main restaurant at night, unless booked months in advance and hardly any room in the Court yard restaurant. There was no golf availability for guests and nobody cared as the hotel was busy and making money. This hotel needs to put it guests first and foremost.",3,2019,10,09
239,Pleasure,"One thing you can say about this place is the outstanding beauty of the grounds. Wether you want to take in a round of golf , or just the pleasure of walking round , then pop in for something to eat and drink . Just the peace and quiet it's definitely worth a visit",5,2019,10,06
239,Amazing Michelin experience,"We booked a standard double room for one night to experience the Michelin Star.
Initial impressions of the room were not great, we were giving what we assumed was a wheelchair accessible room - the bathroom had a shower curtain around it and did not look or feel five star.
Fair play to reception though as after a quick chat they gave us a complimentary upgrade to a Superior King room and it was stunning. 
The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable and luxurious and overall design / fabrics / colors in room were beautiful. Bathroom was on the small size but didn't bother us.

Lunch in the Clubhouse was lovely with a great selection of vegetarian options which my wife appreciated as so many places overlook this.

We went for the 7 course taster menu in Lady Helens, my wife had the vegetarian one.
All courses were amazing, the wine pairing with each equally amazing.

Breakfast the next morning was disappointing.
No white table cloths and a self service buffet made it feel very non five star.
The plates were cold and some of the buffet food was lukewarm.
Tables were small and we had to clear our table to make room for pastries. No effort made to offer something tailored for vegetarians.

Overall, we really enjoyed our stay.
Lady Helen's was the highlight with the Superior King room a close second.
We wouldn't let our breakfast experience prevent us returning, hopefully it's better next year as we hope to return (Maybe for 2 nights of Lady Helens)",4,2019,09,30
239,Beautiful grounds!,We stayed in the older manor house - lovely room with giant windows and a sense of history.  View of the horse farm across the way from the bar was a bonus.  You really need to make dinner reservations ahead of time if you want to eat here. Only complaint - slowest bartender ever (although as a trying-not-to-be-rude American I have found this to be a big difference in much of Europe),4,2019,09,27
239,Nice Stay- Restaurant very helpful,"We got a gift of a stay with dinner and stayed here on St. Patricks day, the grounds are really nice and there were bikes available to use. The restaraunt were a bit overbooked when we arrived but offered us our drinks free of charge given the small wait which was nice",4,2019,09,16
239,A beautiful property,"We enjoyed our stay at Mt. Juliet, although I didn't get to play golf. Service was very good, and our room was very nice. The manor is in a beautiful park-like setting with huge trees and some nice gardens. The gofl course borders the main area grounds. Our dinner in the casual dining room (The Hound) was only average, but in a very nice room with a great view of the course and hills beyond.",5,2019,09,13
239,10th Wedding Anniversary,"My wife and I have just returned from 1 night in this amazing hotel. It was a special treat being our 10th wedding anniversary and boy was it special. 
From the booking process all the way to check in it could not have been easier. 
Klara on reception made us feel so welcomed and nothing was too much trouble.
Our home for the night was the presidential suite which truly has the wow factor and the views were just stunning. 
All the staff were fantastic and a special mention to Paul in The Majors Bar & Carolina in The Hound Restaurant. 
This really is a special destination and we will absolutely be back soon.",5,2019,09,10
239,Almost perfection,"My husband booked a weekend away at the Mount Juliet Estate to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. The hotel is a beautiful property and the surrounding area of Kilkenny is absolutely stunning. We absolutely loved exploring the beautiful countryside and it was so quiet that at times we felt like the only people on Earth. It was the perfect escape from our busy working lives and Kilkenny is a beautiful and very romantic place. 

We arrived at the hotel late on Friday evening, having driven from Cork (where I was temporarily working) after meeting my husband - whom I had not seen for a fortnight - from the airport. The house looked stunning all lit up and we were warmly welcomed on the front desk after our long journey, our car and bags were taken care of and the front desk assisted us with ordering some room service before the kitchen closed. The food was delicious. The staff were lovely and everyone we came into contact with - from housekeeping to bar staff to front desk - was very friendly and service was effortlessly charming. 

However, there were two things that held back our experience from being absolutely perfect and we feel the hotel could address.

Firstly, despite staying in one of the River View suites in the Manor, we were unable to book a table at the Lady Helen Restaurant for the Saturday evening. We had made it clear at the time of booking that this was a special occasion and my husband had asked for recommendations and assistance with booking activities/meals to ensure the weekend was perfect. Instead we had to eat at The Hunter's Yard restaurant, which while nice, was more suited to families and casual dining. A complimentary glass of sparkling wine was offered on arrival which was a lovely touch but we were sandwiched in between several families with small children and had to shout to be heard above their noise on multiple occasions (not the romantic evening in a beautiful restaurant we had envisaged). I would like to suggest that the hotel reserve tables for their hotel guests in the main restaurant (as is the case at other hotels of this price point and calibre eg. Ballymaloe House) and then guests can turn these down if not required. Surely paying guests should retain priority? We were offered little in the way of compensation for this other than a shrug and a 'sorry'. 

Our room was spacious and the views were absolutely stunning. It was, however, a little too warm and felt as though the heating was on in our room/bathroom which was definitely not necessary in the warm weather. This meant we had our windows constantly open and therefore noise travelled between rooms and from outside very easily. The bathroom felt very outdated and not in keeping with the style of the rest of the room but it was clean and adequate.

Perhaps most disappointing of all was that our bed was extremely uncomfortable. Instead of the King size bed advertised, what we actually had was two single beds pushed together. This meant that we had to sleep on opposite sides of the bed as if we were near the middle we rolled into a weird and uncomfortable dip between the beds which was far from ideal. It was definitely not luxurious and not what we expected from a hotel as beautiful as Mount Juliet.

All in all, we had a great stay and think this is a beautiful hotel with lovely staff. These little tweaks would just make things heavenly!",4,2019,09,07
239,Wonderful luxury and attentive staff.,"A wonderful location in scenic Kilkenny, the Manor house is a lovely spot and staff are always at your beck and call.  Weddings can be a little intrusive but the hotel does its best to segregate the crowds.  The dining options in the Manor house itself are very restricted after 5pm outside of the Lady Helen which may not be for everybody and certainly not every night.  The golf club is more casual but (rather rudely) excludes non golfers from dining on Saturday nights, leaving only one choice for eating in the reservation-required Hound",4,2019,09,05
239,Relaxing idyllic  location,"Fabulous relaxing location to celebrate a special occasion . Interconnecting rooms  opening onto enclosed garden was ideal for family group . 
Dinner at Hunters yard restaurant offered a lovely casual relaxed environment as an alternative option to the more formal surroundings of Lady Helen restaurant at the manor itself . However breakfast there was super .
Bar food at golf club bar was overpriced . 
Staff were very co operative welcoming & friendly at all times .",5,2019,09,04
239,Wonderful,"We are just back from a weekend in the Mount Juliet. We stayed in the Manor House in an executive king room. So spacious and comfortable. The room was so quiet and no noise at all. 

Breakfast was lovely. Cold food laid out and you order hot. 

We went to the pool, did the walks and took the bikes for a cycle. Had great fun!

There was a wedding drinks reception held at the house on the Saturday so this was very loud but only lasted a few hours. The Saturday night wasn’t as quiet as the Friday but once we saw the wedding we expected this. 

We ate in the lady Helen restaurant on the Saturday night. Fantastic food. Just delicious. Enjoyed every mouthful from start to finish! 

On checking out there was drink on our bill we hadn’t ordered but this was sorted out with no quibble. (We thought this might happen as bar man wrote our order amount on his hand and couldn’t get us a bill to sign so I made sure to check this). 

Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel. Very relaxing and lovely food. We will definitely return in the future. 

",5,2019,09,02
239,4.8 star family experience,"Just back from a 3 night stay with my family including two kids aged 9. The hotel and all its facilities exceeded our expectations. We stayed in a family room in Hunters Yard. This is the only negative we had about the hotel so I will get it out of the way first. Family room has 2 double/queen sized beds for a family of 4. We have a boy and a girl who won’t share a bed - not an unusual scenario! We ended up getting a rollaway bed in the room for our son and there was still loads of room to move about. The double bed felt so small that I ended up sharing with my daughter! The bed configuration is all wrong. There is plenty of room for a king sized bed plus a single bed for a child (even two singles!) and then a rollaway. Makes you wonder if there was a Mother/parent involved in the bed configuration decision! 

So now for the many many positives. 
-Our kids loved the kids club which is rare. The activities are excellent mid week. Ours did archery and a golf lesson two of the days and then went into the evening session one of the nights and my husband and I ate in the Lady Helen which we really enjoyed. We had afternoon tea in the manor house while the kids did archery and it was incredibly relaxing and delicious (not dainty!)(luckily no wedding the day we booked!). 
-Lovely walks had by the family down by the river admiring the horses in the neighboring stud farm. We also did the 90 minute falconry experience- highlight of the trip for all of us and John who took us out with the hawk and owls was amazing, especially with our daughter who was very nervous at the start. 
-Pool is much bigger than the pics on the website, is 4ft deep all over with a little shallower pool for younger kids and has a lifeguard on duty. It wasn’t manic busy when we were there - we usually went down around 3.30pm and just a few families in the pool. Appreciate kids hours so those on an adult only break can avoid the noise and splashing if they want a quiet swim.
- Ate in the hound two nights and really enjoyed it both times. Kids happy with their choice and staff great with kids (hotel should maybe think of separate areas for families v couples. We felt bad for parents who had kids in kidsclub trying to have a nice meal in peace and they are seated between families) 
- lovely playground

We really enjoyed our break and will be back, hopefully to do some horse riding and fishing next time.",5,2019,08,26
239,Disappointing,"We turned up to Mount Juliet with a room in the Hunter’s Yard, not the main hotel, with high expectations.  The room and bathroom were well appointed but very small.  Not a lot of atmosphere overall.  The Hound restaurant was particularly bland including the food choice and there were lots of kids at dinner, which is fine, but not conducive to a romantic atmosphere.

We did enjoy the golf and did some fishing with the gillie, which was very enjoyable. Probably would rush back.  The main hotel may be better.",2,2019,08,25
239,It's a treat,"We arrived quite a bit earlier than check in time and without a booking for dinner that night. We were aware from the website that on that particular night Lady Helen's restaurant would be closed. The lady on reception was very kind and booked us into the Hound restaurant and took the initiative to ask for my details so that should our room become available she would contact us. We were given a map of the estate and went on a stroll around the beautiful grounds. Within an hour I received a call to say our room was available.

For a late lunch we ate in the clubhouse. The staff were very friendly and interactive and the food was tasty. I had a prawn sandwich, my husband a tomatoe and cheese sandwich, we both had an alcoholic drink and in total it came to €30.

We received a complimentary upgrade with our booking. The room was on the ground floor in Hunter's Yard and we had our own patio area to sit outside if we wished. The decor is fabulous and creates a relaxed ambiance.  There were a few cobwebs around but such a minor detail. The room can appear dark as the lighting isn't great. The bathroom is fab and well laid out with a beautiful rain forest style shower and plenty of towels. The toiletries are from the Handmade Soap company. Each room has a dressing gown and slippers. You have plenty of channels to watch on the tv. The bed is super comfortable and it was actually a double bed (a lot of hotels I've stayed in recently opt to put two single beds together). A proper hairdryer is provided. Room temperature was perfect for our stay.

We used the spa and received a lovely treatment. The relaxation room is small and in my opinion, not to the same standard as other hotel spas that I've been to. The treatment itself was enjoyable and I felt great afterwards. The changing room is quite small and comfortably only fits one person getting ready. 

We went to the pool which was heavily occupied with children. Seeing our hesitation the staff member informed us that children's time was up in the next ten minutes and true to her word on the hour she had all the children out of the pool. There is a sauna and steam room but there didn't appear to be a jacuzzi. The pool is sizeable. Changing rooms are adequate.

For dinner that night we ate in the Hound. We were shown to our seats and had the pleasure of overlooking the golf course. We forewent a starter anticipating a very tasty and filling main course but it wasn't to be so. I ordered the pork (€25 approx), my husband ordered the beef (€30). What we didn't know (and it wasn't brought to our attention) despite the description you should order a side with your meal as you only really get the meat. With the pork, I'd only one cabbage leaf and one carrot. My husband a 1/3 of a roast potato. If we had known upon ordering we would have ordered a side but as we weren't aware when receiving our main we felt it was too late to order a side as our mains would have gone cold waiting. Despite that, both main courses were very tasty and it was only a pity we hadn't ordered a side (€4 each). On top of this we both had dessert (tasty but nothing special) with a carafe of wine between us and the bill came to €80+. I felt this was pricey considering we were leaving still hungry. 

We slept well that night in the bed and the room seemed sound proof enough from the hallway considering we were close to the lifts.

The next morning at breakfast we were brought to our table by a very lovely male staff member who was very energetic. Breakfast gave a lot of option and we thoroughly enjoyed it. It made up for our hunger the night before.

There is plenty to do on the estate as they have outdoor table tennis in the courtyard or you can ride bikes around the grounds (bikes are first come first served basis). If you wish you can book into the driving range, horse riding, falconry, archery etc. Unfortunately given our short stay we didn't get to avail of any of the booked activities but we'd love to go back and try them. 

Upon check out there was a slight error with out bill but it was quickly sorted for us without any hesitation. Again, the front of house staff were excellent and helpful. 

Overall, the hotel and grounds are beautiful but I might look elsewhere to eat that night as that was our only complaint for the overall experience.",4,2019,08,22
239,"Beautiful location, terrible service","I was babysitting for a family wedding at this beautiful estate. Upon arrival, there was zero signage for the wedding so went to where I assumed it was on... I asked where I could get something to eat that wouldn’t interfere with the wedding, the staff were no help. The first was a young lad who appeared to have been his first day as didn’t seem to know there was a wedding on. The second seems more experienced and told me, there was no corner for me to hide out in and walked away. Very rude. 
So I continued to try find somewhere for a bite to eat. I went to the golf club where I was told it was members only, again the staff were no help to indicate I should go to the hunters lodge. Although they were friendlier than my first encounter. I proceeded on to the hunters lodge where I discovered that I could order a drink at the bar but would have to go to the restaurant area to eat (it was in the next room). That was all good, I was happy that I’d be getting a lovely lunch. The bar was quiet, three other patrons were there, yet took the bar staff 15 minutes to serve me and I had to ask for a clean glass for my drink as there was lipstick all over the one provided. 5 stars, yeah right. I proceeded to the restaurant area where I ordered the smoked chicken and walnut salad, as a main. I would have hated to see the starter size, as this was minuscule. The salad was very tasty to be fair but the side of “hand cut” fries appeared to have come straight from a freezer and dipped briefly in simmering oil. Not good. 
The room I stayed in was beautiful and well equipped with bottles of water in the fridge along with a proper coffee machine.The soaps in the bathroom were a lovely touch and not cheap. I went for a walk around the estate which was absolutely beautiful, lots of space and well kept gardens. I was left babysitting for the evening so stayed in the room pretty much for the rest of the day and ordered room service which was prompt and better than my earlier salad dish. The burger was very nice and was served this time with proper hand-cut chips. 
The following morning for breakfast,  we (myself and my sisters family who I had been babysitting for) were met by a rude staff member. We had to explain 3 times the room numbers we were staying in to him, in order to get to breakfast. Breakfast to be honest was great, a lovely selection of cereals, drinks, hot food and fruit. All prepared nicely and displayed beautifully. 
I really wouldn’t be in a hurry back to this place 
down to the interaction with staff who are either overworked and underpaid or don’t wish to engage with working class people. They definitely need to be trained on how to engage with their patrons.",2,2019,08,21
239,A perfect end to our honeymoon,"We received a two night stay here as a very generous wedding present and decided to use it as part of our honeymoon. 
This is a very special hotel. Often hotels of this calibre have a 'stuffy air to them. Not Mount Juilet. It is such a beautiful hotel without being pretentious. We could not fault a single thing- everything from our spa treatments,  afternoon tea and food in the bar were outstanding. The service across the board is truly nothing short of five star.
I have to give a very a special mention to Caitriona who booked us into an amazing suite in the manor house. All I can say is wow. The room was stunning. Thank you Caitriona , room 31 was beautiful. 
We both agreed that we had the best breakfast we ever had in any hotel in the Lady Helen. The porridge made on cream with Bailey's on the side was a real treat.The selection of fresh fruit was commendable as was the smoked salmon. We spent a whole afternoon cycling around the estate afterwards on the hotel bikes. It was such a good idea ! They have put a great deal of thought into the grounds with walled gardens and even a fairy village for kids.
There is so much to do on site in Mount Juilet. You can literally park up and leave your car where it is for a few days once you have checked in. There is so much to do between the spa, afternoon tea, cycling, falconry and of course the fishing and horse riding. 
If you are debating whether or not to stay here , just go!!you won't regret it. We can't wait to return!!",5,2019,08,18
239,Beautiful,"Stayed here with my family in August. It's a beautiful estate. The grounds are stunning. The staff were amazing, so friendly and went out of their way to accommodate us. Room was really lovely, lots of space and it was absolutely spotless. We stayed in the Hunters Lodge. The food is fab. Highly recommend it :-) Equestrian centre great, loved it! We did the falconry and the fishing, really enjoyed it. Lovely golf course, pool, spa and playground too. Bikes available for cycling around the estate. It is expensive but you get what you pay for! Class place, we will definitely be back!",5,2019,08,15
239,Great stay in Hunters Yard,"We stayed here for 3 night in July and really enjoyed it. The rooms were lovely, big bathroom, nicely decorated with all facilities. The food was excellent as well, we ate at the gold club, the hound, and had afternoon tea at the manor house all were very good. Breakfast could do with some work as it was a buffet which was nice but it would be good to have an alternative option as well. There seem to be a menu going around but we were never offered it and when asked it was provided but we only stumbled on it which was very odd. There is loads to do on the grounds with lots of lovely walks and very near Kilkenny.",5,2019,08,14
239,"Wonderful, loved it","We stayed for two nights and did not want to leave. The setting is just beautiful and the rooms were very comfortable and clean. I wandered around while my husband played golf and found the beautiful secret garden and surrounds to be perfect, just like an enchanted woodlands setting. Dined at the Hunters Yard restaurant which was great and also one night at the golf club which was also good. The staff were very and friendly and at the golf club were apparently very helpful as well. I would love to go back.",5,2019,08,08
239,Beautiful Property but Impersonal Service,"We stayed here on our last night during a one-week trip to Ireland, and we had been looking forward to it very much. The property is indeed as beautiful as the photos on their website, but among the 6-7 Irish Blue Book hotels we've ever stayed at, it was the most impersonal and least favorite experience. The biggest problem is the service which was adequate. What was concerning was that we didn't have a big problem (aside from the restaurant), but that it was uniformly perfunctory and mediocre. 

Two examples: 
- A spa reservation inquiry in advance of our stay never received a response. 
- We had to ask about a package that was sent to us 5 times over the course of many many hourse before we got it. was apparently locked at the security office, which was far because the property is sprawling, and nobody could be bothered to retrieve until we were checking out. 

In the restaurant, it was downright horrible and unworthy of the Michelin star. My mother in law had been very much looking forward to eating in the Lady Helen restaurant, so I booked an inclusive plan for the full course. To be fair, the dishes were good, but we knew we were in trouble, when the server poured the first glass from the wine tasting accompaniment and couldn't tell us anymore than where it came from and the fact that it was sparkling. They later made sure that the sommelier poured us the future glasses, but the wine and the food were often so out of sync (15+ min apart) that we finished the wine before the food arrived. We sometimes waited 20 min+ between courses. What should have been a 2.5 hour meal at the most, took nearly 3.5 hours and we were still not done. When the clock neared midnight, we finally gave up and left before we could be offered coffee and petit-fours. We love lengthy luxurious dinners, but we left before finishing a meal for the first time in our lives. 

If you want to try Lady Helen for dinner, I would strongly suggest going a la carte and limiting to 3 courses. 

Given how much they've expanded their property, we wondered if there was a problem of scale or perhaps they're resting on their laurels. If you're trying to decide between here and another Blue Book inn, I would try another one unless you're golfers in which case the golf course here might be attractive to you. We won't be staying here again.",3,2019,08,07
239,Incredible wedding and stay,"I stayed last Friday night and I loved it.
The staff are very friendly and the food is to die for
I was there for my nephews wedding which was magical
I was very impressed with the rooms around the stable yard!
The staff on duty for our wedding were brilliant 
Thank you for making it great for me and my mother",5,2019,08,06
239,Bad customer service,"My fiancé and I went away for the long weekend to finally celebrate our engagement after a few very busy months at work. Before arriving I rang and asked for a bottle of champagne to be in the room for when we arrived. The lady at the other end of the phone was very unpleasant and she also wasn’t very helpful. Once we arrived we felt nothing but out of place. We were greeted by a rude male receptionist and then had food delivered to our room that evening by an equally rude server. They made as feel as if we weren’t good enough to be staying there. The manager of the Lady Helen was very attentive to all other guests except for ourselves. She barely looked our direction for the two mornings that we were in the restaurant, yet knew every other guest by name and made sure at all stages that they were okay with everything. We are both very hard working people, and while yes we may have been a lot younger than the typical clientele, we were still still paying the same if not more than everyone else and we deserved to be treated as good as the older guests. What saved the trip was Clara, and Helen, the two receptionists at check out, who went out of their way to organize a last minute viewing with the amazing Des for our wedding. Not only that but they also checked in on us afterwards and made sure we were happy with everything. Des was nothing only an absolute gem. He answered the million questions that I had and brought us on a very thorough tour of the estate, showing us all of the potential places for a ceremony. Only for these three staff members I honestly don’t think we would be planning our wedding here. The hotels are beyond incredible and the scenery and estate are breathtaking but bad service ruins the Mount Juliet experience. Moral of the story for the staff at Mount Juliet is to never judge a book by its cover; the number one rule in customer service.",3,2019,08,06
239,Absolutely Incredible!,"The Mount Juliet Estate was recommended to us by friends who had recently stayed there.  Words cannot express how amazing and luxurious this place is.  The grounds are beautiful, the rooms are very large and well designed, the food is delicious and every detail has been perfectly planned for by the staff.  In addition to breakfast and tea at the Lady Helen, we had dinner at The Hound and it was really wonderful, with great views, attentive service and scrumptious food.  Server went out of her way to make sure we were pleased with the vegetarian offerings.  While it is more expensive than some Irish accommodations, it is worth EVERY penny.  Save on something else if you need to, but The Mount Juliet is definitely something to splurge on.  Also, allow some extra time to spend at the property, as there are so many things to do without leaving the Estate.  We indulged in high tea and spent time in the equestrian center, both of which were fantastic.  Everyone goes out of their way to make your stay perfect and to make sure you are happy and comfortable.",5,2019,08,05
239,I really wanted to give it 5 ,"I stayed with my wife and young child, we heard great stories from friends who had a wonderful time at Mount Juliet so decided to make a weekend of it. We stayed in the Hounds Yard for 2 nights

The Plus Points
- Beautiful Room, newly decorated and easily accessible with child.
- Comfortable Bed, shower and bath
- Spa Facilitates were really good
- The whole venue is beautiful with stunning scenery 
- Breakfast was really good, quality produce.

The Low Points
- We had dinner in the Hound restaurant the first night which we really enjoyed but disappointed to see the same (limited) menu for lunch on the Sunday and the same menu in the evening on Sunday night. The menu could really do with some creativity, of the 5 sides 3 were potato. No green or salad offerings, Allergens menu just shows you what is contained in the meals but no alternative or vegan offering. I asked our waiter if the chef made a daily special to mix it up but was told no it’s strictly the menu. Sometimes it’s nice to have something simple like a sandwich or pizza instead of heavy evening food for lunch. The room service menu actually had more variety and we ended up ordering in rooms.
- No Coffee Dock, getting a take away coffee turned into a mighty task and wait. As there is lots of walking around the estate, it would be great to go to a simple coffee dock or area to get a coffee and snack instead of going through the restaurant and waiting.
- Cold pool, the indoor pool was well laid out but it was cold and our youngest wanted o leave after a few mins in the pool. We tried to get him to acclimatise but had to leave. 

Overall the service was ok, we felt the bank holiday weekend was busy and a strain on staff but as a 5 star venue and for the cost, it should be a lot better.",4,2019,08,05
239,Wonderful,It had been many years since I visited MJ Estate. It had changed hands many times over the years and our previous experiences were disappointing. I returned for a three night stay with my family and it exceeded my expectations. We stayed at the Manor House. We wanted a quiet relaxing time and it did not disappoint. The staff were lovely. Excellent food in the Lady Helen restaurant and breakfast was superb every morning. We did not use the many wonderful facilities the hotel has to offer  as we were there solely to rest. The Hunters Yard  was busy with lots of kids so I suggest the Manor House if you want tranquility. I will be back again now that it is back to what it should be. A wonderful top quality country house hotel with great food and great staff. Thank you all.,5,2019,08,05
239,Magnificent,"The property is the second largest working farm in Ireland and is kept up with love and care. The staff are friendly and delightful, and the rooms in the old building are generous and beautiful. 
Be aware that none of the activities such as archery are free: it is 30 euros a person. 
Finally, do not prepay for meals, not worth it.",5,2019,08,04
239,"Great rooms, food and estate","Stayed here for 3 nights in July 2019 in Hunters Yard. Rooms were great, plenty of space. Food was excellent, service was good. We stayed with our 18 month old and it was very kid friendly. The swimming pool was very good with an excellent kids pool. There is plenty to do on the estate with 4 different walks and a playground. It is also close to kilkenny with lots to do there and in the area",5,2019,08,03
239,Lovely Stay,"We enjoyed every minute of our short, two night stay at Mount Juliet.  Our room was lovely and quiet.  The breakfast was wonderful.  We enjoyed hiking on the grounds and my husband was very happy with the golf course.  The view was so pretty from our room.  We would definitely love to come back!",5,2019,08,03
239,Exceptional! Despite our golf booking not being booked!,"A recent family wedding took us back to Mount Juliet. This time we actually got to stay in the manor house! 
With the likes of Beyonce having stayed here, expectations were high! 
From the moment we arrived the service was great. so 5 stars for the friendly service.
The rooms were huge and very stately, which is kind of what we expected. Huge, comfortable beds = great sleep! Again, 5 stars!
The food, as part of the receptions, was great! The fillet of beef was cooked to perfection some, being a steak guy, loved it! S food was again 5 stars.
The main suite, for the bride and groom and their parents was phenomenal! separate dining area and 180 views down over the river and estate. If you can afford this, this is the room to stay in. 1 of the dining chairs, when I lent back, just broke and I almost fell on the floor. It was clear that whomever tried to fix this chair, just glued it instead of replacing it. Would not take a star off for this.
Here's my quibble.. Mount Juliet being a former Irish Open course, is obviously a huge attraction for a golfer, such as myself! The groom arranged a tee time for a 3 ball a few weeks before. On arrival, my father in law went to book a golf cart at the pro shop, only to be told that we had no booking and that the only way we could play was to be put with other random 2 or 3 balls. The hotel did not phone through the booking to the pro shop. When mentioned to the hotel on departure, all that was said was ""we apologize."" In my opinion, that's not good enough and should be up to the hotel to provide a round of golf, at another point for the disappointed golfers, some of whom, that have carried golf clubs from the USA and paid for oversize baggage, Minus 1 star for the poor show, I'm afraid, Mount Juliet.
Just a small glitch in what was otherwise a great venue!",4,2019,08,01
239,Great getaway,"We checked in on Friday night and left Sunday morning, thoroughly relaxing time. Service was top class, friendly and efficient. Rooms were stunning and very sound proof so you didn't hear the kids running around. Food in The Hound Restaurant was superb (steak was one of the best I've had). I left relaxed and looking forward to going back. The golf course looked stunning, although I didn't play.",5,2019,07,30
239,Stunning Equestrian facilities & staff,"Our recent stay at the Manor House in sunny Southern Ireland was superb, with the top honors going to their well-run equestrian stable, staff and selection of appropriate horses to fit your level of experience.  James, an amazingly cheerful & expert  horseman, organized my daily rides, helped select a delightful horse for me, (an experienced rider), and then led us on a fantastic tour of this gorgeous 500+ acre property.  We rode along the River Nore, scenery is breathtaking.  Lauren is available for wonderful leisurely rides, also, even escorting your young ones on adorable Shetland ponies.  This stable has everything and does it very well, catering to all your whims while enjoying the luxurious manor life at Mt.Juliet.  
We give them top ratings - a 10!",5,2019,07,26
239,Hunters Yard,"Headed down to Hunters Yard with my wife & 7mth old son for a 2 night stay and we had a great time. It was our first time visiting Mount Juliet and was impressed with the estate ( not a golfer, but the course looked nice ).
Our room was modern, lovely decor with a big comfy bed. The bathroom had a nice big shower and heated tiles :-)
Both nights we had food in the Hound restaurant, while the menu is not extensive its more quality than quantity. The steaks were delicious followed by some yummy deserts.
Breakfast is a self service breakfast also served in the Hound, again really good quality. Throughout the stay we found the staff very friendly and very helpful. You also get nice touches like the baby kitchen, the playground and a nice pool. Didnt use the spa, maybe next time :-)",5,2019,07,25
239,Lovely place in the countryside,"Lovely castle, 31 rooms, in the countryside of Kilkenny. The setting is absolutely stunning and there is a lot you can do on the estate; falconary, horse back riding, golf, cycling, etc. Very relaxing!",5,2019,07,24
239,Beautiful in every way,"Myself and my wife went there for our anniversary. The staff were amazing, professional and great Craic. We stayed in the beautiful Manor House and had a wonderful meal in the hound restaurant. Des is a gentleman and his grandson Conor who works in the bar is as polite as you get. We'll be back again to watch for the Clara jug. 😉",5,2019,07,23
239,Peaceful Surroundings ,"A high standard has been set for this Estate. Set in tranquil gardens and golf course.
What a beautiful place to hold a wedding.
There are a couple of different accommodations to choose from luxurious and laid back.

",5,2019,07,16
239,Almost perfect!,"Mount Juliet is set in a fabulous location, the grounds are stunning. We stayed in Hunter's Yard, which was a beautiful setting and was very tastefully decorated. Minor comment though: there were 3 of us and I'm not sure the room is designed for 3 people, despite the fact we were told that it was upon booking. It would have been better to have a kingsize and single bed, instead of 2 queen beds. Also there were only 2 bathrobes and one bottle each of shampoo etc - we had brought our own so it was fine, however it would have been nice if the hotel had prepared the room for 3 guests rather than 1-2. It was also very difficult to get through to reception - not sure if the line was working as we were trying for ages from our mobiles and the hotel room, and eventually had to go down in person with our request. The pool area is lovely but could do with some updating. I would LOVE if there were jacuzzi jets in the little cave area, and the ladies changing room was freezing, despite it being 20 degrees outside. The terrace at the Hound Bar was lovely for a few afternoon drinks, and we had lots of fun in the saddle bar later that evening. Overall a great stay in a beautiful place, just some minor points that would have led to a 5-star rating",4,2019,07,15
239,My favorite in Ireland! ,Recently stayed here for 2 nights with a group of 18 and it was fabulous!  We stayed in Hunters Yard.  The atmosphere is like a country estate with class and beauty.  We loved the falconry and the golf plus walks around the beautiful grounds and fly fishing!  We created some great memories that will last for a long time. ,5,2019,07,10
239,Family Wedding,"We have just returned from a 2 night stay in the beautiful Mount Juliet Estate. My husband and I were there for a family wedding. I couldn't praise the staff and management enough for the way the whole Estate is run. The location is fantastic as the scenery is gorgeous. The rooms are big and spacious, the beds are so comfortable you won't want to get up, but when you do the breakfast was to die for. We took some time out and walked around the Estate, plenty to see. It was the perfect setting for the wedding and everyone had a great time. We are looking forward to returning in the not so distant future. Thanks to all for making it a great weekend.",5,2019,07,08
239,Such a lovely location - unfortunately food disappointing!,"We are locals who like to visit Mount Juliet regularly for walks, coffee, lunch etc. The location and grounds are stunning & very relaxing. Unfortunately we visited on Saturday for dinner at 5:30 at the Hound. It was evening menu at that time. It is quite expensive & not much choice but we were expecting great things & to be worth the price. We were very disappointed. One person had the beef - The fondant potato was mushy & tasted like an old bad potato. Another had the pork which was dry & not very tasty. No potato with the pork just a cabbage leaf so we needed to order an accompaniment. All dishes very bland. So disappointing especially considering the bill. Think the food needs to be improved dramatically to keep up with the good name & surrounds of Mount Juliet.",2,2019,07,01
239,wish we could have stayed longer,from the moment we arrived we were so well taken care of. The staff are so lovely. We were upgraded to room 7 a beautiful room overlooking the garden and vert quiet. We played golf and had the tasting menu in the restaurant. The tastes were amazing Breakfast was a joy with fresh fruit and juices and food cooked to order. We had only one day there but it was a great break.,5,2019,06,24
239,One night getaway at Hunters Yard,"We stayed at the Hunters Yard for 1 night as a last minute get away. We were indecisive on whether to stay at the main house, or Hunters Yard. We chose Hunters Yard thinking it would have more of a relaxed, casual feel - which it did.

Positives-
Beautiful grounds and views around the estate.
Fairly quiet, although there was a wedding and golfing event it was fairly well contained.
We received a room upgrade and it was immaculately clean with beautiful design- you can tell it’s a recent refurb but very well done.
Breakfast was nice for a buffet option.
Complimentary bikes to cycle around the estate are a lovely touch and we really enjoyed using them.

Negatives-
The organization and professionalism of staff is not 5* at all. 
We visited the hound restaurant and the main house bar, both of which seemed overwhelmed and completely in over their heads. Service was very slow and intermittent and the staff generally didn’t have enough knowledge to complete tasks fairly straight forward.
It made the atmosphere feel stressy and uncomfortable, especially in the hound restaurant. We made an advance reservation for 8:30pm and were seated at 9pm after being ignored at the waiting stand for 15 minutes- not service of a 5* resort.
We were given only a buffet option for breakfast and saw some guests had menu for other breakfast dishes- strange not to have been told.
It almost felt like a brand new hotel and restaurant that was still finding its feet and needed to tighten things up a little.

Has every potential to be 5* and more simply because of the surroundings and luxury rooms, just the staff, organization and attention could do with something extra!

All of this said, I would visit again and maybe try the other house. The location is very relaxing and it has such great potential to be amazing.

Thank you to the reservations staff who gave us a complimentary upgrade to a gorgeous room. ",3,2019,06,23
239,Escape to the country estate!,"We had a 2 night stay and really enjoyed it! We had dinner both nights in the Hound restaurant, and stayed in the Hunters Yard. As we were lucky with the weather, we enjoyed some nice walks around the estate, as well as the swimming pool and spa.   We also went to the Major's bar for after dinner cocktails one evening, and enjoyed the ambiance of the Manor House. We would recommend for sure!",5,2019,06,19
239,Stay at the Hunters Yard,"We stayed at the Hunters Yard and it was a disappointing experience. I've stayed at Mount Juliet house before and it was really good but given the recent refurbishment and its proximity to the pool we thought we'd try a change. Room was okay although not very private, there are glass double doors and people kept passing looking into the room. No bath just a shower. Cleanliness of the room was ? although it did appear as if someone had been in a rush to change our room. The sheet was only half drawn up and we found false nails in the throw on our bed so it may just have been busy and the cleaning staff were in a rush. The problem I had was that when we told the receptionist at checkout she didn't really respond and honestly seemed like she could not care less. The breakfast was poor and very disorganized. The manager looked like he was overwhelmed and the food was just okay. We had lunch the previous day at the bar also and it was just ok. On our final day we had some food at the house and that was much better. The weekend we were there was busy so it could just could have been the staff were overwhelmed.",3,2019,06,19
239,Afternoon Tea,The tea was delicious from the sandwich selection to the pastries. Loved the table that was allocated by the window lovely and intimate with beautiful views. Would recommend highly thank you the service was great also. ,4,2019,06,15
239,Great stay apart from one thing! ,"Returned to Mount Juliet having stayed in both the Main House & Hunter's Yard previously. Was really impressed with the room we were given this time...room no. 3. It was a ground floor suite, absolutely huge with French doors to a quaint garden & seating area. The last time we stayed our room was tiny, top floor & felt like we were staying in an attic!!! Unfortunately the only thing preventing a 5 star review was the presence of bluebottles/flies in the room, this was the case with our previous stay also. We had to swat numerous flies at the window area which was quite annoying & the room became very stuffy as opening the window let even more flies in!!! On a positive note, the breakfast was delicious and the outdoor walks and facilities are great. ",4,2019,06,15
239,Des's Estate Tour,"This is an absolutely beautiful estate.  We have traveled extensively and would consider Mount Juliet to be one of our favorites.  Our room was gorgeous, service was great, and dining in both the formal and casual rooms was excellent.
However, the real GEM is Des, the Customer Service Manager.  His tour of the estate was not only fascinating but he exudes Irish Charm. The tour was complimentary but we would have gladly paid for it!
Another highlight of our stay was falconry with John. It was a fantastic experience.",5,2019,06,14
239,The most tranquil location you could imagine...,"Our room overlooked the River Nore and the Ballylinch Stud - foals and mares in the fiels, along with cows and calves.  Such a peaceful view, and one that I could have drunk in for days!  The morning mist over the river gave way to sunshine streaming into our windows on a glorious June morning,

Charming staff, from the young lady in reception to the lovely waitresses at Hunters Yard.  All were warm, friendly and helpful. 

We walked along the River Nore to the lakes, with the only sounds being those of the river and the birds.  Complete peace.  Having borrowed a couple of bikes, we also cycled around the estate, taking in more of the wooded areas, and the fabulous golf course.

Hours could we whiled away in the Walled Garden, which is a complete delight.

All this is less than a two hour (direct) drive from Dublin, which itself is a 45 minute flight from Birmingham.

Remember - Ireland is green for a reason!  Pack some weatherproof gear if you want to get out and about!",5,2019,06,10
239,Great accommodations terrible service ,"The hotel and grounds are lovely but the service is remarkably bad for any decent hotel. We weren't offered assistance with our bags on arrival which seemed odd, but not an issue for us. At the Saddle Bar I ordered a drink on two different nights and each time I was given a drink other than the one I ordered. This wasn't a mistake by the wait staff we literally sat at the bar and ordered directly from the bartender.  One of the drinks he made required him to look it up and even then he made the entirely the wrong drink. This wasn't a big deal,  people make mistakes,  it was our other interactions with the staff that made it clear that this is an institution wide failing. We had housekeeping pickup up our clothes from our room after calling reception to see if the clothes would be ready by the time we departed two days later. Reception said they would check and call us back to confirm that they would be. They never called us back so we assumed it would be fine as the other five star hotels we have had laundry done at return the clothes in the same day. Next day rolls around and still no clothes. Talked to reception and was told our clothes would be brought to us after dinner. After dinner we talked to reception again, they said that accommodation had confirmed the clothes were clean and would be brought right up to us. A few hours later called reception and was told someone would call us right back. Another couple of hours later we walked back to reception they said they would bring us our clothes.  An hour later someone came to our room to tell us our clothes would be ready by the time we left in the morning. The next day we are ready to leave and go up to reception to ask for our clothes. The receptionist asked us who we gave our laundry to, after explaining that we had followed the directions included in the hotel's room guide she walks into the backroom comes back two seconds later with our bag of dirty clothes. It had been ten feet away from all five people we had asked to account for it over a period of three days.
Never have I had such poor service in a hotel. Any budget friendly hotel chain we have stayed in has staff trained to be accountable for the services they provide why this is not the case here is shocking.  Luckily our next stop was an Airbnb whose owner offered to do our laundry when we asked if we could use his washer. He was kind enough to bring our clean clothes to our room as well. Clothes were clean in a matter of hours. ",2,2019,05,29
239,Don't miss this beautiful experience!,"Our (American) family travelled to Ireland for the first time, having spent many vacations in the UK.The countryside and its pursuits are what we enjoy, so we decided (with our 25 year old son) to stay at Mt. Juliet for 3 nights. 

It was tranquil, beautiful and the staff could not have been more accommodating. We fished, rode horses, hawk walked, golfed and played a game of snooker. All of these activities exceeded expectation. We especially enjoyed being brought into a game of snooker as complete beginners. Everyone was welcoming and we will be back. I have reported to all at home, especially our golfing friends that Mt. Juliet should not be missed!

Sean (A pro) golfed with our son and allowed us to come along to enjoy the outdoors. Our son took advice that changed his game right then and there! Beautiful course!

We were given adjoining rooms in the Manor house that overlooked a walled garden. It was wonderful to hear the birds chirp though our opened windows. It reminded me of days gone by when I travelled abroad with my parents.

Many thanks to the staff from a grateful North Carolina family.",5,2019,05,29
239,One night bliss,"Booked a one night stay at the Manor at Mount Juliet in the King room. Excellent experience from start to finish. Genuine Irish hospitality. Felt like a home from home but with the 5 star experience. Room was beautiful. So much to do from horse riding to golf , spa treatments , walking around the estate. Beautiful swimming pool. Wish we had more time to stay and enjoy the activities. An incredible setting - so peaceful. There is a wonderful tranquility about the place and the staff are all charming and so helpful.  We met some lovely guests all ages and nationalities. Next time will have to book a round of golf.",5,2019,05,28
239,"Fantastic Staff, Relaxed Environment","Everything about our stay was perfect, the staff were attentive, welcoming and friendly always ready to help, the rooms were immaculate and the amenities were fantastic.
Pool was slightly outdated but was clean and all services were working. The spa was excellent, I had the express facial and it was magical.

I want to give special thanks to all of the dinner staff in the Hound Restaurant that worked on Tuesday the 21st of May. I was there with a group of friends and they were happy to cater for our needs. I only got to catch the names of the manager that evening Anne Marie, and another colleague Amber, but great service from everyone on the floor, we appreciated it very much.",5,2019,05,27
239,Nice,"Stayed here recently for two nights.  The rooms were well equipped - robes and slippers, Nespresso machine etc.  The pool is small and not what you would expect from such a luxurious establishment.  The restaurant is nice with a limited menu.  Breakfast is nice but self service.  The bar is ample and the staff are friendly.   Please note this hotel is approximately 20km from Kilkenny down country roads.",4,2019,05,24
239,The Hound Restaurant,"My Nephew made his confirmation Sat 18th May. Our family qent for lunch to the Hound Restaurant. There were 9 in our party.I have to say it was the most disappointing meal we have ever had. It was a disaster from start to finish. There was no lunch menu just bar food. When my sister booked a table she was told they had a lunch menu, a lie off course.
The desserts were over priced for, there was only a chooce of two. The strawberries and Cream consisted of one strewberry disected into small pieces.
They forgot to serve one a coffee my sister had to go and get it herself.
They staff where not trained proberly and the foods manager told lies.
The windows were filthy.
We would not recommend the Hound or Mount Juliet to anyone as they need to get their act together.
A total disastrous place to have any family occasion. We will not be back either.",1,2019,05,23
239,Amazing destination.  The restaurant Hound at Hunters Club-not so much,"The Manor hotel at the Mt. Juliet is amazing.  Wonderful facility and within the Manor itself things are top notch.  Their other restaurant, the Hound leaves much to be desired.
We sat down.  Took about 10 minutes to see a waiter.  Ordered two bottle of wine.  40 minutes later, still waiting, no service staff attending to us.
Just giving the good and the bad news.",4,2019,05,18
239,Best Hotel Break Ever,"Having recently spent three days at Mount Juliet, I'm already wanting to return. This has to be the best Irish hotel break I have ever had. From the friendliness and professionalism of staff, to the cleanliness, decor and peacefulness of the hotel, this was five star service all the way. Took an equestrian trial which was one of the highlights of the stay. Both the Hunters Yard and Manor House were equally as nice with a beautiful atmosphere. We will be back!",5,2019,05,16
239,🇮🇪 Mount Juliet gets better with age 🇮🇪 ,"I love everything about Mount Juliet. I can’t think of one thing that even mildly disappoints when staying here. We first stayed here in 2000 and each visit has always been fantastic. 

On this trip, we booked a two night Executive Room package with Afternoon Tea and a seven course tasting menu in The Lady Helen restaurant. 

After a warm greeting from Des and the staff, we checked Into a spacious room on the second floor of the manor house. It was clean and comfortable, just perfect... The tv was great to watch the races at Punchestown before dinner each night. 

Dining at Mount Juliet was off the charts. The Afternoon Tea in The Major’s Bar was fantastic. Great mix of sweet and savory items including delicious finger sandwiches and pastries. Perfect tea...

Breakfast in The Lady Helen each morning was delicious. Loved the eggs with rashers and boxty cakes. Hats off to Anne Marie and staff for being so friendly and professional early in the morning.

Dinner in The Lady Helen is one of the best meals you can have in Ireland. It’s Michelin star is well deserved. I can’t think of a hotel dining room in Ireland that matches this level of dining. We enjoyed the seven course tasting menu and it was easily the best meal I’ve had in years. Simply perfect with each course better than the last. I would think a second star is coming soon...

Many thanks to Des who does his job so well as Guest Relations manager.  He simply loves everything about Mount Juliet. So informative and such a gentleman... Also many thanks to Anne Marie who was such a joy to be with. 

We can’t wait for our next visit to Mount Juliet Estate! 🇮🇪 ",5,2019,05,09
239,Surpassed Expectations - which were already high,"Honestly, every element of our stay surpassed our expectations. From the idyllic setting in the most fabulous parkland setting, through to the genuine welcome from the reception staff - all were outstanding. 

The rooms in Hunters Yard are exceptional, comfortable and very large. 

The food in the Saddle Restaurant for both breakfast and for dinner one evening is outstanding. 

Golf course is wonderful - challenging and a bit long for higher handicap golfers but wonderful all the same. 

Will definitely be returning and will recommend highly.",5,2019,05,07
239,A wonderful oasis of peace & calm,"My wife and I choose to stay in Hunters Yard for a few days during the Easter holidays to unwind and enjoy some quiet time. Mount Juliet surpassed our expectations so much that we tried to stay an extra night but unfortunately they were full. 

Check in was prompt and special mention goes to the male receptionist (only his third day, possibly named Andrew). He was very welcoming and was of great assistance throughout our stay. 

The room was very clean and spacious. There is a wide selection to suit all tastes when it comes to breakfast. The food throughout our stay was excellent. 

I would highly recommend Mount Juliet if you are looking to unwind and relax. It has become one of our favorite places to stay. ",5,2019,05,04
239,Stunning wedding and holiday resort,"Started our visit to our friends wedding with a meal in the clubhouse and was not disappointed , lovely food, good quality and fantastic service.  Our room was a family room with two double beds, the pictures on the website do not do it justice, it was beautiful and looked out onto a quite courtyard, On the Saturday I had to put the wedding cake up in the reception room and the help I received from Eve the chef was exceptional, nothing was too much trouble.  The wedding reception food was amazing, sirloin steak for 100 people and I didn’t hear a complaint.  The breakfast was lovely there was nothing you couldn’t want for . All in all our stay was far too short and can’t wait to go back.",5,2019,05,03
239,Super Hotel for Family Easter Break,"Stay in the Mount Juliet over the Easter Week,this is my 2nd time visiting,we have stay in the Manor house the last time but this time in the Hunters Yard,what can i say about this new addition to the Estate,one of the best 5 Star hotels i have stay in over the last few year,very accommodating for all our needs with kids club to keep the kids busy,the food at dinner & breakfast is top notch well worth the 2 rosettes it has,rooms are beautifully lay out & decorated & loads of room for the kids.one the best things about Mount Juliet is the friendly less of all the staff which you dont see as much anymore in hotels but Mount Juliet has it all & a special Thanks to The GM Mark Dunne who made your stay memorable,Mount Juliet is a better place now they have you at the helm.",5,2019,05,02
239,Easter Family visit,"We stayed here last week for a family break of 10 adults and 12 children
The place was bathed in sunshine and the kids had a ball with the driving range and outside table tennis and walking to the stud farm
Overall the hotel is really good and the rooms are so comfortable but he beds are to die for!!!!
we had a lovely room overlooking a green area with doors opening out to it
The bathroom had underfloor heating which was fab and a separate large shower and bath.
The first night we ate in the hotel and the food was great despite the staff being under pressure as we found out afterwards two of the staff had rang in sick
despite this we enjoyed our meal
The following night the staff were excellent in the golf club and made a fuss over our birthday boy who is coeliac and they brought him out a birthday plate which was a nice touch.......
4 of us played golf and the course was really good
The grounds are really super to walk around
Overall a fab trip and would love to return!!!",5,2019,04,26
239,So disappointed,"Stayed here over the Easter break.  Arrived early to make the most of our stay.  Decided we'd have lunch in the clubhouse whilst waiting on our room to be ready,  we were informed it should be ready by about 3pm to accommodate our early arrival.  Lunch could only be described as chaotic,  with young staff severely under trained and not used to 5 star service.  We ended up having to go up to the bar to order as nobody came near us in twenty mins.  Food was fine,  nothing special.  When paying,  the till was out of order so I was curtly told ""I can see what you owe but cannot verify what you had,  you'll just have to pay what the till says"". Needless to say I was stunned,  but duly paid and moved on. We walked the grounds which are always beautiful and my child availed of the kids club which was great, however nobody actually assisted with this,  we organised it ourselves.  Again far from 5 star service. We went back to see if our room was ready but to no avail so luckily as the weather was fine we went on another walk to the manor house which was lovely.  At 4 pm we came back to again check on the room to be told there was a problem and they'd give us am upgrade to the manor house.  Twenty mins of waiting in the foyer on this upgrade to be then told the original room was now ready.  This stay was so chaotic the last thing we felt was relaxed or at ease.  I appreciate how busy it was over Easter but this was a mess. We finally got our room at half four. The room was lovely and spacious but nothing out of the ordinary. Only two robes provided despite being more than two guests in the room.  Again the little 5 star touches overlooked We went for a meal in the hound, again not up to standard. Risotto was way overcooked and steak that was bland. No alternative to blue cheese on a cheese board. Everything has just dropped a level since our last visit and we really felt disappointed at this stage.  Drinks in the saddle bar were cut short as the doors were wide open held firm with a stool and it was absolutely freezing,  everyone in there had similar sentiments to our own and couldn't understand why the bar man wouldn't do anything about it.  It became too uncomfortable for us so we left and returned to our room.  The room was also cold and the Air con wouldn't work to heat it,  so we just went to bed.  Had a shower the following morning and the shower flooded all over the floor so took 4 towels to dry it.  No fan in the bathroom either so mirrors impossible to use for at least 15 mins after the shower.  Breakfast was good,  plentiful and staff friendly. Overall this visit really spoiled our previous high opinions of Mount Juliet and sadly I'd be reluctant to recommend to anyone or to return again.  ",3,2019,04,24
239,Easter Break,Super hotel with all extras very accommodating to all. A fine room well decorated which they upgraded for us Beautiful estate with mature trees and a manicured golf course. Superb food with great service and bar service,5,2019,04,23
239,"Manor House - Beautiful location, fantastic atmosphere, excellent service","We stayed in the Manor House for a short two day break. We had a fabulous time. The decor was period perfect, warm and welcoming with an open fire in the reception area. We had dinner in the Lady Helen and the taster option was some of the nicest food you will experience. Take this option if you are fortunate enough to get a booking. Throughout our stay, the staff were extremely friendly, very efficient and most welcoming. the Guest relations manager (Paidi?) went out of his way to make us feel at home, say hello to him, he will give you the inside track on all to see and do.",5,2019,04,22
239,"Hunters Yard - Beautiful, but rained out","Our travel agent put us into this property, as a stop on our drive from Dublin to Dingle. It is a gorgeous property, surrounded by the stellar golf course.

We were there in the rain, though, and it wasn't a great way to experience the property. It was our only poor weather day of our 10 days in Ireland, and this wasn't the place to experience that. 

The room is large, clean, beautiful. We were on the ground floor, so had a walk out patio area that we weren't able to use because of the weather. It looked nice. We were not able to enjoy the natural light of our room, as there were only blackout curtains, no shears, and we would be on display to anyone walking by (yes, a few employees walked by in the rain).

The light in the bathroom was dim - although the bathroom was very pretty, big, had beautiful appointments. Loved the big, walk-in shower.  Also, no fan in the bathroom so the room steamed up pretty quickly when we took showers. They did have USB plugs in the wall (my new favorite amenity).

Because of the remoteness of the location and weather, we had dinner in the onsite restaurant, The Hound. The Lady Helen in the manor house was closed that evening.  Dinner was okay, with a mediocre steak and service. 

Breakfast was adequate, with enough selections to suit any taste. Lastly, there is no way to get close to the building to unload or load your luggage.  You cannot park close to reception, which is a bit tricky with Irish weather.  Surprised that there is no option that keeps you or your luggage dry in the rain. 

A highlight was watching Tiger Woods win the Masters from the bar at the property. That was fun, and their cocktail menu is excellent.  Try the Gunpowder Gin and Tonic.

This place, although beautiful, was our one miss of the trip. Maybe, with better weather, and the opportunity to stroll the grounds, explore the manor, it could have been a hit.",3,2019,04,22
239,Memorable and marvelous. ,"As the title hints we had a wonderful experience staying two nights at the Manor House. Our room was fab. The staff were very friendly - every one of them. Food, drink and all facilities we experienced were wonderful. 

We were gifted a €500 voucher and that covered two nights B&B, one evening meal (which was top class) and nine holes of golf. 

We took advantage of their free bikes for a lovely spin round the estate and we much enjoyed our relaxing afternoon drinks sitting out in the sun. Summer in April!

They also have spa and gym facilities - we didn’t have time :-) And a live falcon (I think) with handler to guide you. 

It is a really top class venue. ",4,2019,04,19
239,Lovely relaxing place....,"Had a fabulous two night stay in the Manor House. Rooms were old style, beautifully decorated, warm but with all mod cons including a proper walk in shower in a spacious bathroom. We ate in the Hound restaurant both nights.  Real fast in the Manir House is terrific - the kippers were to die for. Played two rounds of golf on a magnificent golf course. 

We’d sessions in the Spa which were a real disappointment. It feels like an after thought for a venue of this quality. The relaxation room for example is an after thought with a small room and very uncomfortable furniture. The treatments were mixed in terms of quality. Don’t get the feeling of being pampered, very functional in its delivery. The sauna and steam room is located in the health club where the pool is so not very conducive to relaxation where there is lots of noise in the pool. The sauna itself is dark, can’t read the temperature gauge, there is not water bucket to increase the temperature and the door doesn’t close properly. Not worth the visit and a shame MJ hasn’t put the same thought into this that they do with everything else which is just superb. ",4,2019,04,16
239,Mixed Feedback,"We booked a long weekend in Hunter's Yard intending to have a relaxing weekend away as I am currently 8 months pregnant so we wanted a break to rest and spend some quiet time together before junior arrives.

1. We arrived on a Saturday. There was a wedding on the Saturday night and our bedroom was very close to the function room. We were kept awake all night by music and noise from the function room as the fire door did not close properly and wedding guests were constantly coming down the hall, congregrating outside our room and making loads of noise. We had to go out at 2am and ask people to please move back to the function room area as we were being kept awake. As we had only booked a 2 nights stay and planned for a relaxing break this was very disappointing as we left after our weekend exhausted from lack of sleep.

2. On check in we asked about dining options and were given menus for the Hound restaurant and the Clubhouse by reception, the receptionist rang the Clubhouse to confirm they were open to hotel guests that evening - the menus were very similar so we chose to eat in the Clubhouse as we did not need a reservation and there were limited times available in the Hound. On arriving at the Clubhouse, we were informed that only golf club members were permitted to eat there, not us. When we explained the situation, they did give us a table but the menu was different to what we had been given, it was very basic and limited. I had the tortellini - it was terrible. Prepacked, supermarket tortellini that was undercooked with some tomato sauce on top - very poor quality.

3. On the first morning, breakfast was a buffet and very good but on the 2nd day, we ordered off the menu. We both ordered pancakes - when they arrived they were reheated, hard and dried out - not freshly made.

4. Very long wait everytime we went to reception. Took about 20 mins to check in.

The above were very big issues for us and we were disappointed as we expected better service for the price we were paying and the reputation of Mount Juliet.

Apart from this, there were a lot of very good points. The hotel and grounds are beautiful, room was lovely and spotlessly clean, garden/grounds staff were lovely to talk to and gave us really good advice. Our second night was nice and quiet as there was no function on.",3,2019,04,15
239,Fabulous,"I'd been once before for afternoon tea and found it only ok - but let me tell you I was blown away after staying there.
The team working there were so friendly, the room was devine, the bar (though very full and hard to get a seat) was fantastic when we got seated with lovely cocktails & atmosphere. 
Dinner in Lady helen was lovely - not too stuffy at all and great atmosphere added to by some nice background music. 
Had a facial in the spa was a fabulous treatment - only negative was the 'relaxation' room which is not a room you'd want to chill in. But honestly I was floating after the facial which was the important part.
Definitely will visit again!",5,2019,04,15
239,Review of Hunters Yard Hotel,My three sisters and I stayed here on Friday 29th March and had a lovely time.  The Mount Juliet Estate is breath taking to say the least. It has fabulous wallkways and the setting is fantastic with beautiful trees and flowers. we were greeted at the entrance by a lovely young man called Paidi who carried our bags into reception and had a very warm welcome for us. He was extremely friendly and courteous . He even helped bring our bags to the room and showed us where everything was ans suggested we visit the main house for a drink which we did later on . The rooms were beautiful and very spacious and the underfloor heating was lovely in the bathroom. We had dinner in the restaurant which was very nice and had a few drinks in the bar that night. the breakfast was very good the next morning and we were served by a nice young fella called Darragh whom was very friendly . We walked around part of the estate afterwards but unfortunately hadnt time to stay too long.  We met one of the managers called Des and he was very nice and friendly also. We all agreed that we would like to come back here and stay for a full weekend as the hotel is lovely and there is a nice friendly atmosphere ther and you can sense that the staff are happy in their work. Will definetly be back.,5,2019,04,04
239,Forty-Eight hours in Ireland,"Recommended by some friends so we booked at The Hunters Lodge . Great value, excellent staff and wish we’d had more time there. The lady on reception was exceptional - Laura. She couldn’t have been more helpful and by the sorry state of us when we arrived realised we were cold and tired so upgraded us to a bigger room with a bath - this was hugely appreciated. We were sadly too late for the restaurant but they kindly let us choose from the menu so we could have it in our room (room service is usually limited to sandwiches) which was kind. The one and only negative was the chips weren’t really cooked but other than that it was good of them to accommodate us. Great breakfast included in the room rate which is unusual these days so all in all a really nice place to rest weary heads. We will return to enjoy a proper stay in the very near future. ",5,2019,04,03
239,Beautiful place,"This is one lovely place. The grounds are just so lovely and you could spend hours just walking and taking in the fresh air.
We stayed in hunters yard.the rooms are lovely and spacious and newly decorated.
The staff were very friendly and helpful,
We had dinner in the The Hound restaurant which was top class. We had a drink in the bar afterwards and it had a lovely atmosphere.
breakfast was also very good with a great choice of food to suit all tastes.
I would highly recommend a visit here.",5,2019,04,02
239,Fun and Relaxing few days away. ,"Purchased a two night stay with bed and breakfast for my fiance. We stayed in the Hunters Lodge hotel just a few minutes from the country house. Staff at reception were lovely and our room was upgraded. Room was spacious and clean and had a mini balcony were the doors opened up and could hear the birds singing away. We arrived we dropped off our bags and headed into Kilkenny to see the castle. It's around a 20 minute drive. The next day we had breakfast in the hound. Breakfast was lovely so much to choose from. Contential and breads and juices all available for you to self serve then they have a menu you can choose fry, eggs with salmon, pancakes etc which is freshly made at your choice. Nice view if you are seated at the window. That morning we done an hour long horse riding trek. It was amazing!!! My fiance and I are both confident riders and the man who took us out .adele the ride as fun as possible. We rode around the grounds down by the river and canter through the forest and fields. I loved it. We then played abit of golf at the driving range. Rent of the clubs abot pricey 55 euro so we got some from the lost and found so only cost us the balls. We tried the pool out also. Shame you have no jacuzzi or a thermal bath. There is a sauna and steam room. 
We had dinner that night in the hound which was part of our deal. Food was ok. Starter I had the chicken pate it was nice and then the sirloin steak. 
Overall I enjoyed myself and would go back again. ",4,2019,04,01
239,Idyllic retreat for the whole Family. ,"We had an excellent time of horse riding, long walks and playing games in the library. We especially loved the high tea. The kids enjoyed their Version. The small details are so thoughtful and exquisite.",5,2019,03,31
239,Great Hotel but needs to sort out a few issues,"We arrived at this beautiful hotel just after 3pm to a very busy reception as they had a wedding party arriving at the same time BUT we had 2 problems one not forgivable 
We were told that our room was being checked and would not be ready for a few minutes so we waited and eventually were told our room was ready so we headed for our room with the knowledge that Housekeeping had just checked our room who confirmed it was ready for us
Imagine our surprise when we went into the room to find 2 suitcases belonging to another guest we only had one bag so I bought it with us
The second issue was the shower handle came off jamming the shower on which we managed to get off eventually 
Regarding the champagne on our arrival we got it delivered to our room eventually after 2 requests 
Electricity went out in the hotel as we were leaving the room
Faulty Towers was funny",3,2019,03,31
239,A real treat,"We stayed in the Manor House for two nights at the end of March.  Dinner in the Lady Helen  restaurant was excellent, both the cooking and the service.  The Michelin star and the three red AA rosettes are well deserved. A hotel for a very special treat.",5,2019,03,31
239,Fantastic Wedding,"My wife and I had a fantastic wedding weekend at Mount Juliet in Autumn 2018. Its a really beautiful place, the staff are very professional and the food was excellent for the entire weekend. Angela the wedding planner and Michael the F&B manager are very good at what they do, provide a very professional service and never really said no to us. All of our specific requests and logistical requirements were taken care of without a hitch.

One of the best things about MJ is that it is a really versatile venue. We had dinner in the golf club the night before followed by drinks in the Manor House. The main event was in Hunters Yard and we had a private family dinner in the Hound restaurant the following day followed by drinks in the bar. We spent the entire weekend there but every day it felt like we were in a new venue. 

All of our guests were raving about the venue, the rooms and especially the food. Everyone seemed to really enjoy being there and many commented they would return themselves for a break. If we had to do it all again, we would not hesitate in picking Mount Juliet.",5,2019,03,30
239,"Accommodation gets solid 4 stars, food only 3","Stayed here with family for one night and a lunch in the hound restaurant recently. Impressions as follows:
1. For a luxury countryside estate, it was surprisingly difficult to get parking when we arrived. Lots of people driving round the car park and cars on the grass verges. I think they need to expand the parking areas going forward. 
2. Our room in hunters yard (standard room) was very pleasant, going towards the luxury end of things with a great bed. The shower could have better pressure, but no other concerns.
3. The estate is beautiful with gardens and the river Nore and the Manor House itself to amble round and see. 
4. The breakfast food was very nice, very good quality, but the space and staff seemed inadequate for the numbers arriving for breakfast. There was a long line of people waiting to get in, and we struggled to get some coffee from a waitress to our table while we were there. 
5. The lunch we had at the hound restaurant was disappointing. The menu was very very limited and very pub-food in nature, but the food itself wasn’t even very tasty pub-food quality when it arrived. There was a bit of general confusion when we arrived despite our reservation, and it was a long time before anyone took our orders when we did get seated. Ultimately I had to go and find a waiter and ask them to come to our table. We had booked this restaurant as part of a birthday celebration for one of our party and frankly the very limited menu and the slow service was a little embarrassing in the context of the occasion. 

In summary the accommodation was very nice but the dining experience was poor. I would also agree with many of the other reviewers of Mount Juliet that their approach to dining options is very unusual for a hotel that is out in the countryside - if their Michelin restaurant and the Hound restaurant are both booked out (which can happen easily) then despite being a resident the only way you can get dinner is via room service. They really need to start serving food in the bar, and I think they also need to expand the hound restaurant menu and improve standards there. Nonetheless the estate is lovely and we may come back. ",3,2019,03,30
239,Stunning location for Spring Summit ,"March weather can be so unpredictable but we had two amazing days in Hunters Yard, with the weather really adding the perfect tone to a wonderful stay 

Around 80 of us stayed for a work event, all of us staying in the Hunters Yard part of the Mount Juliet estate. HY is a few minutes walk from the main building, it has a huge golf course, landscaped gardens, loads of walks, spa & gym & pool and The Stables function room

The Stables function room is an impressive room, over looking the golf course, massive chandeliers hanging from the exposed rafters. We used the function room twice during our stay - once for our event & once for our dinner that night
We had pre dinner drinks in the main house & the lovely chauffeur John kindly drove us from one part of the estate to another, he is working in MJE ten years & he had lots of snippets of information. The reception area of the main house is manned by jimmy who was so lovely & friendly. The main house is so elegant and atmospheric
The food was top class at dinner, food served piping hot & service very good. I had delicious sea trout for main, the only slight criticism I would mention was that the function room got quite cold after the food had been cleared away. The pre function bar just out side of The Stables function room was a little chilly, the bar man was so excellent and attentive & really went above and beyond to be friendly & engaging. 
Breakfast the following morning was excellent, the home made Brown bread was particularly good as was the berry compote 

Lovely place to visit in spring or summer 
Highly recommend for big groups or intimate parties - would love to go back & explore this area more ",5,2019,03,29
239,DBr,"A beautiful place lovely grounds .
Food only fair
Staff not well trained
The hotel walks are very good but not marked out difficult to find your way.
Breakfast hot food was cold.when food ran out long wait for new supplies.",3,2019,03,27
239,Great family holiday,"My family (husband, son 16yrs and daughter 13 years) stayed here for a 3 night break last weekend. The staff were excellent in particular Jimmy who was so welcoming and efficient and worked so hard (had a personal word to say for every guest and really seemed to care that people were happy), Tara at the Equestrian Centre who was so enthusiastic and professional and really made us feel welcome (we loved our pony trek with Orla who was very patient with us beginners!), John who runs the Falcon Experience and who made our hour seem like minutes as it was so enjoyable and  Paudie the porter who checked our room on departure for any left behind cables etc, chatted to my son about his Junior Cert and was so friendly and professional. We will be repeating our visit in the near future!",5,2019,03,22
239,The Hound Restaurant,"Food was nice, nothing to write home
About and whilst staff were pleasant, service was disappointing. 
Had ordered two glasses of wine which arrived after we had finished our meal, despite efforts to get someone’s attention for service. 
I don’t believe we will be in a hurry to return although the setting and the Manor House hold a lot Of appeal.",2,2019,03,18
239,Amazing falconry experience with John,"We had a brilliant break away this Paddy’s weekend. The highlight had to be Egbert, his older sister, and their little friend Maggie. As we learned for John, these are two Harris Falcons and an white faced South African owl. I won’t spoil it. You get so much information from John you could write a thesis. And it’s facinating. He is a genius. The birds are truly mageatic. Walking through the estate with the kids and having these amazing creatures fly through the trees and land on their gloves was a memory that they will never forget. We are so grateful to John for a wonderful afternoon.
The whole experience was perfect. The food, the pool, the staff were all so welcoming and the only complaint is that we couldn’t stay longer.",5,2019,03,18
239,Fabulous Getaway,"We had a fantastic night away in Mount Juliet, with dinner in the Lady Helen restaurant. The Manor House was so relaxing to stay in. The staff were very attentive, helpful, and courteous. The house itself is very impressive with high ceilings and beautiful artwork and features throughout. Our room was fab, super spacious and comfortable. Our dinner was just such an indulgent treat, we opted for the wine pairings and enjoyed it all thoroughly. I requested a vegetarian tasting menu and was very well catered for. We went for lovely walks on the grounds, across the river to see the horses and foals, and also around the beautiful gardens with their blankets of bluebells and daffodils everywhere. We'll definitely return for a visit again, it was pure escapism.",5,2019,03,17
239,Perfect getaway .,"This was just superb from start to finish, truly stunning hotel ,everything was on hand for us,how we were greeted by Nia set the tone . Yes the place was very busy with all sorts of people as it was nearing midterm for kids. Lovely atmosphere in the bar while the rugby was on, unfortunately we couldn't get a table in the Hunters restaurant but we were well looked after by jimmy who got us sorted in the golf restaurant for bar food which was tasty . The room was superb ,very comfortable and one of the most beautiful bathrooms we've come across on our travels . However the breakfast for me was just memorable,breakfast is the last meal you have leaving your hotel and it didn't upset me in any way ,it truly was superb, quality all the way through from start to finish . Gutted we didn't get time to go for a walk this time around as the weather was starting to take a turn for the worst . Well done Mount Juliet and thank you .",5,2019,03,13
239,"Beautiful hotel (Hunter's Yard), very disappointing staff","I was really impressed with the standard of the room and decor here and I would love to recommend it as an escape as it is set on beautiful grounds with lots of walks etc. 

I was really surprised by the staff - aside from one lady who was very pleasant when checking us out, it was like they had received no training at all.  We were early for check in so we didn't expect our room to be ready but it was beyond frustrating when we were told it would be a few minutes and that the guy at check in would call us...an hour later I had to go to the desk to find out what was happening as we received no phone-call. This is while sitting watching others getting checked in!  Only then did they check if our room was ready - really annoying given it is already a very late check in. 

We had dinner in the Hound and I must say our waitress was fantastic.  Front of house was poor - ignored us for ages when we were waiting to be seated.  

The breakfast was really fantastic -  excellent food and lots of variety.

Overall - it is a very nice hotel but until staffing is improved, it is not worth the cost.",3,2019,03,08
239,Excellent location for a break family during school holidays,"We have just returned from a 2 night break with our two children at midterm and thoroughly enjoyed it. We stayed in Hunters Yard in one of their double double rooms which are beautifully decorated and very spacious.  We had a wonderful stay.  The breakfast was really lovely with an excellent range of choices for both adults and children.  We enjoyed a meal in the restaurant which was very good although the menu is somewhat limited.  We also attended at the Estate House and had lunch and couldn't praise the staff enough for their efficient service.  I was also impressed that they acceded to a request for pasta when it was not on the menu and nothing was too much trouble.  We went swimming every day and whilst they are limited hours I think they are more than sufficient and also have a full time life guard on duty.  

There was lots to do around Mount Juliet such as lovely walks and it's such a relaxing place.  Our biggest regret was due to bad weather we did not partake in a complimentary tour of the property with Des McGrath who has a wealth of information regarding Mount Juliet.  Mount Juliet is value for money considering the standard of the surroundings and we will certainly return in the near future.",5,2019,03,04
239,Christmas oresent,"One night stay in hunters Lodge Hotel.  Very nice welcome.  Excellent front of house. Room excellent.  Large TV, mini fridge, coffee machine and tea making facilities.  Went for a lovely swim.  Pool area lovely.  Could not go for a walk in gorgeous grounds as too wet.  Had evening meal included.  Food very good limited selection though.  Front of house at breakfast excellent as was selection of food on offer.  Enjoyed stay",4,2019,03,03
239,Excellent Stay,"Just returned after a two night stay at Hunters Yard. From the moment we checked in to the time we checked out our experience was absolutely wonderful. Our dinner at The Hound restaurant was fantastic served by staff members who obviously enjoyed what they did! Breakfast was amazing and plenty of variety. Pool was lovely and the staff at the Health Club were so welcoming and accommodating. I would truly recommend this hotel for a relaxing break. Well done team Mount Juliet. Special mention to Ann Marie in the restaurant, David in the bar and Des in management. We thoroughly had a wonderful weekend. We will be back.",5,2019,03,03
239,Amazing,"Booked a last minute escape to the Hunter’s Yard and it was idyllic. We arrived in the middle of a heavy downpour and although the staff were willing, we decided to cancel our horse riding session. Instead the staff brought us around the paddocks and introduced us to all the horses. Next we had lunch in the bar - big fire and we were really comfortable - but bar area not as quaint or as well fitted out at the bedrooms - which are all brand new and to die for. After a swim, sauna and steam room we were ready for our dinner which was included in the overnight offer. Food exceptional and the part of the hound dining room we were in - beside the windows was casual but atmospheric. Bed huge and super comfy. Great spot, only 2 hours drive from Dublin. We’ll be back!",5,2019,03,03
239,A really good value and very special night away...........,"The staff were wonderful, friendly and helpful. We loved the restaurant and our waitress Meribel was absolutely fantastic, a real treasure . We got a fabulous value weekend and used the flyer from the Kilkenny shop last November to book. I have told loads of people to book a weekend here, well done Mount Juliet...",5,2019,03,03
239,Afternoon Tea ,"The staff on arrival are very friendly, inviting and well-humored. 

Afternoon Tea is priced at €35 per person with the option of adding extras at a price. 
We were all divided in opinion as to whether it is worth €35 per person or not. 
I believe it & the experience in general, certainly is! The tables are very low and the chairs deep so be prepared.

Sandwiches, excellent,every aspect. So fresh & tasty. Maybe a little over-dependent on mayonnaise at times. 
Scones were very nice as were the cookies though we have experienced better certainly. 
Top layer pastries/desserts were excellent with the exception of a raspberry mousse pastry case,not pleasant at all. But the rest,immaculately presented, baked and tasted delicious. 

Book well in advance not to be disappointed as both rooms were fully booked while we were there. 

",4,2019,03,03
239,Manor house - worth every penny,"We had our wedding reception at the manor house a few years ago and have returned for our wedding anniversary every year. This year was no exception and as always our stay was wonderful. 

We stayed in room 30 with a small baby and it was lovely. Breakfast was fantastic as well as room service. The tasting menu is worth it as a treat however we have only done it once. 

The staff were great . , special mention to Ann Marie Galvan ( I think that was her name) who was very helpful. 

The manor house is expensive but it’s worth it, especially if you get a deal. 

Highly recommended",5,2019,03,02
239,Short break at Hunters Yard,"We stayed for two nights recently at The Hunters Yard Mount Juliet. We were allocated a large corner room 131 with views of the garden and partial view of the golf course. The bed was large and comfortable. Free safe, Coffee machine, and mini fridge with complementary water. Breakfast was in the Hound restaurant, the first morning was self service and 
was fine. The second morning had a
 breakfast menu which was much better. The leisure centre was adequate. 
The grounds are beautiful and the walks are very enjoyable. We had tea and scones in The Manor House overlooking the river and The stud farm not to be missed. All the staff were very friendly. I would recommend this hotel for a relaxing break,   we did not use the golf course but it looked fantastic.",4,2019,02,26
239,Terrible treatment,"Let's st art at the beginning. My wife's family (22 of us) booked the Hunters Yard for 2/3 nights to celebrate family birthdays. 

Problems started when I was reading in our room when the door opened and in walked my sister in law who had been checked to our room in error. Imagine if it had been a stranger and I had been showering! Never in 40 years of staying in hotels around the world has this happened.

Later we went to the bar to watch the Ireland rugby match and were told there was an overflow room were we joined other supporters in a room that was cold as no one had thought to put the heating on.

Later that evening after dinner we went to the residents lounge and again were greeted by an icy room with no drinks service available.

The worst was yet to come as we paid with cash because we did want to incur currency changes (we live in N. Ireland) and then found the next day that we were charged again on our credit card.

When my wife phoned admin said they would refund right away. Three weeks later after many calls and no response from senior management they refunded my brother in law in yet another error. When my wife pointed this out the girl only refunded our credit card when she had got a refund from my brother in law's card company. So our refund was held up to cover up a mistake by the hotel accounts.

We are still waiting to how much this will cost us in credit card currency charges and to add insult to injury two of the family group, who also complained, have been given a free nights stay.

For a booking that spend over 5000 euros it was not a good experience.",2,2019,02,26
239,Some room for improvement ,"Stayed at the Hunters Yard. The hotel part of the magnificent estate, it is well appointed with excellent facilities and comfortable  rooms. However the restaurant and bar need attention. Glasses not cleared, limited menu let down by tepid plates, and poor mid priced choice of  wine lists. While ""family friendly"" policy is cited, the bar and resturant should not be a creche at after 8.00 pm. I raised the issues with staff and my comments were taken on board. Would like to try again, but it will give it a little time for improvement",3,2019,02,24
239,"Mount Juliet, failed to deliver any MAGIC.","Expecting a “sumptuous” 5 star experience, the first reality check was a 30 minute wait at reception while the one receptionist managed 4 separate new arrivals, acted as concierge, booked restaurant tables, while we just hung around.  Not good, but then It got worse.

The “sumptuous” bedroom turned out to be a room in the old servants quarters, with no view, a tacky dirty balcony (see photo), and noise from the kitchen thrown in.  

Worse again, The Hunters Yard restaurant had the HEART of a busy train station with too few waiters eager to please but to busy sprinting from table to table.   The meal would make you cry it was so disappointing, bland with small portions, strange flavor combinations, (smoked salmon and hazelnuts??) and potatoes fried in what tasted like over used oil.

The only thing to redeem the experience was the excellent breakfast served  in the Manor house by charming and warm local ladies.

Mount Juliet does not deliver any magic just high pricing with poor quality standards in food and service.  An experience to forget.",2,2019,02,22
239,Good and not so good,"Just back from a one night stay in the Hunters Yard having previously stayed in the Manor House. We arrived around 1.30 checked in at desk as expected room wasn’t ready which wasn’t a problem as we were going for a walk and having lunch. Left bags at reception and they took my number and would ring when room ready. Went to golf club for lunch were there were there was only 3 tables with about 6 people using them. Took coats off sat down and was then asked were we members or golfers I said no we were staying in hotel was then told club was for members only and we could not stay there. So coats back on and we were directed to the hound. Got to the hound coats off nice seat beside the fire only one group of six drinking tea in the bar. Waiter came over I asked for the bar Menu they didn’t do a bar menu so I asked could I have a sandwich and tea no they don’t do food only tea and scones and crisps. He said I could get lunch in the restaurant I explained I didn’t want lunch I just wanted a sandwich and tea and were could I get it. To my absolute amazement he said he didn’t know but would find out and he came back a few minutes later and said the only place I could get tea and a sandwich was in the manor house. So hats and coats on again and off to the manor house were I finally got my tea and sandwich and have to say the service was streets ahead of what I received so far. It was almost 3.15 and still no phone call from reception about the room being ready so we went for a really nice walk around the estate had a drink in the hound bar and still no call about our room. So we went back to reception our room was ready they just obviously forgot to ring me. Room was spotless and really nice. Dinner was included in the package so entered the restaurant from the hotel stood around for a few minutes before a really nice girl took us to the other entrance beside the bar were there was a sign saying please wait to be seated was located. She said the girl would be with us in a minute. Five minutes later and time spent moving out of staff,s way carrying trays of drink from the bar to the restaurant the same girl noticed us still standing at the sign and said I don’t know were she who ever she was is gone but in fairness to her she took our names and showed us to our table. Limited dinner menu but food was excellent and service once our order was taken was also very good. I did order a tea which never arrived and appeared on the bill but was promptly removed once I pointed it out. Breakfast was excellent and strangely they only used the hotel entrance for breakfast and they had a person taking room number and showing you to your table. Over all it was a nice stay but a little more attention to detail or better staff training would make it a lot better. Super golf course which I have played many times really disappointed not to be served in the club house on the Sunday especially since it was almost empty. Even more strange that there is no bar menu in the hound  or you could not get tea and a sandwich without actually leaving the building to go to the manor house yet if I had been in my room I could get it on room service. The package I was on also included a glass of Presco on arrival which was never offered to us. Would I recommend the hunters yard ? not really think the level of service is much better in the Manor House. The estate,golf and walks are really fabulous just a pity they seemed to let standards slip a bit for what is expected in Mount Juliet.",4,2019,02,19
239,Extremely disappointing! Bring warm clothes if you are going to stay!! Don't bother with feedback - they don't want it.,"If you are an international visitor to Ireland please do not judge our hotels by this establishment!!!!

Recommend you stay in the Shelbourne Hotel (or similar) to experience a real Irish 5 star hotel.

My feedback which I shared with the hotel (and received no response):

1 Hunters Bar

I arrived late on Friday (close to 9pm) due to a business meeting in Dublin. I went to Hunters Bar to see the rest of our party. I asked if I could order food and told I couldn’t. I was referred to the restaurant so I asked could I order food in the restaurant and bring it into the bar. I was told I couldn’t. I was referred to room service. I asked if I could order room service and bring it to the bar and was told I couldn’t. Neither of these options appealed as I would be eating on my own.

You will understand my ""surprise"" when 2 customers walked from the restaurant into the bar and were then served their desserts in the bar.

Hardly a 5 star experience

We watched the Ireland v England game in Hunters Bar when 3 members of staff were serving. It was clear and obvious that only 1 member might have had any bar training as the length of time it took to get served was remarkable with that number people working.

In the bathroom leading off Hunters Bar the hot tap at the hand basin is closed.  Not very hygienic.  May only have a cold water feed and cant be bothered to install a warm water feed.

2 General hotel temperature

The hotel was COLD for the entire weekend. My wife commented on this at check out when she was advised that there had been a ""problem"" and a lot of people had complained!

3 Pool/Heat

The water in the pool was reasonable.

The cold temperature in the men’s changing rooms was such that I probably would have been warmer getting changed in the open air!.

4 Dining Experience

Perhaps the only real positive experience of the visit was the service we received for our large party dinner on Saturday night. The lady who looked after our table should be commended.

5 Bathroom fittings

See photos! Say no more. 

Needless to say I wont be staying again!",1,2019,02,17
239,In a class of its own,"Mount Juliet hosted a 50th birthday party.  The feedback from EVERY guest was fantastic.  The hotel, the rooms, the grounds, the activities, the food, the staff, the room for the event ... everything was perfect.  

I cannot praise Zoe and the team enough .... it is a credit to all involved and I would highly recommend Mount Juliet for all weddings, reunions or simply a weekend away.  Thank you",5,2019,02,12
239,Great Hotel ... few minor improvements needed,"I stayed in Mount Juliet (Manor House) over the weekend, my first time returning in over 10 years. I found the staff in the Manor House to be extremely welcoming & friendly. The bedroom was exceptional with a big comfortable bed! The breakfast the next morning was flawless.

We ate dinner in the Hound restaurant, the food was great - however it was quite pricey! You have to purchase additional sides with the mains, I paid €4 for a couple of diced carrots (which were quite al dente) Another gripe I had is the extremely limited lunch menu that is on offer. It's also very frustrating that you can't book a table for lunch in the bar at Hunters Yard. 

All in all, it's a fabulous location for a night away.",4,2019,02,11
239,Restaurant Lacking,"We stayed in Hunters Yard earlier this week. The grounds, room and staff were all exceptional. The let down of this hotel was the restaurant and quality of food that came out for the price that is paid. We order two mains meals, a side and two drinks which cost us $93 AUS. My husband had pork belly which was chewy, lacked flavour and was a terrible small serving size. I had risotto which was sloppy, undercook, had little to no flavour and once again was very small in size. Very big disappointment considering the price and size of the meals. ",4,2019,02,09
239,Finally made the decision to stay,For years said we wanted to stay. Our first of what will hopefully be many visits. Stays in the hunters Yard great value a beautiful room. Great views lovely staff. Lovely little bar. Didn't bother with food as we weren't that hungry but will be booking that the next time.,5,2019,02,04
239,Celebrity Treatment,"From the moment of our arrival, we could not have felt more at home. This was our second stay at Mount Juliet, but this time we ensured to book into the Lady Helen for Dinner, and the Falconry Experience to experience more of what was on offer in the estate. 

We were warmly welcomed by Des, who made us feel so at home, and shared his vast knowledge of the history of the estate, and shared stories of memories of the estate.

We dined that evening in the Lady Helen, and as big foodies, it was a great pleasure to meet the Head Chef John after dinner. Thank you for sharing your time with us, it made the evening even more special.

We stayed in Hunters Yard, and the modern touches in the rooms were beautiful. We stayed in the manor house previous, so if you want more modern rooms, stay in Hunters Yard. The bathtub was awesome!!!

Finally, big thank you to John, our falconer- who shared his expertise and knowledge about the art of falconry! We so enjoyed meeting Eggbert, Ivy & Nelson! A great experience.A must do activity on the fabulous estate.

We have already booked to come back in the summer- we look froward to seeing you all soon.",5,2019,02,04
239,Nice Hotel,Stayed here midweek in January. Was a bit disappointed with the pool spa area. It needs a good upgrading to match the rest of the hotel. Sauna was out of action on the day we were there which was a bit disappointing. Restaurant was good but very expensive. All main course prices excluded sides/veg. Staff were all very friendly and efficient. Breakfast was very good.,4,2019,02,01
239,Great Place for a break,"We were actually concerned about some of the recent reviews when we booked for it in Jan 19. However our experience was excellent. We stayed in the hunter's yard, very large warm rooms, lovely large toilet and very comfortable bed. The main bar could have a bit more character, but for a pre dinner drink is perfect. Dinner was really good at the Hound with an excellent service. Maybe I agree with some previous reviews about children and babies staying up in the restaurant area after 10.30pm might not be for everybody. We used the pool facilities and must say they are great, very large pool with a steam room. Spa facilities fully recommended. All in all I would go back for a treat.",5,2019,01,22
239,Wonderful old world charm,"We had an amazing afternoon tea at Mt Juliet.  The service was slick and professional , the food lovely and the atmosphere amazing.

Its a wonderful building and you're free to wander the grounds and everyone makes you feel very welcome (just avoid walking near the golf course)",5,2019,01,21
239,Excellent weekend,My first time in mount Juliet but it won’t be my last.  My daughter and I visited here last weekend for 2 nights.  Having heard loads of positive things about this place I was delighted to be going.  And it didn’t disappoint    Unfortunately check in on Friday evening was a bit hectic as there was only one member of staff at reception.  However that was the only down side.  The rooms are gorgeous and very spacious.  The spa in which we both had facials was up there with the best of them.  Very professional and very relaxing.  And the food was top notch.  I had fish on both nights and would highly recommend it.  Staff are very friendly and helpful . I must mention Stephen and James on reception and Shaun in the golf club restaurant. Most helpful. The pool area is lovely and I like the fact that children are only allowed in at certain times 🥰.   All in all a lovely relaxing weekend and will definitely return.  ,5,2019,01,20
239,Night away for our first wedding anniversary,"Having heard so many good things about Mount Juliet we decided to book in for our first wedding anniversary on Saturday 05th January 2019. We arrived early and upon check in I asked the person checking us in (who's name escapes me) where the restaurants etc were and also how we gained access to the spa facilities. This information wasn't offered, it was requested by me - he handed us a map type thingy and said no more about it. 

We went to our room in the Manor House which wasnt huge but very nice and cosy. Spotlessly clean. Our hopes were high.
We went for a walk around the stunning grounds, it is a really really lovely setting.
We went down to the swimming pool by Hunters Lodge, then we went into the bar at Hunters Lodge for a drink. We went for another stroll along the river and went for a drink in the Manor House. Again so far so good.

It all went pear shaped, when circa 7.00 pm after getting all glammed up we proceeded to the bar in the Manor House and ordered 2 drinks. We were not really interested in the Michelin star restaurant (Lady Helen) and just waned to eat in the bar. My husband mentioned this to Paul (a very very helpful barman) who told us everywhere was booked solid. We actually could not believe that first of all we were not told this on check in and second of all - how can you tell guests in a hotel paying top dollar for their room that eh tough, starve, you're not getting fed here.

We took our concerns forward to the concierge and were advised to go back to our room and eat from the Room Service Menu!!?? I mean really?? That wasnt happening.

Again we had to make a fuss and eventually were shown to a specially made up table.............up the stairs.........behind the christmas tree in the landing............I kid you not. Hidden behind a tree, in the drafty hall way leading to the bedrooms! Then we were given the room service menu which consisted of sandwiches and soups! It was now 8.30 pm - over an hour later. 

Again we vented our frustrations, and after more faffing and mulling and confusion, eventually we were sent into Thomastown to a restaurant. Mount Juliet covered the taxi fair. Wow. On the journey in we were advised that this happens regularly at Mount Juliet...……...

I just cant believe how badly run this place is. Our first wedding anniversary effectively ruined.
When we got back from the restaurant to Mount Juliet we just went to bed, it was 10.30 pm but we just were done with the place at that point.

We will never darken the door here again. 

Very very disappointing.
The only saving grace were Paul and the concierge, who's name was Kiara I think, They were genuinely interested in helping us but could only do so much. That much was appreciated. 

How at 19.00 pm guests can be told ""sorry we cannot accomodate you for food"" is an utter baffling to me. We only wanted to eat in the bar. It was 7 pm - even if they had agreed to seat us at some point in the evening, whether that be 9 or 10 pm that would have been something. But all we got were shoulder shrugs! 
OR more to the point if we had of been warned at check in or received a telephone call the day before but NO. Nothing. 

Upon checking out staff apologised and the drinks on our room were covered (2 glasses of wine and a cup of tea). Still doesn't make up for it, not by a long shot. 

Go anywhere else. Or bring some sandwiches.

239,Wonderful Stay – we will be back!,"My partner and I had a wonderful stay at Mount Juliet last year.  Expectations were high as several friends had recommended the Estate to us as a potential wedding venue.  

The Estate is stunning and the staff were friendly, professional and efficient throughout. We stayed mid-week when it was a little quieter and the hotel very kindly upgraded us to the Earl of Carrick room in the Manor House.  This was a real treat, beautifully decorated with huge windows and amazing views across the fields with horses in the distance grazing along the river bank.  The view is so different from normal 21st century life that it was like going back in time 250 years and stepping into a Constable painting.  If you want to really see the beauty of Mount Juliette then I would suggest treating yourself to a room with a view, you will not be disappointed!

For Dinner we sat down to the 7 course tasting menu in the Michelin starred restaurant. We were particularly looking forward to this as the chef John Kelly has worked at Heston Blumenthal’s The Fat Duck and also spent a month at Tetsuyas in Australia (reference for my Aussie friends) and his food is easily up there with the best that London has to offer. Particularly delicious was the fish course, the sweetbreads (never had before but surprisingly tasty) and probably the nicest chocolate dessert I’ve had to date – very chocolaty without being too rich and totally delicious. The A La Carte menu also sounded so good I want to go back to eat the other courses we couldn’t fit in :-)

On the next day, we went on a private falconry tour.  It’s something I had never thought to do before and I surprised myself by really enjoying the experience. Our guide John Duggan was extremely knowledgeable and made the tour fun.  I can be a bit nervous around animals that I don’t already know but the birds are so well-trained that all this was forgotten and they were soon swooping down from the sky and landing on my arm for titbits an exhilarating experience.

All in all it was a fabulous 24 hour stay and we crammed a lot in.   My other half enjoyed himself so much that he’s suggested we stay there at least once a year when we head back to Ireland and whilst I hate being the “quiet woman” for once I am happy to indulge him!",5,2019,01,11
239,Perfection!!!!,"I stayed here with my husband for his 40th and to say it was sheer and utter bliss is an understatement. We arrived on Friday evening in the down pours of rain, but where it would usually put a dampener (excuse the pun) on things I have to say it only made our weekend all the better because we could thoroughly enjoy the comfort and coziness of Hunter’s Yard without feeling guilty for not making the most of the outdoors. We were welcomed by a roaring fire which enhanced the Christmas decor and a very warm welcome from the staff on reception. The staff throughout the hotel were out on their own in terms of friendliness and efficiency and couldn’t fault any one of them on their service. We made our way to our room through the beautifully decorated corridors and were overwhelmed when we walked into the tastefully decorated room with its fabulous artwork, plump pillows, bed that you sank in to and handmade soaps. After unpacking we made our way to The Hound for a bite to eat and again we were not disappointed with the fabulous menu and the level of service from the staff who were only too happy to help with every request. This was repeated all weekend with every meal. I can truly say it was the most relaxing weekend I have ever had and will certainly be returning, maybe I might even make it outside to enjoy some of the beautiful grounds that we drove through!!!!",5,2019,01,09
239,Never again. Awful experience.,"I stayed for one night with my husband and 2 small children in the hunters yard. This was our second stay in the hunters yard and will definitely be our last. 

Upon check in we were told the clubhouse restaurant was closed for a function. The other dining options of the Hound and the Lady Helen are not suitable for our kids. We were told the major bar would be suitable as an alternative so we walked down with the kids only to discover that the menu was not appropriate (no menu online or in room to check so took staff's advice). There is nothing near the hotel so my husband drove to Kilkenny for food - so frustrating as had we known the clubhouse was closed we could have eaten on our way to the hotel. 

While in the room waiting for dinner with the two children I discovered dirty bed linen, television not working, Chromecast not working, and no cot for the baby. Spent 45 minutes trying to reach reception by phone with the phone ringing out each time. Eventually cot arrived after an hour and a call to the main hotel reception.

Finally, at breakfast the highchair given to us for our baby had broken glass in it - unbelievable. Staff response when I showed them was to say ""that needs a good wipe down"". Leaving our hotel room, we discovered the fridge had stopped working overnight so meals and milk for baby went in the bin. 

All of the above sent by email to management who acknowledged their failure to provide us with the service we deserved, however offering no explanation and nothing but an apology.

Unacceptable for such an expensive hotel. We did not get the service we paid for (prepaid booking). I do not recommend it to any traveller.",1,2019,01,09
239,Beautiful venue - bit chaotic as an experience though!,"My sister and I booked a package which allowed us a 20% discount in the spa - a lovely treat for ourselves and our two daughters (aged 18 and 21).  The whole experience was a great treat for the girls, but a bit chaotic to say the least!  To make the most of our stay we arrived early around 12 noon.   Our rooms were not available at check-in so we left our bags at reception and went for a walk...  a few hours later we returned - the rooms were still not ready at 3pm - we fished in our bags again for books and retired to the residents lounge.  We had treatments booked for 4pm - the rooms still not ready - so we fished again for swimsuits.  All this in reception.  There weren't enough lockers in the spa, so we were sent to the health centre to change...  After the spa treatments (which were totally wonderful) we checked at reception to see if our diner would be in Hunters Yard or the Manor House - our booking had been erased and there was no booking for us at all!  They managed to fit us into the bar for dinner that evening, but again a late start.  Breakfast was a long queue with guests having to part like the Red Sea to allow staff to move from the kitchen to the restaurant with fresh supplies of bacon, eggs, fruit etc.  The flow of traffic seems incredibly wrong and nothing is where you think it is going to be!  That said, the staff members were very polite and cordial - I think they need to re-work the flow of serving food and getting people into their rooms on time.  The girls had a brilliant time - this was their first night in Mount Juliet and they loved the whole experience - well done to the Spa.",3,2019,01,07
239,We will not be returning,"After being loyal guests for twenty years coming to mount Juliet this stay will be our last.  Our main concern last August during our visit of 3 days was that there were 2 weddings during that time and a golf tournament which meant that my partner could not use the driving range or the golf course.   We were not advised of this prior to staying there and this affected the enjoyment of our stay.   The weddings took over guest areas for a large part of the time during our stay at the mount Juliet house and hunters yard and ultimately this meant that we felt we were excluded from these areas because of the weddings.   We wanted peace and quiet from our hectic working lives which is not too much to ask since that has been the main reason we have returned to mount Juliet for so many years.

However this visit in December we asked in advance if there would be weddings, and were told there were but they would be up at the hunters yard and we were staying in the house.   So we continued with our booking.   Then on the Saturday we went to the house and found that the whole area around the majors room from around 2pm until 6pm was full of wedding guests.   This meant that we were unable to have afternoon tea or any kind of food in this area as the service stops here st 5pm and we were advised they were not serving food anyway because of the wedding.    The only other option in the whole estate on a Saturday lunchtime if there is a wedding is the hound restaurant as normally the golf club is for members only.    
We went to try to get a drink in the majors bar in the house but this was crammed full of wedding guests and the only option for seating for us as guests who were staying in the highest priced room in the place, was in the corridor which lead to the toilets!   Our ‘view’ was looking at a wall with people walking back and forth to the toilet!

We dined one night in the lady Helen , which is a lovely restaurant, but I am a vegetarian and the vegetarian options are very poor.  

The spa is a very good spa with excellent staff and treatments, so it does sadden me because of the way we have been made to feel as guests (as though we are not the priority when there is a wedding) that we will not be returning.   We made our feelings clear in August and this was addressed at the time but it now appears that if anyone visits on a weekend then they should be prepared for their visit to be disrupted by weddings.    If this is now primarily a wedding venue then this should be made clear.  Staying at mount Juliet is expensive and alcohol is overpriced. and so I do think that we should be able to sit and dine where we want when we want and not be made to feel we have to take a back seat if there is a wedding .",2,2019,01,06
239,Not good enough,"We had relatives visiting  who always insist on a trip to mount Juliet hunters yard on their regular visits. The food  presentation was abysmal. The chips were not cooked, the bagel must have been prepared by a two year old, the sides were non existent and the desserts a complete rip off. That's the second recent strike out for Mount Juliet for us. It cant be that difficult on a restricted menu - sort it out or we wont be back.",1,2019,01,04
239,"Hunters Yard, nice for the Butlin's experience","Hunters Yard is a wonderful hotel with top notch facilities and bright, spotless rooms; the staff are cordial, professional and couldn't be any more welcoming but we had a disastrous stay. Upon arrival we went to the pool which was crammed with children late afternoon, fair enough, but you couldn't enjoy a swim at all let alone relax on the loungers with the din. Speaking of, dinner was booked at The Hound for 7pm and after a short wait in the bar we were shown to our table near the door to the main corridor at 7.30. From then on, we basically spent the evening closing the door after it was left open time and time again by kids, literally playing chasing in, out of and around the restaurant. I'd love to say the food was good but playing doorman meant it just got cold and by then all we wanted to do was leave. A couple behind us began sharing the door-closing chores so we managed to at least quaff the wine and coffees with a bit of dignity then we left, out through the open door of course (a door-closing spring costs about a fiver, just to let management know). After a brisk walk we decided to spend the rest of the night in the Saddle Bar, a warm, cheery, inviting bar but at this point, 9.30 at night, it was packed. With children sitting at the bar - at the bar! - playing their tablets and eating crisps. One child was sat alone at a table for four playing her tablet. Seriously. The family (s)  didn't leave until after 10.30 but we had watched as countless couples entered and left, unable to get a seat. We had managed to get two stools at the bar and had a decent enough chat despite the noise from the kids' tablets. Is there not a legal requirement for children to be off licensed premises during extended hours, which is after 9pm? Maybe it's different for hotels. But it does sully the experience for adults. The next morning, relaxing after breakfast, we were treated to a game of knick-knacks as someone's child banged like the Almighty on the door and ran off. Sure they're just kids I suppose. So, if you wish to untether your offspring and let them run riot day and night, Hunters' Yard seems to be the place to do it. If, on the other hand, you're a couple hoping for a relaxing stay - swim, nice meal and a few drinks (and some post-breakfast dozing), well, forget about it. I stayed in Castlemartyr, Cork, with my two kids (yes, I have them too, and I instill a sense of decorum and propriety in them) and we were ordered out of the bar at 8.45; there are also restricted hours for family swims and all the guests were happy with that. This should have been a nice opportunity for us to enjoy a night away while the grandparents minded the children. We got a good deal, in fairness. But we should have just relented and taken the whole gang to McDonalds instead. At least the kids would have been happy.",1,2019,01,03
239,Just a fabulous lady!,"I visited your lovely clubhouse today and had a wonderful meal. The bar staff were great and the food was top notch. But the highlight was when I met a truly delightful lady named Ella. She is part of the housekeeping staff and she went on to tell me about the recent renovations etc. She was so engaging, polite and just wonderful. 

Fair play to Mount Juliet for having such amazing staff. 

Kind regards,

239,Hunters Yard one night getaway!! ,"Lovely hotel and beautiful setting,  room was really nice, loved the decor throughout, however the food and service a bit dissapointing...
Unfortunately I can only give the breakfast a 5 out of 10, a bit poor for a 5 star experience, dinner in the hound restaurant was tasty but pricey for what we got. 
Staff definitely not falling over themselves to be to helpful, especially restaurant and bar staff unfortunately lacking in service skills. 
Pitty as its a fabulous place!!

239,Pretty hotel but cold bedroom ,"Arrived to be meet by festive lights on the external trees, lovely smell of peat of the open fires and very nice staff. 

It when we was shown to our room that we where cold. Rang reception as we couldn’t get the heating to come on. Was told was on a timer and would come on at 6pm. It was 4pm and our room was that cold you could see your breathe. Hotel organised an electric heater after I asked. 

Public areas where heated by the lovely open fires and when the heating came on the room was toasty. 

Another small picky item was the dirty kettle for a five star hotel. Not best start. 

We were part of a company Christmas party, bar areas where lovely. 

Food in the restaurant was stunning, simply lovely, every bite we all loved. With lovely wine. 

Breakfast in the morning was also excellent. 

Note swimming pool and spa is not in the main building but another. ",3,2018,12,20
239,A Relaxing Manor stat,"What can I say but .... wow ...
We stayed at the Manor House of Mount Juliet, the room was great, the staff fantastic and walks around the Grounds in the Autumn weather were worth the break ... 

If you go an stay, spend time ... hang out in HD Bar, read books by the fire and walk around he grounds ... (even go have a look at the hounds and horses)",5,2018,12,17
239,Wonderful but the hotel was cold,Our room and the Lady Helen restaurant were both excellent and the staff so obliging and friendly in all departments. The only downside [otherwise I would have given 5 stars] was that the the hotel was cold in the public areas. Some of the fires that could be lit weren't and at certain times of the day the heating goes off. Not great for wet and cold November days.,4,2018,12,15
239,Luxurious and Peaceful; a perfect break in the Manor House to celebrate a birthday!,"We stayed in the Manor House and had dinner in the Michelin starred Lady Helen Restaurant. The Manor house is is really beautiful and the grounds are vast with lots of walks and things to see. Our room was comfortable and on the ground floor with easy access to the rest of hotel and the bed was super comfortable. The staff were wonderful and couldn't do enough to make our stay extra special. We went for the 3 course meal in the Lady Helen and the breads and desserts were in particular out of this world. I would recommend the chocolate dessert for two! Breakfast was really good in the morning tooo.
We booked a tour with Des for the morning of our stay and it was really interesting to hear about the history of this beautiful estate. We have often stayed and  never tire of the Hotel or its grounds.",5,2018,12,13
239,Gorgeous hotel,Spent only one night in the hotel but would love to stay again. Room was comfy and luxurious. Restaurant was lovely and had a nice atmosphere. Food was amazing. Staff was really helpful and friendly. The setting was amazing with great views,5,2018,12,06
239,Relaxing Couples getaway,"We enjoyed a midweek getaway at the main house while visiting friends in Kilkenny. The property is absolutely beautiful. The grounds are quiet and peaceful and there is a great walking trail by the river that takes you past the nearby stud farm. Our room was spacious and the bed was heavenly. The staff could not have been more accommodating in the Lady Helen, at breakfast, or at the reception when we were looking for a running route close to the hotel. We visited in late November, and the roaring fires in the reception and the residents' bar made the place feel cosy and festive. We could have spent hours curled up by the fire enjoying our (excellent!) nightcaps.We left feeling so relaxed that I could hardly believe we'd only been there for one night. Next time, we will definitely stay for longer and check out the onsite spa.",5,2018,12,04
239,Lovely traditional hotel,"We stayed in the Manor House and we really enjoyed the festive feel and atmosphere throughout the hotel and resort. We had a lovely traditional decorated bedroom with nice views and we enjoyed the selection of teas and the bathroom products provided, the bed was very comfortable also. We enjoyed our dinner in the hound and our breakfast in the Lady Helen restaurant and the service was excellent in both. All the staff we met were very nice and helpful. The grounds and gardens are beautiful and well kept.",5,2018,12,03
239,Hunter's Yard,"My husband and I stayed at the Hunter's Yard on the Mount Juliet Estate for 3 nights with our 10 month old son. Upon arrival we were struck by the beauty of the Hunter's Yard, the grounds are beautifully kept and the decor inside is equally as impressive. We arrived at approximately 1pm and our room was ready. The cot bed I had requested beforehand was already in our ground floor room and the staff were extremely friendly in offering their help in every way. The room had 2 large double beds and was very spacious. The decor and furniture in the room was stunning as was the tiling and suite in the bathroom. It's clear that no expense has been spared in the finishing of the rooms and indeed the hotel in general. There are great facilities for families including a playground, fairy garden, river and forest walks and a family changing room at the pool. I also liked the way you don't have to walk through reception to get to the pool from most guest rooms, there's an elevator bypassing reception which is great. There's also a room near The Hound dining room which contains a steriliser and microwave which was very handy for our son's food and bottles. Unfortunately I only discovered this room towards the end of our stay and it would have been great to have been told about it at check in. The only fault I found with Hunter's Yard is when it came to the food. On our first night, we dined in The Hound and we were quite underwhelmed. I had a salmon main and the skin was soggy and limp and the rosti, fennel and sauce accompanying it was bland. My husband had pork belly and this was equally as disappointing due to a fairly insipid sauce. The second day we ate in the golf club and ordered steak sandwiches, which, while tasty, were very small for the price we paid. I left still feeling hungry. Breakfast in The Hound was a standard buffet spread, but the scrambled eggs were watery and there was quite a queue to be seated on the Sunday morning. 
Last year, my husband and I stayed in the Main House on the Mount Juliet Estate and we found ourselves comparing which we preferred. With our son with us this year, the Hunter's Yard was definitely the better choice because the rooms were more spacious and all the facilities are close by. I also much preferred the decor in the Hunter's Yard. However the food in the Main House is in a different league. 
I really enjoyed our stay at the Hunter's Yard, mainly due to how well they've kitted the place out. It's stunning. All it needs is a decent menu and better food in The Hound and it'd be 5 stars all the way. ",4,2018,12,02
239,Underwhelming,"On arrival I was very impressed. Stunning location, stunning room at the Hunters Yard.  I booked dinner in the restaurant""the hound"" which I feel was a major let down. Overly priced for very mediocre good. I was disappointed with all 3 courses as was my friend. What a pity considering the beautiful surroundings and friendly staff.",3,2018,12,01
239,So fabulous ,"Went with girlfriends for night away. Was just blissful. Beautiful rooms in the house. Relaxed over bottle of wine before dinner. The Lady St. Helen restaurant is just amazing. Service was excellent, food was amazing, atmosphere so relaxing. Lovely comfortable beds, great nights sleep followed by lovely breakfast. 
Definitely worth visiting. ",5,2018,11,25
239,A wonderful autumnal break,"Thank you Mount Juliet for a really special short break. We loved the full Mount Juliet experience: a beautiful hotel, stunning countryside grounds, a great spa, an amazing fine dining and wine experience at Lady Helen Restaurant, and the well stocked bar with a great introduction to Irish whisky from Paul the barman.  We will definitely return!",5,2018,11,24
239,Blissful and Beautiful Hunters Yard,"I have always associated Mount Juliet Estate with golf and fishing and there is no doubt that you couldn’t find a better venue for those pursuits. However, just less than 2 hours from the chaos of Dublin lies the absolute haven which is the Hunters Yard (HY) at the Mount Juliet Estate. HY lies some minutes walk from the Manor House and is adjacent to the beautiful walled gardens of the estate. You will have access to the wonderful woodlands or if you so wish can take a walk on the banks of the Nore, a walk that will soothe the soul especially as the leaves change to their autumnal glory. As we traveled midweek there was an added peacefulness about the place (and we were able to avail of keen rates).

Each and every member of staff were professional and engaging and the quality of the food at the Hound restaurant was top notch having been sourced locally where posible (over a two night stay, we tried a variety from the menu).

On an earlier visit our room overlooked the courtyard and this time we had a lovely garden view - each space having had its own advantage. The bedrooms are beautifully modern and the bathrooms have underfloor heating. We had a blissful and beautiful stay and can’t wait to go back en famille!",5,2018,11,20
239,Very dissapointing overall.,"I love Halloween as my girls are at the perfect age to enjoy the fun of trick or treating and dressing up, so this year we decided to spend their midterm break at The Mount Juliet, convinced by my chat (In September) with Laura in reservations that this was the place to be, with a great kids club, a Halloween party and fun for all.... We ended up staying in, ordering room service and their carefully chosen outfits never left their cases... 
The ""Mount Juliet Juniors"" camp was staffed by girls who were lethargic at best, the printed schedule was not adhered to the one and a half days my three (generally very easy going children) went and my second eldest daughter had an allergic reaction on the visit to the equestrian centre and was left sitting on a kerb outside on her own in the freezing cold(joined by her 2 sisters...) and the staff REFUSED to call us,saying they would have to return to the office and couldn't use their own mobile phones to contact us...….even writing this I am still so upset... and although I contacted Caroline who is in charge, I am still waiting for an apology...that is all I wanted, an explanation and an apology..from the staff I TRUSTED with my girls... we filled in 6 detailed forms(3 each day !...why bother?...it leaves me speechless) Caroline listened,she organised falconry and dinner... but all I wanted was an apology I told her this, please don't let this happen to someone else....we did not hear from her again before departure.... we would have had dinner and falconry without her help, it felt insincere and still does.
The rest of our week was fine( but obviously this had a huge effect on us) the girls had pony camp on the Tuesday and Wednesday, this was well run by Shauna and Tara who were fun and responsible and they enjoyed. They also loved John and the falconry hour he is wonderful.. and Sean a PGA professional took them for an fun hour of golf, again a man totally suited to his job and they really enjoyed it and him (I recommend this and only heard about it from another mum at the pony camp..ask at the golf club)
The food in The Hound Restaurant after a week of the same menu is beyond boring (especially if you dont eat fish) My husband eats steak and it was bad, he spoke to Shawn and it was slightly better but three nights he was left dissapointed. My salmon was good, the cod was a tiny portion served in a bowl..with a bowl of potatoes on the side. Wines were good and staff a little hit and miss but on the Tuesday night Shawn, Vanja and Reiner were very professional and lovely. Breakfast here was hectic and although there seemed to be enough staff they didn't seem to be any organisation and things were constantly running low...we queued four mornings out of the six...
We ate in the Main House restaurant one night and although I'm sure the meat has the same source the steak was much better, and although it was really busy can I commend a young waiter called Eoin who really earned his tips that night, he was excellent. The Saddle Bar for me lacked any atmosphere, no fire and a clock stuck on 11.20 for the week!(How can someone not notice this!?) The barman was pleasant. The Golf club serves food to non members midweek and we enjoyed this space and food and every member of staff encountered faultless and hardworking.

Our 2 adjoining rooms on the second floor in The Hunters Yard were good, a quiet corridor, good size and comfortable beds..and near the pool and spa so well located. House keeping was unintrusive but basic I had to leave the empty Ballygowen glass bottles out after every visit..... it was beds made, toiletries replaced and little else..I didn't expect swan shaped towels but although we had put a small towel to keep the doors open between the rooms surely someone would get a doorstop? We actually looked in the tiny village of Thomastown to buy one and eventually rang reception who did provide two...The Residents Lounge is awful, always empty, surely a fire in November was't too much to expect in its lovely open fireplace...or maybe some board games might breath some life into this forgotten space? We had three spa treatments, I would recommend but do bring your own dressing gown, I am a standard size and they ARE AWFUL...overwashed and uncomfortable..a pet hate of mine.
The grounds were breathtaking (helped by the most beautiful autumnal weather) there are bicycles...not for children, understandable...due to insurance according to reception....but my husband met a lady in management as we left (Catherine ? Lane...)
who didn't seem to get that memo..
The swimming pool is located in Hunters Yard so if staying with children is very convenient, times 9-12 and 3-6 so its small and can get very busy and the male changing room is miniscule...but a nice addition.
So to finish, would we return/recommend? There is so much choice out there in this price bracket and living in Dublin you can get anywhere within a few hours....This was a place I was so looking forward to and I have been bitterly disappointed. It is a magnificent location with so much history attached and I just feel, it should feel...more special, the little things are being missed, the things that make a person want to return to talk positively about...and all I know is my little girls were neglected, missed Halloween and I can't get that week back....I have answered the survey sent to my email address over a week ago now but hopefully my feedback on this forum will make a difference to what should be an amazing destination....",2,2018,11,12
239,Magical ,"Absolutely magical place! The grounds and accomodation are breath takingingly beautiful, the staff are friendly and helpful you just feel minded and taken care of from start to finish with a real easy breezy atmosphere we also booked in for the falconry and I would highly recommend. Can't wait to return at some point soon in the future! ",5,2018,11,11
239,The perfect weekend break,"Mount Juliet Estate is truly a gem of Irish Hospitality. We stayed for two nights and were sorry to leave ..could have stayed for a week ! Wonderful experience with the tasting menu in the Lady Helen Restaurant (wine pairing a definite recommendation) , great relaxed atmosphere, lovely breakfast, thoroughly enjoyed the meal at the Hound Restaurant also (desserts a must, they were fantastic) , managed to squeeze in a visit to Kilkenny before our spa treatments and swim. Left on Sunday truly refreshed. Very comfortable beds and very stylish decor in the rooms. Some really classy discreet touches make all the difference.",5,2018,11,07
239,Afternoon tea ! X 4,"What wonderful afternoon tea we had ‘ four adults one 4 Four yo  and one 5 wks! All well behaved. Adults included. It brought back memories of staying and eating at the house. Overlooking the river above the Lady Helen Restaurant where we dined, post prandial  in our magnificent surroundings",4,2018,11,04
239,Lovely Grounds and Manor House,"My husband and I spent one night in a river-view room in the Manor House. The property is lovely and has every possible amenity available: golf, horseback riding, fishing, falconry and a spa in the new separate section of the estate. 

The Manor House is a beautiful old home, quite large, with gracious public rooms including a bar and a restaurant.  Our room was on the top floor of the Manor; be advised, I don’t believe there are any lifts in the Manor House.  Our room was large and had a lovely view of the river and fields. 

We had a lovely afternoon tea. The food offered with tea was quite nice with a very nice assortment of savory and sweet selections. My only complaint was that the Manor tried to squeeze in a few too many people for tea- a large group of six sat behind us and were rather noisy. This was not, of course, the hotel’s fault, but I do think a manager might have nipped the situation in the bud when a guest was lugging a large additional chair over to the four top; one of the staff should have addressed the situation.

The reason the Manor House receives four stars rather than five is for two reasons: the bed and the bathroom. As always, if a hotel doesn’t have a good bed I automatically deduct a star. Alas the bed in a higher end room at Mt. Juliet’s Manor House was not very comfortable. This should not be the case. In addition, the bathroom, while adequate, was not particularly nice given the status of the property. Both the bed and the bathroom need a refresh or overhaul.

All in all, Mt. Juliet was a lovely property. I was, however, a bit disappointed by the room itself.",4,2018,11,04
239,Mount Juliet mid-term break,"Have just returned from a wonderful stay in Hunter's Yard with my mum, my 17 year old and 3 year old sons.  This was my first time in Mount Juliet with my children and it was perfect.  Rooms were beautiful and it was so relaxing that we didn't want to leave.  My youngest son was too young for the horse riding camp but the staff in the equestrian centre were so friendly, we spent a couple of hours there everyday with the horses and we were made feel so welcome everywhere we went.  I can't recommend it enough for a family break.  We would explore the grounds everyday and just enjoy the surroundings and the amenties especially the pool and sauna.   The food in the  Hound restaurant was super and I would like to specially mention Shaun who was so helpful and always there when we needed him, all the staff we met were fantastic.   I hope to return soon..",5,2018,11,01
239,Perfect hotel for winter break,Visited for a Christmas party and we stayed in lovely rooms in the main house. Very spacious room and comfortable beds. Lovely and clean and breakfast was a dream. Great selection from the menu and buffet also.,5,2018,10,25
239,Overnight stay near Kilkenny,"A fantastic spot to stay. The hotel is Located on a great golf course and with its own equestrian facilities. 
The welcome was warm and professional and the room well appointed and furnished. Comfortable bed too. Excellent. ",5,2018,10,25
239,Awful service and food,"Been here many times but last 3 visits were very disappointing. Restaurant service is appalling (no supervision, steaks undercooked, wine served mid way through mains etc). Menu is a little dull and food was just ...bland. Ordered room service on second night and it arrived an hour later - barely warm, wrapped in foil and they forgot dessert. 2 kids very ill that night having eaten the same thing? Response from management when we wrote to complain was very disappointing",1,2018,10,22
239,Excellent - Mount Juliet Hunters Yard,"I stayed at Mount Juliet Hunters Yard in October 2018 with my wife and felt compelled to write a review about our excellent experience. Our room was very modern, luxurious and clean. The food in The Hound was lovely and at a reasonable price point.The Hound restaurant also has an excellent setting. The spa treatments were enjoyable. I would recommend a cycle around the estate to see the river and the stud farm.  The bar in Mount Juliet Hunters Yard was an atmospheric place to have a drink. Cocktails in the main house were also a nice and different experience.The main house is beautiful in the classic sense of the word. The staff in Hunters Yard were excellent and couldn't have been anymore accommodating to us during our stay. A brilliant break and will recommend Mount Juliet Hunters Yard to family and friends.",5,2018,10,21
239,Perfect honeymoon spot!,"My new husband and I stayed here for 3 nights in October 2018, for our honeymoon(!!). We were so lucky to find this spot; I loved every moment here. Mount Juliet is stunning...beautiful grounds, lots of walking trails, all staff are so helpful and friendly. Staying here really does feel like you're going back in time and being treated like a Lord and Lady. We had a spacious, lovely corner room on the 3rd floor, with views over the beautiful and sweet River Nore. We aren't golfers, but there is still so much here for everyone. The breakfasts are delicious; we loved the horseback riding (such healthy, happy, well tended horses!), and Tommy is an awesome trail riding leader!! Thank you Tommy!); trail walking; breathtaking dining at the Michelin Star Lady Helen dining room for a honeymoon dinner splurge; and exploring nearby medieval city Kilkenny. One of the major highlights was the historical estate tour with Des. These are complimentary (unbelievable!!) and so worth the time - he is an amazing storyteller, and knows so much about the details of this estate. The history here is so fascinating, and it's a real treat to stay somewhere that honors and connects to this in such depth. We can't recommend taking this tour enough. Not many historical estate properties can also boast having a local historian on staff that will take time to connect you with the history of the buildings and land. There is a very positive history here loaded with good karma, and the people who lived and worked on this land were well cared for.  We found a real gem, and absolutely intend to come back.",5,2018,10,19
239,Excellent service and beautiful hotel at Mount Juliet,My wife and I visited Mount Juliet Estate for one night in October 2018.  The customer service was exceptional - I would highly recommend a stay at this estate and will return again.  We stayed in the Mount Juliet Estate - overlooking the River Noir and one of the nicest rooms we've ever stayed in.  Des at the front desk was incredible - thank you very much for a superb visit to your property.,5,2018,10,15
239,Romantic...but there is always one!,"Gorgeous place. Stayed at the manor house, staff were super helpful and welcoming. Fabulous view of the river having breakfast or afternoon tea. Just very quaint. The place as a whole could be described as romantic. Had dinner both evenings at the hunters... absolutely superb dining. Went for a horse ridng trail, we were brought out by a lovely girl called Orla... however there was one extremely RUDE member of staff at the horse stables. It was noted by myself and another couple that she spoke to the other stable staff very rudely in front of guests. As well as being rude to me!!! This was the only downer of an otherwise great experience.",5,2018,10,14
239,Exquisite,"I hemmed and hawed over choosing between a manor house or a hunters yard room - as the newly renovated HY rooms looked to be so nicely done. In the end I am very glad I chose the manor house for my first stay at Mount Juliet. I wanted the feel of staying in a grand old house and had just that. Yes, the decor is very classic, or some might say stuffy especially when compared to the more modern, fresh decor at HY; and there are imperfections or quirks that come with an older property - like maybe a slightly wobbly tile or the weirdness of having to pass through an outer door before getting to the access door for your room. But the overall feel is very grand and plush. I am also glad that I splurged on a river view room. Actually without the river view, I think its more of a toss up to save the money and stay at HY. Though the common areas of the manor house are special enough and by staying at HY you definitely would not have the ability to make much use of them. I’m sure you would be allowed access, it just wouldn’t be very convenient. The properties are about 5 minute walk apart. I did find myself going there in the evenings to enjoy the livelier atmosphere at The Hound and it’s bar. Lastly, I had a wonderful experience at the equestrian center - I was matched with a really terrific horse and had both a great lesson and beautiful ride around the property.  I found the staff all around the property extremely friendly and helpful- in typical Irish fashion they are not in your face - you have to speak up when you need something- but when you do they are very gracious.",5,2018,10,13
239,Everything we expected & more!,"From the breathtaking drive up the avenue we knew this weekend would be special. The service, the food and the attention to detail at this amazing hotel makes it stand out. As always though as beautiful and special any setting can be it is always the staff team that make a difference, the team at MJ offered the highest standards combined with a warm welcome. We can't wait to return ❤",5,2018,10,12
239,Blissful and Beautiful,Great service from staff on site. We ate in The Hound Resturaunt as Lady Helen’s was fully booked out. Food was delicious and service staff were accommodating and friendly. We had Yuvi a Joga instructor guide us through a private class of yoga and meditation. It was heaven.,4,2018,10,11
239,Golf & wedding,If your looking for a true 5 star experience look no further than the truly magnificent Mount juliet estate. Played golf here the day before i got married & played one of the finest championship golf course in Ireland. The newly refurbished hunters yard is a little hidden gem. We held our wedding function here & it didnt disappoint.. we cant thank the staff enough for taking the stress out of our big day & putting on an amazing show !! ,5,2018,10,10
239,"Top Class Stay, Friendly Staff",My wife and I had a very pleasant evening in Mount Juliet Estate. The food was delicious and the staff really added to our experience. They were helpful and very friendly. Before our meal in the restaurant we went to the bar and we were greeted by a very friendly member of staff (if i remember correctly her name was Ciara) who suggested activities and places we could visit in Kilkenny before serving me a lovely pint of Guinness! A young lady named Kelly took care of us in the restaurant and she was also very pleasant and professional. All in all we had a tremendous experience. Top class staff and food.,5,2018,10,10
239,Manor House - Excellent hotel.,My wife and I stayed in the Manor House for a few nights last week. It is an excellent hotel. Great service. Fabulous room - had a river view which was a very spacious room. Breakfast was very good with good choices. The estate is a great spot for strolling around. Very peaceful. It is expensive but worth a visit.,5,2018,10,09
239,Amazing Stay,"Everything about our stay was amazing, the room, service, food - could not have had a more enjoyable stay. We stayed in the hunters yard and wish we could have stayed longer! Kilkenny is a short distance away and such a beautiful city.",5,2018,10,06
239,Wedding gift,"We were lucky enough to be given a gift of a voucher for Mount Juliet as a wedding present. And so we used it this week. We stayed in Hunters Yard and had a beautiful room. I had dealt with a lovely lady on the phone Laura and she was so kind, nothing was a problem. We were welcomed by a lovely young lady on arrival and then we continued on to use the spa facilities. Both my husband and I had treatments, which we both thoroughly enjoyed. However the only one flaw I had with the whole place was there wasn’t a tranquility suite for after the treatments. We enjoyed a 3 course meal in The Hound and we loved every bit of the food. We met a lovely girl in the swimming pool who was so lovely. She was welcoming and went out of her way to be kind to us. Breakfast was tasty with a nice selection of foods. Thank you for keeping our honeymoon going Mount Juliet.... it was wonderful",5,2018,10,05
239,I never wanted to leave. ,"We planned our stay here as we wanted to see where close friends of ours had eloped a couple of years ago, and we weren’t disappointed. From the free room upgrade on arrival, the beautiful grounds, delicious breakfast and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on, our stay at Mount Juliet was perfect. I only wish it wasn’t on the other side of the world as I would love to visit again soon! ",5,2018,10,05
239,"Poor food, poor hospitality","Travelled here last Sunday as I  wanted to treat my partner to a nice dinner. We arrived just before 3:30pm and ordered our food. The lady waiting on us seemed as if she didn't want to be there at all. Food arrived about 20 minutes later. We were shocked when we saw what had been given to us on our plates. I ordered seabass and all I can say is the piece of fish that was served to me wouldn't feed a cat! My partner wanted to leave straight away but I decided to see the meal through. We asked would we be served any vegetables (or anything at all) other than the piece of meat that was on our plates. The lady said they generally didnt give portions of veg with the meals but she would check for us. She came out with a sugar bowl sized portion of veg that barely fed me, my partner had to do without. In total we were charged €32.50 for being served two pieces of meat and a further €3.50 for the veg we were given! The table across from us tried to order dessert at 4pm after eating their meal to be told the chefs leave the kitchen at 4pm so they could not order desserts. Closing at 4pm was never mentioned to anyone being served before that time. All in all the curt reception we received from the lady when we were paying along with the entire meal experience would put you off this place altogether. It is safe to say I will not be returning again nor will I be recommending this place to any of my friends.",1,2018,10,03
239,Very pleasant,"Beautiful place to stay, so relaxing and excellent facilities. The room we stayed in was very modern and really comfortable, beautiful decor. The food was excellent both in the evening and for breakfast. Will definitely be back.",5,2018,10,02
239,Wonderful afternoon tea ,"Had a wonderful afternoon tea here. The staff were friendly and helpful, the food was delicious and the ground incredible. We were kindly allowed to use the bicycles to roam the estate which was brilliant. I would wholly recommend this to anyone!",5,2018,10,02
239,Hunters Yard Experience,"Spent two nights here with my two sons in high season. The rooms in Hunter's Yard are very modern and tastefully done and quite luxurious, actually. The grounds are beautiful and I took a magical walk at twilight toward the manor house and around the back toward the stud farm. What keeps it from being an excellent rating is the service at the Hound which was our only option for dinner really since we didn't have a car (long story, I had to give back my rental car) and my children didn't want to go to a Michelin star restaurant (not that they had a table anyway on such short notice) and we didn't want to eat in the clubhouse yet again with it's limited menu and I didn't feel like asking a taxi to drive me into town. Ugh! Half the restaurant was empty but each time they made me wait an hour for a table and those tables were never filled so they weren't keeping it for reservations. And then once sat, the service was soooo slow, I nearly pounced at the waiter or waitress to sign the check before even getting my food so that I wouldn't be sitting in the restaurant until my children fell asleep. The service at the clubhouse restaurant was slightly better but only slightly. That and I was really looking forward to going riding on the estate but the beginner ride only took us around the manor house instead of another route that would have shown us more of the estate, that was a little disappointing. The falconry experience however was really great. My children loved that. I realized when my taxi driver who drove me to the estate said Mount Juliet is known for being the best golf course in Ireland that if one is not playing golf, one misses out on a really big aspect of staying there so maybe I missed out on seeing the best facet of the place.",4,2018,10,01
239,Very enjoyable stay,"We recently stayed at mount Juliet for a few days and our accommodation was in the newly built hunters yard.   Our room was lovely, very comfortable bed and everything was to the highest standard.  Lovely bathroom.  The housekeeping staff were very friendly and pleasant.

I had a few treatments in the spa which were excellent.   I would like to thank Valerie the spa manager and her therapists once again for helping me to have a relaxing time.

We would also like to thank Des the estate host and Ciara at the hunters yard reception for their welcome and the commitment they made to ensure that we had an enjoyable stay.    We have been loyal guests of mount Juliet for the past 18 years, visiting sometimes twice or three times a year, and we hope that this will continue to be the case.   

My partner played a very enjoyable game of golf and thanks also to Pamela at the golf club for her assistance with this.",5,2018,09,30
239,Great deal,We spent a night at Hunters Yard as part of a deal which included B&B and a round of golf.  We were very happy with our room which we found extremely comfortable with a luxurious bathroom.  The only complaint would be that the toiletries were on the stingy side. One tiny bottle of shower gel is not enough for two people!  Breakfast was self service but very good.  We treated ourselves to dinner in the Lady Helen restaurant and we were not disappointed.  A nice touch was the courtesy car to drive us the very short distance from Hunters Yard to the Manor House.  The golf course was excellent and a walk in the hotel grounds is highly recommended.,4,2018,09,20
239,"The Hunters Yard. Views superb,drinks off the scale expensive.","Check in is at 4 pm, we arrived early, but had a few drinks on the terrace overlooking golf course, receptionist said she would come and find us when it was ready, 5 o clock came,  i then  went to reception, the lady had gone.......... As we walked in the room , a lovely bottle of red and an open double door view, nice. (poor show from front of house)
The golf course according to the hubby is just fantastic, its great to see the young kids joining over the summer, also the lady opened up early for the hubby and was extremely nice to him in the golf shop.
The food was very tasty , steak and veg very nice indeed, fresh produce on site, a wine is € 9.10 for a glass , which i thought was a very hairy price.
Breakfast was also fresh and tasty.
Staff are friendly  but some are perhaps a bit bloody miserable looking.
The place is decorated beautifully but i did get lost a few times on the landings.
Overall a luxurious place to stay and beautiful views.",5,2018,09,18
239,Hunters yard nice hotel poor staff,The newly refurbished hunters yard is really nice. We got a deal on escapes so we had a room with evening dinner and breakfast. When we arrived the staff on reception did not know how to process the voucher which delayed check in. Also this resulted in a bad experience at check out where they tried to overcharge by €200. The receptionist didn’t have a clue which resulted in a 40 min wait for a manager to arrive. This experience ruined the break as the receptionist was very rude demanding we pay someone else’s bill. When he realised his mistake he barely apologised. There seems to be a lot of young staff who haven’t a clue. In the restaurant the older staff were very good but most of the staff seemed new and did everything possible to avoid having to serve customers. All they wanted to do was keep head down and clear tables. At breakfast no one sat us to a table. Then no one offered us tea or coffee. The food is self service but you can’t get your own tea or coffee. The hotel rooms and decor are good but service really poor. Probably won’t go back.,2,2018,09,17
239,Great night away,"This was our second visit to the hotel we had stayed in Manor house previously this time were in hunters yard. Hotel was nice room was good. TV was very modern had chromecast so we could watch netflix. Lady Helen restaurant was closed on Sunday which was disappointing. We ate in other hotel restaurant which was very good see pictures attached. Afternoon tea in manor house was star of the show so it os a must do.

Staff friendly and informative.

I will return to this hotel

239,Beautiful Hotel with fun employees,"Stayed here for a business meeting. The large meeting room overlooked the golf course and it’s good for meeting as it has large windows and natural light. 

The ladies at the gym are so fun and nice to talk to. One of the blonde ladies at the reception with a beige uniform was however not engaging with her customers unlike her colleagues . She does not smile or talk to her guest. 

There was a gentleman at the reception and both he and Housekeeping lady deserves my utmost praises. They love their jobs and their guests. I thought one of my dress was not returned to me but after I left I realised that it was at the bottom of my luggage. My sincere apologies to both of them. They did not accuse me or made me feel like “hello these are all you sent”. Please retain good people like them as they are a gem.

I will recommend walking around the estate as it’s beautiful and peaceful. Rooms on the higher floor and facing the gardens will be my choice as they are quieter and have great views.

239,"Average, without living up to its expensive billing","Pros: Outstanding location, modern but elegant luxury with a great golf course

BUT the cons: €100 tee times catering squarely at the American market is ridiculous, €9 glasses of wine is again cheeky, staff at restaurant at Hunters Yard did their absolute best under intense pressure - simply not enough staff at all on the two nights we dined, they were running around for hours we felt so bad for them, things like forgetting to take a wine order etc can't happen in a place like this surely?

You get the feeling it isn't a 5-star service level. Nice, average but not great in 2018.",3,2018,09,14
239,Give Mount Juliet a miss....there are plenty other hotels who will appreciate your business a lot more.,"The staff /customer service completely let this hotel down, as mentioned in plenty other reviews here. There are many more equally nice hotels in Kilkenny that have proper customer services standards in place. We highlighted our concerns on checkout and were assure of a follow up phone call....nothing. I emailed last week to outline to poor service which included confusion about our booking at every turn- check in, lunch, dinner, check out- again nothing. I resent the email last night.....but it really just highlights even more the issues we had around the way guests are treated here. Kilkenny is a fabulous city with many more hotels who will appreciate your business.... give Mount Juliet a miss.",2,2018,09,11
239,Good stay without being great,Had a night in the hotel with dinner and breakfast recently.  Everything was pretty good without quite being excellent. My wife had the cod for dinner which was great. My pork chop was a bit dry.  Cheeseboard was good.  Bed was good as was the room in general. Breakfast was ok. Scrambled eggs was not great (too sloppy) and toast took too long even with a fairly small number eating.   Enjoyable stay but just not quite as good as I was expecting. ,4,2018,09,09
239,Great stay at Mount Juliet,"We stayed 1 night at Mount Juliet this month, the staff and resort was just amazing.

We stayed in the Hunters Yard and eat in The Hound on a busy Sunday night. 

Our arrival and check in was very friendly, efficient and fast. We were accompanied to our room and explained the resort, the layout of the room and he even got us intrigued about the Major’s Bar and the Michelin starred Lady Helen’s restaurant in the Manor House. Our room itself was quiet, felt secure and had everything you’d need. The bed and bedding was first class and very comfortable allowing you to sink into it.

The bathroom was special too with under floor heating to ensure your feet stay warm, good lighting and a bath and shower area. 

We had dinner in The Hound and the food was really delicious with local products and great product by our servers, Kellie was great at explaining the dishes and nothing was any problem for her. The views are very special and again the speed of service was amazingly quick. We had desserts as they sounded so appetizing and they did not disappoint, the white chocolate dessert and the chocolate with raspberries were everything you’d want in a dessert, no words really can do them justice. 

We had breakfast on the day of departure and were greeted by Des, the Guest Relations Manager. He seemed to be everywhere in the resort, he was always smiling and couldn’t do enough for us and every table having breakfast. Although breakfast was busy, it didn’t feel like it. The breakfast items were delicious and the coffee was just what was needed.

We sneaked into the function room to see a full pre-wedding setting up, the time and care the staff were taking really showed how much they cared. 

Checkout went smoothly without any hassle and we wished we’d booked another night away and promised ourselves that we’d return soon. 

",5,2018,08,29
239,Wonderful,"Absolutely loved everything about Mount Juliet. Our room in Hunters Yard was exactly what I had hoped for - comfortable, clean, beautiful linens and comfy beds.
The staff were extremely friendly and welcoming - nothing was too much trouble - we’ll be back for sure.",5,2018,08,28
239,Wonderful and fantastic  staff,I stayed with my extended family for a 2 night stay in mid July. From the beginning our stay was wonderful. The staff were outstanding at all times especially attending the needs of elderly parents. The accomodation in Hunters yard is superb and the food exemplary in the restaurant. I thouroghly enjoyed cycling around the beautiful grounds. I look to returning to this beautiful location in the future. ,5,2018,08,26
239,Wonderful Hunters Yard Stay,We have just returned from a three night stay at Hunters Yard and I would have no hesitation in recommending this beautiful hotel to other families. Understated elegance and wonderful customer service. In particular I would highlight The Hound Restaurant which catered excellently for my 11 year old son who is coeliac. Gluten free food was readily available and the staff had a superb understanding of allergies which after so many negative hotel experiences was so appreciated.,5,2018,08,25
239,Elegant Manor,"We stayed for 2 nights in the Manor House.  The setting and the grounds of the house are beautiful and we took advantage of the property as well as the adjoining stud farm for long walks.  Our room was clean, comfortable, decorated beautifully and very quiet. We heard no noise from the hallway when we were in our room.   We did not eat in the restaurants but did have a daily night cap and found both the bar at the clubhouse and the Manor house and found that staff as well as the staff in the Manor house to be friendly and attentive.",5,2018,08,24
239,Stay & Play Caution,"Stayed 21/08/18. We had booked a stay and play with dinner. However when we arrived, the restaurant was fully booked, despite the booking clearly including dinner. Our meal was transferred to the golf club bar, where menu is significantly more limited and lower cost. When we brought to the attention of management when checking out, they even charged for the bottle of wine in golf club as an extra. Disappointing service. Otherwise room was excellent and golf course top class as usual",2,2018,08,23
239,Amazing,"We had a wonderful stay here, it's a magnificent setting with an absolutely amazing staff. The best of Irish hospitality and quality, food was top class and really helpful service and advice. I recommmed everything about Mount Juliet",5,2018,08,22
239,Average quality ,Stayed in the manor house. Couldn't check in until 4ish. If we hadn't a spa booked at 2 to attend I would have been annoyed. Our bags were brought up to the room and when we went it we discovered someone else's bag had also been left with ours. Had to call reception to report. Room is very old fashioned and white grubby. Cleaned away about 3 spiders during the stay. Chairs had stains on them. Bed was comfy. The breakfast in the morning was the best part of the hotel. Delicious made to order pancakes and Irish breakfast. Staff very friendly too. Went for dinner at the hound. When finished had requested the taxi to bring us back to the manor which is complimentry. Was told it would be 5 minutes. 20 minutes later in the cold outside still no sign. Also notice the wedding party that left their empty glasses outside weren't cleaned up. Could be dangerous if any small children were about. ,3,2018,08,22
239,Awful service,When we arrived at the restaurant we had to seat ourselves! After 20 minuets of waiting for someone to come and give us menus my aunty has to go up herself and get them! Baring in mind there where 7 of us..sat another ten minutes still no one had come to ask us if we even wanted drinks. Another group came in and they were looked after straight away so much so my aunty had to go up and get the waitresses attention and when she did come to serve us was very cold and rude almost like she hadn’t got the patience for us! Second time it’s happened so never ever again!,1,2018,08,21
239,Business conference in the Hunters Yard,"My expectations were not fulfilled. Mount Juliet has a reputation which in the main is probably deserved.
However a few things left me wondering.
On a positive note... the facility itself is fine ... very nicely appointed bedrooms ... friendly and nice atmosphere in the bar of the Hunters .... loverly dinner in the Hunters Restaurant on my second night ... really nice parkland for walking and golf ... porter service was very helpful and always available.
Areas for improvement ... had to wait almost 15 minutes to check in on arrival ... while directions were provided to my room , there was no offer of help with my luggage ( not that I needed help , it just wasn't offered). Dinner was not available on the first night in the restaurant which apparently was amazingly busy and I was dispatched to the Golf Club Bar ... it was okay but it was only ""bar food""... service thereiin was somewhat tardy.",3,2018,08,20
239,Lovely stay in luxury let down by poor customer service response to awful room service meal,"Three gorgeous nights in a lovely superior room with a fabulous view over the parklands - the paddocks with their resident beautiful mares and foals raised the spirits every time we sat in the cushioned window seat and looked out. 

Food in the golf course venue one evening was better than the venue might have suggested - hake steak and a delicious pate starter were all excellent but our plan to eat in the Michelin star Lady Helen restaurant were foiled when without notice we were told that the restraunt was closed Wednesday because it has opened on the bank holiday Monday that week. Ok not a disaster but a disappointment and perhaps an email or a word on checking in might have meant we would have eaten there our second night - anyway we settled for room service and that was our big mistake - a simple order or fish of the day with fries arrived promptly but oh dear on cutting into one dish the hake was jelly it was so undercut - my companion who was my host for the three day break refused to complain that evening in case it spoiled our night but she could not eat hers, I ate mine and it was cooked as one would expect. 
We thoroughly enjoyed the  beautiful walks in the grounds and across the River Nore where we rambled after scrumptious breakfasts each morning - staff were very attentive and really breakfasts were the best meals we had. 
On departure I left my host to pay and speak to the receptionist about the disastrous dinner the previous evening - she apologised profusely and said she would bring it to the managers attention. that was it - no ‘I’ll take that off the bill,apologies’ or some other small gesture of true contrition 
To be honest it spoiled my thorough enjoyment of what had been three days of luxury in a top resort - I wasn’t paying but I know the bill was well in excess of 1k euro - would love to say we will be back but the poor management of a complaint has tainted the visit and did the manager ever ‘get back to us about the complaint’ No and I’ve given them a week to do so before posting this review.",4,2018,08,19
239,Willows Golf Society Captains day,"What a place. We had 28 lads play golf and had a 3 course dinner stayed overnight and had a wonderful breakfast. We could not recommend this hotel any higher, the staff, food and facilities were second to none. From Michael in the Pro Shop to the girls on reception the paying of the bills was painless and exceptional value. The bars are also excellent with late night drink if desired. Highly recommended both for couples and Golf Societies, if you don’t try it you won’t know what you are missing. ",5,2018,08,18
239,Beautiful,"We stated here for a night in the Manor House. The room was really beautiful, classically appointed with period features you'd expect to find in a house like this. The bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in in any hotel.
We had dinner in the Lady Helen restaurant which has a Michelin Star. I'm no foodie and not a critic. Overall the meal was tremendous and worth every penny. The staff and the service were incredible and I really enjoyed it. Dinner is a big deal here so allow lots of time. We sat down for 8pm  and really we should have booked for 7pm instead.
The gardens around the hotel are",5,2018,08,18
239,Beautiful house and grounds,"We stayed at the main house for two nights in July.  In my opinion it would not be as special an experience staying in the Hunters Yard rooms without the historical atmosphere of the main house, which is spectacular.  Having said that, I regretted not booking one of the more expensive rooms with views of the grounds.  We were led up back stairs to the servants’ quarters - still a beautiful room and bathroom, but overlooking a small garden and next to a delivery area for the hotel which resulted in understandable noise early in the morning.  Our friends had the room mentioned in an earlier review with no view at all, but access to an outside seating area behind a high parapet.  Also, no-one could help the unusually warm weather, but there is no air conditioning which made for warm nights.  However, we slept with the large windows and curtains  open and weren’t bothered by any insects - an unexpected bonus!

A couple of maintenance niggles.  I had to ask for a light bulb to be replaced in the bathroom (which it was) and for the extractor fan to be fixed in the windowless bathroom (which it wasn’t).

The Lady Helen restaurant is extremely good, and I would highly recommend.

Worth booking activities in advance.  We wanted to try the Hawk Walk but it was fully booked our two days.

All in all a good experience which I could have improved still further by spending more on the rooms.",4,2018,08,15
239,Hunters Yard Hotel,"Hunters Yard has had a huge refurbishment recently and added bedrooms to increase capacity down on the magnificent Mount Juliet estate. We were a group of 6 staying for one night and it was such a lovely treat. We drank cocktails on the terrace before dinner looking out over the golf course which really helped us unwind. The dinner itself was flawless. Ken Harker's food is innovative and flavored to perfection, a must if you are in the Kilkenny area!",5,2018,08,15
239,The Best Hotel in Ireland,"I LOVED Mount Juliet. My only regret was not staying longer. Everything from the service to the afternoon tea was simply amazing. Jaime who checked us in was so helpful and kind we couldn't have asked for better service from the Mount Juliet staff. They gave us a tour of the property and drove us between the Hunter's Yard and the main building whenever we wanted.

I definitely recommend staying more than one night because they have so many activities and there is plenty to explore in Kilkenny. We spent hours just walking through the gardens and petting the horses. 

The highlight of our trip was enjoying a fabulous high tea at the main house. We felt like royalty and all of the snacks and desserts are made from scratch. 10/10 would recommend this place and I hope to stay again if I visit Ireland",5,2018,08,14
239,John and Margaret,A1...loved this hotel.  Highly recommend... beautiful .. well maintained.. brilliant helpful staff.  Loved the horse theme ..food. /breakfast. Tasty .. delicious..will crrtaybook in again eggnog we’re back in Ireland....,5,2018,08,14
239,Great stay,"Stayed here with family,relaxing place,some great walks around the estate that takes you away from the hotel area,a really big thank you to Dan in the fishing department,I contacted him through the hotel and he couldn’t do enough for me to get me fishing on the beutiful River Nore,he even took me on a tour of the river and got me some flies in his local tackle shop and drop them to me,thanks for going above and beyond and I really enjoyed the trip on the estate river (hope you catch that big trout under the trees) 
Over all a very enjoyable experience with smiling happy staff,
Thank you mount juliet and we will certainly be back",5,2018,08,14
239,Pottery tour,"We visited Mount Juliet on our way back to Dublin after a day visiting pottery houses.

We had a lovely walk around the grounds as it was a beautiful sunny day and they are just fabulous.

We weren't there for golf just to have our dinner which we had in the main house.

We were delighted with the restaurant ..We had a window seat so our dinner was accompanied by the spectacular  views.

The menu was varied with many local foods  we enjoyed steak and fish local black pudding and all were delicious.
The service was excellent and we were made to feel very welcome.
It was just what we needed after a long but great day and it set us up well for our trip back to Dublin.",5,2018,08,07
239,Wonderful place to stay in Ireland.,"Our first night in Ireland was spent at Mt. Juliet, an elegant Irish country inn. Grounds are beautiful with flowering shrubs, green grass. From our bedroom window which had pink roses blooming at one side, we could see thoroughbred mares and foals grazing in a pasture across the River Nar. Dining room was excellent: white table cloths, gleaming stemware, and a choice of buffet items as well as ordering from the menu. We came upon fairy gardens when we walked on paths around the grounds. Lovely. We toured the BallyLynch Stud Farm near to Mt. Juliet.",5,2018,08,06
239,Relaxing Break,"I booked a golf break as a birthday present for my husband and a bit of relaxation for myself too. Unfortunately shortly before our break my husband became ill and had to be admitted to hospital.
 I telephoned the hotel and the reception staff were so understanding and agreed to change the date without any charge,I found  the staff  were more than accommodating and were very understanding. I don't think in this day and age I would be looked after if this happened in another chain of Hotels or in the UK for that matter. Thank you all for you help.
I had booked a 4 night break in a river view room in the Manor House. The staff put a package together for me with 1 night dinner in Lady Helen Michelin star restaurant and 2 rounds of golf.
We enjoyed our break so much, it was just what the doctor ordered!
The staff were so helpful and friendly. The breakfast staff went over and above with their hospitality and kindness. The breakfast was cooked to order every day.
Our room number 20 overlooked the paddock which was very pleasant to watch the horses and their fowls play and graze.
We enjoyed the delightful food in the Lady Helen restaurant, we have eaten in Michelin star restaurants in the past but we found the amount of food we were served here  were big portions but we are not complaining, the food was delicious and presented very well.          
My husband enjoyed the golf, the greens were in perfect condition.
We had a dinner booked the Hunters Yard, we did not return it was below acceptable with service and food quality. I will submit another review later.
We would certainly recommend the Mount Juliet Manor without hesitation, in my opinion book an executive Riverside  room if you can.",5,2018,08,01
239,Underwhelmed. ,"We stayed for one night in the Manor House. The grounds and house are beautiful and our room was nice not sure the price of the room was warranted. We had a lovely treatment in the spa although the spa wasn’t as grand as I expected. The relaxation room was just a cramped heated waiting room with music and some old couches/ day beds with tatty covers. You wouldn’t sit back and rest there after a treatment. The treatment rooms themselves again were lacklustre. No lovely smelling candles and dimly lit rooms. Now I know why there’s no pictures online! The spa staff however were great. In the Manor House we asked for additional pillows (non hypo allergenic) when we reached our room around 5pm as we both like to sleep with 2 each. When we returned at 9pm there was no sign so we called reception again. Just before 10pm we got a call from housekeeping to say they searched the estate and there was no additional pillows to be found.... laughable really, especially as there is pillow menu - just dial 0!!  So we went to bed with one pillow each - a flat hypoallergenic one. 

We had just come from an amazing 5 star stay at the four star Castle Durrow up the road and it outshone Mount Juliet on every aspect. ",3,2018,07,31
239,Birthday weekend,"Very nice estate.beautiful grounds.

We were fortunate enough to stay on a very warm weekend, so the weather was perfect, which absolutely complimented the place..

Apart from having no a/c in our room.

Staff very nice, although forgetful at times.

Dinner in lady helen was very good, clean flavours, precise cooking. 

All delicious.

The service however, fell slightly short. One example being that the petit fours were not introduced to us, another being that our iced americanos were sickeningly sweet and had to be returned, as we did not want any sugar.

Afternoon tea was average enough. Sandwiches were very nice. Some of the sweets werent great. Especially there was a small, rectangular, plain cake, crusty on the outside and a bit dry to be honest.

Again the staff fell short, our actual tea arrived about 5 minutes after the food.

I dont feel that the breakfast buffet was befitting of a 5 star hotel.  poor choice and underwhelming pastries.

If you want an amazing 5 star hotel breakfast, try the cliff house in armore. You wont get better.

All in all, a beautiful spot.

Perhaps  bordering a little on the 'too' expensive",4,2018,07,31
239,Holiday in a Weekend,"We had the weekend of our lives here. Staff are amazing, the setting is pue magic and the room was gorgeous. It was so relaxing and recharging! We swam, ate, lounged, walked, chilled. Cannot wait to get back. On saturday night we ate in the Lady Helen restaurant which was the best meal we have ever eaten. 

",5,2018,07,27
239,Brilliant stay.,"I was extremely impressed with the overall hospitality of Mount Juliet. Apart from the stunning grounds and impressive refurbishments, the staff and service was second to none. 
The housekeeping staff in Hunter’s yard were phenomenal, always so friendly and kept the public area and our room utterly spotless. 
Claire from reservations helped to make sure that we would be well looked after and her colleagues Paddy Kelly, Paidí and Stephen did not fall shy of providing this for us. Each of these guys working at reception were adequately friendly, sincere and, of course, helpful. I would have loved to have left each of them a tip had I any cash as I believe they deserve to be rewarded for their efficiency. 
We had a thoroughly fantastic and enjoyable stay and will be sure to be back.",5,2018,07,25
239,Relaxing stay at country side ,"Stayed there for a couple of nights and it was lovely. I enjoyed the walk to the river and the view to the country side. The room itself is rather basic but the environment is very relaxing. Staffs mentioned about golf course but we didn't bring our golf club. Perhaps this is for future trip. Tried the spa, it was okay although the massage bed was a little awkward. But other than that the treatment was okay. I enjoyed the Irish breakfast with white pudding, sausages, and good tea. Overall, it was a pleasant experience. 
Happy to come back in the future.  ",4,2018,07,20
239,What a Gem in the heart of Ireland,"This is a truely amazing resort. There is not one thing i can fault from the Staff to the property to the amazing food we had in Hunters resturant. You are made feel so welcome and the staff really try to provide a great experience for every guest.

Both myself and wife are looking forward to returning in the near future. A Gem in the heart of Ireland....",5,2018,07,20
239,Amazing  hotel,"Having spent three nights there last weekend celebrating my 60th birthday with family and friends, words fail me. We had the most wonderful time in Mount Juliet. Claire Brennan in reservations was fabulous in helping me to arrange this trip. The Lady Helen restaurant has to be experienced to be believed. The guest rooms in the Hunters Yard which were recently refurbished were beautiful, warm and welcoming and furnished to an exceptional standard which can only be described as 'under stated elegance.' Tip: try the archery, the craic was brilliant. We all look forward to a return visit. A huge thank you to all the wonderful staff, the front of house staff could not have been better, Seamus and Des deserve a mention. My son and granddaughter had a fabulous time while horse riding. A perfect hotel for a wonderful trip.",5,2018,07,18
239,Amazing,"Came here for a girly weekend with 4 friends. Used the spa which was fab, had a facial and back massage and was totally relaxed after it!!
We had dinner in Hunter's yard restaurant and everything was delicious!!
Breakfast the next morning was also delicious. 
The rooms were so beautiful. 
We strolled around the grounds the next morning and everything is just kept so well. 
Could not recommend this place enough, definitely worth the money for a special getaway!!",5,2018,07,18
239,Attention in every detail,"We Stayed in the Hunters Yard which has rooms on 3 levels facing out onto two separate courtyards. 
5* for about every element. The rooms were so comfortable. Coffee machine, water in the fridge, quiet air con. 2 v comfy double beds. The pool was just a floor up and the restaurant was on the side of the yard overlooking the (kick-a**!) driving range. 
Service from checkin staff to dining room staff (breakfast) was top notch. You ask and you get - no faffing 'let me ask someone about that' involved.

The estate itself is immaculate and vast. Tons to see and places to venture. No pretentions but golfers do abound but you may not see much of them past breakfast...
I DID play golf and it was great but was here principally on a family break. There were quite a few of us so our kids had things to do but it might be a break more for couples.",5,2018,07,12
239,Wow - why is this not 5*,"In a word - wow! Mount Juliet is one of the most spectacular places we have stayed. It’s hard to know where to start. 

Staff are superb - friendly, professional, helpful and fun. This is the perfect combination. 

Food is amazing - we dined in the restaurant for an evening meal. It was delicious. Breakfast was equally as good. 

Guestrooms - we stayed in Hunters Lodge rooms. They have all been renovated and have been impeccably furnished. Comfortable, lots of amenities and really spacious. The bed was so comfortable!

Swimming Pool - really nice. Great staff in Leisure Club. Only downfall was no jacuzzi. 

Resort - stunning. Beautiful walks, endless onsite activities at really good value (for example one hour horse riding is €40 which is outstanding value). 

Golf - unfortunately not allowed by better half to play as we were only there for 1 night!! The course looked immaculate. 

Overall, an incredible stay. Congratulations to the management and staff. You are doing a superb job. We have stayed in many 5* hotels that are far inferior. Keep up the great work. We’ve already booked a return visit!",5,2018,07,10
239,Such a treat,"Can't say enough good things about this place. Great staff. Loved the rooms and the grounds. Stayed in the Hunters Yard portion of the resort that was recently built. It made absolutely zero difference from staying in the in the ""main building"". This distinction is overdone in my mind. It's all part of the same complex and they are so close together. 

There are some fantastic walks around the horse fields. Seeing the new foals was a treat. Would have enjoyed a longer stay.

We did a day-trip to Killkenny, which is a very reasonable drive from the resort.

The weather was exceptionally hot for Ireland (32C!) and the rooms were ice cold! The common areas were very, very hot. Unfortunately, they did not invest in cooling systems for those areas. The employees were sweltering in the hallways.

Beds were great and bathrooms were all new and in great shape. The design of the shower area leaves part of it open allowing water to pool on the floor and hit the wall. We used extra towels to mop up the floor after each shower. My guess is the wall and wood trim is going to end up rotting in most of the rooms in time. That area should be watertight and tiled if it will always be hit with shower water.

Breakfast was fantastic. Great selection.

We also tried the snooker room, which was a really interesting experience. The room is in the basement of the main house, and it seems like it has been forgotten for such a high-end resort. The table felt was fine. There was no chalk for the cue sticks. The bridge is missing pieces.That should all be addressed.

The room is stuffed with chairs in a helter-skelter manner, making it feel more like a storage area than a nice billiards room. The dart board is missing from the wall.

The framed pictures that were once on the walls, are in a pile in leaning against the wall. One of them is a framed photograph from the 2002 American Express Golf Championship that was held at the golf course there. The glass is broken on the frame. It looks like someone broke the glass to steal one of the signed scorecards from the champion, Tiger Woods, that are attached to the picture. There is one missing and are three are remaining. I'd appreciate it if the hotel would send me one of those cards if they aren't even going to display them! I would have it displayed prominently in my home!",5,2018,07,10
239,birthday treat,Myself and 3 of my friends enjoyed a wonderful afternoon in mount Juliet last Saturday.  The afternoon tea was delightful.   The staff catered for our different tastes and they were so helpful and attentive.   It was such a wonderful afternoon where we could relax and were not under any pressure to leave.   Joan,5,2018,07,09
239,Golf break,"We had a lovely room in hunters yard . First morning really lovely breakfast where we were offered a menu and looked after by very attentive young girl. She couldn't do enough for us.  I was really impressed. Fish, waffles and cooked breakfast brought to table. Next morning when we went to breakfast totally different experience. No menu,no service, no fish available.  buffet eggs and bacon etc which looked like it had been cooked hours previously. Awful. No staff and the one girl on duty did not want to be there. I was so disappointed. It was a total rip off. Can't understand why standard of service can't be like the first morning. Would love to know. Don't think I will return.",3,2018,07,09
239,very helpful staff,"view out our rose covered window of a river, cows and stud farm was idyllic- great place to unwind after a day in town- staff was very helpful! we visited during an unusual heat wave- but they gave us 2 fans and room was comfortable at night",5,2018,07,07
239,Very high price for Average everything...,"Nice stay but nothing out of the ordinary except the price!
Breakfast was nice but have had better in B& B's ... Dinner was a bit fussy but nothing to write home about ... Grounds and staff were nice but would not see us going back anytime soon .. Enjoyed the stay but two night B&B for 2 with one evening dinner came to over €800 ... no thanks...",3,2018,07,05
239,Dined at room off Hunters  Yard.,"Not sure about this venue. Tables reserved  on arrival and few people there. Food menu very poor. Felt staff in attendance were helpful. Had called over to Hunters Yard and told a party of 30 were booked so could not take us for dinner at 7:30 pm. No manager on duty. Place was fairly empty. We do eat here regularly and felt young waitress a bit laissez faire. Who turns down business in these times ? Back to menu in other venue steak sandwich stringy, fries overdone. My wife unsure about couscous with chicken skewers. Was it more bulgar wheat!!!!. Not 5 star.",2,2018,07,04
239,Simply Stunning - Staff are Amazing,"While the Hunters Lodge rooms where beautiful and the golf fantastic, the most memorable thing about Mount Juliet is their staff. Never in Ireland have I come across more pleasant, helpful and cheerful staff. They completely made our trip. Nothing was too much bother for them, from early lunches, to lifts to the Lady Helen Restaurant, which was fab.  I would especially like to mention Caitriona O'Mahony, who was just amazing. Anything we needed she got with a smile, a more professional and warming person I have not come across in hotels in Ireland. She was a joy to deal with and made our stay - exceptional. We will definitely be returning.",5,2018,07,02
239,Nice but not fantastic,"This hotel is nice,the refurbishment is beautiful but I essentially blown away by the hotel,the staff are not overly nice and I am talking about management here not cleaning staff or wait staff who were so sweet and mannerly,the dinner was standard.the hotel pool leaves a lot to be desired,it really brings down the hotel a lot,it’s grubby and dirty,the room made up for it,the beds are amazing and the room is just lovely,would not come back here,giving it a 4 star as not bringing down the rating just because I was not satisfied",4,2018,07,01
239,Picturesque and relaxing,"We recently stayed at the Manor House for a short “mini-moon”, the staff could not have been helpful and friendly. When we checked in we were greeted by a chap called Stephen, he was only on his 4th day at the hotel, he was professional a touch nervy, which is understandable, but he went out of his way to look after us. This included allowing me to use the reception computer. Thank you Stephen you were brilliant.

We decided to leave the hotel a day early as my new wife wanted to visit our favourite hotel, which is also part of the hotel chain. There was a lively lady at reception whom helped me make the booking at the new hotel as well as helping with the spa appointment etc. I think the ladies name was Emma. Thank you for your help and professionalism.

The restaurant “the lady Helen” was brilliant, we had the 7 course taster menu and I can only say that it was nothing short of brilliant, if you have an conservative but slightly adventurous pallet you will live it! 

The room was facing the stunning stud farm and river, I think it’s called river nore. It is a stunning example of period luxury, one negative is that due to the age of the Manor House there is no air con, however the staff were swift to ensure that a conventional fan was provided. Having said this it is not uncommon for houses/ hotels of this period to not have a A/C which is purely due to the age of the building etc.

The room service was just as good as the restaurant and was a welcomed pig out in the room. 

The golf course is a stunning example and if one is into golf, you will appreciate that it is the only jack Nicholas signature course in Ireland! Don’t miss out!!!

Thank you to the staff for everything you made it a very special mini-moon!!!",5,2018,07,01
239,Countryside beauty overshadows service hiccups,"The Mount Juliet Estate is set in the most marvellous countryside of trees and fields where thoroughbred horses are sired and born. Unfortunately, our experience was not completely up to the standards the estate sets for itself.

First the good. The location is sublime, the rooms in the manor house are lavish and large. The activities on the property are varied and wonderful, including golf, falconry and fishing. The overall atmosphere is refined and relaxed. We wished we had stayed several days to enjoy more of what the Mount Juliet had to offer.

We did experience service hiccups. The Michelin-starred dining room was not open the night we were there. As a consolation, we ate at The Hound, the restaurant adjacent to the golf course. The food was average and the service terrible. After the wine was delivered it was self serve until the bottle was empty. Courses were delivered and servers disappeared unless or until plates were cleared. We arrived late but the restaurant was still open. We felt our presence was resented as staff noisily set tables around us for the morning.

The bellman who was to carry our bags up to the second floor seemed unfit for the job. Out of sympathy, we carried most of our own luggage. On the way, we passed the vacuums and laundry bags bags left in a stairwell by the housekeeping staff.

To the establishment’s credit, the reaction to our experience was horror. Employees were very responsive to feedback, bending over backwards to make amends. The morning supervisor asked us for details the next morning and offered us a complimentary breakfast. 

In spite of the gaffs, we would recommend Mount Juliet Estate. One forgives a lot for the idyllic and luxurious setting.

239,Lovely,"We stayed her for one night in the Hunters Yard.  The staff were a delight, the scenery and surroundings were lovely, the food was very tasty and we had a great nights rest.  The resort is very much based around golf but we were not golfing and had a great time.  There are some lovely walks around and they have bikes you can take for a trip around the estate.   The staff were very friendly and down to earth, a shout out to our lovely young waitress, think her name was Catriona, she was very attentive.  All in all, would highly recommend and hopefully, will be back again soon.",5,2018,06,26
239,Family time and relaxation.,"This is such a beautiful hotel especially the main house. The grounds are absolutely stunning. We and the children love how we can go swimming, horse riding, cycling and fishing . It’s peaceful and relaxing .Everyone is so friendly and welcoming. We can’t wait to return!",5,2018,06,25
239,2 nights in a wonderful estate,Stayed last week with my family including 2 young adult sons and my college bound daughter.  The weather couldn't have been more perfect and we felt we found a little slice of Irish heaven.  We stayed in the Manor and enjoyed our room.    Only downside was for our children's room was on the morning sun side and there is no air-conditioning and so it was warm.  We were hardly in our rooms as we ate dinner at the Hound restaurant and had a wonderful meal.  The Bar at the Manor was comfortable and fun.  We met several different groups and had a wonderful evening with them chatting.  The estate has wonderful bikes to use around the grounds and surrounding area.  Stunning.  We did the Falcon walk and had just a fantastic time with our falconer.  My daughter took advantage of the equestrian facilities and rode two different times including a beautiful trail ride where she was able to enjoy galloping through a field by a river in the shadow of the estate.,5,2018,06,18
239,Truly a magnificent estate. Must visit to appreciate all it has to offer.,"This estate now has two places to stay in, the original Manor and the new extension which offers large rooms with even larger bathrooms.  There is golf, falconry, touring, fox hunting and horseback riding that can be arranged by the hotel. The service is amazing, with a smile and a welcome from the staff. If you want to be treated like royalty, this is the place to visit.",5,2018,06,17
239,We expected more.,"We parked in what we thought was the main car park, and set out to find somewhere to have a light evening meal. Some member of staff (we think) directed us to Hounds restaurant. We stood at the ‘wait here to be seated’ sign for longer than was comfortable. If the restaurant was busy we would have understood. It wasn’t. More staff than customers. One member of staff in a very crisp blue suit, standing very close to the ‘wait here’ sign had decided to totally ignore us. An unsmiling waitress appeared eventually and directed us to our seats. My steak sandwich was very enjoyable, but my wife’s chicken burger was the driest she had ever tasted. 
We will not be returning to Mount Juliet Estate. We had great hopes prior to our arrival, but the whole experience was negative in the extreme. We expected more.",1,2018,06,13
239,Underwhelming afternoon tea,"Went for afternoon tea on Tuesday with my husband and 2 year old. We were using a gift voucher.

The estate is large and includes a variety of activities/features but being summertime, I expected that the grounds would be reasonably well maintained. They weren’t.

The Manor House where afternoon tea is served is neat and quiet. The Reception staff were friendly and helpful, as indeed were all the staff that we encountered.

Being a Tuesday it was understandably a slow day and we were fortunate enough to be offered a prime table overlooking the valley below. The table however was a bit cramped when the high chair came out so the lovely waitress quickly set up another table.

Unfortunately I cannot recall the waitress’s name, but she was particularly pleasant and a perfect host for afternoon tea.

The tablecloths were not ironed and looked quite scruffy. The afternoon tea itself was fine but not particularly impressive. We were served half a lemon cake each instead of the whole piece. The paper straw in a somewhat strange lemonade drink turned to mush quite quickly, the chocolate mousse cake was sticky/messy and difficult to eat without a fork, the scones were better than most hotel scones but were served with strawberry jam, lemon curd (?!) and cream (not whipped or clotted but just runny double cream).

The chocolate madeleine was good, as was the savoury items and remaining items (lemon puff, cookie, strawberry tartlet).

There seemed to be a bit of a lemon theme to the items, even to the point of having a lemon (curd) dressing on the salmon bagel.

No tea or coffee refills were offered, although there was a change of shift during our sitting.

There was nothing particularly wrong with the afternoon tea spread...it was just a bit underwhelming and had no wow factor for 30 euros per person.

Our 2 year old ate from the children’s menu and had the chicken breast with carrots and chips. She enjoyed it and I must say it was very tasty. The only issue was the carrots had a somewhat fishy taste...very peculiar!

Our daughter became more animated after the meal and so we finished up so as not to disturb other guests. We had an enjoyable stroll around part of the grounds including along the river and horse paddocks.

We would rate this experience as 3.5 out of 5, but as it didn’t quite reach ‘very good’, we had to rate as ‘average’ (3).",3,2018,06,12
239,Wonderful Hotel - Hunter's Yard,"My wife and I spent two nights at Mount Juliet Estates, in the section of the property known as ""Hunter's Yard"", in early June, 2018.  It was a good stay.

The hotel is out in the country - it is not within walking distance to town.  The hotel is surrounded by the golf course.

We stayed in the new area known as Hunter's Yard.  Apparently, the facility has just been renovated because it still smells of fresh paint.

Our room was large with plenty of room for us.  The furnishing are new.  The bed was comfortable and the linens were nice.  The bath is adequately large and the towels are large and fluffy.  The floor of the bath is heated, which is a nice touch.

A Nespresso type coffee maker is provided and was appreciated.

There's only one stand for a suitcase but they were  willing to bring us another.  Hotels need to realize that when two people are staying in the room, there's usually a minimum of two suitcases - and having one on the floor is not very convenient.

The air conditioning works well and was easy to adjust.  The display on the thermostat lights up when any button is pressed so you can see to make adjustments in the middle of the night.  I'm told that the old house - the original manor house - does not have air conditioning so make sure you reserve Hunter's Yard if you want air conditioning.  The Internet access was easy to connect to and fast - much appreciated.

The only minor issue with the room is that we were unable to set up a night light in the bath.  There's a mirror with a light, and that would make a great night light, but when you turn the lights off in the bath, the mirror light goes out, also.  A nice addition would be to do something so that there's small night light in the bath.

We ate breakfast in the restaurant two mornings and dinner one night.  Dinner was good.  The menu for breakfast is somewhat unusual for American tastes but the kitchen was willing to do a few ""special"" things for us - but not make omelets. 

The staff was excellent, both in the hotel and in the restaurant.

We played golf on the golf course and the course is nice and well maintained.  It's not a really difficult course - pretty flat.  We had an early tee time and there was no one else on the course which made it especially nice.

All-in-all, a good hotel and a good stay.",5,2018,06,07
239,Luxury & Relaxation on an Overnight Break,"Fantastic overnight stay in Hunters Yard Hotel (recently renovated hotel) located in the Mount Juliet Estate. We received a courteous & informative greeting at reception, swift check in, room fabulous with all mod cons.  
We had dinner that evening in the restaurant 'The Hound' - great views overlooking the driving range of the golf course and the rolling Kilkenny countryside.  The food was top notch although the service was a little less perfect.  We both had a cocktail which was part of the package we were on and they were delicious.  
‘The Saddle Bar’ is also a nice place to chill & relax and there is an outside seating area adjacent, sheltered within a courtyard.  Gowns and Slippers in the room were a welcome addition for use in the spotless Pool area or in The Spa.
We walked up to the Manor House during our stay and ambled through the extensive walkways - all to be recommended.  Bicycles are available also for use around the extensive estate.
Only negative I can mention & it is only a very small issue but the signage could be improved as it was our first time to visit.
",4,2018,06,07
239,"For a luxurious break, this is the place!","Mount Juliet is an excellent place to stay.  If you want Michellin star food, there's the Lady Helen Restaurant and The Hound for good breakfasts, lunches, dinners etc.  There's horseriding, cycling, golf.  Beautiful manicured estate. The rooms are excellent with air-conditioning. First-class service and really professional, friendly staff.
",5,2018,06,05
239,Mixed thoughts,"The overall rating on average is based on a rather rude experience in the main restaurant (explained in a minute).  The Good:  the reception staff was friendly and accommodating.  The grounds were nice and clean and had a classic feel to them.  I didn't golf, but it appeared to be a gorgeous course outlining the beautiful terrain surrounding the property.  The negative:  the parking and the service in the main restaurant.  The parking isn't that major of a deal, but the extremely rude server in the restaurant has no business in the profession.  I wish we knew her name and I regret not reporting her to management.  I generally don't like to complain but in this case I should have.  In short, the wife and I returned to the property after a day in Kilkenny and were excited to try a dinner in the hotel.  We were greeted at the door by a server (her name unknown) who asked if we had a reservation.  I said ""no"" and she essentially told us we were out of luck in her own way, luckily for us another server said let them in.  Here's what got us, there must have been 30 empty tables and about 4-5 in use yet she didn't want to sit us.  We also asked if we could eat in the bar which was empty and didn't require reservations, she said ""no"".  She remained snooty to us throughout the dinner which I thought was strange considering how polite and nice we were.  As we were leaving the restaurant we noticed another couple eating in the bar area.  Lets just say this rather rude server left a bad taste in our mouth.",3,2018,06,02
239,Overpriced & Needs Attention ,"Popped in for tea and scones, at The Manor House at 9Euro for two scones and 8Euros for a pot of tea for two to say the experience was overpriced would be an understatement! 
The tea tasted nothing like Earl Grey, the scones were average, but the sad piece of butter, the measly amount of runny jam and cream was really beyond acceptable. 
Everyone knows Scones need large dollops of jam and clotted cream.
I did like my surroundings. ",1,2018,06,01
239,Spectacular,"Our kids treated us to a weekend break in this spectacular place, they have everything here for a self contained luxury indulgent time. In fact we only ventured out for one tour of a fantastic new distillery close by every other minute was spent enjoying the wonderful place their great service and lovely facilities.",5,2018,05,31
239,2 night stay in mount Juliet ,spent 2 nights in mount Juliet. staff were consistently friendly and helpful. A wedding  was on in hotel so place was fully booked. staff struggled with things like volume at check-in and breakfast queues. however we this annoyance disappeared quickly once we got to room.  location is very peaceful with lots to do. we ate in main restaurant first night and although pricey was best meal I have had this year. myself and my wife are definitely coming back.,5,2018,05,31
239,Magical Christmas Experience,"We visited Mount Juliet for the first time during Christmas period. We stayed here for 3 nights. 

The dinner in the restaurant was unbelievable! All the food was such high quality. The second day we walked the grounds and had high tea which was Christmas themed with mulled wine! 

The rooms are very luxurious and the service is incredible. The place was done up in full Christmas spirit with lovely fires lit everywhere. We will definitely be returning next year.",5,2018,05,28
239,Lovely Night Away,"Me and my friend Terrie had a lovely night in Hunter’s Yard Hotel on the Estate - we were on a voucher which included breakfast and dinner with a glass of Processo.  
The room was beautifully decorated in shades of calming green. It had two very comfortable double beds - we had an excellent nights sleep. The Bathroom was tiled and included a fantastic Shower. Overall the room was excellent. It overlooked a courtyard/garden area. The peace and tranquility of the estate is amazing.
Dinner in The Hound was very good. We decided on Chicken Liver Parfait and the Crab for starters - both excellent. We followed this with the Duck which was cooked to perfection. Our desserts however were only ok - we had the Chocolate Creme and the Apple Sponge. I think the chefs need to refresh the dessert menu.
Our servers were Michael and Katie and these staff members were a credit to the hotel - in fact all the staff we met were friendly and interested in us - a great sign of Excellent Teamwork.
Thank you for such a wonderful experience - we will return
Just to say on the morning we were leaving we went to The House for a look around and Brandon gave us a tour - Wow! he was terrific and knew all the history of the family - I have to say that this was the highlight of our trip. Thank you Brandon - a young man who will go far in the hospitality industry.",5,2018,05,28
239,5 star Night away,"We happened upon a deal on one of these discount sites. We were offer a package for the newer part of the estate, Hunters Yard. We were welcomed, enthusiastically and with true friendliness by the receptionist. Our room was lovely, a nice double bed, and seating area with a large TV screen. The bathroom was compact with shower only. We had as party of our deal, a meal in the Hound, a restaraunt that was informal and is part of the Golf Club. The food was excellent and the service was excellent. We had a ""clean"" (collectors and presented well) Irish cooked breakfast, all fresh and hot! The buffet had everything and more for those who didn't want a hot meal. We had a late checkout and will be back.",5,2018,05,27
239,"Very enjoyable stay, would highly recommend newly refurbished rooms in Hunters Yard","My husband and I recently celebrated our wedding anniversary and stayed in Hunters Yard.  The minute you walk down the inviting wood panelled corridor, it feels special, airy with a beautiful colour scheme.  The room is large, lovely double doors opening out to open area and found a nice bottle or merlot compliments of the manager which was a lovely touch.  We had dinner that evening in the Hound, very nice setting, we had a lovely table overlooking the golf course and the food was really good.  The only fault I found was lack of training of the young members of staff which is a miss and leaves a feeling of slight unprofessionalism.  The young barman was a lovely chap but was obviously not trained properly and looked uncomfortable and was not able to prepare or find some drinks that customers requested, he was on his own so had no support.  Also the following morning, the young girl who served us for breakfast was again lovely but again lacked training and looked again uncomfotable and lacked confidence.  It is the only thing that leaves the place down.  Overall we had a very enjoyable stay, I felt sorry for the young staff, they did their best but its unfair to put them in front of the public when they're not ready or have the proper support in place.",4,2018,05,22
239,I want to go back already,"My fiancé and I booked a last minute getaway in Mount Juliet this May and it was everything I wanted and more. Let me say firstly that the service and attention to detail is just impeccable. While we waited for our room to get ready we tried the food at the Hound restaurant. We lunched outside overlooking the golf course with a glass of malbec. [Top tip: try the 3 course lunch special. The servings are just right.] Then we took a quick stroll down by the bridge until our room was ready. There was a wedding on while we stayed there but the property is managed so well we didn't even notice them. Our room was stunning with a very very comfortable bed. After chilling out we visited the pool and then used the complimentary bikes to cycle back to the manor. We booked a table for the Hound restaurant for dinner. The steak was so soft, the parmesan crust house fries were delicious. After a satisfying meal we returned to the bar in the manor house. I had a mojito and a long island iced tea. We relaxed by the window and admired the finer details of the house. We noticed how well kept the place is, even down to the rope on the drapes, everything is clean and neat. The staff must really care about the manor because it shows. If you're a history buff you'll love it. Especially if you're into art. I'll be sending friend who's a costume historian up to Mount Juliet in her best Georgian kit to take some pictures. I finished the night with another glass of red before retiring to my very comfortable gigantic bed. The following morning we had breakfast. I recommend the cinnamon french toast. Also, try the honey. We went for one last cycle through the grounds, my fiancé even befriended a little foal who followed us from behind his fence as we cycled for a bit. On returning, a staff member asked if we'd like to take a cycle as he noticed us looking at the bikes earlier. We thanked him and said that we had just returned. This attention to detail can really add to a stay. Visit for scenery, serenity, relaxation, great food, refreshing drinks, and more importantly, peace and quiet. I will return.   ",5,2018,05,21
239,Super relaxing,"My husband and I had a wonderful time in Hunters yard. Beautifully decorated even though I don't think it's finished. Our room was so comfortable with a big huge bed and stunning views... We had lunch and a little explore down in the Manor house..which was just stunning big huge open fires  it was sooo relaxing and our lunch was delicious. We both had treatments in the spa which we both enjoyed (thank you Nikki)... We had dinner that evening in the hound restraunt, again this was delicious as was breakfast the next day. The only problem I had was that I only stayed 1 night.",5,2018,05,20
239,Horse Riding lesson,"We were staying in Kilkenny for a few days and my 6 year old daughter said she would love to try horse riding. I rang/emailed a few places but I found Mount Juliet to be the most helpful.

The lady on reception was very nice to deal with. A special mention to Sarah Jane, the girl who took my daughter on her first riding lesson. She was very friendly and her enthusiasm for horses shone through.

My daughter had a wonderful time, she learned the very basics in a paddock before being taken out for a little trot around the grounds of the estate.

A very enjoyable experience.",4,2018,05,16
239,Manor house and resteruant,"A lovely picturesque estate, with grounds nearly unparreled for bio-diversity of plant life but they don't bill them selves this way. Beautiful horses and cattle being bread (and studded for typically insane prices).
We stayed in the manor house and it was very nice. Our room was not large and had water stains on the wall, paint chipping all over the place, mildew on the floor of the bathroom and no table to sit and eat at. Again the room was not large, and for the price actually very small but even with the criticism it was clean for the most part and the maid service did a great job when we where out. The exhaust fan in the bathroom didn't work so it made the room stuffy and uncomfortable after a shower. So, even though it would have been nice to spend more time in the room for our anniversary it was not possible.
The staff were all well trained and did their best to pretend like they didn't know that the guests knew that they knew everyone was the same, bar a willingness to spend an absurd amount of money (the resentment and disgust was apparent with some). Every one seemed to keep this charade up fairly well and it was a bit uncomfortable with the constent fawning from those who were laying it on a bit thick or were not as genuine at being nice or vested in their job.
It is obvious that they are striving to be a 5 star hotel and the property and golf course/country club may get them there. The bar staff (singular for the 3 days we were there) were not competent and treated the guests as if they didn't know the limited number of drinks they had available but they did. Thing is they did not know basic knowledge of what they were serving. Also you were made to quite clearly feel as if you needed to tip certain staff who had maybe not done anything and possible overcharged you. 
That mite not be fair as a 1ltr glass bottle of ballygowan at dinner in the lady Helen resteraunt was 6€. So it could be entirely that I was suffering from sticker shock and I did not actually catch being overcharged but staff were reluctant to tell you the price of anything or give receipts if you didn't ask multiple times. A neat trick actually and I think part of their training as the were adept at ignoring questions and trying to change subjects if asked anything they didn't know. 
The lady helen resteraunt has a Michelin star. I think this is for the setting mostly because the food while expertly prepared by supremely talented chefs/cooks was an assault to the pallet. Kind of like someone who knows how to paint in Picasso's cubist style but has no instincts to make a good painting/meal. Had we not agreed to pay for the tasting menu I think we would not have eaten the food at all and just left. It was a true waste of money. 
The falconry and walks on that part of the estate not take up by golf were very nice; however most places you were asked to keep off the grass",3,2018,05,13
239,An oasis of calm ,"Cherry blossom, asters, bluebells everywhere and bright sunlight filtering through frail green beech leaves.  This place is just so special. Staff are so friendly and kind, in particular the omnipresent Catherine Lane who just seems to be able to set everything to rights. 

Spend an afternoon gazing out the window of the main bar in the Manor House with the river sweeping by and the mares and their foals grazing gently in the distance. It really wouldn’t have mattered what we had to eat but the afternoon teas were first class. ",4,2018,05,11
239,Hunter's yard stay disappointing,"We stayed in Hunter's Yard as there was no room at the main house.  The reception desk wasn't manned when we got there and we had to go all the way to the main house to check in. We discovered that we would have to do that after waiting for 20 minutes with no guidance. There was still a lot of building going on around us and either we should have been given a room further from the construction noise or they should not have been taking in guests while it was still a work in progress. Didn't sleep well the first night and trying to nap during the day was impossible, even after calling reception the noise didn't stop. The restaurant in the main house was fully booked so dined at Hunter's Yard which was expensive but not very good.  Staying at Hunter's Yard felt like an inferior experience altogether, but nonetheless costly! It helps if you like golf, but I wouldn't go again. Also Mt. Juliet is a beautiful estate, but it is marred by all the bland one-off houses along the river and the characterless building projects.",3,2018,05,07
239,Excellent staff and great food. Witnessed ignorance,"To whom it may concern
I visited to mount juliet over the bank holiday weekend and despite the fact the staff were extremely busy I found them to be friendly, helpful and polite. The food as usual delicious. Compliments to the chef. The only complaint I would have can not be rectified by any member of staff or management. The ignorance of some of the other guests towards the staff was disgusting. These people believe that their airs and graces deliver them with a divine right to treat others how they please. For any other trip advisor guest reading this, remember, these people are human too, mistakes can be made and will be, they do this job because they like working with people and helping them. They show respect and restraint with faced with anger and ignorance. You are not perfect, whatever you cant control in life should not result in it been taken out on others. Put yourself in their shoes. They miss out on family time and friends so that you can have a great day with your family and friends. So next time you have a problem, breathe, count to ten, ask politely and talk it through. You are not as important as you think you are. We are all VIPs to the wonderful staff at mount juiet.

239,Afternoon tea best ever! ,"I am very late in writing this review but none the less felt it was very important to do it! We went here for afternoon tea and my sister had her 3 month old baby with us and all of the staff could not have been more accommodating. The bar staff and waiters and waitresses that helped us in where would be best to sit with the baby and checked that we were OK for more tea or coffee etc were so friendly and lovely to deal with. The place itself was beautiful, spotless and very comfortable but what drove me most to write the review was the food! Myself and my sister go for afternoon tea all over the country..it’s what we do for each other’s birthdays and Mount Juliet is the best we have been to so far! It was outstanding! I would most definitely return!

239,Stayed in the new Hunters Yard,"The bedrooms are large and modern. There was still some decorating work going on while we were there but it was hardly noticeable. The beds were very comfortable and I loved the  new modern bathroom. Breakfast was very good and all staff that I came in contact with were super. We arranged a lift down to the main house for drinks before our meal and the driver came back for us on time without us asking! Super service! I liked the new hotel reception area too. 
However I found the new restaurant and new bar to be very bright and lacking in athmosphere. The bar is just one rectangular shape and has an odd assortment of furnishings. The old bar and restaurant at hunters yard was much nicer in my opinion.",4,2018,05,03
239,Underwhelmed and disappointed,"Visited on a Thursday in April (off Peak, I would say). Lots of activity on the golf course and some in the hotel. Afternoon tea booked for 1.30, was with a large group. The 'tea' was served cup at a time from a stainless steel teapot,No a china pot in sight - disappointing. no choice was offered, when I queried the blend I was looked at in an odd fashion. The room was served with tiered cake stands (mostly) at 1.50. 'My selection, as we were a table of 3 arrived on a plate at 2.15, without the savouries, I was advised they would arrive later. The afternoon tea was 30 euro p/p. By comparison very expersive with other similiar providers. I will not return, nor recommend",3,2018,05,01
239,Not to the standard expected,"Stayed one night in hunters lodge. Our room was disappointing... we got a room with a disabled bathroom, it felt unfinished. There was absolutely nowhere to place our toiletries. There wasn’t even a toilet paper holder. There was an extremely bright green fire escape light over the door which prevented us from sleeping. We left out our room service request from breakfast at 10pm the night before. At 6am it was still there... we had to ring reception to remind them to pick it up! Breakfast was delicious once it arrived. The furnishings are very high quality however the comfort just wasn’t there and the bathroom was simply dreadful. Certainly not worth the price. Pity.",3,2018,04,29
239,Absolutely magical experience!,"We just had our wedding at Mount Juliet and had the best time! We've been to Mount Juliet a total of 3 times within the last 15 months and each time we've had an amazing experience, and the highlight of all was our wedding last weekend. From catering to our specific needs to being extremely welcoming in all aspects, we found Mount Juliet to be an incredible venue. We have had some of the best food there in Ireland (thank you John Kelly and team!). Thank you Christine Murphy and your entire team (Zoe, Angela, Michael, Eoin, Des, Anne Marie, and more) for making our weekend so incredible! We lucked out with the weather and had 3 gorgeous days of sunny skies and no rain. We heard from our wedding guests who loved the estate and took advantage of all the activities being offered, from the golf, to horseback riding, archery and more. A special highlight was a Falconry session with John, a must if you are staying on the estate (need to reserve ahead of time.) 

We stayed in the Manor House all three times and had a different room each time. Some are more renovated than others, but all had an air of elegance and old-time luxury, with some rooms having an outdoor patio/terrace area. 

Overall, an wonderful stay and experience at Mount Juliet! We cannot wait to go back for our anniversary!

239,"Beautiful Room, nice breakfast, that’s it Full stop. Hunters Yard is poorly laid out and completely confusing.","So disappointed. Hunters Yard was badly sign posted, impossible to find the rooms. reception was indifferent and nonplussed about assisting. The Spa- Well I cancelled the treatment, it was as if the whole experience was a ‘bother’ to them.  The treatments were not well explained and Frankly the spa area was not memorable. WOULD NOT recommend",2,2018,04,28
239,Disappointing,"We were very excited about our trip to Mount Julliet. Sadly it did not meet expectations. 

When we arrived it was badly sign posted and got turned around on the golf course a few times. There is a lot of construction work going on there at the moment so this is possibly why. 

When we arrived we were greeted by very friendly staff and brought to our room. The room was not what we expected. It was shabby. The furniture was scratched, there was bird poo all over the windows, the bed had a very hard springy old mattress, it was just not what we were expecting especially for the price. 

I told the lady at the reception that we were not happy. She asked was the room not as big as we expected and I told her no it was not as nice as we expected. She moved us to another room. The other room was lovely. We were happy with it but it did start us off on a bad note. I must say the staff were very nice and helpful, they even sent up a bottle of wine later. 

Dinner was very nice, we enjoyed it. 

There was no option to have breakfast in bed, for a hotel like this is unusual and again disappointing. 

Breakfast in the dining room, the cold breakfast was very nice. The cooked breakfast wasn't great. It was bland on both mornings, soggy mushrooms, hard eggs, soft wet bacon, the sausages weren't very tasty either. The next day we had pancakes, small, blah. Bad presentation on both days. The difference between night and day in the dining room was crazy.

We went for a swim before having spa treatments on the second day. There was construction going on outside the pool area. Just a bit of a mess. There was no Jacuzzi, facilities just weren't up to scratch. 

The spa was very nice. I had an amazing treatment and was very happy. We couldn't have treatments at the same time, dispite booking way ahead of time. 

The price of our stay was very high so we expected a certain level of luxury. We didn't get it. I would not recommend and will not be back.

239,Wonderful Corporate Weekend at Mount Juliet,"From start to finish, Mount Juliet provided exceptional customer service. As the organizer of a corporate event for 50 people, I was grateful that Caitriona and Zoe made planning easy and hassle free.  Every detail of the booking was carefully checked, so when our attendees arrived every room and every individual requirement was in place and perfect.  

Every staff member we met was friendly and courteous, every room immaculate. The food and drinks were lovely throughout the weekend, our cocktail reception was glorious in the evening sun and our fantastic three course dinner was beautifully presented and delicious....  children had a ball between the various trails and gardens, and of course the tennis courts, horse riding and and the leisure centre which was spotlessly clean.  

Mount Juliet is a truly lovely venue, beautifully manicured and restful, ideal for a weekend retreat for all ages.",5,2018,04,24
239,Worst service of any hotel I've stayed in,"We were really looking forward to our stay here, as we read good reviews online and as their website states 'gives 5 star service'/  Unfortunately, shortly after we checked in the service we received was shocking and was more like 1 star than 5. In the bar, I asked the barman if food was possible and was told no - shortly afterwards a couple beside us received two main courses. I asked again, and again was told that food was not allowed in the bar. A couple of mins later another table received food - I complained about this at the time and mentioned that the bar man should have at least acknowledged there were others eating in the bar while telling us no food was allowed.  We also asked if the rugby game was to be shown, and he told us yes to take a seat. We shortly heard him tell others the bar didnt have the TV station for the game (he never told us, after saying it was being shown). Later that night we went to the restaurant for dinner, we were seated in the corner with a number of tables around us that were not cleared off and left with plates and glasses on them. We had to wave for the waitress to take our order, wave again to order drinks and again to get the bill. After the bill arrived we never saw the waitress again and as we were staying in the hotel unfortunately my husband left his jacket behind. We went back first thing the next morning while breakfast was served to ask about it. A waitress opened a small drawer beside the till and said 'no its not here', and didn't bother to look anywhere else for it. After calling couple of times after check out, it was eventually found and was to be posted back to us, which we were asked (and refused) to pay for.  It has been three weeks since the jacket was posted to us and has yet to arrive. I wouldn't return here, which is quite disappointing and wouldn't recommend it.",2,2018,04,23
239,Worst pedicure ever,"I recently visited the spa at Mount Juliet
I chose this spa as I had received bad reviews from another prominent spa in the nearby area
I had booked a wax and a pedicure.  The waiting room isn’t the greatest and not as lovely or as relaxing as others I’ve experienced but it was ok.  There isn’t much to say about the treatment rooms the were fine but in relation to the actual pedicure it was quite different.  In the midst of my pedicure I felt quite a bit of pain I looked down and the nail technician had removed a large portion of live cuticle and not only that but she said nothing and proceeded to do the same to my other toe
I wasn’t wearing my glasses so I couldn’t see exacted what happened
However towards the end I could see blood on my toes. After pointing out that my toes were sore she said yes they were bleeding and she was sorry about that !!
She went in to put varnish remover on them - extremely sore asked her to stop
She put top coat of varnish and again I asked her to stop as my toes were now stinging quite badly
I expected at least an apology from management or a discount I got neither 
I was in such a state of shock that I just walked out after paying with two very painful toes
My toes hurt for three days after this pedicure unacceptable and I will be contacting Mount Juliet in person.
I am writing so no one else will take this treatment of bad service

239,Fantastic,"This is a fantastic hotel, everything about it is great, the grounds the golf course, the staff, the food the rooms, every thing is top class. We had a lovey time there, it was so enjoyable we high recommend it",5,2018,04,15
239,Very good but room for improvement.,"Invited friends for a very special occasion to Hunter's Yard restaurant. On making the reservation we were asked to move it forward by a quarter of an hour as they expected a group of 12 to arrive at the time we requested. When we arrived at the restaurant it was totally empty. Don't ask me how they manage when everybody arrives at the same time unannounced!! 
I ordered a glass of Guinness which arrived in what appeared to be an Irish Coffee Glass. Irish Coffee was later served in the same style of glass.
The ""sommelier"" let several drops from the wine bottle fall on the table at every glass he served.
What did upset me was that 2 of my guests who were local were served up very very red lamb. They were not even asked how they liked their meat. I know from experience that the Irish generally like their meat well done.",4,2018,04,12
239,Afternoon tea ,This has become an annual get together of three good friends and where better to do it than at Mount Juliet’s. We were treated to an exquisite afternoon tea with exemplary service that was both friendly and attentive. And then this was followed by the real icing on the cake - a wonderful tour of Mount Juliet’s glorious estate; thanks to Des our tour was packed full with facts and stories all about the fascinating history of the estate and the families who have lived there. A thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable afternoon. Thanks - looking forward to next year already!,5,2018,04,11
239,Food a major let down.,"Myself and my partner are just back from a night in Hunter's Yard.  As a regular visitor to Kilkenny I was excited to try out this Hotel.  It was a present for my partner's birthday and also one last treat before our new arrival comes the end of May.

We had a slight mix up with room allocation on check in but to be honest it was rectified and we were very happy with the room we got.  We found the hotel itself to be lovely, clean and modern.  The bed was so comfortable and I had a great nights sleep. We had a lovely view from our room. No issues whatsoever with the actual hotel and staff.

Now for the food, we decided to have lunch in the Hound Restaurant and we had dinner in there also as was part of our package.  The lunch menu was very limited, no option for a sandwich or  a salad or small snack.  I opted for the beef stroganoff which to be honest was very basic and bland.  My partner had the seabass and found it ok. We had dinner then later that evening and if i'm honest It will probably go down as one of the worst meals I've had in a hotel.  Very basic food and tasteless and dry, presentation very poor.  We're not fussy eaters but we were so disappointed.  It's such a shame and I feel that this is the only reason I will not return to this hotel. Breakfast was lovely and no issues there whatsoever.",2,2018,04,09
239,The Hunters Yard Hotel on the estate is AWESOME,"Stayed here on Easter Monday, last minute getaway. There are 93 bedrooms in this hotel which only only recently. Lovely decor. Very impressed with options on TV, watched the last two episodes of Banshee from our phone on the TV. 
The Howard restaurant and bar over look the golf course, good food and drink.
Beds very comfortable, rain forest showers...the list is endless
Going back again next month...take it off your to do list and just go...very good value too...paid €185 B&B with beautiful room.",5,2018,04,08
239,A Sum of Two Parts,"Stayed in the Manor House recently. Our check in experience was courteous and fast. The reception area has been moved from the right hand side room to a room on the left that is more spacious for dealing with multiple check ins.
Since our previous stay the house has been given a very welcome face lift which has been really enhanced one’s stay. Sympathetic decoration has been carried out in every area of the house.
Our bedroom was georgous with very comfortable bedding which leads to a very refreshing nights sleep.
The room was exceptionally clean and kept that way during our stay, well done to the housekeeping staff.
Breakfast was beautiful with a very extensive menu. What made breakfast even better were the staff. It would be unfair to mention one individuals name as they were all exceptional, nothing was a problem for them.

Our evening meals were taken in the old clubhouse, a new clubhouse having been constructed contiguous to the existing building. Again, the meal choices here are very good and competitively priced. Generally there are specials added to the menu each day. The staff here in Hunters Yard restaurant are very efficient and friendly, as they are in the main House.  The layout in this restaurant has changed significantly with the bar having been moved to what was once the golf members area and the conservatory area also enhanced with additional tables. All the windows in the building have also been replaced which makes it nice and cosy.

You may ask why we didn’t dine in the Lady Helen dining room, well for some unexplained reason this restaurant was closed over a Bank Holiday period that just doesn’t make sense?

One serious issue that requires addressing is wether a resident has access to the new clubhouse on Saturdays/ Sunday’s. We entered the clubhouse/Proshop on a Saturday and were told emphatically by two members of staff that we could not stay in the clubhouse. We had enquired earlier in the day from Management if we could have the facility of using the clubhouse and were told yes. So there is a dichotomy in interpretation. Sadly, the two staff members who had earlier told us we could not stay were less than professional in the service they provided to us which is a shame because it was out of character with our overall experience during our stay in the resort.

Our experience with the golf staff was again very pleasant prior to and subsequently after our game. However, the golf course once a jewel in the crown alas is no longer. 
Allowing for the weather we have experienced over the last number of months the course is in the WORST condition I have ever experienced. I would estimate that there has not been any sand laid on the fairway’s for two years or more. And now it’s not unusual to lose your ball on some fairways due to plugging, with six balls having been lost on the course, but eight balls found on fairways and just at the edge of the rough all well plugged. Maintenance is always essential on the course but during our stay all the greens had been hollowed tined, this was not mentioned prior to our round. There were four very unhappy golfers with the conditions experienced.

The recreation area/pool area was undergoing renovation at this time also, with workmen putting up partitions and generally carrying out maintenance on the changing rooms, they being out of operation on a number of days. The pool and surrounding areas were very cold and the experience was not at all enjoyable. This has to be addressed as well, trying to operate while carrying out upgrades,!!!!

In summing up on our stay, our accommodation was superb and if that’s what you are going for then you wont be dissapointed, but check on the dining option, wether open or closed,we were dissapointed that the Lady Helen dining room was not open, the recreation area ongoing works. Some individuals whom we met there were less than happy over this and returned back to their accommodation without using the facility.

Please get the golf course back into the condition it was in over the past years. It was sad to see the pin marker flags on the golf flags saying “European Tour Destination”  it will be a long time before any major competition is held here again.
Consequently our reason for the overall rating.  
Accommodation, brilliant
Recreation area, poor
Golf course poor.",3,2018,04,06
239,Hunters yard family meal,"10 out of 10 for the wonderful ambiance, the black pudding croquettes and prompt service. Though would recommend that guests are not referred to as ""guys.""  
My steak was perfectly cooked.  
 Recommend Bread starter plate should be provided as an accompaniment not charged for.  
5 out of 10 for the lamb rump which was half fat. We did complain and got no apology for this.  I ordered apple sponge for dessert and got a dry cupcake of sponge on stewed diced apple.  Not a good deconstruction of a classic dish.  Despite my few gripes it was a wonderful setting and otherwise a pleasant meal. ",4,2018,04,05
239,Really disappointed- promised interconnecting rooms- got 'adjoining rooms' not acceptable for family break,"I stayed here twice before so had no hesitation in staying again- what a mistake. While we stayed in the lodges before this time we were supposed to have interconnecting rooms for ourselves and the kids.
Its a bit rich being told the interconnecting rooms had been given to people staying 3 or 4 nights. I really think its unacceptable to expect customers to put up with that kind of nonchalant brush off. The reception staff were v pleasant- but the management really need to brush up on service. 
 
There was no making up for expecting a 3 or 6 year old to sleep on their own.
They didn't even have a roll out bed for one of the kids to sleep in our room.
",2,2018,04,05
239,Expensive treat,"We had a voucher which was nice to use as a treat. We stayed in the Manor House, which I wasn't aware there was a difference between the House and Hunters Yard. I am still unsure of the difference. The manor house is beautiful as are the ground surrounding the estate. 
Welcomed by such friendly concierge and reception staff. Brought to our room which was also stunning. 
We then went to the bar in the manor house which was lovely but not the type of bar we are used too, very quiet!! 
If you are a young couple looking for a nice relaxing drink the saddle bar up the other end is the best option. Restaurants all looked lovely but if you are looking for nice pub grub this isn't the place. We chose to eat in the golf club as this menu was the closest we got to what we wanted, burger etc.., the food here was amazing. There was also a tv screen for sport etc. 
Overall a gorgeous treat and faultless in terms of service etc however in my opinion extremely overpriced, breakfast was an extra €17.50 per person if required!! We noticed however the golf club do breakfast at very reasonable prices, however we didn't avail. 
Its also a good 20 minute drive into KK so we didn't bother venturing in until we were on route home.",4,2018,04,04
239,Very poor,"Hi, we recently stayed at the new part of mount Juliet, we booked through booking.com for 2 nights, we were very disappointed with it. Because it was booked through booking.com, they didn’t appear to have any interest in us, there was unbelievable confusion upon checking out by attempting to overcharge for 2 extra nights, we were in a queue of people all of which had similar problems, we weren’t even asked if we had a nice time and the hotel removed money from my credit card without even asking, food in the restaurant was overpriced, bar food was lovely. We put a review on their site but they for some strange reason refused to put it up. The old part of mount Juliet seemed really lovely and very endearing, something which is totally lost in the new part. If your looking for a weekend to give your money away for very little in return, then this is a must for you!!",1,2018,04,04
239,Afternoon Tea at Mount Juliet,"We spent a wonderful afternoon at Mount Juliet for our Annual Afternoon Tea. Greeted on arrival by Des McGrath who would be telling us the History of Mount Juliet. We sat in awe of his knowledge, enthusiasm and passion of the Estate, the families who lived there, the Estate workers, the buildings; I could go on and on. 
Des left us in the more than capable hands of Annmarie, along with other staff members, who took care of us, serving up an outstanding Afternoon Tea. We opted for Gin and Tonics with our tea, well we were spoiling ourselves! 
The next part of our afternoon, was a tour of the Estate, again Des passed on anecdotes and history while we to travelled back in time to days gone by.
You must book Afternoon Tea during your stay at Mount Juliet and you must book a tour around the Estate and you must ask Des McGrath to tell you all about the history and present this amazing Estate. You will not be disappointed. Guaranteed.",5,2018,04,04
239,5 star class !!!,"This is a 5 star experience . Every staff member, every detail of our beautiful junior suite, was superb! They have created a most relaxed atmosphere amongst the beautiful house and grounds without falling into pretentiousness. Even with a boisterous 4 yo we felt welcome! Reminded me of the Awahnee in Yosemite . Cannot recommend it highly enough. Thank you!",5,2018,03,31
239,"Beautiful Wedding, poor staff.","Nicest wedding food I can remember, but the staff seemed to try and ignore the guests all weekend. There seemed to be enough on, but all weekend every time we tried to order anything it took a long time, and ages to arrive.",3,2018,03,25
239,Luxurious hotel. Amazing grounds. Pure delight.,"Room was massive with steps down to bathroom with elegant bath. Room smelled of lavender. Beautiful decorative features.
Grounds are extensive. Restaurant was the best part of the stay. Exquisite! Beautifully prepared and delicious food in an atmospheric setting.
Lots of activities including golf, horse riding, walking and falconry.

",5,2018,03,25
239,Stunning Hotel with Sumptous Surroundings,"Third time at Mount Juliet and we stayed for 2 nights in the wonderful Manor House to celebrate my wife's 40th birthday. The staff went above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable and memorable as possible.

The rooms are exquisitely decorated (we were in the Presidential Suite) and the comfort of the lounge areas really has to be experienced.

Dinner at the Lady Helen restaurant was amazing and the selection of the breakfast menu is superb.

Special shout out to Julian, in the main Manor House Bar, who made us some wonderful cocktails and kept us entertained after a long St Patrick's day watching rugby and drinking Guinness 
 
Can't wait until our next stay in what I think is the most luxurious, well run, maintained, friendly and well deserved 5* hotel in Ireland (From those that I've stayed at anyway)",5,2018,03,23
239,Amazing!,"Wow - what a wonderful experience our stay was in Mount Juliet. We stayed in the Manor House and the whole stay was fab. From the moment we arrived we wer made feel welcome. The room was beautiful and the whole decor of the Manor House is beautiful. We had dinner in the Lady Helen on the night of our stay and it was a true fine dining experience with food that was delicious. We could find no fault with any course! We then had some drinks and cocktails in the bar and the waiter could not of been more helpful, suggesting non alcoholic options for myself as I am pregnant. Breakfast the next morning was lovely with a good fresh cold buffet and great selection on the hot food menu. The staff again were so friendly and couldn’t be more helpful. We finished off our stay with a spa treatment and I have to say my back massage was one of the best I’ve had. My husband also enjoyed his treatment. We also took a walk around the grounds which provide for ample opportunity to get out in the fresh air. I can’t wait to return in the future.",5,2018,03,23
239,"Sadly, Only One Night","Wow, what a magnificent Estate. Sadly for us we only had the one night stay but fond memories will be had. From the moment that we drove into the estate we were impressed. We were very fortunate to be staying the Manor House. The reception staff member was very efficient, polite, friendly and explained in detail all details. Now the room, Lord Mountgarret. Wow, it was large, roomy and most of all very comfortable. The bed was very very comfortable, the bathroom large and yes it was very clean. The bar is cosy and has a wonderful fire place, just what you need when it is cold. We had  dinner in  the Lady Helen Restaurant, three courses and it was superb and would highly recommend if it is in your budget. Heck, we are holidays and a splurge now and then is ok. Once again, all the staff were very friendly which only enhances the stay. If we were ever to come back to this part of Ireland, it would be a bee line line for us.  We were really impressed.",5,2018,03,14
239,Awful,"Really, Really disappointed with the whole experience. Would not recommend.  Does not deserve to be 5star.  

There was a pair of dirty socks in our room upon arrival.  They stayed there for the duration of our stay, despite bringing this to staff’s attention, no remote for the TV and the robes were ripped.  

Upon check on Friday evening approx. 7.30pm, (granted we had no reservation for dinner) the receptionist advised there was no availability until 9pm; when we eventually found the bar, we were seated straight away without hesitation. We were staying in the new section of the hotel,called Hunters Yard, you can smell the new paint and still feels like a building site. They do not have signs up directing you around the hotel; spa, pool, pub etc.  really difficult to find anything.  

We booked in for the falconry (which I would highly recommend) and asked 2 different receptionists on separate occasions, if we were to be collected from Hunters Yard Reception; they advised we were.  We were not.  We were 20mins late for our activity.  The staff were not well trained, they were unsure of everything and the whole place had a sense of chaos about it.  There were so many little things that just combined to make this a bad hotel.  It is not what I expected especially out of a so- called 5star.  We cancelled our dinner reservation for the Saturday night and ate in Kilkenny town, as the hotel menu was not value for money; choice is minimal, just like the portion sizes. The spa was awful; the relaxation room is a glorified, old fashioned- sitting room.  You are practically on top of other guests while waiting and there was dirty to feel to it. The full body massage was enjoyable, but the treatment rooms were bright and uncomfortable.  The only good thing about our stay was the breakfast.

You are paying enough to treat yourself for a weekend break and expect a certain standard for a 5star hotel.  This hotel should be 3star at the most. Again, would definitely not recommend.  So disappointed with our two-night stay and the whole experience of Mount Juliet.",1,2018,03,12
239,New look Hunters Yard is fantastic!,"Cant fault our overnight stay on Saturday. And I am one of those people who notices every little thing. The standards of cleanliness and service were excellent throughout. Despite a very busy night and morning, staff were always friendly and in control, service was prompt, the coffee was fresh and hot, breakfast buffet was immaculate even though we arrived to a very busy dining room. Bedrooms are beautiful and super clean with lovely attention to detail. I cant wait to go back!",5,2018,03,12
239,Just a few changes and it will be perfect.,"I really want to give them 5* because of the friendliness of the staff but there are just a few niggly things which won’t let me. Firstly though all the staff are super-friendly and helpful there are a few who need a little more training. It’s early season so they’re probably new so hopefully that will improve during the year.

There’s still a bit of development work going on, all the rooms in Hunter’s Yard are finished and are of a very good standard, not quite 5* but 4.75 at least. Silly things like a lack of drawers in the wardrobes, not much shelf space in the bathroom and no hotel information book let them down. 

The place is also a bit of a rabbit warren to find your way around as they still don’t have the new signage up but that will come.

Pool area is very nice with a great pool although it is lacking a jacuzzi. One thing which lets it down is the size of the changing rooms, they are too small and if there is a few people in them you are stuck for space, especially if there’s a family with a few kids.

The big thing which lets the place down is the Hunter’s Yard restaurant. Breakfast is good, although bacon & sausages are undercooked but we had dinner there on Friday night and the food was nowhere near good enough quality for this resort. It was medium quality pub grub at best and far too expensive for what you got. They do food a bit weirdly as well, the Hunter’s Yard bar has food during the day but not at night and it’s difficult to get a table in the restaurant if you haven’t booked (god knows why) so the only other place to eat in the evening is Jack’s Bar in the golf clubhouse and that has very little to choose from.

They are spending a lot of money on the resort and I really hope it just sorts out the few niggles and it will be perfect.

One more thing - we did archery and falconry and I would highly recommend them. Both Shane for the archery and John for the falconry were fantastic.",4,2018,03,11
239,Worth a visit. ,"Really enjoyed our stay! We unfortunately got stuck behind a person that wanted to complain about everything -The receptionist handled with grace and was very professional. We had a fantastic stay, the room was absolutely beautiful. The leisure centre was lovely but unfortunately the hallway and the door into the leisure centre still looked like a building site. The only reason that it’s not getting five stars as the hunters yard was still in the middle of building works and we weren’t notified at the time of booking. However, we will be back when everything is hopefully finished. ",4,2018,03,10
239,changes at this great old place,"been coming here for many years and fell deeply in love with this property and its people- it was sold to a group and many changes are being made adding rooms construction is all a plus to ensure this grand place can support itself  going forward  but we were devastated to find that so many of the staff were let go  and replaced, it once felt so welcoming and as if we were home- definitely had a different vibe than it once had  maybe a bit less personal feel - happily we met up with Des who is a wonderful asset to this place and found a few cherished  friends still working in the hotel ",5,2018,03,05
239,Lovely weekend getaway,"We spent one night at Hunter's Yard on a weekend and it was the perfect escape from the city. 
The rooms are brand new, spacious and very well designed on great standards. 
Loved the food: we had afternoon tea in Manor House and dinner in The Hound restaurant. Delicious cocktails. Breakfast was also a great experience, amazing views of the golf course, quality options ranging from a full Irish to great variety of fresh fruit and pastries. 
The staff is also worth to mention, always doing their best to best accommodate us. Special thanks to Páidí for being so welcoming and Margaret for being such a wonderful host.
We will definitely come back in the Summer!",5,2018,02,27
239,Comfortable stay but a few improvements needed ,"My husband and I stayed in the recently refurbished Hunters Yard with our 6 month old. First impressions were good, from the natural beauty but of the estate surrounds to the charm of courtyards where the Hunters Yard is situated. We arrived to the hotel before the 4pm check in time and were lucky to find that our room was ready and we could check in straight away. The receptionist was extremely pleasant, offering to make dinner reservations for that evening and also advised that the travel cot we had requested when booking would be set up in the room at turn down if it wasn’t already there (It wasn’t). Our room was a nicely decorated, bright and airy room finished to a high standard, including huge comfortable bed, large screen tv (that synced with husbands phone!) espresso machine and underfloor heating in the bathroom. 

We took our baby to the swimming pool which operates specified childrens hours and a strictly enforced armband policy for children under 6. We had to pay 12 euro(!) for armbands for our 6 month old in order to bring her into the pool despite the fact that she was going to be held by one of us at all times and clearly not going to be “swimming”.  The armbands (which had an advisory warning on them that they are not intended for under 3s and were therefore unsuitable anyway) were too large and made handling our daughter in the water more cumbersome and hazardous than going without. A bit of common sense from the staff in the leisure center would not have gone astray here.  

We had dinner in the Hound restaurant that evening. Again the staff were extremely pleasant and accommodating. Service was extremely quick and we enjoyed our meal.  There was still no sign of the travel cot on our return to the room (or indeed a turndown service) but this was quickly remedied with a call to reception. 

Breakfast was ok, however we expected better from a 4 star. After checking out we returned to the bar for some coffees before the journey home. It was busy (most tables occupied) with only one person working behind the bar. We waited over 15 minutes for our two coffees to arrive and then had to remind the server that we were still waiting on a scone and soft drink. 

Apart from our experience at the swimming pool we had a comfortable stay and we found most staff thoughout the hotel to be exceptionally warm and accommodating, but just noted a few service issues that we wouldn’t expect at this price point. ",3,2018,02,26
239,Golf club catering facilities,"4 of us Played here as part of a group last week . Having driven almost 3 hours ,looked forward to breakfast in “Jacks “ (Nicklaus) . “Sorry the grill is broken no breakfast available ” we were told , my 3 pals went to the hotel , Sorry , residents only they were told ! Delayed about an hour due to frost and that was fine , got out at about 12.40 and finished at about 5.15 . Showered etc ( very good facilities there) , and then into Jacks for food . “ Sorry food finished at 5.30 “ I was told , my pals were equally surprised. We drove to Clonmel and ate there . I did complain by email and received a phone call from a nice man at the golf shop telling me that hopefully we will be able to feed you next time . 
Not good enough for a 5 star MJ ,  won’t be rushing back any time soon !",2,2018,02,26
239,One for the short list ! ,"Stayed overnight recently after attending a business event at Mount Juliet.  On arrival we all felt signage was poor to guide you to either the hunters yard , main house or golf . We arrived at reception at hunters yard to find just one person to check in nearly 20 people . While many staff passed through reception , no additional help  was at hand to speed up the process , so it took 20 mins to check in , not a good first impression . 
Room was fantastic, newly refurbished to the highest standard , bathroom was bright & included both bath & a fab power shower . On small detail forgotten with the shower was there was no shelf  for shampoo etc , simply rectified .
Bar was cosy , service swift & welcoming .
Restraunt : Food fantastic , great menu to suit all tastes,  choose the fillet steak which was cooked exactly as requested . Service in restraunt was very poor . 
Golf course : Check in at the golf should take a bow for making all guests feel so welcome . Buggy are necessary for guests complete with GPS.  Course fabulous & challenging,  in great condition despite the poor weather , would love to return in summer to play again . ",4,2018,02,24
239,Great rooms,"Stayed one night, dinner, bed and breakfast in Hunters Yard development. 
On the positive side the receptionist was most helpful and pleasant. The room was as expected and the sleep quality was very good as were the other room facilities. Bar service was excellent. Breakfast was also quite good. 
Negatives. The whole complex is still a site under construction. The car park is some way from reception especially if one has a lot of luggage. Service in the restaurant for dinner was extremely haphazard. There did not seem to be allocated tables for waiting staff and simple things like water were not served until the meal was almost over. The food served was adequate if not spectacular. 

It might be unfair to knock at this early stage as much of the negative may be teething issues. 
All in all it warrants, in its present state about 3.5. ",4,2018,02,21
239,Disappointed 1st Wedding Anniversary Weekend Stay,"Stayed in the Hunter's Yard Hotel on the Mount Juliet Estate for our 1st Wedding Anniversary Feb 2 - 4.

We were very excited and expected to have a luxurious weekend.

We checked in and were brought to our room only to discover that there was a JCB construction digger outside our ground level balcony door.

The room was decorated and equipped to a high standard but the view just ruined that for us.

We checked in on a Friday late afternoon and we could hear heavy construction work being carried out, if you were looking for some peace and quite you would not be in luck.  That being said the construction work seemed to stop come Friday evening for the weekend but I would be extremely pissed if I had a mid-week stay and had to listen to that every day.

I called reception to asked to be moved to another room that wasn't facing a construction site and they said they would call me back shortly to see if they could do anything to accommodate us.

I was expecting a call back but the hotel porter arrived at our door to bring us to another room.  I was disappointed not to receive any apology or even an explanation from the porter, or even from reception when we checked out.

Our new room was to the same high standard of decoration and equipment but a couple of little things let it down for us.  There was a blown bulb on the desk lamp, our mini fridge did not work and the bathroom lacked a toilet roll holder on the wall, there was just a toilet roll holder for spares, and the bath was not 100% clean.  The view out of our balcony door was better this time, we were looking out on to a court yard but it was an unfinished court yard in terms of construction and landscaping, we could also view into other rooms that were under construction.

We were also under the impression that there was no swimming pool onsite at the hotel as we could not readily see any information or pictures regarding it on their website.  We were extremely disappointed to be informed at check-in that there was a swimming pool as we did not bring our swim suits.  We did visit the swimming pool to have a look at it and i have to say it looks fantastic with the little grotto's/caves incorporated into it.  This viewing only added further to our disappointment as we would have loved to have had a dip in the pool.

We also dined in The Lady Helen Michelin Starred restaurant which we were also very excited about but again left disappointed in terms of the luxurious experience we were expecting, but hey that's for another review.

Overall, in term of the expense of staying and dining in the Mount Juliet Estate, we were disappointed with our stay and took the shine off of our first wedding anniversary.  I feel it is extremely unprofessional to not even inform guests of ongoing construction works and especially to put you into a room overlooking ongoing construction and machinery.",3,2018,02,20
239,2 night break in Hunters Yard,"My wife and I stayed for 2 nights in The Hunters Yard. We had a very enjoyable stay. Key highlights:
- Room was very comfortable and bright.
- Gorgeous view of the countryside from our breakfast table.
- Staff were courteous and helpful.
- Beautiful grounds to stroll around.
Looking forward to going back soon.
Thanks for a great stay.

239,Fantastic food in lovely setting,We recently stayed in the manor house for one night and had dinner in the Lady Helen. The staff were very professional and friendly at all times and the food in the Lady Helen surpassed the high expectations we had. Highly recommend a night if you are treating yourself...,5,2018,02,19
239,Not as good as we were expecting.,"We recently spent a weekend in Hunters Yard. On arrival we were checked in by friendly staff and brought to our room by a porter. The room was lovely, but our main complaint was the lack of lighting for reading! You had to lie on the bed to have a decent light. There was no information folder is the room  to give you details of amenities in the hotel or service  times for breakfast or dinner. Also the fire alarm seemed to be faulty, it went off twice over the weekend, false alarm each time, thankfully! 
We found the food in the Hound restaurant to be hit and miss. We had dinner on both night of our stay,  and we can’t understand why an establishment like Mount Juliet can’t get the basics right, there is no excuse for food not being hot and why are the plates always cold?  Some of the waiting staff need to be better trained, especially for breakfast. We had to ask for used plates and bowls to be taken away from our table after use. Also some of the staff in the Golf Club bar really need to improve their manner! 
When we checked we were not informed that breakfast on Sunday doesn’t start till 8, we are early risers and arrived at the restaurant at 7.40 , the waitress was only getting everything ready but she did serve us . Breakfast was ok, nothing spectacular, not much of a choice of breads or cheese. Have to say that the yogurts were the highlight for us, really lovely.
The grounds are fabulous with lovely walks, really peaceful.
We did enjoy the experience of Mount Juliet , it is an expensive stay , and because of the price we expected everything to be perfect but for us it wasn’t.

 with the bathroom, which we were told are going to be resolved, no holder for the toilet paper, no where in the shower to put shampoo, soap etc. These are basic things that should have been right from day one.",3,2018,02,17
239,Great location but terrible service ,"We stayed in a lovely room in the recently refurbished/new part of the hotel. The room had a lovely decor & finish, although there were teething problems, eg sockets not working. 

However, the service was the worst I have experienced in years. I wanted room service when I arrived & had to call reception for a menu as there was none in the room. After 15 mins, I called back to make sure the menu was on the way & was told that it was. After another 15 mins I went to reception to collect it myself, but they didn’t have one to give me so I had to go back to my room to wait for it. It was another 15 mins - a full 45 mins after my request, before I received a menu. 

Then, when I called to place my order, the service deteriorated further. My call was put through to a restaurant that didn’t pick up the phone. I called back reception to let them know (& also inform about the fiasco getting a menu) and I was assured that the restaurant would call me back immediately. After 45 mins, I left my room without having received a call back to take my order. 

There were other Fawlty Towers incidents during my short stay and I had intended to discuss it with the staff when I was checking out, but I was surprised that the lady checking me out didn’t even enquire as to how my stay was. And this was from the Front Desk Manager. I took that as a fair indication of the hotels indifference to its guests & their experience. 

So, good facilities, great food in the Michelin starred restaurant, but very poor service. ",2,2018,02,17
239,STUNNING COUNTRYSIDE,"The estate at mount Juliet is very extensive,i consists of one of the best golf courses in Ireland which has a great clubhouse which is open to non members as well and serves great food and drinks with great views of the stunning Kilkenny country side,nearby there is a lovely walled garden,also there a beautiful old gentry house that is now been converted to a hotel,you can go over a small bridge that spans the nore and have a wonderful walk around a stud that breeds horses,the scenery around there is amazing.",5,2018,02,16
239,Every now and then a Hotel gets it right.,"Every now and then a Hotel gets it right. They hire the best staff, they spend money on good fittings and generally go the extra yard. The Hunters Yard Hotel in Thomastown is one such place. Built in the stable yard of the Mount Juliet Estate it is not long open but clearly decided to put the extra effort in from the start and make the whole customer experience a good one. We were greeted at reception with warmth and brought to our room and given a tour by Paudie a shining example of the Hotels policy of hire the best and reap the benefits. The room we stayed in number 167 was lovely with all the nice touches ie. bathrobes, slippers, safe and a Bewleys “pod” coffee machine. The bed was huge as was the wall mounted TV. The bathroom was nicely fitted out with under floor heating, a deep bath and separate shower with overhead shower head. We slept the sleep of the just and then enjoyed an excellent breakfast in the comfort of the cosy breakfast room/restaurant. We ate in the Hotels “The Hound” restaurant which was lovely where we were looked after by Kelly who was yet another of the Hotels “finds”.  The hotel has an indoor pool and spa and overlooks the practice green on the golf course. The estate consists of 1500 acres although the stud farm and golf course makes a fair bit of it out of bounds for walking but a short walk to the Manor House is a must. It was just reopening when we visited after doing up some rooms and again we were lucky enough to encounter Des the customer services manager who gave us a tour of the house together with some interesting history. The house is beautiful and restored to a very high standard but it’s the staffs obvious pride in their work and work place that makes the whole stay in Hunters Yard highly recommended.",5,2018,02,14
239,The Hound,"We went for dinner at The Hound and it was amazing. Brilliant service, great food. We had a bottle of prosecco - gorgeous. For starters we had chicken terrine; very tasty and full of flavour, and rustic vegetable soup - beautiful. 
For mains we had pork; great sizing, cooked to perfection, and duck; fell off the bone, complimented by the red cabbage. 
For desserts we had chocolate creme. 
Will definitely be returned - the staff couldn’t work hard enough for us, so polite, so helpful and good conversation. Well done!! ",5,2018,02,12
239,Can’t wait to go back!,Recently stayed here for a night and couldn’t have been happier. Right from the start when checking in the staff want to do everything to make your stay perfect. The rooms were great and modern but still had the country hotel feel. Had a great meal in the restaurant also so no need to venture down to Kilkenny town for those wondering whether or not to eat in the hotel.  ,5,2018,02,11
239,Disappointing!,My partner and I stayed at the new Hunters Lodge this weekend and it's safe to say we both feel incredibly disappointed. Firstly when we arrived and checked in 1.45 in the afternoon we were told our room was not ready yet. We headed to the bar and decided to watch the rugby to pass the time till our room was ready. We returned to reception 2 hours later and were taken to our room - we walk in and there are two twin beds..... Not exactly ideal for a night away with your partner. We returned to reception and explained the situation. We were given a couple of excuses and told there were no other rooms free. Eventually we were shown to another room and this one had a double bed so we took it however the bathroom was not fully finished. There was tape all over the mirror in the bathroom. We decided to head to the pool and try relax there but the pool was ice cold and no one was able to stay in it as it was freezing ( apparently the heating was broken) we were told this after my partner was charged €4 for a swim hat so we could get into the pool! The dinner menu was also another let down - very basic and extremely over priced (the waiting staff were very nice though). Overall I'd say we were totally ripped off - charged full whack even though the place looked like a building site and smelt of paint where ever you went.,2,2018,02,10
239,A new hotel within an old setting.,"We stayed for a couple of days at the Hunters Yard hotel, the work is still being completed on some of the rooms, its that new.  The work was not disruptive.  We have stayed at the manor house a number of times and always had a great experience, so we were interested to learn how this new venture would stack up against a vintage hotel.  First off, everything is new, what was the old golf club house, restaurant, bar and function room have been renovated and the spacious elegant bedrooms added.  The service was still excellent, my one disappointment, was the restaurant, The Hound.  The menu is limited, the food in the evening was ok, but priced at a premium.",4,2018,02,08
239,Lovely stay at hunters lodge,"Myself and my partner visited for an overnight stay in the new hunters lodge. The staff were helpful and friendly and the decor and inter design are beautiful, we had a delicious 3 course meal in the restaurant with wine and cocktails and can’t fault it at all. Cant wait to return.",5,2018,02,04
239,Wonderful hospitality in an idyllic location,"We enjoyed a most magical stay in late Jan, and were blessed with perfect winter weather ti enjoy the grounds. The new hotel at the resort blended country charm with some elegant urban chic, and the estates heritage was tastefully interwoven throughout. 
We were greeted with wonderful Irish hospitality at every turn, and thoroughly enjoyed our stay thanks to the warmth of service.
The new rooms were beautifully presented with elegance and charm, and delivered total silence and darkness for a great nights sleep. An early morning stroll around the estate was delightfully serene and a diverse and generous breakfast offering in the main restaurant was just the ticket to follow. We left dreaming about our next visit.....",5,2018,01,30
239,Mrs ,Spent 2 absolutely wonderful days at hounds yard @ mount Juliet . Bedrooms were spacious spotless & interesting. What a beautiful venue & what wonderful staff. Breakfast & evening meal were fab. Couldn't rate mount Juliet highly enough - should be 5 star,5,2018,01,22
239,December wedding,"Our daughter had her wedding in Thomastown church and her reception in Mount Juliet.   It was terrific.!   The guests who were staying in the hotel were well received by the efficient and friendly staff even though part of the new wing was rstill under construction.   
The welcome drinks and delicious and plenty of canapés were served in the Manor House which had already been beautifully decorated for Christmas even though it was the 1st December.    There is something quite romantic about a winter wedding!
The dinner was served in “The Stables” restaurant in The Hunters Yard which was formally known Kendal’s.    This room has been extensively renovated and catered very comfortably for our 160 guests.   The menu was superb and carefully chosen with Ken Harker the head chef.   He and his staff presented his dinner with great style and efficiency.   There is a beautiful bar beside the dining room where guests could adjourn to chat if they didn’t want to partake in the dancing and revelry.
The general manager Christine Murphy and events manager Alma were always available in the run up to the wedding and considered our requests and suggestions carefully.
Finally, the success and enjoyment of the day was by a mile,  due to the efficiency and hospitality of the wonderful staff.

239,A great family day,"Mount Juliet Estate is in lovely south Kilkenny, a few miles outside of Thomastown and a very scenic area. Just driving through the estate alone is beautiful, with well kept grounds and stunning views. 
We were welcomed to The Hound by the friendly waiting staff for our son’s Christening celebration. The Hunters Yard hotel and Hound restaurant are beautifully decorated to the highest of standards. 
When seated in the restaurant, were presented with our menu. Tables looked fantastic with candles and greenery. 
I had a piping-hot winter vegetable soup, perfect for the cold weather. Others had a beautifully presented smoked salmon starter, all produce fresh and locally sourced. For my main I had a generous cod fillet on a bed of seafood/chorizo. Amazing! The chefs took great care selecting ingredients and presenting them well. My husband had fillet of beef-again very large portion but perfectly cooked, tender and juicy. We had plenty of mash and winter root veg to accompany our meal. To cap it off, we had either winter berry pavlova or apple crumble with homemade vanilla ice-cream. Too tasty to leave behind, the crumble was delicious with a nice addition of nuts on top. We had some nice wine to accompany our food too. 
The service from Tess and the waiting team was second to none. Their patience when dealing with our large number of children was notable and they were very accommodating with our special requests. They were so attentive and looked after our large group very well. 
Finally, we retreated to the stunning bar for a few post dinner drinks. The huge open fire was very inviting and we felt very cost beside it, sampling some of the cocktails from the drinks menu. 
We had a very pleasant, enjoyable and memorable day with our family in The Hound at Hunters Yard, and I highly recommend a visit to this stunning hotel, restaurant and estate.

239,Leisure club woefully inadequate AFTER renovations,"I’m a member of Mount Juliet leisure club and was looking forward to returning this week after a closure of almost three months to inspect the “highly anticipated renovations”.  The renovations consist of walling off the changing rooms and part of the reception area to convert them into bedrooms.  The changing rooms have been shoe horned into part of the already undersized gym.  They are woefully inadequate with very little space to get changed in and no privacy at all in the showers.  

The remaining space has not been touched so the dirty, stained and sagging drapery above the pool is still there, as is the ugly and distinctly grotty “grotto” in one corner of the pool.  The windows are still filthy.  This is not a five star facility by any stretch of the imagination and I won’t be renewing my membership.  I have given two stars to reflect the stoicism of the lovely staff who must be feeling very dispirited after a three month layoff.",2,2018,01,05
239,Needs to Re-evaluate,"This was our 4th visit to MJ (in 5 years). Either the service is dropping or I'm getting too critical. 
There is still no street-lighting to the Hound. Are the insurers happy with this?
In the Hound, the opening time said 5 but the restaurant manager told us 5:30 upon arrival. Ok, not a problem. He said wait in the bar and he'll call us in due course. That never happened, so at 5:50 I had to chase up a table despite it being near empty and he ambling about seemingly aimless.
The Manor House bar has a nice fire, but a rather disinterested barman  (NOT the guy with the glasses). 
We dined another night in the Lady Helen. A few minor errors creeping in to Michellin service but largely pleasant. 
Overall, service was without a smile  (with the exception of Niamh and Aga in the LH). I've no idea is there something behind that but MJ need remember they're 4 star and charging us 220 a night. 
Our bill, delivered devoid of warmth or a smile wasn't much change out of 800 for 2 nights. We stayed in Ashford Castle last month for a little more and got disproportionally more. 
I'm not vilifying MJ, but we've been there in the recession and as the economy improves the prices go up and service resembles 3 star. 

 ",3,2018,01,03
239,Disappointing ,"Stayed in the Manor House on New Years Eve.Whilst the grounds at Mount Juliet are fantastic and we enjoyed a horseback trail ride, the bar areas and service throughout really let the experience down.The first point to mention is the ridiculous late check in time of 4pm.At this time of year when it gets dark at 4.30pm this check in time is too late.We had to wait in wet and damp dirty clothes after the trail ride and couldn't take a shower.We decided to for the majors bar for lunch...I can only describe this as the most disorganised unprofessional service I have ever encountered.We placed the most simple order of two coffees and two soups...the coffees arrived after 10 minutes and it took an astonishing further 50 minutes for  two bowls of soup. We had to ask three different staff members where it was and apparently there was an issue with the electronic ordering system and the order hasn't been processed.Could the waiter who took the order not have used some initative and wondered why the order which he took had never arrived and checked with the kitchen?. All the while we are watching other people who arrived after us receiving their orders. A family seated near us waited over 30 minutes for two hit chocolates. Finally we got to pay...another ordeal with staff again confused and using calculators.....we payed 17.40 for two tiny bowls of soup and two coffees.Eventually we got to our room....nice size and view but a few issues  with the lights intermittently failing and I suppose a potential danger with a partially exposed socket....especially if a child was attempting to plug in a device.My package included prosecco on arrival....this was not offered I had to go and ask and was told it is not normally offerd on arrival, you can get it any time?????.It was stated on arrival in my booking confirmation.Is the wbole idea not to welcome you on arrival - like what a true  prestige resort offers. There is no atmosphere at all in the majors bar....and I think maybe 3 or 4 drinks available on draft, no Budweiser,no coors light  etc.There is another bar a very dangerous 10 minute walk away.You have to ask to use the shuttle service.. .it was never offered to us and I think stops at 11.We walked back to our room at 1am....very dangerous when dark with cars driving by. The last major gripe is you will not be able to get any food whatsoever after the restaurant closes.I asked for some crisps and was told they had run out in the two hotels.....almost laughable,couldn't get a sandwich or a simple plate of chips even.So all in all beautiful grounds but the service and atmosphere in the place really let's it down.....value for money is just not present. I have stayed in many prestige places both in Ireland and abroad.....Mount Juliet really failed the quality test overall.The two positives where the Lady Helen restaurant( which I felt I had to review separately as so not to be tarnished by this review) and the horseback trail ride.",3,2018,01,02
239,Disappointing lunch,"Our group consisted of 14 for lunch in the Hound Hunter's Yard to celebrate Christmas holidays. The restaurant was not busy. Most of the groupwere happy with their food. I however, was disappointed. I ordered sausage with puy lentil & onion gravy. I love puy lentils & hoped this would be similar to Cassoulet. When it arrived the sausages were served with a barley gravy. I mentioned to the waiter that it was supposed to be lentils, & that I cannot eat barley. I also said I would order something else if there was a problem. He insisted on changing it & getting lentils. He returned around 15mins later with just sausage & gravy.  No explanation was given.  Because I was in the large group I didn't wish to make another fuss. It was disappointing. Maybe  my expectations were too high, but I would have appreciated an explanation at the outset & alternative options offered.  ",2,2017,12,26
239,Break before Christmas,"We stayed in the Manor House for a couple of nights before Christmas, the room was good but does need a upgrade as does the bathroom. The staff were lovely and special mention to Paudie the porter.
Breakfast was good and we had dinner in the hound restaurant one night very good service and food.
Would recommend  this hotel and would go back. It was quite and very relaxing at this time of year.",4,2017,12,25
239,was still under construction,"With one night away per year alone without kids, I chose Mount Juliet for a much needed break as it was somewhere i had always wanted to visit. We stayed in Hunters yard, the new hotel on the grounds. I was aware it was newly constructed and gathered  there was still some construction work ongoing. I assumed this work would be away from where the guests were currently being accommodated. This was not the case.We were called a few days prior to arrival to inform there was no leisure centre open. Which was a bad start as I had checked that mount juliet had a leisure centre before booking as this is something I was looking for specifically as last few times away have been unable to use sauna due to pregnancy. However, I was not informed that the site was very much still a work in progress. On arrival on a cold night, firstly the signage was not great to find Hunters Yard. Secondly, we were assigned a room directly overlooking the construction site under our windows. Instead of golf or estate views we had views of bulldozers and a lot of noise that afternoon evening and on the Saturday morning. It was just not the peaceful place I thought it would be. It is like part of the new hotel is almost finished and second part is still under construction and we were stuck in middle. In my opinion it is very cheeky to charge (a considerable amount)for rooms in the current half finished facility. Left a very bad impression for me and my choice left my husband disappointed. The corridors went from warm to freezing. The room was nicely appointed, well decorated, spacious with large comfortable beds. They will be a nice visit when the whole place is complete. Bathroom was a bit plain white for my taste and didnt have a luxury feel. It felt unfinished. The shower was powerful but the screen and design didnt stop water spraying out to the bathroom floor. On the plus side the staff were all welcoming and accommodating, service was good throughout, cocktails were different and tasty, our dinner in the Hound was delicious and filling, as was our breakfast, views from the Hound were great, and the estate itself wonderful for a peaceful walk or cycle. We visited the main house and had coffee in the bar which again had fantastic views. However, overall bitterly disappointed that I chose here for a rare special trip away.",2,2017,12,20
239,Great lunch,We were among the few diners on a snowy day here- so the service was excellent. Great Sunday lunch- excellent roast beef with tons of extras. I wasn't impressed by a rather oily vegetable soup and there was only a white ciabatta-type bread. Lovely vegetable sides though. The coffee was not up to scratch but overall most things were delicious in a beautiful setting.,4,2017,12,10
239,Still under construction,"We stayed one night in December, a weekend in the newly built Hunters Lodge. We were here a year ago also and the construction was just starting, this is a large project.

The food, as usual was fantastic in Mount Juliet. The new bedrooms are stunning, but it is form over function. The electrical setup in particular is very odd. 14 light switches in the room. 10 of them appear to do nothing at all. One main switch by the door powers the room on or off, but there is no individual switch for the bathroom, it is on the same circuit as the ceiling lights and lamps. Which means, if you need to pee at 6am, your partner better enjoy all the lights being switched on. Wifi didn't work. No cellphone coverage at all. No toilet roll holders, no shelf in shower for shampoo or soap. Maybe it's not finished. We got paint on our shoes and sleeves from stepping over painters who were engaged to be there at 9:00am on a Saturday morning. Bizaar scheduling, just as every guest in the hotel heads to breakfast. 

Pool was closed. I've included the view from the bedroom and the breakfast room, as well as the bedroom and the breakfast buffet. 

I love mount juliet, but my goodness those works are disruptive.",3,2017,12,10
239,The Hound Restaurant,"Had Sunday Lunch at ‘ The Hound’.
The location is superb. Lovely walks.
Newly decorated. Very comfortable. Lovely relaxing armchairs and it was really warm and cosy. The views across the golf course are lovely.
Staff are really friendly and helpful and obviously well trained.
The lunch menu is somewhat limited and if fish wasnt your thing on our visit the choice is restrictive.We had roast of the day. Very good, nicely presented and the cranberry sauce was really delicious...homemade, chunky and nicely sweet. We asked for butter and were given a lovely cube in individual portions...no foil wrapped portions here.
The plumb with mascarpone was delicious for dessert. It would have been nicer if the fruit was a little lukewarm with some sweet stickey juice. It was served with lovely brittle shortbread. 
It is not cheap but about what could be expected in a place of this calibre. Wine is a tad too expensive however.
Overall..a lovely experience. Will definitely return.",4,2017,12,05
239,Was not expecting to stay at a construction site,"We spent a Friday night at Hunter's lodge. We arrived at 3pm and checked into our room. Upon walking into the room, our view out the patio doors was builders directly outside our room. I gave the benefit of the doubt that the building would finish that evening so went into Kilkenny and had a lovely evening there. However, we were awoken the next morning just before 8am by the same builders back, this time operating a JCB and using shovels. This was not what I was expecting from a county getaway! Added to this the fitness centre was also not open. I told this to reception on checking out that it ruined my stay and was offered a drink in the bar at 10am, which was ridiculous and inappropriate! Then I was told that the Revenue manager would be in touch about my complaint but have not heard anything from them. In conclusion, avoid the place until construction is complete.",1,2017,11,29
239,Old world charm,We have stayed in Mt. Juliet on several occasions both in the main house and the Hunters lodge and thoroughly enjoyed our visits.  This visit was no exception even though we were disappointed that the pool was closed for renovations.  We did not know this until we arrived as we had booked online and there was no notice on the site.  However we enjoyed our two nights and had wonderful dinners in both the Lady Helen and Hunters lodge.  Wonderful chefs in both places and we look forward to returning.  Great staff.,5,2017,11,26
239,AMAZING SERVICE,"I went here as part of a group of 4 for a 2 night spa break.  We stayed in the Manor House which is beautiful and as for the staff there are no words.  Nothing was too much trouble, the concierge service was also outstanding and they ran us around pretty much on demand (the estate is 500 acres). We had a great meal at the Hunters Yard Restaurant and breakfast every morning was cooked fresh, none of the awful hot buffet breakfasts here.
We had a great stay and every one of our party are planning on returning.",5,2017,11,23
239,A lot done but more to do,We stayed last weekend at the newly opened Hunter's Yard in the grounds of Mt Juliet. There are so many good things about the newly opened extension.  There  are beautifully furnished bedrooms with such comfortable beds and a lovely bathroom with a heated floor & lovely tiles. There is a French window on to a small balcony overlooking the beautiful Kilkenny countryside. Lots of things to be sorted out e.g. Lights in the bedroom crazy system. Corridors freezing. Breakfast chaos far too small for all the guests & they still have more rooms to go! We found staff very friendly but restaurant staff in particular  need more training. Getting there.,3,2017,11,21
239,Country club resort and 5 star hotel in rural Kilkenny neighbouring a stud farm and fishing river,"Mount juliet is set in park land not far from Kilkenny city.

It has a Michelin starred restaurant. The hotel has horse riding facilities and a spa and golf course. 

Hound restaurant has an award winning chief. Popular with golfers and tourists. 

The hotel is popular for afternoon tea.",5,2017,11,12
239," Had higher expectations... what a disappointment!","Overall I have to say I was disappointed with most things about my stay here! The staff generally seemed unhappy (certainly not friendly anyway especially the two at the pool, they’d want to be giving them some customer service training!). Not even a hello to us when when arrived, never mind a smile. I was surprised as the 4 star hotels I’ve been to were better than this 5 star! 

The pool temperature was slightly too cold and needs to be adjusted. There was also unsightly mould which there can be no excuse for. I did enjoy my massage, however the relaxation room is extremely small (maybe 1.5m by 3m if that even) though and you literally feel like you sitting on top of the next person so doesn’t feel “relaxing”. The bedroom we stayed at was nice & spacious, traditionally decorated and again spacious bathroom separated from the bedroom. 

Food at dinner was good. I enjoyed the “Dizzy” cocktail at the Bar. The only negative thing was that around 12.30 (I think) The Barman said he couldn’t make cocktails anymore, which I do not think is unreasonable to expect from a 5 star venue! They probably just needed more staff on. 

Breakfast was lovely, a good selection. I ordered a simple hot breakfast and the waitress got it wrong, she did apologise however seemed a little overwhelmed. Lovely views from the room though. 

Given the choice unfortunately I would not return! Sorry Mt Juliet but you are so behind other 4/5 star properties, you need to up your game!

239,A true five star experience ,Myself and my wife recently visited here for two nights. Everything was incredible. From the beautiful grounds to the food to the hotel itself. Could not recommend it highly enough. The golf course is the best I have ever played on and the staff couldn't be more helpful it was truly an experience we will not forget. ,5,2017,11,09
239,Old World charm,"I recently spent a few days relaxing in the old Manor House with my wife. The whole experience oozed friendly and welcoming comfort & luxury. Our bedroom was very comfortable. The Majors Bar is a perfect place to while away a few hours in front of a beautiful open fire. The grounds of the estate are picturesque & plentiful, allowing you to take long walks or even try some horse riding. We really enjoyed the whole experience",5,2017,11,07
239,Not even close to Ready for Prime Time,"First, disclaimers: The overall Estate and the Main House are lovely, but we stayed at their ""Hunter's Yard"" facility, which is now basically a Golf Club and I am not a golfer, so the potential charms of that aspect were lost on me. That said, my wife and I were VERY disappointed by our stay. 
To be fair, we did get a call before we arrived mentioning that there were some ""renovations"" going on that shouldn't affect us but they wanted to let us know, and we, expecting they would be off somewhere in another part of the Estate said we were okay with that. They turned out to be a full-blown remodeling and expansion of the building we were staying in, and when we parked in the Lot, as another visitor has mentioned, we couldn't even FIND the lodging-building for all the construction equipment, fences and disruption, not to mention there wasn't a single sign directing guests from the parking lot to the entrance, all the while the regular country club members treated us like annoying obstacles (The photo I enclose was from halfway to the entrance, where at least it is VISIBLE in the distance, whereas it was not even apparent which way to go from the lot when we arrived). When we did find it, the check-in service was unctuous but not particularly helpful and while the room itself was technically completed, it was sparsely, if prettily appointed, and the the spaces leading to, from and around it were totally bare and in fact NOT FINISHED (more photos), and what decorations there are are tacky: plastic plants in the restaurant, etc.. Examples of the 'sparse', 'not helpful' aspects were that there was only one luggage rack in the room, so the bellman just left my wife's bag on the floor, there was a storage-pole but no mounted toilet-paper holder in the bathroom, leaving us reaching down to the (heated!) floor when we needed it, and the wifi was inconsistent as well, forcing me to go down to the 'lobby' to get a good enough signal to plan the next-day's driving, and the drain in the shower wasn't up to the fixture's flow so we had to run the shower at half-flow to keep from overflowing the stall. When we mentioned all this at check-out, our observations were attentively, if somewhat superciliously noted, but no accommodation of any sort was offered. 
And while again the restaurant at the main house may be good, the one at the ""Hunter's Yard"", while earnestly run, was quite disappointing as well. As other reviewers have noted, the food is mediocre, which is way below average for our experience in Ireland. 
All in all it was very pretentious and is clearly shooting to be a top-notch Trump-style Golf Club some day, but it was not ready for occupancy and should never have been let out in it's current condition.",1,2017,10,26
239,Surpassed expectations,"We were traveling with our 1.5 year old, and needed suite options so that my husband and I could hang out beyond our son's 7:30 bedtime. We booked the Rose Garden Suites not entirely sure what to expect since pictures on the website are very limited. The living room was a little dated, but what it lacked in decor it made up for in size! The place was basically a palatial estate with a huge foyer, giant living room, full dining room, kitchen, and two bedrooms, both with ensuites. We had only booked for one night and my husband immediately requested we extend another evening. The staff was just lovely - extremely helpful and polite. We ordered dinner delivered to our room - it was prompt, hot, and DELICIOUS (the sauce on the sea bass is unreal). And the following morning we explored the grounds which are serene and everything you'd hope for in Ireland. My husband had wanted to see the falcons, but that was cancelled due to rain (probably a pretty common occurrence!!) - but otherwise we had zero complaints. I'd return in a heartbeat.",5,2017,10,26
239,Dinner at Lady Helen,"Attended  a dinner with large group of professional females 23/20/17. Dinner was lovely - venison was  succulent and delicious. Ok starter of truffle ravioli. Delicate custard tart for dessert. Private dining room was great for mixing and chatting. Only sour note was the young male manager for the evening-  very poorly welcoming , not gracious as we arrived.I was left  to search for a waiter for a pre dinner aperitif-manager pointed me in the direction of waiter -didn't even get up to help- not worthy of a five star hotel ! ",3,2017,10,25
239,AMAZING PROPERTY...BUT,"First, let me start off with this...Mount Juliet the property is absolutely AMAZING!  It's gorgeous and everything you think Ireland should be!  My family of four, children 11 &14, loved the property, had so much fun walking around the property and our lodge accommodations were fantastic and very large for a family of four!  My complaints about the property is that they were not overly friendly at either desk area at check in.  We also had terrible service in the golf course restaurant...and they seemed hesitant to even seat us.  The food was just o.k., one of the worst we had in Ireland, and that's saying a lot, because the food in general there, was FANTASTIC!  My husband and children were also treated rather poorly going to the pool.  They were made to buy swimming caps and had to be very quiet.  I guess the pool is part of the country club for members but maybe hotel guests could have their own special ""fun"" time as well...otherwise the pool should just be off limits to guests.  It was not fun for them!  These few service issues are why I didn't give this property five stars...it's just rather pretentious.  Would I stay there again? YES!  But now I would have a different outlook going in!",4,2017,10,20
239,Expected better than Average,"In giving this review, I am making allowances for the fact that we stayed here post Ophelia.
 I rang the previous day to say that we would actually be down there early afternoon and would appreciate if we could check in earlier than the 4pm check-in time.
We arrived at 1pm and went for a walk in the beautiful grounds for two hours. 
It was a perfect day after the storm. We went back at 3.30 and the room wasn't ready. I know the check-in time is 4pm but we really felt there was absolutely no effort made to accommodate us. We got checked in at 3.45pm.
When we did get into our room - we were very disappointed at the size of the room. Its a Superior Double.... if this is a Superior Id don't know what the ""Standard"" room is like. The beds are so small and not suitable for 2 adults. I suggest taking some of the clutter out of the Rooms and put in a proper double or King bed. A good nights sleep is a must. Unlike previous review from Tarlam- our room was spotless.
So after the nice walk- we wanted to go for a swim only to be told that the Swimming Pool is closed due to remedial work after the storm. Now we completely understand that this is out of their control but we should have been informed. Having a swimming pool is a must for us when we a choosing a break away. This left us at a loose end for a couple of hours Again no gesture was made to make up for the fact that there was no Swimming Pool available to us. It could be a small gesture like the offer of a Coffee or some discount on our bill. After all this is one of the important facilities that we were paying for. We would normally go for a swim when we are away, before the breakfast so this was not available to us the following morning. 
We rang Reception after lunch on Wednesday to make sure that the Pool is reopening at 3,30 that afternoon as advised. The receptionist said it was- I asked her did she know what time it will stay opened  - she said she thought 6pm??? She said she will check it out and call me back. I got no call. We passed through Reception and I cant say that the Receptionist was run off her feet so much that she couldn't have found out. She apologised that it slipped her mind.
When we did get to the Pool - the signage for it is very poor but found it eventually.
We ate in Hunters Yard on Tuesday evening and it was first class.
Wednesday we ate in Bassetts in Thomastown and it was wonderful. I would highly recommend both.
Staff in MJ were very nice especially in the Dining Room - Anne Marie is a pure professional - a great person to have managing there.
My husband forgot his Golf Clubs and enquired about hiring some clubs to use in the Driving Range - He was told by the guy in the Clubhouse that there was no facility to hire some Clubs. Why Not???
Last thing - water dispenser at reception was  full only once while we were there..
On the whole we were disappointed and it did not measure up to other Blue Book experiences that we have had.",3,2017,10,19
239,"Mount ""Fantastic"".Estate","Had a two night stop here as part of a tour. Can't really describe how nice the grounds and facilities are. The room we had was very nice and most comfortable. The bathroom was huge and the decor was pure luxury. The restaurant was very nice and the food was superb. They had a great continental breakfast buffet as well as menu item. The staff was very friendly and seemed anxious to see to our every need. The dinner menu was quite adequate and the food was delicious. My only criticism of the dining area would be the carpet is long past its prime and needs to be replaced. We had a falconry lesson as part of our stay and it was awesome. The birds, Ozzie and Maggie were majestic and John, their handler was very knowledgeable. The total experience was one of warmth and comfort, well worth the stop.

239,No singe. Bring a map,"I have just checked in for a two day conference.Initial impression very  unfavourable.Its 11.30.
Room won't be ready till 4.
No signage to direct guests from car park to hotel. I walked around in the rain trying to find reception.Building works in progress.Reception staff apologetic.
Still no access to room and I am disappointed and damp.
Definately not blue book standard.Hopefully will get better over the two days .",1,2017,10,19
239,A disappointing weekend in a most beautiful setting.,"We have been to Mount Juliet on a couple of occasions before over the years all wonderful experiences.  What a stunning location, grounds and house...
Unfortunately that is where the heaven ended for us on this visit-
We walked into our room to a smell of 'must/dampness', so hurriedly opened the windows, there was no 'awe' in our bedroom; beds were extremely shabbily made, a pillow case had been left thrown on the dresser; stains on the bed stools; mould in the shower; a filthy toilet roll holder - both rust & dirt.  
This is not 'blue book' quality; and at this stage I have stayed in most of the blue book locations in the country.
On asking for a manager to come to the room, we met Des the Guest Liaison manager, a lovely friendly gentleman.  He took photographs, agreed standard was very poor and then brought in the cleaning lady, in front of us guests, to show her the problems.  
This was most uncomfortable, embarrassing and in my opinion extremely unprofessional.
Afternoon tea for the 3 of us was at 2 small tightly sqeezed together Round tables; fair enough we did not reserve a table, however on seeing a larger space available in the room we did ask could we be moved.  We were told this had been reserved for this particular time.  1 1/2 hours later still nobody arrived at the large table sitting, and yet we were not moved.. service was poor at tea; and many times we had to run into the bar to ask for teas coffees, side plates...
The following morning the House keeping manager offered us an afternoon tea on the house, however we had made our plans for the day and were just heading out the door.
The Lady Helen was beautiful, however we were disappointed that neither beef, pork, chicken or lamb were included in any main course.  If you don't like Game, then perhaps eat elsewhere.
I don't like to be negative, but on this occasion it can't be helped unfortunately.
All the staff were lovely people, very friendly, willing to help.  Special praise we would give to 'Anne Marie' (I hope the name is correct, a lovely blonde lady).  Anne Marie supervised the breakfasts and lunches - breakfast was spectacular.  When it comes to staff Anne Marie stood out on her own.

I felt aggrieved to be honest having spent a 4 figure sum at Mount Juliet for our 2 night stay (all in), and based on our experience won't revisit.  
Mount Juliet are building a second hotel on the grounds at the moment, but in my opinion should be spending their money fixing the issues they have in the main house before embarking on another venture.

It is not okay for the House keeping manager to tell us 'the rooms on our floor are badly in need of refurbishment'.. why put us in this type of room??

It is not okay to correct and embarrass the cleaning lady in front of guests in their room..

In my opinion most Staff are not equipped and trained to deal with issues, and there seemed to be a distinct lack of any senior management on duty that particular weekend.",3,2017,10,18
239,"didnt stay, but we ate here","we visited again this year, this time we didn't stay but we had a beautiful meal,.  Staff extremely friendly and nothing too much bother for them, they made you feel at home  and made our visit comfortable and relaxing. well done and keep up the good work, from some satisfied customers.",5,2017,10,15
239,Gorgeous place and amazing staff,"We came here a while back - a large family with men golfing and women spa-ing. Both were absolutely amazing! I thoroughly enjoyed the stay, we were in the houses and suited us greatly. The kids had loads of room to play and run around and there was no hassle from the hotel that the kids were enjoying themselves. Would highly recommend!",5,2017,10,12
239,Golf heaven,"I played golf at Mount Juliet for the first time a little while ago and it is an excellent course. From the moment you arrive through the front gates you know you are in a classy establishment. Staff throughout are professional, polite and helpful. Although it was very busy there was no sense of anyone rushing or anything being a problem. We didn't stay over but can highly recommend the course for all levels of golfer. It is in superb condition and well worth the trip down.",5,2017,10,05
239,Total relaxation ! ,"This is a beautiful resort!  I have stayed here twice and each time was particularly lovely. The grounds are gorgeous and so well kept the staff are as friendly as your going to get as they go out of their way to help you with your every need. 
The rooms are very comfortable clean and they usually come with a beautiful view of the grounds I really enjoyed the surroundings. 
There are different activities you can do while your there I actually did falconry and as I had never done this before I was really excited and impressed with my experience with such beautiful animals.
All in all I'd stay here as long as I was allowed! It's beautiful romantic relaxing fun and a magical little getaway! ",5,2017,10,04
239,Wonderful as always,"Enjoyed our second stay at this lovely facility.  If you have the time request a tour of the grounds from Des.  His knowledge of the history and ability to exude his warm personality are so welcoming!!  The gardens, the fox hound kennel, and of course the fairy woods are both interesting and fun!  ",5,2017,10,04
239,Exquisite,"Our visit to Mount Juliet was truely an exquisite experience !  The attention to detail given to every square inch of this 500 (once 1500) acre estate is exceptional. We stayed in the Rose Garden Lodge, a two bedroom, two bathroom 'Townhouse' with kitchen, separate dining area and living room with fireplace, a vertible home from home. Kitchen was supplied with tea/coffee and milk, sugar, water all available. Beds and Linens were all comfortable and immaculate. The only disappointment of our trip was not being able to dine at the Michelin Star Lady Helen Restaurant - booked months in advance. Hunters Restaurant is new to the recent expansion of the Hotel, it is very good and we highly recommend it, however with a little more time it will surely improve immensely! Overall our stay at Mount Juliet was an unforgettable experience and we look forward to returning often!",5,2017,10,03
239,Amazing Place. Must Visit At Least Once.,"Everything about our stay was picture-perfect. The only small comment that we had was that the waitstaff seemed a bit overwhelmed and at times slower than what we would have liked, forgetting orders etc. But they always had a smile, so that was appreciated over a few extra minutes.

We had a large group of 15 and booked an assortment of Rose Garden and Manor House rooms. My only comment here would be for the hotel to publish more pictures on their website, but I guess they wanted to surprise the guests. The Rose Garden units were much larger and nicer than anticipated and the Manor House units were gorgeous. 

We did a variety of things - fishing with Shayne (who was great fun), golf, and falconry. The spa and pool area was nice but could use some updating (and from what I understand this is happening very soon).

In summary - a fantastic place that hopefully only improves with the new construction.",5,2017,09,28
239,A splurge that is worth it,"Although not handicapped, we were given a handicapped accessible room in the main house because of the size of our tour group.  The bathroom was definitely designed for a handicapped person with a large stall shower, no tub, and grab bars in several places.  There was a French door that led to a lovely walled garden, and attractive and comfortable furnishings. We enjoyed the meals we had in the Lady Helen dining room but advise you to skip Hunter's Yard because of the poor quality of service there. We took a class in falconry with a great instructor and well trained birds. What fun!  The hotel is well located for day trips to Jerpoint Abbey and Kilkenny.",5,2017,09,27
239,Lovely Estate - super surroundings ,"The Manor House is lovely and the golf course definitely worth playing. A great place to stay to explore the surrounding history. 

Formal dining in St Helens Restaurant for a special occasion and the Hunters Yard Restaurant is good for more casual dining. 

We stayed in the Rose Garden Lodges which gave us the freedom of dining out or dining in. 

This is such a lovely old Estate with charming walks through the Room se Garden and back down to the front of the main House. 

Hunters Yard Hotel is in construction so this was the only downside to our stay with unavoidable heavy traffic and noise from the site. ",5,2017,09,23
239,Superb as ever ! ,"Great visit for bday .  . Lovely garden room in the old house - my favourite . I love the smell of the fires during the colder months here . 

Welcome drink and glass of champagne at dinner on the house - very sweet and appreciated . Thank you 😊👍👍👍
Food was fab , Scallops , lamb and deconstructed tiramisu - some lovely Abarino to wash it down . Excellent service . 

I come here frequently as it's always reliable in terms of atmosphere , service , great good and the friendly Irish hospitality which cannot be beaten . 

",5,2017,09,16
239,Stunning Beautiful Amazing ,What an amazing hospitality experience. Off the beaten path Mount Juliet is located in the beautiful city of Kilkenny. The surroundings of this Manor House Estate is breathtaking. I stayed here for a destination wedding for 3 days with a wedding party of 45 guests from all around the world. The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly tending to every need. Breakfast was great and varied and the food from the Lady Helen restaurant for the wedding day was out of this world. The Manor House itself was very well maintained the rooms were classically decorated. The bed was one of the best I've ever slept in. And those pillows just WOW. The only negative I would have is that the rooms did not have a small refrigerator which would have been an added bonus. An all round amazing location for a weekend luxury break and perfect location for a destination wedding. ,5,2017,09,13
239,Amazing afternoon tea,"Booked in for afternoon tea with friends. One of the best and most luxurious afternoon teas we ever had. The food was truly delicious; scones were superb. The staff were also very polite and friendly. Overall though very pricey, it was well worth the money for such an amazing afternoon. Will definitely return again.",5,2017,09,09
239,Avoid for afternoon tea,"I recently had afternoon tea in Mount Juliet. It was a very disappointing experience.  I sent two emails to the hotel raising the following points and did not even receive an acknowledgement:

- When I booked I was never told that there was a wedding on that day and that we would be in the room where the drinks reception was.  As soon as we realised this, we wanted to finish before the wedding party arrived as there were no other non wedding guests in the room.   I would rather have been told about the wedding so that I could have booked for a different day. 

- I was told I could only book for 3pm or 5pm that day.  I'm not sure why this was as there were only 2 other people in the room when we arrived and no other people arrived before the wedding! We would have booked for earlier had we known there was going to be a wedding there. 

- It was evident that the wedding was the priority of the staff.  There were delays in our service and I had to go up to pay the bill myself in the end.  I accept the wedding being a priority however we should have been informed at time of booking.

- The afternoon tea was for my mother's birthday.  I had included this in my booking email.  There was no reference to this on the day.  We go for afternoon tea for her birthday every year.  In the Merrion, happy birthday was written on her dessert plate,  in the Westbury she received an additonal dessert with both hotels wishing her a happy birthday.   I thought it was very disappointing that no similar effort was made in Mount Juliet and that her birthday was not even acknowledged through a simple ""happy birthday"".  There is no comparison between the service we received in Mount Juliet versus that of the Merrion and the Westbury.

I have previously stayed in Mount Juliet but would be reluctant to do so again.   ",1,2017,09,08
239,Wonderful,"We stayed here for a family wedding and had an excellent time. The hotel is of the highest standard in every respect. Set in magnificent grounds incorporating a championship golf course the views are magnificent. What lifts this hotel is the friendliest, most helpful and attentive staff who can't do enough for the guests.",5,2017,09,04
239,Stole my heart. ❤️,"I'm going to find it very difficult to put into words to tell you how much I loved Mount Juliet. We were invited to a wedding for a four day event from England, apart from looking on line we had no I idea what to expect. From the minute we arrived I was blown away with the beautiful views, the hotel and everything about  it. It is perfect, from the very friendly helpful staff, the grounds and the decor. There was nothing I didn't like about it. This hotel has 32 room which I believe are all unique, the lounge/ bar area is beautiful so welcoming with large a open fire. The dining areas are equally as stunning with high ceilings and a very large open fire. Every room has beautiful views, however the river view is what blow me away. I understand Mount Juliet was built in the 18th Century on 15,000 acres, which is a stud farm. You can go horse riding, fly fishing, play golf, go on beautiful walks or just enjoy the amazing atmospheric beauty of the hotel. The restaurant is Michelin star and dinner, breakfast and lunch was delicious. I loved it so much I didn't even want to leave to see anything else in Ireland. It would be just as lovely in the winter when the weather isn't so great. I plan to go back for Christmas. The staff were all so lovely however Des and Ann Marie spent a lot of time explaining the history of the hotel which my husband and I found so interesting. I have stayed in many hotels and I can honestly stay this was most definitely the nicest. I really can't wait to return, its stunning! ",5,2017,09,03
239,Awsome place,"I love it, it is the most beautiful place in Ireland, staff are very kind and helpful. Hope to come back on the winter cause it probably looks even better. I strongly recommend this place for honey mooners, it's quite and peaceful.",5,2017,08,30
239,Charming ,"I love Mount Juliet. 
We stayed in the old house and our room was very nice. 
The staff are friendly and helpful.
We dined in the Lady Helen and ordered the tasting menu, the atmosphere was fabulous and the setting beautiful, however the portions were a little small.
Lunch in the Golf Club was lovely.
I found the Spa to be very disappointing, its  a massive inconvenience to have the Spa in a separate building from the swimming pool.
I would have expected these amenities to be under one roof.
I also noticed that some of the furniture had become a little shabby, However I was informed that the estate was changing hands and there are massive plans to upgrade the Hotel and Clubhouse.
I look forward to the completion, A freshen up will make this charming hotel even more stunning.",5,2017,08,21
239,Splendid Stay,Every wish is taken care of at the Mount Juliet. The rooms are nicely  appointed with historic charm. The restaurants are very good and the service is impeccable.  The bartenders are very good at recommending whiskeys and drinks. The outside grounds are beautiful and very walkable. It is great to take the bridge and see the horses and cows. ,5,2017,08,17
239,Wedding in the Manor House Mount Juliet,"We celebrated a very small intimate wedding in the Lady Helen Restaurant in Manor House last weekend. I really could not fault the staff or the location. Everything was simply wonderful and we were extremely lucky with the weather which also helps. The canapés were mouth watering - a lot of my guests commented on how tasty they were. The meal was delicious from start to finish, and the service and attention to my guests was second to none. My whole wedding party enjoyed the occasion immensely and we are hoping to go back next year for my Dad's birthday.
I had 12 kids at my wedding ranging in ages from 15 weeks to 12 years. Mount Juliet organised 4 babysitters for me and they were excellent. The kids had a ball. As we sat drinking our champagne on the lovely lawn the kids played football in front of us. Everyone was taken care of so well.
Our reception meal was in the Parlour room, off the Lady Helen Restaurant. The views from this room are simply stunning. And the room itself is exquisite. All the bedrooms in the manor house are beautifully finished and very comfortable. 
The day after the wedding we rode bikes (free to use) around the estate. Both my husband agreed that this was our favourite part of the weekend. It is so peaceful being around the horses and country side. It's really a must do if you go there. I also went horse riding with my nieces and nephews in the equestrian centre - this again I could not fault. The kids loved it. 
I did not play golf on this occasion in Mount Juliet but I have previously and the course is excellent. The new club house is ideal for hungry tired golfers and again is very comfortable.
Mount Juliet is also only 15 mins away from Kilkenny, it is easy to get to from Dublin and Cork and the near by village of Thomastown is very quaint.
For me, it's one of my favourite places in Ireland. You can do everything in the Estate - Golfing, cycling, horse riding, swimming, spa activities, falconry, fishing, running, walking, tennis, actuary, fairy trails, playgrounds for kids - the Hotel and staff have thought of everything. It's a no brainer to go and visit and I can't wait to go back there again. 
If you are travelling from abroad, I would recommend that you have a hired car. There is lovely countryside around the estate and places like Graigneunamanagh, Inisteoige, Kilkeeny City, Thomastown and Bennetsbridge is worth the visit. It's a bonus obviously if you get the weather, but it's such a cosy charming peaceful place that it is also really lovely in the rain too!! Thanks for reading and make sure you go!",5,2017,08,17
239,club house steak sandwich,"my brother and I had a steak sandwich in the club house there on the 3rd of aug.Not to be repeated and an embarrassment to such a great establishment.The steak was tiny,and the chips must have been cooked several times over,and they were far from fresh.My brother plays golf and has played there,and definitely its a beautiful place but the food let it down completely.",1,2017,08,17
239,Off the beaten path,"Historical property that is impressive in beauty and size.  Downside is you are reasonably far from Kilkenny so you are staying on property.  One very small Michelin rated restaurant that we could not get reservations for, the other two dinning options are part of the golf center, which were average at best.",3,2017,08,12

239,"Mount Juliet ""The Hound"" restaurant","The Hound restaurant is just one multiple dining options when staying in the Mount Juliet Hotel or in one of the cottages on the Estate. The restaurant is spacious, the ambience is very pleasant and the Staff are most attentive. Although the menu is short and hardly creatively exciting, it's far better than what one encounters throughout most of Ireland. All members of our party of four where satisfied with their meals and I enjoyed a very good quality sirloin steak. Prices were about what I expected in a restaurant of this class. My sirloin steak cost around 29 euro.",4,2017,07,30
239,Destination in itself,This place is an amazing destination - so pretty and with such an interesting history. Our only regret is that we were only there for one night. The service all round was exceptional and thanks to Des for the personalized tour of the Estate - as first time visitors to Ireland it was a great couple of hours. Thanks also to the porter who carried our bags all the way up to the top floor - it was a beautifully relaxing view over the river. Non golfers but will definitely recommend.,5,2017,07,30
239,Beautiful old manor house hotel,"While construction at the newer hotel building distracted from the overall impact, the estate is spectacular. Beautiful views and outstanding service and several excellent alternatives for things to do. Good food and drink. Falconry, estate tour, golf and walking tours all available and were evaluated as excellent.",5,2017,07,19
239,Absolutely stunning ,"My husband and I went around Easter time for my spring break. The grounds were stunning. Our room was on the top floor overlooking the river. If you can get river views I would definitely recommend it. We could see the river and the thoroughbred breeding farm on the other side. Our room was spacious and comfortable with a very clean bathroom. 

We walked around the grounds and got as far as the Ballylinch Stud. They were very friendly there as well and invited us to walk around the barns and pet the horses (something you can't do in America). This was a surprise for us, and especially me who rides horses and loves racing. 

During the week we went to the spa, did falconry, golfed and rode horses. We emailed the hotel and booked everything in advance. I highly recommend this. I did this just for peace of mind and then overheard other guests that they missed out on things because they didn't know to book ahead. The spa was great. My husband went back for treatments on a second day even! 
I had two riding lessons in the arena. I rode an adorable Connemara named Max. The horses were all in good flesh and the tack was in good condition. They had helmets and boots if you didn't bring your own. They even checked my own helmet to see that it was approved for safety. Everyone at the barn was sweet, knowledgeable and helpful. The lessons were appropriate for my level, which can be tricky because some places assume you know nothing. We also did a trail ride with my husband who had never ridden a horse before. He was given a very cute horse that took excellent care of him. I think her name was Penny. 

My husband golfed both a lesson and 18 holes. He enjoyed both very much and found the lesson to be helpful and the instructor knowledgeable. 

I would definitely recommend the falconry. It was an amazing experience and he sets up some great photo opportunities. He was incredibly knowledgeable. You can tell birds are his passion and he's happy to discuss any questions you have. That must be booked in advance. 

Get the high tea! And try the Pimms cup!! Both were delicious and I wish I could go back just for that. After dinner drinks were fun and relaxing. I can't say enough good things about the food. The choices of restaurants means there's something for everyone. 

We can't wait to go back!!",5,2017,07,18
239,Family visit,"Really superb hotel, delightfully luxurious.  The surroundings are magnificent and if you get a room facing the river (the Earl of Carrick Suite is highly recommended) you are in for a treat as you can sit by the window and enjoy an early evening drink before diner in your room.  The grounds are delightful and I particularly recommend a walk to the Ballylinch stud which adjoins the estate.  The private cemetery is eerily beautiful and the walled gardens with its wonderful 'occulus' moon window is well worth a visit. The only slight disappointment was dining as the food which although perfectly acceptable, did not come up to expectations.",5,2017,07,13
239,Lunch in the hunters yard ,"Well what can I say ! Words lost to flavours . 
The food was so tasteful and beautifully presented . The staff so friendly and attentive 
I am so looking forward to my next visit 
It is going to become my regular meeting place,  a place I am proud to entertain in .

239,"Cold, damp and grey","Welcome to Ireland In February.

Fortunately inside the brightly lit Mount Juliet House the welcome we received was as warm as the roaring fire in the hallway.  Check-in took just a few minutes and was followed by a short tour of the public rooms before we were shown to our room.

It is not often you meet people who are not only happy in their job but are also proud of the place they work in but this is the case at Mount Juliet.

Our room was large with a view over the river and the parkland beyond. Everything was clean and the large bed very comfortable.  The shower room was spacious with sufficient surface to put things and with just about all toiletry needs provided. There was however no hair dryer… I called reception was answered immediately and assured one would be with us shortly. Within a minute or two a hair dryer was delivered with an apology - full marks.

Breakfast in the Lady Helen dining room was an elegant affair with an extensive menu (how often do you see whiskey porridge on a breakfast menu?) . The perfectly cooked food was served by friendly efficient folk who along with the surroundings helped to make the experience special.

Would I go back? Yes, absolutely.

Would I recommend Mount Juliet to friends? Yes, without hesitation",5,2017,07,11
239,Lovely room and food,"We stayed in Jan - 2017 - Had a really lovely room in the old part of the hotel overlooking the front entrance to the main building NOT the courtyard area -
Room and Bathroom were excellent - no noise.
We eat for two nights in the Lady Helen - this is a superb restaurant  - it really is as good as it professes to be!!
We had great recommendations from the staff for both the food and wine choice.
The lay out is also lovely - the tables were spaced enough that you are not on top of people where you feel too uncomfortable to talk (one of my hates) - but everything was perfect here - you could go to your table straight away and no waiting with pre-dinner drinks etc!! Plenty of lounge space too and a lovely bar that serves food during the day.

Loved it I have to say and would definitely return.

 . . . The only negative and it was a real shame - *(but I was told in advance but didn't expect it to be as bad as it was) - is the development of a housing estate on site!- this manifested itself in lorries backing and shunting on the drive lots and lots of muck and the pool was in reality not usable to access due to this activity - the yard area that houses the pool was dirty and not a nice space due to this development - this may be finished now so check when you book - I would give the stay 5/5 only for this as I love to swim but did not this time - I did go up there - but said no way when I saw the area.
I am not sure what people did that were staying in the yard area?
Breakfast was good and the bed was comfy!",4,2017,07,11
239,Excellent place,This country home is beautiful. Rooms are lovely and the property is stunning. It is a nice walk over to the stables. Dinner was delicious in the highly rated restaurant. Full Irish breakfast was great. Loved the brown bread.,5,2017,07,10
239,Beautiful country-side,"Location : not far from Kilkenny by car. But Thomastown is quite small, nothing much even the food nor supermarket. Suitable for driving own car.

Estate : Large and well managed property. Some area are closed for renovation until next year. However, they keep noice to very minimum. 

Hotel : luxury & classic

Breakfast : quite crowded. 

Activity : plenty! Horse riding, walking along the river, playing golf. Normal for indoor swimming pool & Fitness.

The most memorable thing is the air! Fresh and clean with little smell of grass & animal. ",5,2017,07,08
239,Afternoon tea,We had the champagne afternoon tea on a beautiful summer's day and it was wonderful. Gorgeous country house but very informal.  We live less than an hour away so we didn't stay but will definitely return for dinner some time.,5,2017,07,08
239,Not impressed,Stayed in a siperior room at Mount Julie.  The hotel is nice but very over rated. When we arrived there was a delay in getting our room as there was a wedding the day before. The room was OK nothing spectacular considering it was 260 for 1 night. We ate in the golf club but it was a bit of a walk to get to it. Food was nice there and reasonably priced.  Grounds are lovely to walk around. Would only book this if there was a special offer. ,3,2017,07,04
239,Wedding ,"Just back from this amazing Hotel having attended a family wedding , words cannot describe this amazing experience . Everything about it was just wonderful , the helpful and friendly staff , really comfortable large bedroom, breakfast looking out over the river - and the wedding marquee - the food at wedding was 5 star , cooked to perfection and served with style - well done to all concerned - will keep happy memories from this occasion 😀",5,2017,07,03
239,Sunday night treat ,"Spent one relaxing night away, which included afternoon tea which we had on arrival. Sitting at table facing out towards the picture postcard view of the grounds while enjoying every last morsel of the scrumptious tea!
 Had spacious room in manor house overlooking the front of the building.  Big bedroom and  loving the ""Handmade Soap"" toiletries in the bathroom. 
Took one of the  many walks around the grounds before dinner in club house which was tasty.
 Again lovely breakfast in the morning sitting in elegant dining room...I love the thought of so many generations of people using these rooms throughout the years..staying in a place with history just adds another unique element to the stay.",5,2017,07,02
239,The culmination of a great trip.,"We stayed at Mount Juliet with friends and family in April. We arrived in brilliant sunshine and were impressed by the drive up to the main house, surrounded by glorious spring tulips and green pastures and an impeccable golf course. The staff were friendly and went out of their way to be helpful; our daughter was upgraded to a wonderful room because of a late cancellation. The Lady Helen restaurant created a visually resplendent feast which will linger forever in our memories. Breakfast here was also excellent, albeit some of the staff were a little forgetful. We also ate in the newly opened golf club restaurant, which was family friendly and had a lively buzz. The estate is adjacent to Ballylinch Stud, where we took a leisurely stroll in close proximity to magnificent horses and very cute foals. Our 12 year old loved the pool and the food, and the dinosaur egg in the foyer sculpted from chocolate. Two nights was not enough, but we will return.",5,2017,06,18
239,Falconry with John was AMAZING!!!!! This place is incredible.,"I stayed at Mt. Juliet for only one night with my husband and another couple as part of our trip across Ireland -- man oh man, now that we know how incredible it is, I wish we had stayed much longer! The grounds are gorgeous, the cottage we stayed in was BEYOND nice, clean and comfortable and stocked with amenities, including laundry facilities and even detergent tabs (invaluable for travelers who are living out of a suitcase!), and I can safely say I have NEVER slept in a more comfortable bed in any hotel anywhere! The decor was absolutely charming and I can't stress enough how CLEAN everything felt -- it honestly felt like an amazing home away form home. The staff couldn't have been friendlier, especially Desmond McGrath! What a gem! So friendly and chatted with us for a good length of time before we left. The HIGHLIGHT of our experience, by far, though, was the falconry lessons we took with John ... he is a consummate PRO at what he does and it shows!! He explained the art of falconry to us and introduced us to Ozzie, the bird we began our lessons with (named for Ozzie Osbourne because of what a ""headcase"" he is! SO funny, all of the birds have unique names). We got to participate in numerous different tricks with the birds and had plenty of interaction -- it is money WELL SPENT for a one-of-a-kind experience of a lifetime! The birds are amazing, beautiful creatures and John had us interested and laughing the entire time. On top of that, he also made sure that we all got amazing photos and videos from the experience! He literally re-did tricks with the birds with us, not because anything had gone wrong but just to ensure we each had the PERFECT shot to take home with us! I can't talk up the experience and John's skill enough. The lesson ended with an insanely cute, tiny owl who John introduced us to and we all got to hold. It was such a magical experience at a magical place and we can't wait to go back someday! I highly recommend you go and take the falconry lesson and you will be back here sharing your own top-notch review, I guarantee! HUGE THANKS to John for making this the highlight of all our time spent in Ireland!",5,2017,06,13
239,A mixed bag,"Really wanted to enjoy this stay but we consistently felt disappointed. Very disappointed with the Lady Helen Resturant which was very average. Having gave a two week notice about food allergies I was shocked to see the staff and chef had little understanding. This was then compouned by the waiting staff who are clearly not up to michelin star service. In fact at times they looked completely lost. We were served bread and 5 mins later got tge butter. We would wait 10mins plus with out wine glasses been refilled. 

Rooms were fine in the main house but with no air con meant for a very unpleasantly warm sleep. All spa and pool facilities are only available by the golf club and requires a drive or walk from the main house. 

This is not a bad hotel by any means but with so much competition around Ireland for this level of hotel Mount Juliet just doesn't cut the mustard. ",3,2017,06,11
239,Hunters Yard restaurant,"There are three restaurants on the estate, The Lady Helen superb, classy.  The golfers restaurant mostly frequented by those playing on the estates course, however there is another in my opinion jewel  Hunters Yard, situated very close to the Golfers restaurant.   
This is not a hotel  but there are plans to incorporate a number of bedrooms.",5,2017,06,08
239,Wow what a venue for a wedding,"Atteneded a wedding here and wow it was amazing.

The food is unbelieveable, so tasty and well presented and the service was excellent. Staff are so efficient.

The house and estate itself is beautiful and it is beautiful here",5,2017,06,07
239,Thoroughly Enjoyed,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Mount Juliet Estate. We ate one night at the Michelin star restaurant and another at the other restaurant and enjoyed both very much.
The staff are nice and the rooms are more than adequate.
It is nice when somewhere keeps that genuine old fashioned feel about it.
There are really nice walks around the grounds and it it just a top notch place for a relaxing stay. 
Would highly recommend.",5,2017,05,30
239,Spa day,I spent a whole day at Mount Juliet spa courtesy of a gift. It was a lovely experience. The therapists were really friendly and very professional. My full body massage was wonderful as were my pedicure and facial. I felt very pampered and well looked after. There was a lunch break half way through and it would have been nicer if I didn't have to dress and go out to the bar for my lunch. It broke the feeling of being  removed from reality. This wasn't the fault of the therapists who were genuinely great so I'd suggest that management look at improving the experience by keeping the whole day in house. Products were lovely and my skin is glowing and very smooth. The setting is lush and truly beautiful. I'd be happy to go back. ,4,2017,05,28
239,Excellent Beautiful,"Staff,Accommodation,Scenery,Walks,Playground this Estate lacks nothing,food excellent reasonable priced. Golf was overbooked long delays 5 Hours for a normal 3 and Half hours game for 2 players and that was with a 4 ball dropping out on the 9th hole, Course itself was in impeccable condition Greens Fairways best I have seen ever will visit again",5,2017,05,28
239,"A terrific experience, with some minor flaws.","My wife and I spent two nights there in mid May. The grounds are amazing and the views of the horse stud farm pastures across the river are unforgettable. Almost fairytale setting.  The staff and service crews were all polite and worked very hard to accommodate any requests.  We so much enjoyed the equestrian center as the staff there was very helpful.  This is something couples should really take advantage of during their stay as a way to experience the estate from horseback.  Don't let a lack of riding experience keep you from doing this as the young ladies who will set up the horses and guide you love what they do and it shows. Another terrific thing to consider is booking a falconry lesson.  Again, amazing, you will not be disappointed as to have a trained hawk perched on your arm, flying back and forth in an hour long lesson of hunting skill is nothing short of exhilarating.  The photo op is worth every euro.  As for dining, here's where the slight challenge exists.  The Lady Helen restaurant is beautiful and the setting matches the expectation for the Hotel, however the staff does not appear well seasoned. Its missing gravitas.  The dining is expensive as you would expect in this setting but the service and overall dining pleasure is lacking. Then seeing $12.50 euro each for bottled flat water on the bill doesn't help the feeling that the dining is a bit over-priced. Our second night dining was in nearby Thomastown (5 mins away) at a terrific new restaurant called Bassets. This restaurant was not on Tripadvisor yet because they were just opened but I can't help but believe they will be well rewarded.  Overall, the Mount Juliet was very good and highly recommend!",4,2017,05,22
239,Beautiful Estate,"Only staying at the Estate one night did not give us enough time to enjoy all of the amenities. We were also not told by our travel agent that to eat in the dining room, you have to book in advance. So, we had to eat in the golf clubhouse, which was fine; although, the service was slow.

The Estate seems to be largely centered around the golf course and is in the process of adding 90 new rooms, which will about triple it's current room capacity. I hope they add dining venues to keep up with the room capacity.

The Manor itself was beautiful. The rooms are elegant, but I would not recommend staying in the front of the hotel. Our rooms (18 & 21) were on the second floor directly over the entrance. People leaving the restaurant or bar in the early house of the morning were quite loud and the diesel vehicle which drove them back to their residences was also loud on leaving and arrival.",4,2017,05,20
239,Stunning views and area but the stay was ok and not really more,"We went there for a 2 day stay, for a wedding in September 2106, the wedding is stunning, and absolutely amazing day, the vibe was great and the food was superb, 
Saying all of that, the rooms are nice but for the price you pay but not much more than that, in fairness to them my husband's key problem is always the mattress in the hotel and these were really good ! over all a good stay but without the WOW effect in the rooms",4,2017,05,19
239,Pool area is dirty,"Could you please clean the pool area, this includes the shampoo dispensers in the shower area, the glass around the shower area, the tiles etc. Allocating 15 mins to clean these would suffice. Why don't you do this???? The hotel is looking great with the new design but laziness is the word when is comes to not keeping the pool area clean",3,2017,05,19
239,Beautiful Estate!!,Lovely and relaxing estate!  Attended a wedding and spent three delightful evenings at the hotel. The accommodations and grounds are fantastic. Don't miss seeing the lovely gardens and walk along the beautiful paths. Plenty of activities for everyone.  Staff is excellent. ,5,2017,05,17
239,Oh how amazing,"If you want the best service in beautiful surroundings this is the venuefor you. The service was impeccable and faultless. This a great place to relax and enjoy being pampered. We were made to feel so special by everyone from the tidy up fairy to the receptionist to the maitre de. Some places when the staff ask you how things are and then the smile falls off, well here the smile stays need I say more. Enjoy",5,2017,05,17
239,An old Manor House,Stayed here for my nieces wedding. Fabulous room and power shower in bathroom. Rooms were very cosy and warm. Breakfast was delicious. An array of dishes from Eggs Benedict to pancakes with maple syrup and fresh fruit. Also the full Irish. An extensive selection of breads and pastries were also to be had. The only fault I had with my stay was when I checked in I had to take my luggage to my room which I thought with a hotel of this calibre should have had a bell boy to help. Otherwise no other complaints.,5,2017,05,17
239,Very Disappointing Stay,"We stayed here as a family group for my mums 60th and my aunts 80th birthdays. Although this hotel is a beautiful property and the food was very nice, the staff appeared to be nice. I couldn't help but feel they were a bit fake and definitely felt ripped off and disappointed after our stay here. Afternoon tea was advertised at one price and when it came to paying it was almost twice the price than that advertised in the hotel information provided in the rooms. When we questioned this as you would the staff said their prices recently changed. I'm sure there is a law against this type of over charging. The way the staff dealt with this was appalling and ruined our whole afternoon tea experience. If that wasn't bad enough we were charged over €40 for WATER with our dinner which was outrageous. The whole place felt a bit pretentious.
Having said all that , the grounds were beautiful and the food was lovely in both the main house and golf club. Rooms were very nice and old worldly. The spa was very small and disappointing although the staff in the spa were nice. I wouldn't bother ever staying here again. It was an unforgettable stay all right- unforgettably bad!!!",2,2017,05,17
239,O'Connor Family wedding,"From the moment we arrived the whole experience was wonderful! The staff was so accomadating. We has 78 guests and everyone has told us how much they enjoyed their stay. The ease in which they worked with us to execute the whole wedding week end was stream line. The rooms were beautiful, the food was delicious. Mt. Juliet is a beautiful estate! We hope to return very soon!🍀",5,2017,05,16
239,Sneaky night away,"Myself and partner stayed here for a sneaky night away without the kids. We were not disappointed.
We stayed in the main house. The room was large, luxurious and everything we could of asked for. The bathroom was large and clean and super nice.  
We ate in the lady Helen restaurant and were not disappointed. It lived up to it Michelin star with every course. 
We used their bikes for a cycles around the estate and took walks which was so nice.  The new golf club bar was just finished being renovated with amazing results and we watched the last match of the 6 nations.   
Could not recommend Mount Juliet enough and just can not wait to return. 
",5,2017,05,12
239,Sunday lunch,"Five for lunch, food presented well, hunters yard light and airy, great view. Unfortunately we were in a cubicle at the end of the dining room so couldn't see, very tight space table too big, seating low and table high, didn't really work.
Staff were excellent, helpful and courteous.
Main course €14-20, starters €7-9, deserts,€7-9, mains do not come with potatoes/ veg etc they have to be ordered separately for €3.50, which makes lunch quite expensive for what one would assume would come with your main course
",3,2017,05,10
239,"Top of the mark,","One of the nicest hotel in Ireland, beautiful in every respect, gardens, golf course, dining, river thru grounds, pastures, service/wait staff well trained to provide excellent customer service, billed as luxury estate for the rich and famous, told Jimmy Carter stayed in same room, so had room fumigated",5,2017,05,09
239,Lady Helen - Beautiful Experience but left a little hungry,"Mount Juliet Estate is absolutely beautiful. I visited with family for dinner and before our meal we had a drink at the bar/library with a fantastic view out onto the gardens. The staff were excellent, helpful and very friendly. 
We all decided to have the tasting menu, and we were brought to a wonderful table in the gorgeous dining room with another great outlook onto the lawns. The service was great and the ambience perfection but as a vegetarian I was greatly disappointed with the options, no doubt they were beautifully presented but there was absolutely nothing substantial on any of the courses. No carbs at all - mainly just fancily positioned lettuce leaves. We had to keep asking for more bread from the waiters and when I went home I made myself a cheese and tomato sandwich because I was that hungry.
I have no doubt that the chefs are excellent at what they do, and two of my meat eating family members thoroughly enjoyed every course they were given, I would just suggest more substantial options for vegetarian's 
Again though Mt Juliet is a beautiful place with excellent staff and I really enjoyed the experience!",4,2017,05,07
239,Average Certainly not 5 Star & Disappointing ,"Visited Beautiful Mount Juliet for two nights on the weekend of 30 April / 1st May.

Whilst the  overall cost was very expensive it did not unfortunately live up to its perceived reputation.The service levels did not reflect either the five star rating or the perceived status of the resort.

Our initial check in experience and room was excellent.

The resort was needless to say very busy for the weekend.

Upon checking our very well appointed room we discovered the fridge / mini bar was neither working or stocked. We called reception who advised upon checking with housekeeping it was out of service ( no apology / reason or excuse given) and asked would we like some ice? This we found to be very strange and unacceptable. We eventually got some ice after subsequent phone calls from ourselves.

We booked dinner at Hunter's Yard and whilst the quality of food was excellent if a little skimpy on quantity  / portion size  the service was very poor and very slow. There was no heating on in the restaurant and it was noticeably cold ( in fact we pointed out to staff a number of guests dining with their coats on ) you would have thought a member of staff would have noticed that?? We did mention that it was cold in the restaurant to a manager.

After dinner we retired to house hotel bar for a nite cap to find it in a very untidy state with the remnants of afternoon teas (@ 22:00) and drinks and food from previous patrons guests on several different tables. We in fact cleared the table ourselves. Eventually a member of staff arrived to behind the bar area and as there was no sign of them coming to us we walked to bar and ordered our drinks.

We noticed several groups who arrived after us did exactly the same again this is not what we or anybody else would have expected in such a prestigious resort?? There was a noticeable attitude amongst some of bar staff also.

The next day (Monday morning) we once again enquired about our infamous fridge mini bar and were informed it would be fixed repaired on Wednesday ( we departed Tuesday ) need I say anymore.

It is interesting to note that housekeeping did not replenish the ice stocks in two days or provide turn down service on the first evening.

We managed to enjoy our weekend despite the poor service at Mount Juliet although  it really could have been so much better with 5 star customer service and attention to detail being improved dramatically. I would associate the level of service and attention to detail ( at Mount Juliet )  in properties of much less status most likely at the level off 2-3 star rating.

When a customer visits and stays at a resort in the stature of Mount Juliet you expect to experience a ""wow factor"" this was sadly lacking during our entire visit.

We have been fortunate to spend very nice weekends here over the years up until last weekend.

Whilst we love the resort very much we would not plan another visit anytime soon as we believe it's status as a five star resort has diminished greatly on the basis of our most recent experience.  

It is very disappointing to see such a wonderful resort having declined so much in terms of service and attention to detail.

In the interest of balance we did speak with a member of staff / management about the issues and whilst they appreciated our comments and were somewhat apologetic. I would not have much confidence in the situation improving anytime soon.

Also the Hunter's Yard restaurant did appear to address at least the heating issue on the second evening Monday 1st.

Overall we were very disappointed given the cost and feel we could have spent our hard earned cash more beneficially in a different and better run resort.
 ",2,2017,05,03
239,5 star experience ,"We spent 2 nights here over Easter with our daughter in the main house.

Everything was perfect from start to finish. The staff were extremely helpful, there was loads of things to do and the food was best we've eaten in an Irish hotel. The tasting menu at Lady Helen restaurant was one of the best meals we've eaten ever. The room was very spacious and plenty of room for family of three. 

Overall, great value and will definitely be returning. 

",5,2017,05,01
239,Peaceful & Tranquil,"We stayed here for two nights in April and had a great stay. Unfortunately the Lady Helen restaurant was closed on one of the nights and full the other so we didn't get to experience its culinary delights. We did however eat in the new Club House and had a lovely meal. We started with a glass of wine out on the veranda overlooking the golf course, followed by a tasty meal inside. If I were you, I'd go for the steak, the pork belly was good but the steak was better. Generous portions, great waiting staff and an overall lovely atmosphere. The second night, we ate in the bar and I had what I can honestly describe as the most delicious steak sandwich I have ever had. We got a table at the windows looking out over the fields where the horses were runinng around. Talk about relaxation! The hotel arranged a babysitter for our 7 month old, and it all worked out perfectly. The only criticism I have of the place is that the swimming pool area is a bit outdated and it was a little on the cold side for my liking. There are idyllic walks to do around the grounds (even with a buggy). Overall a beautiful place, fantastic staff and well worth a visit. If you do intend on bringing your child just bear in mind that there is no lift in the hotel to get to your room. So either request a downstairs room or just be prepared to carry the buggy up one flight of stairs which we did. Also if interested you can visit the horses in their stables and the beautiful hounds in their kennels. Just ask at reception.",5,2017,04,27
239,"Jade, Grainne and David are simply exceptional people!","Hi, 

My fiancee and I dropped in today for some food in the Clubhouse and we were met by Grainne - well, that girl is simply professional and charming in equal measure! Jade took over later on and she is a character! We really enjoyed the banter and it was terrific to meet David once again who spoiled us with some bubbly to mark our engagement - this was unexpected, but we were genuinely touched. He's a truly wonderful chap and I have to say that the atmosphere among the staff in his charge is really refreshing!! 

We would be really delighted if someone would tell these 3 x wonderful people that they are brilliant are their jobs, they made the afternoon what it was and we will definitely be back!! Honestly, 10/10 guys!!

239,"""' Be careful""","Six of us called in Sunday for lunch. It was busy so we sat out overlooking the practise putting green. We just had main course as we had a tight schedule.  The roast beef was tasty but the veggie was scarce and the Yorkshire pud was dry. Served on a cold plate the food was gone cold in a minute.  The fish and chunky chips were OK but one of my companions crunched on a stone in her mushy peas. Luckily she has good teeth and did nt break any. She gave the pea sized stone to the waitress  who said ""Sorry about that"" and promptly walked away and came back with the bill.  No we won't be returning!",3,2017,04,14
239,Absolutely stunning grounds! ,We just loved this hotel! We had a beautiful room with a lot of character overlooking the river and stud farm. The staff was very nice too. There is just nothing that can compare to the natural beauty of the Estate and charm of the hotel. Absolutely recommend this property for a countryside getaway. ,5,2017,04,14
239,"Average, over priced, shocking service","Called in for a cup of tea and a scone with a friend after a walk around the beautiful estate. We sat in the middle of the bar area and we were approached with a menu. A couple left one of the window tables so we moved to make the most of the view. The waiter approached and literally scolded us for changing tables before he had time to clear it! We apologised, which was a little embarrassing considering I am nearly 40 years old, and ordered a tea, latte and 2 scones. We received our hot drinks and then waited 10 minutes for a very small cold scone, tiny lump of butter and runny cream and some tasty jam. A tiny biscuit also accompanied which looked utterly lost on the plate. I am quite obviously pregnant and don't expect to have to go and find the waiter to ask for a glass of water in a 4 star establishment. He didn't approach the table again and we kept looking around for service but there was no one behind the bar for a long time. When paying the bill which was a few cent short of 20  euro for 2 hot drinks and scones (!!!!) the waiter didn't smile, didn't even look my friend in the eye or say thank you. We left feeling deflated and totally ripped off. Won't be returning any time soon when there are several local cafes offering fabulous afternoon tea for half the price and with friendly, attentive service. Maybe the waiter was having a bad day, but having worked in the service industry myself, I know a smile and providing service is the bare minimum one should offer. Needless to say we didn't leave a tip.",2,2017,04,12
239,Afternoon Tea,"We decided to book in for afternoon tea here as we had heard great reports. We were unsure of where to go once we entered the hotel as this was our first visit, we looked into one room and there was a tall lady sitting behind a desk typing on a computer. She didn't even look up so we presumed we were not in the right place, another lady that was part of our group then went back and asked her if she'd be able to point us in the right direction. We had clearly disturbed her with the reaction she gave us. She looked up for a second and said 'yes,in behind me'. That was all she said and went back to typing. We could not fault the ladies serving the afternoon tea, the food itself or the grounds, they were absolutely amazing however, after working for several years in the tourism sector myself, I know first impressions count and unfortunately on this occasion, it was an unpleasant one.",3,2017,04,10
239,"Good food, pleasant setting, nice service","Seven of us had dinner in The Clubhouse. Our orders varied from trout, burgers and the vegetarian pasta dish. I got a burger, and while it's normally difficult to get excited about a burger, this was a very enjoyable meal. Feedback from all seven of us was that it was an enjoyable experience and several, myself included, said they would return in a personal capacity.",4,2017,04,08
239,Never Fails to Deliver !,"Back for our second wedding anniversary last Sunday in the magical Mount Juliet. As per usual the exceptional staff put us at ease immediately and proceeded to look after us in similar vein for the duration of our stay. 

The stunning location and venue itself will never fail to please but it is the people that work there who make Mt. Juliet extra special, and yet again they never fail to deliver. 

You simply must experience this place at least once, the only thing is you won't want to leave.

239,Very nice stay,Just on the way home from Mount Juliet Estate and had a wonderful time. Most of the staff were very friendly and in particular Des McGrath the customer relations manager was exceptional and gave us a guided tour of the estate. We were a little sceptical at the outset with our check in as it wasn't entirely welcoming but this is not a reflection of the rest of the staff who were fantastic. We did the tasting menu in the Lady Helen restaurant and half way through we ordered chips as we were starving! The food was nice but it's just not our type of food but would suit others I'm sure. Room was spacious and clean. I had lovely treatments with the fab Niamh although it was a pity that the fire alarm kept going off throughout it however that's because there is lots of work being done to update the estate including a new hotel on site. It's a lovely getaway and we will be sure to return. ,4,2017,04,04
239,Belated mothers day treat,"My daughter, my five year old grand daughter and I dropped into the hotel for lunch after a lovely walk around the beautiful woodland gardens. The grounds are exquisite. Im a garden designer and landscaper and I found the grounds really refreshing in so much as, mother nature was allowed have a say. Not too much control was exercised on the natural landscape. 
From the minute you drive in the gate, there is a wow factor. You are enticed around the garden on winding crazy paved paths, tiered rolling lawns filled with daffs and anemones. 
Lunch was absolutely beautiful served by excellent staff. All staff we came in contact with were so welcoming and helpfull
The interior is absolutely exquisite
The grounds magical!
I would highly recommend a visit for lunch or afternoon tea",4,2017,04,01
239,Beautiful room beautiful grounds,"Stayed here in November 2016 and my only disappointment was that it was only for one night.  We had a gorgeous room in the main house - very comfortable bed, very spacious, great shower and good toiletries.  It was November so the services open were a bit limited but we had a full tea, dinner & breakfast in the golf club and drinks in the main house bar.  Service was good - we especially liked our bartender from Romania, a very personable guy.  We loved walking around the grounds; they are stunning.  I can't wait to come back during the warmer months.  The only negative I have is that the check-in and check-out took quite a long time.  Took about 20 minutes with two people in front of me.",5,2017,03,30
239,Overnight stay with family,"Got first class attention from the very friendly Manager Christine, and all the staff on arrival on Saturday afternoon.
We stayed overnight, and had dinner in the Lady Helen Restaurant. That was  a real special experience- and lived up to expectations. Breakfast was relaxing, and gave us time to take a leisurely walk on the estate.
Can't wait to go again..",5,2017,03,19
239,Good but not a 5 star experience ,"When you pay close to €300 for one nights accommodation your expectations are naturally high. Mount Juliet is very good but failed to live up to expectations. It's lacking the attention to detail and little extras that make a stay special. No little treat left at turn down service, cheap coffee in the rooms (Nescafé gold blend), a kettle that doesn't reach the plug, a shower temp that went intermittently from hot to cold and a blocked shower drain. It lacks a cozy bar area when you would feel comfortable sitting for hours! The rooms are nice but really not worth the money...nothing special or nothing offering the wow factor. The book in the room giving information on the hotel repeatedly stated terms &conditions about what the hotel is not responsible for-if you read it you don't exactly get a warm welcoming feeling! Staff are nice but I couldn't pick out one for exceptional service. Food in the Lady Helen was superb-good there and don't bother with an over night stay. For the money you will get much better else where",4,2017,03,19
239,very good,"Stayed 2 nights with friends.
Excellent check in and superb attention from Des the guest relations manager.
He is super, and a real asset to the hotel, every hotel should have a Des.Thank you.
Room very spacious with a good size bathroom. I feel they are a little outdated but very comfortable non the less.
Food and service is excellent . i am giving 4 stars as I feel to get 5 stars attention to detail is key ,there were little things that I felt needed to be improved on but i am very fussy, and for the price we paid we really got good value.
would recommend.",4,2017,03,18
239,Superb Stay,"Having had a previously wonderful stay here, this visit lived up to expectation.

Upon arrival we had lunch in the bar which was very tasty and was served by a very pleasant lady. 

We then checked into our room which was on ground level with a garden. The room was very spacious as was the bathroom. There were plenty of towels, nice toiletries and robes provided.

Dinner that evening in The Lady Helen was sublime. Staff were very attentive and informative. Each course of the 7 course tasting menu was beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. My compliments to the chef.

Breakfast the next morning was excellent. There is a good selection of cereals, pastries, etc. and the cooked breakfast was a very high quality. Again, staff were to notch.

The leisure centre is a little outdated but the pool, steam room and sauna are perfectly adequate.

I would highly recommend a stay at Mount Juliet. The staff are outstanding and the food is excellent. I will most certainly be returning again!",5,2017,03,17
239,The best 3 days!,"We recently stayed three nights/days at Mt. Juliet Estate.   It was the longest time spent in one location during our trip.  How lucky we were that it was at Mt. Juliet!  The staff were friendly, the building lovely, the grounds just beginning to welcome Spring; our room was large and inviting.  The view from our windows was the river, with the horse pastures in the distance. We had a wonderful dinner in the Lady Helen Room and also 2 meals at the clubhouse.  Breakfast each morning was hearty and delicious.  Mt. Juliet will be the fondest memory of our trip to Ireland.",5,2017,03,15
239,Fantastic Stay,"Stayed here for 1 night at the weekend with my husband. Really enjoyed our stay. Room was fab and spacious. Bar serving lovely beers, and a real cosy feel in the place. Sat with a view over the river. Fires lighting throughout the house. We booked into the restaurant for Dinner. Food and service was amazing!! Couldn't fault it in any way. Lovely breakfast the following morning followed by a trip to the pool! Also took a walk around the grounds and up to the stud farm at the back of the hotel. Well worth a visit.",5,2017,03,15
239,Another Enjoyable Visit,"Visited Mount Juliet Estate for a weekend with my husband and again had a fabulous time.  The estate itself is gorgeous, our room was very comfortable with views of the river and the food was excellent.  Also visited the spa and enjoyed my treatment very much.  Look forward to my next visit already.",5,2017,03,13
239,Fantastic ,"Great stay a few weekends back lovely hotel
And grounds the spa very busy but again that's a good complaint to some staff all friendly and polite couldn't have asked for better service when we were there thank you ",4,2017,03,06
239,Timeless elegance ,"I couldn't think of a better place to spend a couple of days celebrating my better half's significant birthday. I've played golf here many times and can testify to the quality of the course. It is my favorite parkland course in the world. I've never stayed over so I booked a couple of nights in the manor house and we had a wonderful time. The facilities are second to none including the spa treatments. You can go horse riding, cycling, walking. You can play golf or shoot some arrows or find a quiet spot in the house to contemplate the universe. Thoroughly relaxing. The Lady Helen restaurant is superb and lives up to it's reputation. I must add also that the beds are wonderful. Like sleeping on a cloud. We'll be back!",5,2017,03,06
239,Espectacular!,"I went with my fiancee for one night in February and had a great time. The hotel is very stylish and a has a very relaxed environment. 
Rooms: We stayed in a Manor House Riverview room. The room was very comfortable and had a great view of the River Nore .
Dining: We had dinner in The Lady Helen Restaurant at the Manor House, 1 Michelin star awarded. We had a fantastic three course dinner (one vegetarian). All courses were very special, the attention to detail is noticed in each component on the plate.
Staff: The staff were very helpful and freindly every time we approached them. 
I would recommend this hotel for anyone who is looking for a real treat.",5,2017,02,17
239,Amazing relaxing stay!,"We visited Mount Juliet for 2 nights during the week. We stayed Mon - Wed over valentines. The hotel itself was rather quiet which was nice! It is a beautiful old building with lots of charm and the open fires were a lovely touch!

The grounds of the estate are amazing and there are plenty of walks you can do, we particularly enjoyed walking around the grounds and taking in the wonderful scenery.

The hotel itself has everything you need from restaurants to a swimming pool. The staff were particularly friendly and were keen and able to help with any requests we had! 

We had the afternoon tea on Valentine's Day and it was really lovely, the sandwiches were excellent. We also had breakfast each morning which was very good too with lots of selection! I really liked the honey they served straight from the comb.

Only thing we would suggest would be a upgrade of the spa facilities and the rooms were very warm!!

A very relaxing break in a beautiful hotel! Would highly recommend to those looking for a relaxing getaway!",5,2017,02,16
239,Disappointed,Options during day are limited and not clear what's open at night.  Estate is naturally magnificent but needs a lift to present as a good 3 star.  Nice new bar but kids running amok in small golfers bar.,2,2017,02,16
239,Mount Juliet mesmerizes,"We celebrated a special birthday at Mount Juliet recently and enjoyed a perfect weekend of  warm fires, cool cocktails, breezy strolls and super-friendly service. There were 15 of us altogether, 5 of whom were under 5! They took care of us magnificently and paid great attention to the children.",5,2017,02,14
239,As good as it gets in Ireland ,"Wonderful Saturday night in MJ.

SUPERB hospitality from check in with tour of the house. Room was grand as in large and classy. Only drawback was absence of a bath (request a room with a bath if you stay).

Food in the Lady Helen is spectacular.  Breakfast busy but again top class.

Also happens to be the home of Irelands best and most playable inland course and a package with your accommodation is definitely recommended. ",5,2017,02,12
239,Beautiful & Relaxing 3-night Stay,"I had heard great things about Mount Juliet, especially from my boss, who visits once or twice a year so I was really excited and full of expectations. I have stayed at several manor style hotels before and so far none have topped Ashford Castle in Mayo....would Mount Juliet?

My initial impression of Mount Juliet was that it seemed quite small but, once I'd  checked in, had a little look around and settled into my room & surroundings for a while, my impression changed to it being more homely and old worldly.

The manor house is just beautiful, steeped in history and so well maintained...it's gorgeous. The staff are exceptional, so friendly and helpful and nothing was an issue. I loved the fresh flowers and open fire. 

We enjoyed many walks on the grounds and through the stud area. We were really blessed with the weather, which really enhanced the experience. 

Our room overlooked the river and views were nice, especially in the morning as the mist burned off with the rising sun.  However if I visit again I think I'll save my almost €100/night and try a standard room.

Impressions of the room: River View Room (22)

Cost - The room was not worth the €835 we paid for 3 nights (including breakfast).  However we knowingly chose this category of room and could have opted for a standard, if we'd wanted to spend less but, like many other reviewers before me, I also agree the room is not worth the money and I expected much more of a wow factor.

Bed - The king bed was wonderful, bedding and pillows were fresh and cosy. We had excellent sleeps!

Large TV in the room was great, with all the channels and the WiFi was excellent and fast. There was also tea and coffee making facilities & complimentary water. Surprisingly no fridge in the room. 

The room was lovely and warm (too warm initially) and all bar one radiator was switched off by us once we checked in, because we weren't able to switch off the other one. The radiator under the left window could not be switched off and needs to be looked at....luckily we left the windows open otherwise it would be stiflingly hot.

Bathroom - fantastic rain shower, super pressure and temperature but, the bathroom was a let down overall. In a hotel of this calibre, it was dated looking  and grubby - shower doors need replacing or else a bleach clean, as well as grouting around the shower base. It needs remodeling, and cleaner lines. The shutter in the window wasnt closing properly. The complimentary handmade soaps, shampoos etc, were beautiful and I've already ordered the full range from Slane and they arrive tomorrow at my home.

Breakfast - really good. Small buffet with a selection of fruits, pastries, cheese & meats as well as some breads & juices. There's also a cooked option of full Irish, eggs benedict, pancakes, kippers, etc. Service was prompt and professional. We sat by the window for two of our three mornings to take in the beautiful countryside views. So peaceful.

Activities  - there are many to choose from, from horse riding to falconry and archery and fishing etc. The Walking routes around the estate are nice too. The grounds are picture perfect and so well maintained. 

Clubhouse - a few minutes walk away, there's a lot of construction in the area. We had a couple of beers at the Clubhouse and some food on our first night. Burgers are really tasty. Beer selection was slightly limited (for my taste, as I like craft beers). The atmosphere wasn't great and I think we were probably the youngest patrons there by 20 years (we are mid 40s). Staff were lovely, faultless and attentive. 

Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our 3 night stay. Just what the doctor had ordered. We unwound and relaxed and soaked up the laid back, peaceful vibes from the house. If peace and relaxation is what you're looking for, you'll get it here. There's lots to do here too and, all the sites of Kilkenny city are just a 15 min drive away.",4,2017,02,06
239,Romantic break,"Beautiful Estate, lovely walks, and great staff. Got an upgrade to a suite, great surprise 
Lovely for a Romantic break. The Spa and Pool facilities were also very enjoyable, especially the spa treatments.
Thank you to all the staff for making our stay so pleasant. ",5,2017,02,06
239,A taste of luxury ,"We managed to get a last minute booking to this wonderful hotel. We stayed in the Manor House. It has been renovated recently and is truly very elegant. Service was exemplar.
We went for a light supper in the club house. Service here was good, but food was average, sorry to say. But it was golf club house food......
The main hotel itself is under extension at the moment. I am concerned that this will make it too big and commercial and therefore cause it to loose its current high standards. 
Scenery is magnificent.😄😄😄",5,2017,02,06
239,New Years Eve 2016,Super friendly Estate in Co.KilKenny. great amenities spectacular scenery and delicious food.💜 Great New Years Eve party at a house on the Estate. Kids enjoyed horse riding next day. Tranquil....will return.,5,2017,02,01
239,Very good but could do better,"Hotel and grounds are wonderful. In particular the Lady Helen restaurant and its staff were really great. We did receive a complimentary upgrade as a result of extensive construction going on at present. Staff in general were helpful.
Some issues where we felt  let down were as follows. 
Check in time is 4pm and if your room is available before that then it is available to you. This was our first time experiencing a 4pm check in and in our case it was 4pm before we could access our room. This is totally unacceptable as it is by far too late.
The second issue for us on our 1 night stay was neither my wife or I eat red meat and had made the hotel aware of this prior to our stay. I was particularly looking forward to Kippers for breakfast and knew that they were on the menu. So a few moments after ordering them the waitress returned to say that they were not available this is not good enough for a 5 star hotel. Finally on checking out I did raise these issues after being asked about our stay. At the time there were 2 people behind the reception and one a lady may have been from management. But        both my wife and I felt our complaints fell on deaf ears. So again not a 5 star experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Finally                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ",4,2017,01,20
239,Wow ,"We decided to spend a night in the house and nothing more than breathtaking explains our experience. If you don't have a love for antiques and small portions of great food this may not be for you. I loved the decor the beautiful views of the river and greenery. The restaurant is great for dinner each dish served so well the chef and staff in the restaurant are great. All over the hotel the staff could not do enough. Do not leave without visiting the salon for a treatment it's lovely natural products that they use and it's really relaxing. Overall it was a great stay highly recommended and would return. Lunch consists of a selection of soup and sandwiches which were really delicious also. 
Thank you for a great stay with so many beautiful walks and so many activities left without trying I would definitely return for a longer time. Had a good relax thank you.",5,2017,01,20
239,Top class!,"This was our 2nd time staying in Mt Juliet, and this time we had a 3 yr old and 10 mth old in tow.  We stayed in the Mt Juliet suite (#23), which was very spacious and has the best views in the house.  It's old world stylish.
The room was great, the food was perfect and all of the staff couldn't have been more accommodating.  Michelle in particular looked after us so well for breakfast and lunch.  Nothing was too much trouble. 
We were blessed with the weather which meant we got to enjoy the lovely walks around the estate.  With the pool and equestrian centre onsite, we didn't leave the estate while we were there.  Refurbishment works are underway beside the hunters yard, but it didn't impact on our enjoyment of the main house or estate at all.
Wholeheartedly recommended. I just have to get back down now to play the beautiful looking golf course!",5,2017,01,14
239,Xmas stay,"We stayed at mount Juliet once again over the Xmas period.   We have spent Xmas here for the past several years in addition to staying at mount Juliet other times of the year since 1999.   This year we saw some new additions namely the new club house which is absolutely lovely and I am sure this will be a delightful place to have a drink and some food during the summer with a lovely view from its location.   Staff were great here as in other areas of the hotel.

The treatments at the spa were as always lovely and the staff great as usual.   

The meals we had were excellent but one thing both my partner and I were very disappointed about was the fact that in previous years we have dined in the lady Helen restaurant which is a Michelin star restaurant on both Xmas eve and st Stephens night.  However 9 weeks before Xmas we were advised that this restaurant was going to be closed on 26 December .    Apparently it was because 26 December was on a Tuesday and the lady Helen is not open on a Tuesday!     However, This was a bank holiday so I would have assumed that the hotel would have catered for guests staying there over that period.   I am sure we were not the only guests who would have dined here?

We were told we could dine at kendals a few hundred yards from the house itself, which, whilst it is a good restaurant, is a very different dining experience to the lady Helen.   Ultimately we opted to stay in mount Juliet house and were told that there would be additional options on the room service menu.   Unfortunately this was not the case and the same room options were on offer.   Disappointing!    

I feel we needed to mention this point as customer satisfaction is important.",4,2017,01,11
239,Christmas stay at mount juliet.,Mount juliet you were perfect. from the very welcoming arrival to the complimentary chocolates and wine in the bedroom.Dinner in the lady helen has left an ever lasting memory. General ambiance with open log fires all accompanied my helpful staff was the start of a magical celebration. Congratulations to all involved. I look forward to returning next year.,5,2017,01,09
239,Pleasant stay,"We stayed in the Mano House, beautiful old house with a lot of history, particularly if you have an interest in Horse racing..
We were there on a Tues night, Restaurant was closed, club house also closed so the food choice was to use Golf club bar, the food was very good and reasonable, limited menu..
Breakfast was ok, no all cooked fresh..,
Overall it's a very relaxing location, however I feel a bit pricey...

239,Beautiful Cottages,stayed in the Rose garden cottages for a weekend break.  The cottages are spacious and well equipped kitchen and very nicely furnished living area. Many have a balcony off the living area with tables and chairs to sit out on a nice day. The beds were comfortable.   All in all a lovely place to stay if travelling with children or a large party.,5,2017,01,08
239,Beautiful place for a walk,Not the first time we have been but such a beautiful place to go for a walk and then pop into either the new extended bar/restaurant or the original building for a coffee or delicious meal. Had the best hot chocolate in the main building on my previous visit but not so great this time around in the new pro shop extension. ,5,2017,01,08
239,Super dining experience,"Had a most wonderful meal in the Lady Helen restaurant- Michelin starred and rightly so - exquisite 7 course sampling menu, excellent advice on lovely wines. Really friendly and helpful staff. Beautiful cosy dining room in  large period house on lovely grounds.",4,2017,01,07
239,Nice venue...pity about the food and service.,Hotel is nice but lacks a warm welcome on arrival. It boasts a Michelin start restaurant which was closed.We were advised to go to Kendal's Restaurant at Hunters Yard which is on the grounds and which they offer to drive you to. All I can say is that the food was terrible and overpriced. Add to that pretty shoddy service I am surpised that this is associated with a ' 5 Star Hotel'. Breakfast in the hotel was also mediocre. Rooms were ok with beer stained cushions on the bed !!  The golf course was closed due to weather conditions. Overall the was a lack of attention to detail and I do not recommend.,2,2017,01,06
239,"""Wonderful Christmas Stay""","A fabulous destination to spend a family Christmas. Wonderful Christmas atmosphere, it was like home from home. Staff are extremely friendly and went out of their way to ensure we enjoyed our Family Christmas.  A big thank you to Louise who organised our stay,  Catherine in accommodation for the very warm welcome we received and Aga in the Lady Helen, where nothing was too much trouble  Thank, you all very much.  looking forward to our return visit.",5,2017,01,04
239,One that should be on everyone's list to stay in,"We booked Mount Juliet through a deal from a retailer, I live quite close in Waterford, so it was a last break from ourselves and our 1 year old before the 2nd baby was due to arrive in November.  
The grounds are amazing, I have played golf here before and walked it this time round, its a fantastic estate at any time of the year.  We arrived at a time the birds were off to rroost for the night and it set quite a cool atmosphere with hundreds of birds flying off to the many trees on the estate.  The check in was efficient and friendly with log fires burning all over the lobby and reception area.,  It made for a lovely homely atmosphere. The room was clean, warm and very comfortable with the cot supplied as requested.   The staff also brought the bags up while showing us to the room which was a real help with a toddler.  
The house itself was great to walk around, full of corridoors and nooks and crannies, really nice old house feel about it with none of the old house drafts.  Our 20 month old had a ball there, running around and up and down stairs with us - the staff were very friendly towards him and very accommodating when he popped up at the kitchen door to say hello!  
The food options were wonderful at breakfast, with dining options ranging from fine dining to food at the golf club (which was great too) and very handy again when you have small children.   All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed the stay, the walks, the views, the luxury, the relaxation at the leisure centre, and I know from before the golf course is excellent if people are looking to play also.
My only points to improve on would be for restaurant service to be a little more attentive when taking orders for families - we twice asked for childs food to come out straight away, and were twice left waiting (just makes things harder on parents).",5,2017,01,04
239,Perfection for a big birthday,"I have just spent a fabulous evening in Mount Juliet with my wife and family celebrating a big birthday. The staff could not have been better in catering for all our needs. We stayed in Mount Juliet House and we had dinner in Kendals. Both experiences were marvellous and to the highest standard.
However the undoubted highlight of the stay was the tour of the House and Estate by Des, the Customer Relations Manager. Des recounted the fascinating history and the various owners of the House and Estate with a wonderful enthusiasm and humour. I would highly recommend that guests staying at Mount Juliet take this tour as it would appeal to all whether familiar or not with Irish history.",5,2017,01,04
239,Beautiful country house near Kilkenny,"We are so glad we have discovered this wonderful house 1h30 drive from Dublin. Everything was wonderful . The property is so elegant, peaceful in this beautiful countryside. 
All the rooms have different style. We had booked a standard one but then we've asked for an upgrade and we had the chance to visit a few. The all have something special! Exactly what you would expect in this kind of property. We finally decided for the riverside view one, and it was so charming!!

We had book the dinner package (along with the room) in the gastronomic restaurant Lady Helen. Don't hesitate to do it if you plan to eat there anyway (if you don't want to drive 6-8 min to the closest village restaurants) . Food and service were excellent. Many courses all tasty and refined. Just a warning though, wine is not included and prices range from 50€ to much more...
Breakfast was perfect too! Different choices of dishes on demand.

We did a horse ride of 1h in the estate and it was great. We were lucky as at this time of year we had the paths just for us.
Our only regret is not to have stayed longer in this beautiful and romantic place.",5,2017,01,03
239,Wonderful wedding stay,"A genuine 5 star. 

We stayed at the Lord Dunboyne room in the manor house, a lovely, big room with huge bed and good finish. The bathroom was large and mostly clean (light fixture was loose, sink didn't drain, shower was a bit dribbly) but it did have underfloor heating which was a massive bonus in a December stay. 

If you do get the choice, we saw some other rooms on the river side which were a better view.

The house itself is stunning. The restaurant does a smashing full Irish and the bars (Mr. Jinx') are very comfortable and cosy, full of woods and leather. 

The staff were very helpful, from the porters on arrival, to the f&b staff, and at the wedding. 

All in all, this hotel is well well worth a visit.",5,2017,01,01
239,Beautiful estate,"Lovely old hotel full of atmosphere. Wedding in Hotel but did not interfere with guests in any way, in fact I would say it is an ideal place for a Wedding.  Lovely meals in the hotel including breakfast.

Our only problem was the fog....but we will have to return to get a better view of the golf course and gardens.",5,2016,12,21
239,Overnight stay,Wonderful experience with excellent food and service. Part of a large group attending a company function and the staff dealt with everything so seemlessly and professionally. Breakfast alone was a treat and cooked to order which makes a pleasant change from buffet fare.,5,2016,12,21
239,Relaxing but average stay,"Our room was in the older part of the hotel - the manor. Although nice, it was not as luxurious as expected. The bathroom had been renovated but everything else had not. No functioning AC or heating. Check in time was not until 4pm. We arrived at about 1.45/2, and got a phone call at 4pm that the room was ready.

With my partner being a picky eater, dining in the restaurant did not suit. So we instead had both lunch and dinner at the bar by the golf course - food was okay, nothing special. 
The staff were very friendly which was great.
I expected a lot more from the estate but I think it's more for the Golf Pros and enthusiasts than the couple who want the relaxing weekend away. 
Swimming pool was full of parents with young children running around screaming and jumping in the pool with armbands splashing into your face (both Sat + Sun), so we didn't relax as much as we hoped. (Maybe some set swim times for children would be good idea?).
The sauna was not as hot as desired but we were told that this was being looked at because it was broken that week. All in all, wouldn't rush to return with so many options in Ireland. ",3,2016,12,20
239,"Beautiful, lovely estate","What a wonderful location and hotel.  There are multiple common rooms with great places to enjoy afternoon tea or drinks.  The rooms are very nice with lovely views.  We stayed in a suite on the 2nd floor which had great views and lovely amenities.  It was very quiet.  Couldn't have asked for more.  We found the service and staff  outstanding.  We also recommend the food.  We also enjoyed the falconry lesson and the fly fishing.  Instruction was excellent.  Definitely recommend both.  Definitely would return.  Great location, beautiful grounds, excellent inn.",5,2016,12,07
239,Our Wedding At Mount Juliet,"It has been 2 weeks since my new husband and I got married at Mount Juliet and I can't believe it has taken me even this long to write a review. I could be here all day talking about gorgeous Mount Juliet and is and how amazing staff are, so I will try and summarize as best I can!
Planning the wedding with Alma (wedding coordinator) and Michal (F&B Manager) was an absolute dream. Alma is the most detailed and precise person I have met and manages to be so kind and caring at the same time. She really makes you feel you are the only bride in the whole world! Michal, who we are had our tasting with, gave us brilliant advice, which really paid off on the day! It made the build up to the wedding such a pleasure and we felt so relaxed knowing Alma was there!
To the team of chef's....all I can say is that all your hard work pays off! The food in the Lady Helen, Kendals and our buffet in the Jinx was exquisite! The level of thought and effort that goes into producing these wonderful meals is on another level. I can see the Michelin stars coming for years! All of our guests were blown away by the food...Thank you all so much!
The main house has recently been refurbished and is the definition of elegance and luxury, yet provides a sense of comfort and relaxation! The bedrooms are stunning....with 4 poster beds, bathtubs you could swim in and the most breathtaking views of the River Nore! Simply gorgeous! 
And what can I say about the staff....it's easy to be polite but the staff here really care....and I mean really care! They are so attentive, genuinely striving to ensure you have everything you need and it is all done with genuine smiles on faces! There are a few special mentions I would like to make: Chef John Kelly and your team, Alma and Michal as mentioned earlier, Des who was there to help, Eugene in the lobby who made sure everyone was looked after, AnneMarie in Kendals for making sure the evening ran so smoothly, AnneMarie in Lady Helen at breakfast which was always perfect, Julian behind the bar who helped my mom bring my elderly grandmother to her room...I know there are people I am forgetting and I'm so sorry but this review is for each and every member of staff! 
The staff are very obviously led by a wonderful management team with the most lovely and professional Christine Murphy at the forefront. The best I can sum it up, is a guest at the wedding said ""You feel like you know the staff and I really enjoyed chatting to them all and having a laugh.......and they know what you need before you even need it!""
Once again, we cannot say thank you enough to everyone for making us and our guests feel so special and looked after! We will be back as much as we possibly can! Looking forward to seeing you all soon, Ciara and Justin x",5,2016,12,06
239,Perfect short break,"Mount Juliet is a great place for a short break whether a golfer or not. The approach is 'very country club' which creates some initial disappointments but once you arrive at the house you get a better feel. While having a very warm and comfortable atmosphere the decor, furniture and fittings were frankly downmarket and out of place for such a great house. The food in both the Lady Helen's Restaurant and Kendals was excellent and service was friendly and efficient throughout the hotel.",4,2016,12,01
239,A Bit of everything - the best of everything!,"Absolutely wonderful weekend break. From the friendliness of the staff to the glory of the surroundings, it was a fabulous and unexpected November getaway. We walked the grounds, Pony trekked the surroundings and fished the lakes and we left feeling we didn't get to do everything i.e. golf, bike riding, tennis etc., we could have done with another 2-3 days easily. Definitely the best hotel stay we have ever had anywhere. The hotel has a gem in the shape of guest relations manager, Des McGrath, who has so many stories to tell and jokes too, a real gentleman and entertainer. It says it all really when our 10 year old daughter said she preferred her 2 night stay in Mount Juliet over her holiday earlier in the year at Legoland - as unbiased a review as you would ever get! It really is an ideal getaway for anybody looking to relax, unwind and just recharge the batteries.",5,2016,11,20
239," Ireland at its best!",Mount Juliet was absolutely beautiful! Highly recommend staying here. Take the time to explore the property with bikes. We went on all the trails on the property and loved the Irish countryside and wooded areas the property had to offer! The rooms were elegant and the staff was over the top! Loved our stay! Still talk about it today when we reminisce about our Ireland trip!,5,2016,11,16
239,"Classy hotel, great place to unplug and relax","With its understated elegance and attention to detail, Mount Juliet is truly a location for those who want a break away where your ever need is attended to with the greatest amount of ease and highest quality service.

The accommodation, staff, service, food and location are of the highest quality and I have no hesitation in recommending it as a first stop for those that want to unwind and relax.

If I were to find one slightly negative point - signage at the main gate could be better lit with more prominent wayfinder signage then for the various locations on the estate - however this could also be said to be in keeping with the general atmosphere - this is not for those that seek obvious glitz and glamour.",5,2016,11,15
239,Wonderful hotel with so much going for it.,"We have just returned home from a fantastic weekend break with friends at Mount Juliet.The experience was excellent.From the moment we went through the front door we were bowled over by the warm welcome and friendly,attentive and professional staff.The setting is magnificent 
with breathtaking views over the river and surrounding countryside.A superb location to walk the extensive site and enjoy peace and tranquility.The restaurant was fabulous too with a wonderful menu.The open fires and warm atmosphere provide a very enjoyable experience.This is an hotel well worthy of note. We had Scotish friends with us who were most complimentary.Looking forward to returning soon.",5,2016,11,13
239,Dropped your standards,"Last April I booked a room in the main house and dinner in the Michelin Star, St Helen’s restaurant, for a friend, who is celebrating her 50th Birthday. Last Monday 17th October ,  I got a call to say that I would now be having my ‘Michelin star dinner in a side room’ !! as the main restaurant is fully booked for a private party.  How can a restaurant take complete booking when last April we were advised to book the restaurant for dinner to be guaranteed and the hotel was also nearly full ! I doubt if Michelin star allows ‘side rooms’ however when I received the call from your receptionist, she in no way reassured me about this ‘side room’ and when I expressed my disappointment and expressed that I was considering cancelling the restaurant,   I was then asked 3 time would I also like to cancel the room, in a very abrupt manner.  It became   clear to me that she hoping I would also cancel the room - 7 months after making the booking!",2,2016,11,11
239,Heaven,Just home from a much needed night away with himself. We were upgraded to a manor house room which made the stay really unforgettable. The tete a tete dining was beautiful. The cocktails in the bar were fabulous. All in all we really enjoyed our stay and have been raving about the place since. Hope to be back soon!,5,2016,11,06
239,A whine for no wine,"Dinner for four in the pre-booked Lady Helen room at the Mount Juliet Estate was somewhat disappointing. With bottles of wine each costing at least 50 Euros you'd think their list would be up-to-date. Surprise to say they could not supply a requested bottle of Cotes de Rhone. A grovelling wine waiter who, I imagine, would claim to be a sommelier crawled back after several minutes to say they could not oblige but then proceeded to tell me (not recommend) what I would like instead. Not impressed - especially as the meal for four seemed pricey for the so-called chicness availing itself in the surrounds.",3,2016,11,06
239,Lovely historic surroundings!,"Spent a day in Mount Julliet and was very impressed with the buildings and the tasteful decor! Lovely sense of old!  Beautiful walks, fantastic golf course!  Lots of people enjoying afternoon tea and lots of lovely nooks for relaxing in! ",5,2016,11,03
239,"The most lovely estate in all of Ireland with the best staff, golf, tennis and fishing. Spa Too!","We got off the plane in Ireland at about 6:00 a.m. After getting our rental car, we took off with excellent directions toward Mount Juliet.  The ride took an hour of hairpin turns and tiny country roads broken by little towns with of course, taverns.  We pulled up to a magnificent 18th century ivy covered estate initially built by an English major. It sits in the middle of magnificent horse country, along the River Nore. Known for it's extraordinary service, there is nothing you can ask for that they don't provide. You can fish in the Nore using equipment they give you from the fishing room in the basement, equipped with anything you need. There is a billiard room in the basement as well and of course, a gorgeous Jack Nicklaus designed golf course with the biggest bunkers you've ever seen. We'd left our clubs at home but they rented us top shelf equipment. If horseback riding is your thing, they have it, along with tennis, badminton, a spa, lovely indoor pool and a terrific restaurant. Breakfast has you sitting in front of huge windows that look out on the river, across from paddocks where thoroughbred mares and their babies are each hand-lead down the path to the gate to frolic in lovely green pastures. Accomodations are plush; down comforters, large rooms that look out over the countryside and lots of places to read or catnap. We had initially booked an overnight stay as our starting off spot before heading off to other Irish adventures. We loved Mount Juliet so much we stayed there 3 days before forcing ourselves to leave to see the rest of Ireland. I would go back in a heartbeat and in fact, we've booked it for our 40th anniversary in two years. Can't wait! BTW, Tiger Woods stayed there when he was playing in a tournament held at Mount Juliet and the waitress staff all told us wonderful stories about him. They love him there.",5,2016,11,02
239,Annual Visit,"The refurbishments to the property are very tasteful and we had a fantastic October bank holiday break . 
we spent most of the days in the spa and it was wonderful . Niamh Tynan does the best message that i have ever experienced . 
congratulations to the team on the wonderful and relaxed servic",5,2016,11,02
239,Pastoral Paradise,"The word ""serene"" best describes this lovely, historic estate. The rooms were large and comfortably appointed and the staff couldn't have been more helpful and gracious. This estate offers the best of golf, country and city because of its close location to Kilkenny. This is one place in Ireland we'll definitely go back to. Be sure to take a tour of the grounds with Louis. He's a delightful fountain of knowledge about the history of the estate.",5,2016,10,31
239,A pleasant sunday lunch in the Majors Bar,"Brought our elderly mother for a birthday lunch ot the Majors Bar.  We had thought the lunches would be a bit more formal from the discussions over the phone, but it was more bar food.  This was not actually a problem for us, because this is the kind of food we like. But it was a problem for others who had pinned their hopes and dreams on meat and two veg. 

The room is beautiful with the most gorgeous view over the right side of the estate (A view over a golf course being as attractive as a view over a business park).  If you want to see the river itself, book a window seat.

Some people were there having afternoon tea - which looked very good indeed!  Always wondered where a girl could go to get a fabulous afternoon tea round these parts.  Look no further. But the mother had had her fill of afternoon tea the day before - lunch it was.  

She had a silky leek and potato soup that was a goreous deep green colour.  That was washed down with a steak sandwich and a cup of tea.  Just her kind of thing. The sister had some local smoked trout that she was happy with and shared a hummus/toasted focaccia with me.  I had a cheese toastie, which I am never unhappy to be forced to have due to an absence of other meatless vittels.  A nice glass of chardonnay helped me pull through.

Service was friendly and initially very efficient, then the staff got run off their feet with walk-ins.  They do say you don't have to book.  One group were appalled that a proper lunch was not served.  But they were staying, then they weren't, then they were, etc etc.  Another group didn't like where they were sitting, moved, complained about everything then when their food arrived promptly got up and left leaving it untouched.  An inquiry was launched.  Senior staff came one at a time to inspect the crime scene - a forlorn scone, a pot of tea, something on a slab of wood - where had it all gone wrong?  Some kind of family occasion in the room next door was spilling children into the room periodically.  Holy delilah.  Moving at 75mph, staff zoomed past with towers of cakes, pausing every now and then to apologise and ask what was it we wanted again. Nothing really - we were quite happy.

Moral of the story - come early of a sunday afternoon before this gracious dining room of the former landed gentry becomes properly overrun with the marauding Irish ;-)",4,2016,10,30
239,Need to Stay at least 2 days,"This Estate was fantastic, my favorite of a 2 week trip to Ireland. The surrounding property with a horse farm made for a magic bike ride.  Rooms very nice, food delicious, great service. Give time to fish for trout.  We were only there one night which was not enough.  Dinner at Golf Course dinning room was perfect.  Perfect property to enjoy beauty of Ireland.",5,2016,10,26
239,A beautiful period mansion in idyllic setting spoiled by niggly issues,"Second visit in 12 months. Renovations which were underway in December last now completed. Our room 5 was in a ground floor wing. The heating was inadequate. Only 1 of 3 radiators in bedroom worked (it was tepid). When we reported this the porter who was sent to deal with the issue suggested the heat might be on a timer. He promised to check it out later. The problem remained. We had an exactly similar experience with similar ""result"" during our December visit ( upstairs room to front of house). The new bar and reception area are a big improvement. It is disappointing that visits to top venues at top prices are marred by issues which must be obvious to management and which should be sorted. There is nothing worse than to start a stay with complaints. The staff were all very friendly but I would question their commitment to deal with bona fide complaints. On check out I again highlighted the issues. I had to ask for a receipt twice when I paid my account. The property is beautiful but the guest experience could be improved.",3,2016,10,25
239,Visit to Kilkenny,"This hotel is located in gorgeous countryside adjacent to a golf course.  The staff were extremely courteous and helpful.  The rooms were wonderful.  It all added up to a very relaxing stay.  One tip; since its location is a little remote, make a dinner reservation when you make a room reservation.  We did not do so and ate instead in the President's Bar close by - here the food was great and the atmosphere a little more relaxed.  All in all, a wonderful experience and one to be repeated.",5,2016,10,22
239,Slow service ,Went for lunch in the new golf club. Service was very slow. We had been at the main house the night before and service was slow too. It was not what I expect from a five star accommodation. Would not return. The grounds are lovely for a walk. ,1,2016,10,21
239,Beautiful place! ,"Had a wonderful 2 night stay here. Very good food and accommodations. Service was inconsistent and there is no elevator!
Des, who gives estate tours, was the best! Our newbest friend. Would love to return when we had time for golf.",4,2016,10,18
239,Weekend away,"Went here for a weekend celebration  .We got a lovely suite overlooking the river .The meal in the restaurant was excellent ,Ivan see why they won a Michelin Star ,overall a great experience and will do it again . ",5,2016,10,17
239,Lovely setting & full of promise,We have visited Mount Juliet over many years and it seems to be losing its country house feel and styling and becoming more hotel chain.  There seems to be more and more development which is clearly taking the senior team's eye off the ball.  We used to love popping into the bar for either lunch or supper after a busy morning/day out but now not so much.  We used to recommend to friends and family and very much hope to again.  We spend most of the year in Kilkenny and want all our hotels/restaurants/attractions to feature prominently in Ireland - it is a wonderful welcoming county.  Lady Helen is still good but not the wow it was.   The hotel is in the most beautiful setting and offers a great golf course.  We will keep going back and review when we do.,3,2016,10,17
239,Very nice!,"Stayed for two nights while our husbands golfed.  It's in a beautiful location, however, our bathroom had an emergency exit door to the hallway and it felt like everyone in the hall was walking right through our bathroom!  It felt very public!
The food in the main dining room is OK, but the service is very, very slow.  Had a much better dinner at the golf course.  Mt Juliet is not near any town, so you are a captive audience for food.",4,2016,10,14
239,Recommended,"Stayed here for a wedding. Beautiful estate and with the plus of a Championship golf course. Different types of accommodation - Main House, Cottages and Clubhouse. Main house magnificent (stayed in the same room as Bruce Springsteen apparently - top floor big apartment room and fabulous view - he has good taste) Everyone else said the other accommodation was also top class. Leisure suite great and the main house also has a Michelin Star restaurant (Lady Helen) but Club House Bar and Restaurant also great. Staff excellent. Perfect for a short break.",5,2016,10,13
239,The lap of luxury!,"The Mount Juliet is possibly the most enchanting place I have ever stayed. From the moment you pull up to the ivy covered main house, you are treated like royalty.  The staff is of the upmost professionalism and courtesy.  The rooms are extremely large, very private, and very quiet.  The surrounding grounds are something out of a fairytale...from the horses grazing the green fields, to the gurgling of the river, to the perfectly manicured lawns and gardens...there is even a walled garden straight out of a storybook. I only wish we could have spent more time there to enjoy all the resort has to offer...a Jack Nicholas designed golf course, equestrian riding, falconry, archery, tennis, spa services, etc.  ",5,2016,10,07
239,weekend away as a couple,"we have syayed in the mount juliet hotel a few times and have always loved the experience.This time i have to say was a little dissappointing though.We have always stayed in the main house but this time were booked in to the hunters yard,which is to my mind more for golfers.the room was very small and we could have been imy average hotel in the country.the estate is now run by the Conrad group and i feel it lack the personal touch of the previous owners and if you are not staying in the main house you are almost looked on as a second class citizen!!we love the grounds and the beautiful surroundings,the whole place is visually stunning but we felt the service,particularly in the Presidents bar,left a lot to be desired of a 5 star resort.",3,2016,10,04
239,Afternoon tea in amazing surroundings,"Afternoon was very beautifully presented.  Plenty to go around. Sandwiches were outstanding. Selection was very good, and all of the group were happy with the choices.  I would definitely recommend Mount Juliet for afternoon tea.  I cannot wait to return.",5,2016,10,03
239,Cottage Stay,"Stayed in one of the cottages onsite for a little mini break with the kids. They were fantastic, next to a playgound, with a beautiful walled garden.
We ate in the bar and the portions, even though not on the cheap side were tasty and large. The breakfast the following morning was to die for! The kids loved their pancakes  with Nutella and the staff were warm and friendly! I will return!",5,2016,09,28
239,"David, Ruth and Luke are just amazing!","We had a lovely experience in your bar there on Saturaday night. We were served by the super-impressive Ruth and Luke and they were just so incredibly professional and welcoming. The supervisor on the night, David (forgive me if the name is wrong) went above and beyond to make us feel extra special for this birthday meal - a masterclass in customer service.",5,2016,09,26
239,So Peaceful and Full of Ireland's Wonderful Hospitality,"Visited Mount Juliet in August for a family meal. Our family is a large one and so we had
a room just for us, which was lovely. The table settings and lay out were just as planned and the service was brilliant. We had a set three course meal and it could not have been any better. Many thanks to all the staff who waited on us, you did a great job!

After our meal, we all went for a relaxing stroll around the grounds plus the weather was
beautiful, so when in Ireland, you make the most of the sun when it appears.
My husband worked here during the summer many years ago when they were 
re-landscaping the grounds so this place holds many memories for us.
Will we visit again? You bet.",4,2016,09,23
239,Always Enjoyable,On our second trip to Ireland from the US we made a return visit to Mt. Juliet.  A good golf course is available for you.  There are different activites on the grounds and there are many things to go and see and do in the area.  A lovely spaciious room and a bottle of wine greated us.,5,2016,09,22
239,Can't wait to visit again ,"We had afternoon tea here for my granny's 90th. From the minute we got there, the staff did everything they could to make sure my granny enjoyed it, including one of the staff piping her out back to the car. Excellent service all round. ",5,2016,09,21
239,Beautiful Resort!,"Wow, is all I can say about our stay here! The Estate is breathtaking and the service is superb. The rooms are very different which I found to be very charming. We did the falcon experience which I highly recommend. If you are planning on visiting this area, you MUST STAY HERE...You will not regret it!",5,2016,09,19
239,Family dinner,Went there with family on Saturday evening for family meal. I ordered vegetable stir fry as the vegetarian actions are limited to only 2 main courses. What came was literally only nudles pepoers and onions. It's a joke.  They call that a meal in supposedly posh place.  I won't be wasting my petrol and money going there anymore.,1,2016,09,17
239,Excellent ,"We have dined in the Hunter's Yard quite a few times over the summer and we were never disappointed. I have worked in the hotel industry myself so I know the difficulties in getting everything running smoothly. I brought several friends also and I was very proud of the reception we received. Each time we were there the same manager seemed to be on duty, luckily for us. He made us feel so welcome and even arranged a birthday surprise for one of our guests without even being asked. I found the staff very friendly and a harmonious environment prevailed largely due to the manager and his people skills. I didn't have time to get his name but I think I heard someone call him Conor? Great management potential. I also brought some Polish friends and they were very impressed. They have since been promoting your premises on social media so take a well deserved bow. We will be back! ",5,2016,09,17
239,Highs and Lows,"Dissapointed on this occasion with our trip. Standards of customer care seem to be slipping among the staff. Some were excellent others certainly not so much. 
Also have a good look over your bill before you leave. 
Pros: Food, service can be excellent, cleanliness, quality of the rooms.  
Cons: Some waiters/bar staff, bill was incorrect",3,2016,09,14
239,Food Was Muck!,"Went for lunch in the Hunters Yard for a birthday celebration. Living locally we know the standard of food fluctuates here quite a lot but recently seems to be getting good reviews. We waited a while to be seated, not a problem as it was busy and you can't book. Once we ordered we waited about 45 minutes for food to arrive. Only ordered mains! Burgers were the worst I have had in a long time. They came with cold chips and a warm shrivelled up salad. They were replaced but this is not the standards expected. The roast beef was like a school dinner.  No choice of how you would like it cooked. A small discount made on the bill but overall our lunch was an awful experience. Need to pull your socks up MJ! ",1,2016,09,14
239,Lunch in the President's Bar,"We were on mini-moon, and on the way back to Dublin, we thought we'd drop in here for a treat and have a nice lunch with a view.  I seldom give bad reviews because mistakes happen, but for the standard of this place, we were shocked.  
Our experience: 
- When asked for a seat for lunch, we were rudely pointed to a seat from a distance. 
- After waiting for 5-10 minutes, eventually got up to find the menus ourselves.
- After several more minutes, got up to find a waiter to take our order, and told they would come to our table
- Eventually someone came.  We ordered Chowder with GF bread, a coffee, a Kale salad, 1 tea, and water for the table
- Food came before drinks - had to ask for drinks again. 
- Water never appeared, tea had slime on top (which we complained about and were not charged for). No butter for the bread, asked for it twice but also it never appeared. 
- Chowder was the smallest I've ever seen, in a tiny soup bowl and it wasn't great at all
- Kale salad was grand, but again small. Nothing amazing. 
Overall, bad experience, poor food, overpriced for what we got, and terrible service.  We had 4 different waiters serve us in total, and only 1 of them seemed to know what he was doing.  We didn't even get a view because they were digging up the lawns!",1,2016,09,13
239,Disappointing experience -- beautiful setting,"We stayed in mid August. Lots of little things added up to a disappointing stay. For example, the hotel information says you can borrow tennis rackets for the tennis court, but in fact all they could unearth was one broken adult racket and one child's racket (we were two adults). The swimming pool is nice, but you have to wear a hat and unlike other hotels they won't lend you one -- you have to buy one. On our second night the fire alarm went off (by mistake) in the small hours. I imagined we'd receive apologies for the disturbance when we checked out in the morning. However, it wasn't mentioned, and when I raised it the receptionist made a joke of it. The house and grounds are beautiful (although note the room we stayed in had a shower over the bath, not a separate bath/shower), and the food was good, but sadly the service wasn't luxury hotel standard.",3,2016,09,06
239,Great place ,"Just spent a wonderful night at this beautiful country estate, staff are very attentive food in the Lady Helen is amazing the breakfast is equally  as good I would highly recommend for a short break or Golf",5,2016,09,06
239,Beautiful Setting ,"We spent a few days at this resort and had a nice stay. Room felt tired and small. Service was fantastic. When they lost our dinner reservations to Lady Helen, they claimed they had a computer failure. We did get have dinner in this Michelin star restaurant. Then on our last day, we had an estate tour scheduled and they told us they had computer failure again.  We only had a very short abbreviated tour because another party was scheduled over the top of our tour. 😒. ",4,2016,09,03
239,Absolutely beautiful and the staff the match,"From the moment we arrived till the moment we left we just had such a peaceful, relaxed and enjoyable time. We arrived before the check in time but the girl at reception took all our details and allowed us to use the facilities. We had afternoon tea out the front of the manor house which was just exquisite. I have NEVER tasted sandwiches let alone cakes like them. There was such flavour to every bite you took. The pool is lovely, the grounds are gorgeous to go for a cycle around and there are tennis courts. I believe there are house riding lessons also! 
We stayed in an absolutely beautiful room on the far left of the house that had a stairs down to the extraordinary bathroom! It was to die for!
The staff throughout the entire grounds are all so friendly, polite and helpful. Nothing was too much! I couldn't recommend this place enough. I fell in love with it and took the wedding brochure upon leaving!!",5,2016,08,31
239,Affordable luxury,"Stayed in the Manor House  for family wedding, what a wonderful experience.  Decor and staff excellent, with none of the stiff formality that  can be evident in some 5 star hotels.  Worth  saving for as a special treat",5,2016,08,30
239,A fine country estate,"Visited with friends on a golfing excursion around Ireland. The golf course was most enjoyable and well presented. We enjoyed excellent accommodation in the main house and a fine meal at Kendall's Restaurant. A very delicious breakfast was included in our tariff. Our only disappointment was with the service level of some of the staff. We visited an almost empty bar, and still had to ask for the beverage list. We were given a snacks menu instead, and then had to chase the barman for service.",4,2016,08,29
239,Avoid Hunter's Yard,"Every part of the stay was lovely- dinner at Lady Hellen's, walking along property, horseback riding- with exception of room. My room in Hunter's Yard was rather disappointing (other areas of estate were fully booked). Room was very very dated. I would have enjoyed the small patio outside room but mine faced construction equipment. I am a little unsure if room I received was due to low rate I booked through Travelocity but it was overall a disappointed from my parent's rave reviews of this property.",3,2016,08,29
239,Overnight stay.,"We stayed one night in mid August. The room was very well appointed in the main house. We had dinner in Kendals restaurant which was excellent, and the service of a very high standard.
The following day my wife and daughters availed of the Spa services which they thoroughly enjoyed.
The barman in the residents lounge on Sunday Aug 15th was very friendly and provided excellent service.

The breakfast in the morning was wonderful, prompt service, wonderful choice of food, and great coffee.

We found our short stay wonderfully relaxing, and plan to return for longer stay at a future date. ",5,2016,08,28
239,5 Star and Something Special extra,"It was just a two day break to relax . We arrived to the news that we had been upgraded to a room in the main house with its own access to a  beautiful walled garden . The room was massive and had everything in it you could possibly want .
The estate itself is huge and takes about two hours just to walk round , but a very helpful Reception offered us complimentary bicycles including an electrically assisted one if we wanted. We made good use of the excellent pool and spa facilities , but didn't have time for the golf, horse riding, tennis or salmon fishing. 
The staff are fantastic and seem to want to make things special for guests , they even have a member of staff who can give you an entertaining and comprehensive history of the estate back to the 1600s .
Breakfast was more or less anything you want cooked in any way you like . The grilled kippers with poached eggs are the best I have ever had at any hotel in the world. 
We left after two days totally relaxed as one of the staff played the bagpipes outside the main reception.  PURE GENIUS.
We will be back !

",5,2016,08,25
239,"Overall a pleasant stay, but a few things need to be addressed.","Mount Juliet is a lovely property. The golf course and landscaping are beautiful and serene. We thoroughly enjoyed a walk around the property, including down by the river. The pool, sauna, and fitness center facilities are really nice and a welcome relaxation area. The breakfast is a great set-up, with lots of options and friendly service. The service from the hotel staff (reception) was friendly, but not up to par for a property of this type. We were told our room was ready and that keys would be brought to us in the clubhouse bar. However, they completely forgot, and I had to call twice before the keys were delivered. I find this poor service to be unacceptable anywhere, but especially this type of property. The rooms are comfortable and tastefully decorated. However, the Hunters Yard rooms are a bit dated and have a few issues. The showers leak (we had two rooms and both had leaks). Further, the decor is older and there are a few stains on the curtains, chairs, etc. Overall, this is still a nice place to stay, especially for the serenity of the surroundings and the central location to both Kilkenny and Waterford, but the rooms do need some updating, the shower leaks need to be addressed, and the service should be brought up to a higher standard.",4,2016,08,25
239,Great Service,"Recently stayed at Mount Juliet for a family wedding, we stayed for three nights and cannot say enough about it. The house and the grounds are amazing but it is the staff that really make it. From the moment we arrived they could not do enough for us. Rooms were large and comfortable with beautiful views.

The wedding reception was held in the marquee close to the main house. Both the food and the service were excellent. The bar staff were really friendly and efficient. The only minor problem was at one stage they ran out of some drinks at the bar but the staff were very apologetic and polite while they waited to be restocked. The staff also went above and beyond to ensure all those attending the wedding were returned to their accommodation safely at the end of the night as some were staying in the main house and others in the various lodges and cottages on the grounds of the estate and unfortunately it was raining. 

We spent the day after the wedding relaxing in the main house and walking the beautiful grounds.  This was a great way to unwind after the celebrations from the day before. Over all it was a great stay. Looking forward to visiting again soon.",5,2016,08,24
239,Perfection,"Such a beautiful tranquil place. Nothing is too much trouble and the staff are outstanding. We were upgraded to a magnificent room overlooking the river, the view was so beautiful and the sound of the river that night was so peaceful. The food is fantastic, our afternoon tea, our evening meal and our breakfast were all equally delicious, it has everything you could want as a family, pool, playground, horse riding and a secret garden and our stay was nothing short of perfection. Thank you to all the staff and management of Mount Juliet who assisted us during our stay and for ensuring that it was perfect, we really appreciated it.  ",5,2016,08,23
239,take a step back,"stayed here in November 2015, overall great experience, stayed in the main house room was excellent, ate in the restaurant also, second to none, had a treatment at the spa too decadant.
hubby said Golf is excellent, but the shooting was better(lol) for me.",5,2016,08,23
239,Kids on golf buggies,"Stayed in Mount Juliet for only one night, we had booked the Hunters Lodge but was upgraded to the main house which I was happy with. The check in staff were very friendly, our bags were taken to our room by a lovley man who gave us the history of the hotel as we walked.  The room was big with a lovely big bed some of the furniture could have been better looked after.  During the night alot of noise one two and four o'clock people coming and going, was suprised I could hear all that because our room was double doored but the noise came from above.,
When the comings and goings  died down it was replaced by a fan or some sort of vent which rattled on and on. I wondered if it might have been better in the Hunters Lodge guess I'll never know.  Went for a walk although it was just getting dark there were kids driving around on golf carts which we had to watch out for as they were moving a little too fast for their  how should I say maybe their driving experience.  We went horse riding the next morning which was very enjoyable.  Breakfast was lovely although the selection of bread brought to the table could have been fresher a little on the yesterdays side.",4,2016,08,19
239,WEDDING ANNIVERSARY BREAK,"My wife and I were in Eire for a week and we booked two nights at the Mount Juliet Estate to enjoy our 35th Wedding Anniversary. We had a room in Hunter's Yard; a stable block which has been converted and is around 300 yards from the main house.
Our room was spacious, quiet and comfortable with a lovely walk in shower.
The estate is 1500 acres and is a peaceful haven; you can enjoy walks, golf, fishing, riding plus other activities, as well as the spa. Breakfast was taken in the restaurant overlooking the golf course and the food was plentiful, wide ranging and the cooked breakfast was delicious.
A lovely place to stay for that special occasion.",5,2016,08,19
239,Loved every second,"Stayed in Mount Juliet Estate for one  night and I can definitely say it was not enough. Everything about this place was fantastic.  Stayed in the hunters lodge, rooms were a bit basic but very nice and comfortable. The beds were just perfect and I had a great nights sleep. The whole estate is beautiful with plenty of lovely scenery and walks to take. Once you are here you do not need to leave again. It felt so magical and relaxed. I did not want to leave! It is true what they say, you get what you pay for.",5,2016,08,18
239,Lovely rooms and excellent service ,"We stayed here last night and had a great stay. The rooms are really lovely with gorgeous furniture. Service is really good and the restaurant there I would highly recommend. We had a lovely meal, very high standard of food. We had lovely wines and port was especially good. We had a great time and will be back!! ",4,2016,08,17
239,A Beautiful Property,A lovingly looked after manor house with eclectic bedrooms. No A/C in my room so if it's hot be aware. Breakfast very good and so was the espresso. A place to relax with generally good service and willing staff. Views not too bad either.,4,2016,08,15
239,Dinner ,From the word go everything was wrong I had to go and ask for menus even though 4 staff were standing around  ordered out meal my wife had fish chips and peas I had what was advertised as an open gammon sandwich and seafood chowder  it arrived with the chowder spilt over the sandwich which without the mustard would have been a tasteless mess the chowder was just milk with some bits of fish floating in it my wife meal was no better I had some of the fish which I was sorry for the greasy taste was in my mouth until I got home and used mouth wash and frozen chips in a place like that wake up 45 euro will not be back at least the dog enjoyed the walk zero to staff and food avoid it,2,2016,08,14
239,Very disappointing,"We stayed one night and from check-in to check-out we were very disappointed. The service was so poor in both the main house and Kendals restaurant. Perhaps each issue on it's own would be a minor irritant but it seemed to be one thing after another. Thank god we saved the hot stone massage until the end, as that seemed to be the only positive thing about our stay. For the price you pay, I wouldn't recommend staying here. There are much better places where you get better value and service for your money. Such a shame.",1,2016,08,14
239,Country estate visit,"Greeted by the hotel staff upon our arrival for our 2 night stay at this beautiful property was the perfect preamble for a terrific experience.  The staff are warm, hospitable and helpful.  My stay in the Lady Juliana suite with its walled garden was delightful.  The buffet breakfast was sumptuous and well presented and there was something for every taste or, if preferred, you can order from the menu.  Our first dinner at the casual Presidents Bar located a short distance from the hotel and overlooking the golf course was well prepared and tasty and our dinner the following evening in the Lady Helen dining room exceptional.  Our falconry experience with John was informative and having the opportunity to fly these beautiful birds was a not to be missed experience.  We were also able to handle the owls as well as the hawks...beautiful!",5,2016,08,13
239,Great place to stay in Kilkenny Ireland,"Beautiful location!  Scenery was lovely.  Hotel was stunning.  Clean.  Great service.  We had a room on the second floor with a beautiful view overlooking the river, but really I think any view from this hotel would be beautiful.   Eileen (not sure I spelled that correctly) who works in the reception office is absolutely amazing at her job!  Very accommodating and super helpful.    

To get here from Dublin airport is a bit tricky, but just research ahead of time;  Let the hotel know in advance if you'll be needing a complimentary ride from the train;  If you are thinking of doing any of the activities there, schedule them in advance.

Enjoy your stay!   You won't be disappointed.",5,2016,08,09
239,August stay ,"We stayed for two nights in the Manor House . Lovely big spacious room , breakfast and dinner were excellent . 
The new clubhouse is being finished and the Manor House refurbishment is fab . We went horse riding which was great fun and the golf course as good as ever . Only one negative , I had a spa treatment which was mediocre. Staff were as charming and accommodating as ever and looking forward to returning again soon . ",5,2016,08,09
239,Heavenly,"We stayed in the cottages for a friend's wedding and it was perhaps the highlight of our entire trip to Ireland. 

The grounds itself is immaculate and has so much character and beauty in every detail. There's literally a fantastic photo opportunity in every corner. The cottage we stayed at was beautifully decorated with all the amenities you could want including an individual washer and dryer. The staff around the property seemed very friendly and exceptionally helpful! 

I now understand why everyone raves about Mt. Juliet! ",5,2016,08,09
239,I could live in this style,"Upon our arrival the staff were outside waiting for our tour bus with a member playing bagpipes and cool refreshments waiting for us as we departed the coach.This was just the start to a great stay at Mt Juliet! Our room was very large and very well appointed with a balcony. Food and service at all of the restaurants was quiet good. My wife and I very much enjoyed walking the grounds, we were able on the second day to take a nine mile walk around the entire estate, then have a very nice lunch at the clubhouse. If we had more time we would have played on the Nicolas golf course, maybe next time. We would very highly recommend staying here if you have the opportunity!",5,2016,07,31
239,Wish i coukd have stayed longer!,"Visited this hotel for one night in July. What a treat! Stunning grounds with beautifully manicured gardens. Perfect for a relaxing break. Stayed in the manor house in a superior room which was beautifully appointed, a great size with an extremely comfortable bed. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The food was excellent. I woukd thoroughly recommend this property for a chill out break. There are plenty of activities to suit everyone. The room rates are very reasonable for a hotel of this standard. Next time i plan to stay longer!",5,2016,07,28
239,"Lodge rooms ok, spa gorgeous","Room in the lodge part of the hotel ( not the castle) were ok. Clean, spacious but quite basic. Bathroom was good, lovely toiletries and excellent shower. 
Breakfast was good, plenty of choice.
The spa was fantastic, really luxurious.",4,2016,07,28
239,What has happened?,"Mount Juliet used to be one of my favourite places to visit. Amazing buildings in beautiful surroundings but more than anything the service and standards were superb.  Staff were always so helpful and professional and it felt like real 5 star luxury.  On a recent visit I was shocked to see how much standards have fallen.  I know the hotel was sold in recent times and am wondering if the purchasers are planning on turning it into a run of the mill 3 star job? All the old staff who were so brilliant and professional appear to be gone, not sure if they decided to go themselves or if the new guard got rid of their best asset - staff.  Once your reputation is gone it takes an awfully long time to build it up again.  Place was dirty, disorganised and disappointing. I really hope that the place can be rescued before it is too late.  I for one will not be returning... perhaps I should find out where the GM and Managers are and visit those places instead as I'm sure I would find proper standards.",1,2016,07,28
239,Beautiful setting,"Nice hotel.  We stayed in the cottages though.  So couldn't have breakfast at Lady Helens- though the breakfast location for the cottages (about 100 yards away from the main hotel) is nice and the food is good.  The walks on the grounds are very nice, especially down from the hotel, over the river and by the horses and cows.  Very picturesque in the evenings",4,2016,07,27
239,Sunday escapade with friends,"My 3 girl friends and I had booked horse riding on the grounds of Mount Juliet one Sunday afternoon and as we arrived early we decided to have afternoon tea before our horse ride and what a fab time we had! 
The afternoon tea was so reasonably priced and had such a lovely spread that none of us were wanting for more after. Tea was included but we had a cheeky glass of prosecco each which cost extra but at a special price. Such a treat it was served to us outside overlooking the grounds. Staff were most friendly and accommodating (especially when we had to move everything inside due to typical unpredictable Irish weather) and even provided a car for us down to the horse stables. The horse riding was over priced for a short trek around the grounds and though our guide couldn't be more pleasant and informative; unfortunately the new owner was quite rude and very unhelpful when there was confusion with the price but I would highly recommend a visit to Mount Juliet, with the afternoon tea a must! We will be back!",5,2016,07,27
239,A Real Treat,"Spent one night in this hotel with a friend for 'Wuthering Heights'.  We really enjoyed our stay,  the staff were so helpful and friendly,  We had a lovely breakfast and walked around some of the scenic walking routes.  Please do some more affordable  'special offers' for the main house and we will be back.

239,Beatiful ride!,"My husband and I are traveling through Kilkenny area on the way back to Dublin, and 2 people suggested Mt Juliet for great golf and horse riding. The course is lush and beautiful, the estates are spell bounding, and the riding was by the beautiful scenic river and around the grounds on an astounding Irish bred Sporthorse--phenomenal! Seriously, top notch.  Service at clubhouse bar is friendly and accommodating with a lovely atmosphere. Did not stay here overnight, but truly wish we were booked!",5,2016,07,21
239,Overpriced and terrible administration,"Stayed one night in Rose cottage as part of a large family celebration.  Lovely houses but they charged me €70 extra for third child (pull out bed) and also charged me full price for each child at the family dinner although we had agreed verbally to have half portions at half price so get everything in writing.
Their admin is all over the place, they took multiple deposits from my cc account without my permission and also failed to recognise deposits paid for a number of our party.  We all had to go home and trawl through cc bills!
Mount Juliet is a beautiful place but they really need to sort out their administration, I have been trying to get this issue sorted now for 4 days and still don't have written confirmation of what they owe me!",1,2016,07,21
239,PRETTY BUT,"I have an issue with steps.  We asked many months ahead for a first floor.  Wjen we checked, they had the request but said they couldn't accommodate our needs.  We were put on the THIRD  floor(62  steps up).  Their lack of caring and detail is severely lacking.  Also the towels are like TEA TOWELS.",3,2016,07,21
239,Had a fabulous stay in ,"Mount Juliet lodges are a fantastic place to stay with children we had so much to do like tennis , cycling around the fabulous estate , playground , golf driving range and use of leisure centre , we also got to use the equestrian centre . The lodges are so spacious and beautifully decorated with a fully equipped kitchen . We can't wait to come back and stay again . ",5,2016,07,20
239,Memorable Family Vacation,"After spending two nights and three days in Mount Juliet Estate I can say with certainty that we had the most wonderful experience of hospitality with a very high standard of customer service. 

From start to finish the experience was fabulous. We took a lodge for 4 kids aged 12yrs to 4yrs and two adults. The lodge was spacious, clean and beautifully appointed with proximity to the playground and leisure centre. 

Breakfast every morning at Kendals was excellent with a very efficient and welcoming team out front. We dined at night in the Pres Bar and again both the children and adults were totally satisfied. Drinks at night in the Manor House and during the day at the Pres Bar was so relaxing and excellent value. 

However the activities and the amount of them available within the Estate was so impressive. We never left the estate for 3 days. Golf, Tennis, Croquet, Cycling, Equestrian and Leisure Centre. To experience the children not looking at screens for the whole break was refreshing, thankfully the weather helped. 

On a final note hospitality is about a warm welcome and efficient service Mount Juliet delivered and I have no doubt will continue to do so. The children did not want to leave and already planning on a return visit.
Compliments to the entire team",5,2016,07,17
239,Excellent food and service,"We decided to called into Mount Juliet for some lunch. 
Sarah served us and was very friendly.
We had soup and sandwiches combo which was very good.
Lovely homemade soup and nice fresh sandwiches.
We spoke to Des, the guest relation manager who really brightens your day with the history of Mount Juliet.
We dined in the Presidents bar.
The grounds are so peaceful. Its a really lovely place to visit.",5,2016,07,16
239,Five star treatment,I recently visited this stunning estate with friends for a round of golf.. And as we were early we decided to check out the golf club bar for tea & a light snack. We were made feel very welcome by the staff & management which added to a greats days golf on one of the finest golf courses in ireland. Already looking forward to my next visit !! ,5,2016,07,14
239,Beautiful property - hotel rooms so so,"The estate is gorgeous.  Lots of activities...golf, falconry, spa, horseback riding, etc.
We found the hotel rooms to be old, musty and very small. We asked to have our room changed and they said they were full but would try the following night.  No one even got back to us at all.
The room had a double bed squeezed into a spot where you could barely get out of bed without hitting the wall.  Definitely not for 2 people.  So if you go, make sure you get a bigger room.   We did not sleep for the 2 nights we were there.",3,2016,07,13
239,A fabulous get away!!!,"From the moment we arrived to when we checked out we were so impressed with the whole experience. We were greeted by a lovely porter who kindly brought us to our room in the Hunters Lodge. We ate in Kendals Restaurant and were not disappointed with the food. The service was excellent and all the staff were very helpful and attentive.
I would like to give a special thanks to Tess, our breakfast waitress. Having gone to the dining room without my glasses, she very kindly read out the menu to me and recommended the absolutely gorgeous french toast.
We were only there for one night on this occasion but hopefully will be able to stay longer on our next visit.",5,2016,07,12
239,Wonderful,"Wonderful setting, with golf, horseback riding, fishing, great restaurants etc.  beautiful rooms, friendly and helpful staff - you can't ask for more.  Large wonderful bathrooms, comfortable bed.  Highly recommend.",5,2016,07,12
239,Mount Juliet heaven,"Myself and my wife stayed here last weekend and from check in to departure we were made feel so welcome by the very friendly and efficient team at mount Juliet.
Looking forward to our next stay at this wonderful hotel.
Thanks again, we will be back soon.",5,2016,07,12
239,Falling Standards!,"We have been regular customers of Mount Juliet over the last number of years.
My sister owns a house near by.Myself my husband and kids often visit during our holidays.On a recent visit we noticed that the club house bar has become messy, run down and disorganised their used to be 2 managers there all the time but I don't think I have seen either of them in the last 6 months or more Annmarie & Stephen ( I think) their were both great at organising and took great pride in their job at the moment it seems to be lacking this leadership, staff gathering in coffee area for a weekly catch up,standards of food not been kept,drinks presented differently each visit.
On a side not we visit Mount Juliet House for afternoon tea which was amazing love the new decor.",3,2016,07,11
239,"Afternoon Tea, not a great experience.","We visited for afternoon tea, we phoned to specify one or two dietary requirements/requests a week before going. We asked for no fish, and for a plain scone without fruit, we were told it would be no problem at all. When we arrived we were seated at a great table right in the window over-looking the wonderful grounds. The disappointment began when we were served our afternoon tea. Firstly there was fish on some of the rolls, so after having specified no fish it came with fish anyway, and it couldn't be eaten. The service was really really not good at all, there were just three tables in use including ours, yet we still had to get up a number of times to ask for various things like clean plates and to get more tea, I don't understand how with one person there and only three tables in use that staff can't keep an eye on their customers. The next thing was the scone, so I had asked for a plain scone, they said they could only provide me with a gluten free scone, and lets just say it tasted absolutely awful. My girlfriend's scone also tasted awful, it was hard, dry and she couldn't even finish it. Neither scones tasted fresh at all, and so they were both left on the plate. Overall a very disappointing experience in a place that should have been a lot better, especially for the money paid. Even though the grounds are really great, I would not recommend it, they couldn't get a simple request right, the service was terrible and it just wasn't worth the money.",2,2016,07,11
239,Poor service - mouse ran across the floor!!!,"I sent an email on the 20th of June to Mount Juliet and still have not got a response!!!

Myself and my friends arrived for lunch on the 6th of June for my 30th birthday , the service was very poor, we all ordered and myself and  1 of my friends both ordered toasted sandwiches which arrived approx. 15/20 minutes after everyone had been given their lunch and were half way through, we asked for the sandwiches on 3 occasions to a different member of staff- no apology was given for delay. After our lunch we ordered coffees and teas and desserts which again were very slow and all over the place, we kept having to ask/ remind the staff what we had ordered. Another of my friends asked for a particular dessert in which she got a sharp response, we only do that at Christmas!!
 
I have been for lunch several times here and never has the service been as appalling as it was on this occasion. However to top it all off mouse ran across the floor while we there!!!

 We informed a member of staff of this at the time. We all found the service to be very poor unfortunately on this occasion. I hope you act of this feedback.",1,2016,07,10
239,Elegant Country Estate in a Gorgeous Setting,"This historic country manor property is in one of the most beautiful and romantic settings imaginable. This is a large estate surrounded by grazing horses and cattle, with some excellent country paths for strolling/hikes. The hotel sits on a hill overlooking a nearby river. During our late spring visit the wild flowers were in abundance and of course the landscape was a lush green. The service and restaurant meals were all excellent. We stayed two nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this very classy and beautiful property.",5,2016,07,03
239,Lovely meal,"We had a table for four booked it was  a lovely evening great food and great company , very relaxing we had plenty of time to talk and enjoy our food and a few glasses of wine it was nice not to be rushed . ",5,2016,06,29
239,Beautiful country resort,When we first drove in to the resort we felt like we had stepped back in time. The main building is virtually original with a grand staircase and rooms that are designed with a respect for history. At the same time you never feel that anything is old or tired. Staff are well trained and the food is terrific.,5,2016,06,28
239,Beautiful old house but.....,"Fantastic surroundings with great walks. Tried two but did not complete them. Best walks of any hotel I have stayed in. Not challenging.

Some suggestions - when redecorating next use split beds that can be twins or doubles.
Magnifying mirror great - but you would have to sit on the hand basin to  use it.
Organic tea in bedroom but you can request Barry's from the kitchen - much nicer.
They do not order sufficient newspapers and you have to fight your corner to get one. There is no shop nearby to purchase your own. 
Dinner in Lady Helen's beautifully presented but food only average. 
Staff very friendly and helpful under difficult circumstances.
Lots of noise from temporary marquee from 11.30 to 1.30 a.m. which travels to the Manor House",4,2016,06,19
239,Delightful Country Estate,"Beautiful location with a variety of activities.  We took advantage of the spa while others in our group did the falconry or played a round of golf.  The staff was very attentive to our needs.  We had a lovely third floor suite; however, the only negative was a lack of an elevator resulting in a climb of three flights of stairs.  The bathroom was very large, except you had to go down five stairs to access it.  On the whole it was a wonderful place to stay.  If we are ever in the area again we would definitely stay there again.",5,2016,06,19
239,Birthday visit,Stayed here for one nite . The hotel amd grounds are amazing . We had couple of drinks in the golf club bar whice is very nice . We had dinner in the lady helen whice was also wery good . Breakfast we had in our room good quality we will be back for a stay .,4,2016,06,19

Perfect hotel for a romantic break or special occasion. ❤️",5,2016,06,18
239,A weekend to remember," My partner surprised me with a night away to the beautiful Mount Juliet. On arrival I was blown away with the lovely grounds and breathtaking scenery. Our trip only got better and better from the moment we arrived! Everything from the food to the service was exceptional. Our room looked out over the river and it couldn't have been a nicer view. All staff went above and beyond to make our stay a special one including those in the lady helen, concierge and behind the scenes. A bubbly young accomodation assistant with brown hair called Clionadh was so friendly and recommended great places in Kilkenny for us to go and she wasn't wrong. I would recommend Mount Juliet to anyone who wants a truly relaxing memorable experience. Thanks to all!",5,2016,06,17
239,Outrageously shabby treatment!,"A gift from my sister who has stayed on a number of occasions at Mount Juliet, my husband and I looked forward to our first stay at Mount Juliet Manor House on the night of May 5, 2016 which also included a meal at Lady Helen Restaurant. An expensive package in total.

Having already checked out, and returning from a short cycle down to see the recently born foals frolicking with the mares at approximately 12:30 on May 6, we decided to have a final cafe in the sunshine outside the house when we were abruptly told that we would not be served cafe and that as the house was privately rented for a wedding from 12 noon until 12 noon on May 7, we should have already left the house and would need to do so promptly.

I cannot tell you how shocked we were to hear this.  I immediately asked to speak to a manager who pointed to a sign reiterating the arrangement and went as far as to say that if questioned by the wedding party renting the house as to why we were still there, she should be in a compromised position as to explain why.  When eventually the Events Manager arrived, he reiterated the same message - that we would need to leave as the other guests 'had paid a lot of money' for this privilege of renting the house.

I was, to put it mildly, outraged as to what I was hearing and the tone in which I was hearing it. Had we stayed in one of the lodges, I might have understood this a little better.  But our decision to reside in the house was precisely for the privilege of enjoying not only the room and its service but also the full hospitality of the house and estate into the following afternoon (and not just until 12 noon - the recommended room check-out time).

This policy decision to rent the house privately and continue to accept guests on the previous night without informing them that they would be required to leave the house by noon the following day (thereby giving them the choice to choose a different date) - seems not only inelegant, poor business acumen but also legally questionable. Management simply cannot have it both ways. They simply cannot take the guest's money and then treat them in a humiliating, insulting manner by making them feel like guilty trespassers who should have already scuttled off the grounds to accommodate a more important guest!

When I wrote to Mr Peter Wilson, General Manager to tell him of our shock - he apologised profusely, offered to look into the matter as well as a vague promise of better treatment should we decide to again stay there (the proposal of an upgraded room which is really no different to the type of offer which regularly appears on their website). We find it ridiculous that we should be required to again consume a product in order to be compensated for its inadequate delivery in the first place! If management insists on allowing the house to be privately rented, they should be legally required to either inform guests prior to their reservation of this arrangement OR allow the previous night's guests the courtesy to take their leave slowly and elegantly - which is not only good business acumen (and a right for which they have amply paid) but basic decent hospitality - by delaying the renting of the house until perhaps 16:00. Many guests will have traveled a long distance to visit and relax and will not feel like being shown the door!

My husband and I find My Wilson's empty attempt at an apology to compensate for the appalling level of treatment we encountered there of a very similar tone to the one we were subjected to before leaving - shabby, cheap and inelegant (if not legally unsound) and not worthy of the establishment Mount Juliet is supposed to represent - or perhaps it is intent on moving in a different direction - where money speaks louder than elegance and hospitality?

We are not only disappointed but quite frankly shocked.",1,2016,06,14
239,Lovely night away,"From start to finish our stay at Mount Juliet was a delight. Check in was easy, all staff were friendly from front of house, to the driver, to the cleaning staff.  The room was very nice, large with a lovely bathroom and comfortable bed. We ate at the Lady Helen restaurant and everything from the Amuse bouche to the Petit Fours was excellent with five star service. Breakfast was also delicious, pastries, cereals, eggs benedict and we were lucky to be seated at the centre window seat overlooking the beautiful estate. The estate itself is gorgeous and we were sorry we were not having a round of golf while there. The only negative about our trip was that we ate at the clubhouse the next afternoon and unfortunately we were served frozen raw chicken wings here which was quite unpleasant- this was handled quite well by the staff but we were still charged for the rest of our meal which I didn't think was appropriate considering I felt very ill after.  Overall would highly recommend.",5,2016,06,14
239,Great hotel,"What a beautiful estate. this is not a modern hotel, but certainly of high quality. the estate tour was very special. Had dinner at the The President’s Bar, the service left a lot to be desired.  The server never came back to see if we needed anything, which we did.",5,2016,06,11
239,"5++ stars, relaxing, friendly staff, spa","My friend and I stayed here for a night and I wish I was there longer! we stayed in one of their manor house rooms and it was spacious, the bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom great. We enjoyed a swim in their leisure center which also has steam room, sauna, and work out center. We had dinner at the presidents bar with a great view of their golf course. The amenities are wonderful, offering spa services and the staff are friendly and helpful. There are plenty of places to walk around and explore the estate as well. I hope to be back one day and hopefully stay for more than one night!",5,2016,06,05
239,Lovely Days Golf : Recommended,"Played 18 Holes last week. The course was in super condition, the fairways and greens were almost perfect. The rough was cut to just the right length, it was possible to hit a decent shot out of the rough but it was about a half stroke penalty. 

The bunkers had just the right amount of sand in them.

Only complaint was that the speed of the greens was not consistent, they seemed to get slower as we went around. However all in all it was a very enjoyable experience.

The locker rooms in Mt Juliet are one of the best in the country, its nearly worth going there for the showers!! They have left the names on the lockers from the WGC in 2004 which is a nice touch.

Check in at the pro shop was very friendly and helpful. I had a chicken sandwich for lunch before I went out and it was very nice. I had a Chicken Caesar Salad after the round which was very nice also.

Overall it was a very good experience and I will be back soon.",4,2016,05,31
239,Superb Estate,"Our family visited this Estate and stayed for 2 nights. Although parts are being refurbished, it did not distract from our visit at all. We stayed in Hunter's Yard that will be refurbished during 2016/17. The rooms were very comfortable although Nespresso coffee machines in the rooms rather than a kettle and instant coffee would have added to our experience. The service was excellent and the food top quality - as expected from a Michelin star establishment. My only regret - that I don't play golf! ",5,2016,05,20
239,Beautiful grounds but bright room,"We stayed at Mount Juliet a few nights ago.  The grounds are beautiful -- gardens and the main house is covered in Wisteria vines.  We stayed at Hunters lodge which isn't the original lodge.  It appears to be stables that had be converted into rooms.  The beds were comfortable, nice bathroom and very clean.  However the room was incredibly bright.  The curtains are not black out and there is a spotlight outside (maybe for security). So bring your eye mask with you.  The dinner at the restaurant was delicious.  Breakfast was lovely although the pastries weren't the best.  ",3,2016,05,19
239,Golfing with the Americans,"Once we passed through the front gates, we were met with a true Irish welcome, the staff could not do enough for the party. We stayed in the main house, dined in both the Lady Helen and club house restaurants, both amazing and good fun. The atmosphere the place gives out is one of relaxed country style comfort and ooooozing charm.",5,2016,05,19
239,Ladies Golf Club Outing,48 Ladies travelled to Mount Juliet on a Golf Outing.  The Golf Club was fantastic.  We had Coffee and Scones on arrival.  The Golf Course is well maintained.  Tough but fair. Accommodation is excellent. Dinner was fantastic.,5,2016,05,18
239,Mount Juliet,"Lovely visit, great walks and weather was great which really helped. Stayed one night and will definitely be back. Food was very good and staff were very friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend a stay there.",4,2016,05,17
239,Be sure to walk the grounds,"This hotel was originally a private family home, on gorgeous grounds.  We stayed in a room in Hunters Yard, which is not in the original Manor House.  The room was large and very comfortable, and robes and slippers were provided in the rather small closet.  The included breakfast is very nice, but know that if you want to sample the ""fine Irish cheeses"", you have to ask the waiter to bring out a cheese tray -- there's no cheese on the buffet.  I wish I'd known that before checkout!  Be sure to walk the grounds around the manor house -- there's a lovely garden, and trails out to the pastures where the horses are kept.  The staff is friendly and the service in the manor house harkens back to earlier era, but the President's Pub is more relaxed.  Just don't order the steak there.  Mine was criminally overcooked!",4,2016,05,17
239,"Less choice, higher prices","The hotel has recently been tastefully re-modelled and updated. However, the quality of breakfast and range of items on offer has declined significantly. Save for a fresh fruit salad, the selection of fresh fruit are gone (grapefruit, oranges and prunes are no more). The choice of meat and cheese now have to ordered a la carte (penny pinching if you ask me). The range of pastries on offer has also been cut back. This is a case of portion control gone mad. Bring back the full breakfast buffet.",3,2016,05,10
239,Wonderful Welcome,"I visited this hotel on a deal with secret escapes, We stayed in a hunters yard room which was fine for what we were paying , However the true delight of this estate is the Manor house itself ! Beautiful period house with fabulous fires lit all over the house it made us feel so welcome ,The staff were extremely helpful and The Lady Helen Restaurant was superb , Well deserved Michelin star .
      The grounds were stunning and a well kept golf course .
Excellent stay , I wouldnt hesitate highly recommending this lovely Irish Estate",5,2016,05,10
239,Wedding delight,"We had our wedding at Mount Juliet a week ago and it was such a lovely time for all of us, so much so that our guests have still not stopped reaching out to let us know what a great time they had. :) The accommodations were amazing, but really the staff set it apart from all the rest. My husband has been telling me over and over how impressed he was with the service and how Mount Juliet will have our business forever. Truly, the wonderful staff bent over backwards to accommodate our every need and came to the rescue every time we needed help--from dining to dry cleaning services. We are so very glad we decided to go with Mount Juliet, we will definitely be back!",5,2016,05,09
239,Beautiful spot,"The best afternoon I've ever had in terms of quality and value. Overall stay was nice, room service was overpriced with a small (very small) soup at €8.00. To get the full experience you have to stay in the house not the other properties on the location, I will definitely return.",5,2016,05,09
239,Golf Break,Recent golf break overall opinion good. Some issues with the condition of the course and lack of advance info regarding conditioning work on the course. The fairways were in poor condition and the greens were inconsistent. I feel a complex of Mount Juliet's status needs to be more informative to visiting groups of it's playing condition. On the other hand the accommodations were absolutely first-class. Food was a mixed bag in the Club House it was very good and served by very professional people. Breakfast provided could have been better as at midway through the time span it was tepid. Perhaps the heating and holding facilities need a revamp. It is an issue but one that can easily be fixed. As anticipated interaction  throughout the visit with the staff was first class and very professional. Well worth a visit.,3,2016,05,07
239,Gorgeous Hotel on an Historic Estate!,We stayed at the Mount Juliet for two nights in the main house as part of a wedding party.  Stunning building owned by a descendant of the renowned Kilkenny Butler family.  We had a lovely room with a river view.  Great service and excellent restaurant and bar options.  Very Downton Abbey-like and none of us are golfers.  They had bikes for riding and rode to  the ruins at Jerpoint Abbey and environs.  Fantastic stuff!,5,2016,05,04
239,Very relaxing and enjoyable,"This was our first time to stay at Mount Juliet and we will definitely be returning. We stayed in the manor house and the room was amazing, very spacious with lovely views. The food was excellent. They have bikes you can take to explore the estate, a great idea and something we really enjoyed. The whole place is immaculately kept. Thomas, one of the concierge team, was very helpful and friendly and probably the friendliest employee we met as we found many of the other employees we encountered to be cold and sharp. A smiling face goes a long way. The leisure centre is also very good. ",5,2016,05,02
239,Disappointing,"Stayed here for one night. We were really looking forward to it as we have been here many times but not stayed overnight. We booked Kendal's restaurant for dinner but were then told they had taken a group and could not seat us. We were offered a table in the bar conservatory instead and were promised the Kendal's menu would be offered here. However when we arrived we were told we could not have that either! The bar food we did have was average at best. 
Also have to mention the bed in our room was quite uncomfortable. I woke up every few hours from a pain in my side!",1,2016,04,25
239,Fabulous food,"Hotel is lovely restaurant is top notch and the grounds of the estate are great. Grab a bike and cycle around the grounds impressive . Fishing , Horse riding and a fab Golf course what more could you ask for. Sit outside on the lawn outside the fabulous house and have drinks served to you",5,2016,04,25
239,Disappointing customer service,"Firstly, I have never written a bad review. I've stayed at hotels where things weren't 100% but overall it ends up being enjoyable or corrected. Our stay at Mount Juliet was truly disappointing. We let many little things go, the heating in our room did not work properly, a very lovely porter came and tried to fix it but it never came on completely. I won't exaggerate the room was chilly not freezing, fine we'll get on with it. The food at the bar was delicious but service was slow. Again, trying to be fair, it wasn't that big of a deal. But something that couldn't be overlooked was that our shower flooded the bathroom. We reported it to reception  who sent someone over to clean it at 10.30pm, a nuisance when we're trying to relax and only there for a night. We were told it might happen again but it probably won't.  Nobody at that time apologised or offered us another room with a functional  shower. We could not use the shower. Cue check out. Both my husband and I complained and it fell on deaf ears. Because we had used a voucher there was nothing they could do. Really? Nothing? Contrary to what the receptionist implied, I wasn't looking for a freebie, I'm very fair, our meals, the grounds of the hotel and the room itself was beautiful. I heard the receptionist speak to her manager, she said I was looking for something off. I wasnt, just sincere acknowledgement. She was so patronising and made me feel really small because we had a voucher that was ""already a sustantial discount"". Am I missing something? Our shower didn't work. We couldn't have a shower in the morning. It's a service I expect when I pay for a hotel room whatever the price. Things go wrong, I can fully appreciate that but it is how you address those errors that really show the quality of a service. ",2,2016,04,25
239,Escape to the Country,"I've just returned from an overnight stay at Mt Juliet estate. We stayed in the Manor House in a beautifully decorated and spacious room. The grounds are stunning and we enjoyed several long and varied walks during our stay. Breakfast in the Lady Helen restaurant was very enjoyable. Spa facilities were nice. 
Two aspects of our stay were a little disappointing. Firstly, when checking-in we were told there was no record of a booking for afternoon tea, despite having made one. When we went into the drawing room, we asked the waitress who said we did indeed have a reservation and she had reserved our table. This was a let down as we could have missed out on our booking had we not followed it up ourselves. Secondly, we had dinner at the President's Bar where service was incredibly slow. Overall, a very relaxing stay and we would both like to return. ",4,2016,04,24
239,Very special,"Just lovely! Very special place perhaps because it has such history. It felt more like staying in someone's country home rather than a hotel. The main rooms are beautifully restored, decorated and comfortable to sit and relax, and each bedroom is individual. We stayed in the main house and I loved it's spaciousness and soft elegance. We also had a private garden. The gardens and lawns were magnificent at this time as they were full of daffodils and carpeted with white and blue flowers. Just stunning. Fabulous walks around the estate.
Afternoon tea in the main room overlooking the river was delicious and a very high standard. Also impressive breakfast and dinner in Kendall's.
Going to the pool would take a bit more organisation as it and the Spa are situated at Hunters yard - 5 mins walk away. I would have been very disappointed if I had arrived and been assigned a bedroom in Hunters Yard as it is a very separate building from the main hotel. Having to walk back and forth to me is the only downside to this beautiful, idyllic hotel. I will definitely return.",5,2016,04,23
239,An enjoyable one night stay,"Spent one night here with friends. Our lodge was gorgeous very spacious, well kitted out with two fabulous ensuite bedrooms and most comfortable. The breakfast of eggs benedict and creamy porridge was delightful. The grounds are scenic and a great place for a walk or run. Found a few things not just as we expected them though. Check in time of four o clock is very disappointing and for a one night stay greatly reduces the enjoyment time. Our waiter in the restaurant though friendly asked us were we on a package? As if this made us somewhat lesser customers?? In the breakfast room the girls chatted and ignored us until we finally get their attention and a request for fresh tea went unanswered. Back on a positive note the young man who was our driver back to the lodge was the star of the night. He was friendly welcoming and very keen to tell us the history of the estate. He had only been a staff member a few weeks but he certainly is one to keep! Overall a pleasant experience",4,2016,04,23
239,Little scape ,"Got a lovely room although it was a ground floor room facing the main door (our car was parked right outside the window!). We requested to be moved to another room but the hotel was fully booked. We closed the curtains and pretended we couldn't hear anybody outside... We didn't want to spoil our stay. We wanted to make the most of it.
We went around to see all the little hidden places. Everywhere was lovely although we lacked the wow factor.
The waiter at the bar was very friendly and chatty.
The ladies at reception were also very nice.
No complaints. It was a lovely stay after all",4,2016,04,20
239,Amazing hotel with stables on the estate!,"I came to Mount Juliet for three nights and stayed in the main house. I was in room 22, which was a king bed with a river view. It was amazingly beautiful! Huge room, and every morning from my window I could watch the horses and their fouls grazing. I came mostly for the horseback riding, which didn't disappoint. I went on two different trails, one in the woods, and one around the estate. My two instructors were really great, and gave helpful tips. Dan was my favorite horse! The Lady Helen restaurant is delicious. It is expensive, but worth it! The plates looked like art. Kendall's is also really good, and better for a more low key dinner. The only criticism I have is that the reception was unresponsive to my emails before I arrived. I planned the trip relatively last minute and so I needed answers fast, and I had to email them multiple times to ask the same question. Once I arrived, they were still disorganized. My package had certain things included, such as tour tickets, that were supposed to be explained and given to me at check in, but they were never mentioned and I had to go back a few days later to ask for them. Also, I made a reservation at Kendall's through the reception, but when I got to the restaurant they said that I did not have a reservation. Besides that, Mount Juliet is amazing and I will definitely be back!",5,2016,04,20
239,Lovely relaxing break before my surgery,Stated at this fantastic hotel and it was just wounderful. The staff are a credit to the Hotel. Especially Claire at reservation what a fab girl. Really loved the food. We stayed at Hunters Yard and the rooms were really fab...bed was so comfortable and the pillows were brilliant. Silver service by staff and the friendly staff was just so refreshing. Will be staying here again. Its a little piece of heaven. Rhank you so very much.,5,2016,04,20
239,Most beautiful place in Ireland,"Stayed here for three nights on work. Welcome from.staff was excellent. The porter Rick collected me from.the train station and he was very friendly and helpful.
Stayed in Hunters Yard. 
Room was spotlessly clean with very comfortable bed.
Dined in The Clubhouse and Kendals. Food was excellent.
Was lucky enough to also experience Lady Helen Michelin star restaurant which was really fantastic.
Great selection for breakfast with focus on locally produced foods. The herbs grown in Mount Juliet are used for cooking. Beautiful walks all around the manor.
Too many excellent staff to mention as the staff all seem to be  a happy team. 
In particular Des is fantastic..he gave me a very interesting tour of the estate.
Also many thanks to Aga and her team. 
Martin, Rose and Conor also were very kind to me during my stay and I most certainly would love to return.
Thank you Mount Juliet..keep up the excellent work.",5,2016,04,12
239,Luxury,"Just back from one night stay in mount Juliet house what a place its stunning .its pure luxury staying here .we eat in randles resturant top class ,best fillet steak I've ever eaten .breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice .i had spa treatment a hydration facial which was lovely n so relaxing .my husband had round of golf which he really enjoyed he was so impressed with the course .the staff here are so nice n helpful in every part of the hotel .fantastic night away loved every minute of it .this place is really special .",5,2016,04,11
239,lovely hotel with great scenery,"Stayed over easter in a superior room with superb views over the river and estate stud. Had dinner in Kendals Brasserie on the first night which was excellent. The second night we decided to eat early in the President's Bar at the golf course. Unfortunately after an hour and a half after we placed our order we still had not been served our dinner so we left. The staff handled our complaint well and we did not have to pay for our drinks. Both breakfasts were excellent as was the service. Overall I had a great stay and would have hesitation in returning. 
",4,2016,04,06
239,Lovely place - shame about the service!,"Just spent a night in Mount Juliet. The scenery is fantastic. They have a check-in time of 4pm which is ridiculous in these times. Arrived at 12.30pm and while we did not mind not being given a room at that time when I called back to reception at 3.15pm there was still no room ready.

The service for the breakfast in Kendals restauraunt was very poor. After sitting at a table for 15 minutes we had to request tea and coffee. We also asked for 2 eggs - but the lady serving us never brought them. We had to ask another server 10 minutes later and then the wrong order was delivered. Finally, we asked for some hot water for the tea pot and it was not delivered.

On a good note, we had a great experience for dinner the previous night in Kendals where the service was very good. Pity the service here was not matched elsewhere in the hotel.",3,2016,04,01
239,Meal had my taste buds dancing with delight,"Wasn't sure what to expect from the Lady Helen restaurant but it lived up to expectations. Elegant surroundings and no annoying background music that you so often have in restaurants. Quite an interesting menu which made choosing a bit tricky!  The amuse bouche of carrot panacotta with nuts was delicious and set the scene for the rest of the meal.  For starters I chose red leg partridge with small trumpet mushrooms marinated in something delicious.  Main 
course of rabbit with langoustines, plus several very interesting vegetable bites such as pickled radish (sweet and delicious) celeriac etc. All combined to give a sweet melody of flavours. Chef really got this course right. Not a desert person, but had some nice chocolate creation.  Wine list was limited but interesting, had Chablis and fabulous Meursault.  Restaurant could do with a sommelier as it seemed  whatever wine I picked was going to go with the meals we chose.",5,2016,03,31
239,Food Experience!,"We stayed for one night in February 2016 (couple early 30s). We had dinner in the Lady Helen Restaurant and this was simply the best meal I have ever had! The service was second to none and the food was just something else!

The only negatives of our stay was the quality of the breakfast buffet in Kendal's restaurant the next morning. It wasn't as good as we expected it to be. Also, the pool and gym facilities are basic enough, however the grounds are amazing and great for walks/runs/bike rides etc. 

Our room in Hunter's Yard was nice but be aware that it's maybe a 5 minute walk to the main house, although the concierge is available to drive you if required.",4,2016,03,31
239,Oozes class,"We received a present for a family get together in two of the lodges over the Easter weekend and I have to say it was fantastic from start to finish. The lodges were extremely spacious and extra beds and a cot were provided for small children. The service in the bar area for drinks and food were immaculate and very courteous and accommodating again for our 3 and 1 one year old sons. I'd highly recommend the steak on the bar menu ! Easter eggs were even delivered for the children on Easter Sunday. The swimming pool was clean,warm and family friendly and adjacent to the lodges there was a play area for the children. The play area had a zip line which was great fun , even for the adults ! On checking out we were delayed as our youngest son was having a delayed mid morning nap due to the change in daylight saving hours but there was no-one knocking on the door or phoning the room asking us to vacate the room which made our onward journey much easier. I'm sure sure this made things more difficult to prepare the house for incoming guests but the additional time was greatly appreciated. We left at 1-30pm and we didn't hear a beep from the staff. The only thing we didn't get was a tour of the walled garden , maybe next time ! 
Staff always had a smile and a hello. 
It's the small things.",5,2016,03,30
239,Outstanding ,"There was confusion on arrival as the hotel didn't have a record of our booking. Our initial disappointment was soon overturned as the staff went above and beyond (on a busy bank holiday) to rectify this oversight. We were offered lunch and coffees while we waited for the matter to be sorted. A bottle of wine was then put in our room and dinner and that nights accommodation was free of charge. 

Our room was in the Manor House and it was gorgeous. We ate in the Kendalls restaurant which was also lovely. The estate itself is beautiful and full of things to do. We played tennis, walked through the estate and used the leisure centre. All of the staff were very helpful, especially Jacob who was on hand with tennis racquets and cycling maps. 

A special mention to Eileen in reception. She was absolutely fantastic. Our initial disappointment could have continued throughout  our stay but her efficient, thoughtful and professional behaviour turned our first impression on its head. 

Will definitely be returning and would recommend it to anyone. A gorgeous hotel - the staff make it. ",5,2016,03,28
239,Easter holiday break,Really recommend Mount Juliet for a stay. We stayed for one night in Hunters Yard with son. Loved the pool and playground. Kendall's brasserie for dinner and could be one of top 10 meals!!  Will definitely be on list to return!! Well done Mount Juliet. ,5,2016,03,27
239,Great place to stay ,"Just back from a lovely night's break in Mount Juliet.  The house is beautifully decorated, the staff are friendly and there's a lovely cosy and relaxed atmosphere. Really enjoyed it. 
The spa treatment I received was lovely,  though the price was a bit expensive considering there's no extra amenities e.g. rooms for relaxing,open spaces with views outside etc. All in all though a wonderful place to stay.",5,2016,03,27
239,changed,"have stayed here on business several times over last 5 years this time I was very disappointed as its changed hands & in my mind has lost what it had --guests were made before to feel at home before but this time it was rather ""take it or leave it "" as my room was NOT what I expected --new owners need to inform their staff that any guest is a welcome guest",3,2016,03,19
239,"Picturesque, with so much to do","This is the second time I have stayed here and hard to believe it, but our stay exceeded the first! The staff are all wonderful and very accommodating. We stayed in a family room and it was big, spacious, and the beds were all very comfortable - even the pull out sofa-bed was great. The rooms overlook a cute private courtyard, and the views from the whole estate are just spectacular. There is so much to do on the estate, in our second visit we still haven't even managed to fit it all in! And the food is always top class, the Lady Helen is of course magnificent, but Kendall's brasserie and the Presidents bar are much more relaxed and almost as good.
I would recommend Mount Juliet to anyone and can't wait to come back myself!",5,2016,03,14
239,Paint Fumes,"Overall very relaxing and enjoyable however we could not believe that the Hotel would put guests into a bedroom that had paint fumes as bad as we suffered on our first night there, we both suffered sore eyes and coughing  It seemed like the hallway on that floor had been painted just before we checked in. We immedately raised this with reception who apologised but told us that they had no rooms available in the Hotel to move us to, so we had to put up with it. The second night was fine as there was no painting on that floor during the day. While this would normally be a lovely hotel to spend a couple of days in, I'm afraid our experience was soured by the memory of the first night. 
While I had a response ready at checkout to the normal quesion of ""how did you enjoy your stay"" i.e. Lovely but the first night was terrible with the paint fumes. However we were not asked so I left it, lady at reception was like all the staff very friendly and attentive.",2,2016,03,13
239,Gorgeous room - great restaurant,"We stayed here primarily to sample the food on offer in The Lady Helen restaurant.  It certainly wasn't cheap, but our room was beautiful and the bathroom in particular was quite stunning.  The house is really charming and the service is excellent in both the house and the restaurant. I would heartily recommend it as an expensive treat.",4,2016,03,09
239,Lovely one-night stay,"Hadn't planned on lunch on arrival but were glad we had it, lovely soup and sandwich overlooking the river. Main house looking so well after recent refurbishment. Stayed in Hunter's Yard. Our room was a bit cold, on return from Leisure Centre but oil-filled, electric heater was brought up to us, as soon as we brought it to the attention of reception (thanks Fiona & John). Dinner was delicious in Kendals and walk to main house 5 minutes from our room was spectacular under a clear, star-filled sky. To cap it all, after a yummy breakfast in the Lady Helen Restaurant (main house), we were treated to a very informative talk by Des, who went out of his way to fill us in on the history of the house and to show us as much as he could of the estate before we had to leave. Many thanks to all. We hope to be back soon!",4,2016,03,07
239,Blissful Mount Juliet,"I was lucky to get the chance to go to Mount Juliet for an overnight stay and dinner at the end of Feb.  I stayed in the main house which is just stunning, it transports you back in time.  Had a tour of the estate, so much to do whether you be on your own, as a couple or a family.  Their Bar is just magic, so relaxing and enjoyable and views from the window are fabulous and so relaxing.  I got the chance to have dinner in its Michelin Star restaurant, I was on my own but I didn't feel like I was on my own, the choice for dinner was excellent.  11/10 to the restaurant & its staff.  Had a great nights sleep and breakfast the next day was stunning, cooked fresh with lots of choice.  I didn't want to leave and next time i will stay for longer.  Well done to the Management & Sales Team.  Excellent",5,2016,03,01
239,Sleepless in Mount Juliet,"We recently had a one night break here staying in the main house. Unfortunately, after a lovely dinner in the Lady Helen, we had a sleepless night due to non existing sound insulation between our room and the one above. We had to endure the sound of snoring all night and loudly flushing toilet. We were disappointed also with the quality of our bathroom towels which were the smallest I've ever experienced in a hotel and not exactly fluffy. They were also rather miserable with the quantity of the toiletries for two people and we had to request more. A good night's sleep is very important and Mount Juliet didn't deliver.  ",3,2016,02,22
239,Short break,We spent two nights at the hunters hard and we had a fantastic time. The rooms are basic but so central to all your needs.The pool is literally a stones throw away and it was really nice and relaxing there.We ate at the club house and the food and staff were excellent but for me it's the grounds that make this place special acres and acres to walk and clear the mind.The only problem we had was leaving and we will definitely return,5,2016,02,20
239,Perfect weekend ,"This hotel has everything! Amazing grounds set on a fantastic golf course. Ate in the lady Helen which was great. The food in the bar was great quality for bar food. So much to do there- walking , golf , swimming, spa, horse riding and plenty more. Highlight was probably the staff and service. Had a great history tour by the extremely friendly and knowledgeable Des! Conor the bar manager was also extremely helpful to us as we had a baby and was very accommodating. We will definitely be back!",5,2016,02,15
239,Average,"Short but sweet. The hotel is average for its rating. The staff are friendly. That's the hotels high point. 

Our room was located in the Hunter's Lodge. It was average at best. Nothing worth mentioning except a pleasant view of the grounds. Bed was comfortable. Room was cold. Heating wasn't turned on despite fiddling with it. In the end my wife had to put on a jumper and the bar man brought a duplex heater to our room. Not great really.

We had an afternoon drink in the President's Bar upon check in but left after the first drink as again it was cold and service took in excess of 10 mins of me standing at the bar. The fire was not lit by 5pm and it was a cold day. Too drafty at the table next to the fireplace.

We ate dinner at the Lady Helen. The food was ok. I enjoyed the Partridge and the Venison. The cheese plate was average. Staff again were friendly. I wasn't overly impressed for a Michelin Star. Very little atmosphere. You could hear a pin drop.

We didn't avail of the pool regrettably as we forgot our attire but it appeared pleasant.

The grounds are magnificent and John who drove us to and from the main house and helped us with our bags is definitely worth a mention.

We won't be rushing back.

Average overall.

239,Golf heaven,"We stayed in one of the apartments on site and all I can say is ""wow"" . Pure luxury .... great place for golf , fishing , archery and equestrian tastes. The golf course was designed by Jack Nicklaus and is a test for all levels of golf. Also held world golf championships 2 years in a row in the early 2000's.",5,2016,02,14
239,Superb,This hotel is currently being re-modelled and looks great in its new part completed guise. The new bar and reception area are superb. Take your time over breakfast in the Lady Helen Room. Food is good as is the service. I'll be back,4,2016,02,10
239,"Incredibly elegant and staff was friendly, respectful and accommodating","If you want to stay somewhere memorable and with a beautiful history, stay here.  Ask for a complimentary tour of Mount Juliet Estate and chances are you will be lucky enough to get Des.  He will make the colorful history of the estate from 1720 come alive as he drives you to see the hounds, the horses, the lush walled garden as well as the Chinese Moon Gate.",1,2016,02,08
239,Heavenly Hideaway,"This has to be one of the nicest places in Ireland that I've stayed in . Located just outside Thomastown which itself is a charming small town not far from Kilkenny City . The house is stunning with real fires burning which were particularly welcoming on a wet February day , Staff were friendly and efficient , the food was top drawer and the bar was very comfortable with a great selection of whiskey . The room ( number 15 ) was spacious with a huge en suite with a separate shower which is important to me as personally I don't like showering in a bath . The bed was comfy and I had an excellent sleep . I look forward to coming back in better weather and bringing my golf clubs next time . Well done to all involved .",5,2016,02,08
239,Unfriendly Staff and poor service,I gave my sister a birthday gift to stay in Mt Juliet with her  husband. Very disappointed to hear  that the staff were so  unfriendly and literally threw the key at her and did not offer any advice or help. Next  morning same attitude  when it came to check out. They said  it was very quiet with few guests so expected staff had  more time to treat guests well but not the case. Would never stay there again and I hope others read this too.,2,2016,02,05
239,Fantastic,"Just back after 3 days at mount Juliet which we thoroughly enjoyed. We stayed in the hunters lodge which was comfortable, clean and quiet. We ate mainly in the presidents bar and the food was lovely. I had a massage in the spa which was fantastic so thank you Louise! The pool and facilities were also well kept and very enjoyable. Mount Julie's grounds are beautiful and we enjoyed this very much. The main house is amazing and has a lovely feel to it. Overall we found mount Juliet had something for everyone and the staff were so nice. We will definitely come back for another visit. Thank you for a lovely break!!!",5,2016,02,03
239,Great Stay,"My wife and I have just spent 2 very enjoyable nights at Mount Juliet. We stayed in a standard double room in the Manor House, which was very spacious and tastefully decorated, with a lovely view of the river and grounds. In decorating the house and rooms, they have managed to find the right balance of maintaining the heritage/personality of the house, whilst also delivering on the modern luxuries. The decorators (very unobtrusive) were in during our stay and the main building is looking great. 

All the staff were exceptionally friendly and we were made to feel welcome from check-in onwards. 

We ate in Kendall's restaurant on our first evening. The restaurant has a very pleasant ambiance and the food was good, without being fantastic. One dish was not cooked to our expectation and it was immediately replaced with an alternative dish by the attentive staff without any fuss. 

The dining experience in the Lady Helen (7 course tasting menu, with the accompanying wine selection) exceeded our expectations. 

We didn't use the full spa or leisure centre facilities but my wife was not overly impressed with the manicure she got, so I am deducting a point for that. 

We would definitely return for the Manor House, the spectacular grounds, and Lady Helen restaurant. 

",4,2016,02,02
239,Beautiful hotel,Mount Juliet is a fabulous hotel with numerous amenities for all types of guests. I particularly loved the golf course and the quality of furniture in the main house. I ate in the hunters yard sand the food was delicious. There is something magical about this hotel!!,5,2016,01,22
239,Short break at mount Juliet,"Had a short break here in beautiful Mount Juliet in November. We stayed in the main house which is beautiful, our room however was small with the ensuite taking up most of the space and the furniture and decore a little tired, I would have expected mahogany in a grand house like this.
We arrived tired and hungry and were told we could eat in the clubhouse until 9pm. After a cup of tea in our room( sadly no biscuits ) a short rest and freshen up we went down to reception to be told the club house had closed at 7.30. Strangely the staff didn't know of anywhere nearby we could have a meal and the only options that seemed open to us was room service or the lady Helen restaurant at £75 each! Although I felt we had been coerced into it we ate in the Lady Helen.The food itself was fine, portions very small and we ended up asking for extra bread because we were so hungry! Service was excellent but a Michelin star meal it wasn't .
Breakfast the next morning was excellent great service and the best freshly cooked breakfast I have ever had.
The grounds are really magnificent  and the view across the river to the stud farm lovely, lots of places to walk and the bar very warm and cosy (strangely we saw people eating in here why wasn't this option suggested to us? )
We ate in the club house the second evening , excellent.
So could be a fabulous place but they need to up their game a bit, refurbish that bedroom ( get advice from Castle Leslie) replenish the bedroom tray ( no tea the second day) also should have small packs of biscuits at least. Toiletries should be replenished  daily. For Michelin restaurant I would have expected more than one knife and fork!
So fabulous destination being let down by sloppy management.",4,2016,01,21
239,Attended a wedding and overnight stay,"Wow loved this place and what a treat after Christmas. I was attending a wedding and had pleasure of staying overnight. The room was fabulous with everything available. The staff were excellent and the food was fantastic. Glad I had opportunity to see how the other half live, would love to return some day maybe the lotto will come up :)",5,2016,01,14
239,Two night stay in Mount Jutiet,"We stayed for two nights in Mount Juliet over the new year.
The room we had was in the clubhouse, it was quite nice but is starting to age, there is no stocked bar or snacks. The bath products are not good.
The times for the leisure centre and breakfast are different than those advertised in the room. We were given incorrect times for the leisure centre opening times twice, so the reception staff are not up to speed, call up to the leisure centre and ask there.
We had dinner the first night the Kendals restaurant, this was very disappointing, the room is big and dated, and you will enjoy dinner to your favorite 80s rock ballads. It really is a throw back to the 80s. We had a salmon starter, which was tiny and tasteless, and a pear salad, again tasteless and served with tinned pears. On the other hand the steaks were good. Advice: have the steak and have it in the bar.
We thought the food could not get any worse until we came down for breakfast, cooked breakfast is a buffet, and not a good one, similar to a travel lodge.
The only redeeming feature was the old house, perfect for an afternoon snack and a beautiful room to sit and read. There was a wedding on one of the days we stayed, so the house was off limits to 'guests', so we enjoyed sitting in the bar of the golf club that day, as all the tables were reserved for golfers and locals having their lunch!
Very disappointing visit.",2,2016,01,11
239,Post-christmas blues,"Stayed in Mount Juliet during the week and although the staff were very friendly, I was not overly impressed with the place. The hotel and grounds were nice (unfortunate to be recovering from a deluge) but the room was only OK. For a 5 Star hotel, there were damp patches in our room and generally dust and cobwebs to be seen in all the common areas; all of which seemed surprising since it was directly after what one must assume was a busy Christmas period.
We had also booked into the Lady Helen restaurant the experience of which we were very much anticipating. However, the restaurant did not live up to it's claims. The waiting staff struggled to remember what the tasting menu offered (pre-ordering) and the Tasting Menu itself was basically a photocopy of the Á Lá Carte (but more expensive). We were left on a number of occasions with no cutlery and/or napkins (this may seem trivial but this is supposed to be a Michelin Star restaurant and they charge accordingly)! Whilst the meat dishes were tasty the vegetarian was dismal and the food portions were generally very small - we had to stock-up on bread on more than one occasion. The waiting staff were often inattentive and entirely mis-directed as they attended whichever table the next plate in the kitchen was for - in my experience most Michelin Star restaurants (or any restaurant, in fact) have staff focussed on a particular area which allows them to remain attentive to those customers.
Breakfast the following day compounded what was a very disappointing experience. Having arrived and being seated before a number of other larger groups, we were finally served (breakfast order taken) after some of these later groups had already received their cooked breakfast. The coffee and toast arrived before our order was taken (about 30 minutes before we got our breakfast) and as a result both were cold when required.
All-in-all this was unfortunately neither an experience nor a place I would recommend to anyone.",2,2016,01,09
239,Another wonderful Xmas stay,"My partner and I have stayed at this hotel many times and on each occasion we have had a restful, relaxing and thoroughly enjoyable stay.

We stayed here again at Xmas and everything was great.    I had some spa treatments which were excellent and the spa staff were as always very professional and welcoming.  

Some areas of the hotel i.e. the main house have been redecorated and the workmanship and the choice of wallpaper is absolutely stunning. 
   

Thank you once again to all the staff at Mount Juliet - we had a great time!  We will definitely be back soon.",5,2016,01,06
239,An Amazing Place,"We had the pleasure of attending a family wedding at Mount Juliet Estate.  It is a beautiful place, from the moment you drive in the entrance, past the Hunters Lodge, and down to the Manor House.  It is very enchanting and really Luxurious.  The food in the restaurant in the Manor house is exceptional, and lives up to its Michelin Star & 3 AA Rosettes ratings.  The rooms are beautifully decorated and are very comfortable.",5,2016,01,05
239,Pure bliss,"We are just back from Mount Juliet and were delighted with our stay. I cannot speak highly enough of the staff, from check-in to the porters, waiters and bar staff. Service is prompt and excellently delivered in a lovely friendly manner. We definitely felt at home over the short stay.

Our bedroom was beautiful. The bed was incredibly comfortable and there was plenty of bottled water in the room. The heated floors in the en-suite bathroom are a lovely touch. My feet were very happy. The place is immaculately clean for a large country manor covered in art, beautiful candelabra, statues and antique furniture. I don't envy the person on dusting duty. I loved the details on the high ceilings, the lighting and incredibly comfortable chairs and couches. The soggy weather prevented much venturing out over the couple of days, but the fires were well tended and we made the most of it and chatted with some very interesting guests over some lovely tipples. I realized I need to drastically improve at both checkers and snooker. A very relaxing way to see in the new year.

And then there's the food...
We ate in the Lady Helen for new years. Despite the fact that there was wedding on in the hotel the same night, every course was delivered in perfect timing and was just exquisite. It's definitely going in my top five restaurants from around the world. All of the little tasters between courses were amazing and there is a great choice of wines with dinner. Our taste buds were very happy at the end of the night. The bar food is also great.

The weather provided an excuse to prevent our exploration of much of the estate, although they have cars to drive you between buildings. An excuse we will use to go back. Cant recommend it enough.",5,2016,01,02
239,Amazing place ! ,Stayed here for my brother's wedding with all the family ! Could not recommend this place enough ! Staff went above and beyond in any way they could. Beautiful place all round. Food was excellent. Room was spotless and well maintained. Will return again 👌🏼,5,2015,12,30
239,Fantastic gateway experience,"What a marvellous experience! My husband and I spent his birthday and our wedding anniversary in Mount Juliet , a lovely present from our daughter . We absolutely loved it from the moment we arrived. First impressions are important . We stayed in the beautiful Main house , we were given a very large room beautifully decorated. We had lunch, went for swim in the spa area, got collected by one of the porters as its a bit dark at night. We opted to stay in the main house to try the dinner Tasting menu. Absolutely Amazing.After a peaceful sleep, the next morning we had a full Irish breakfast served in one of the lovely dinning rooms, overlooking the grounds, followed by a Long walk around the state , a few horses came by to say hello :) and believe it or not we managed to have afternoon Tea !!  sitting in front of a roaring fire. Beautifully presented , quite abundant and tasty. The service was impeccable , the staff extremely helpful and friendly. Overall a wonderful experience .Thank you to All the staff for making this getaway A marvellous experience. Looking forward to our next visit :)",5,2015,12,24
239,Nice but not 5 star,"I booked a night's stay at Mount Juliet as a short break (one night stay) for my wife and I. It was our first time staying at the hotel but I'd heard great reports about the hotel from friends over the years. I thought I might surprise my wife and push the boat out a little by staying in one of the hotels better rooms, I also booked a table at their Michelin Star restaurant. 
Upon arrival I was a little surprised there was no doorman to welcome us to the hotel and help us with our baggage, a no no for a five star hotel. Being the Christmas season it was possibly the wrong time to stay at Mount Juliet as they had a Christmas village setup on the hotel grounds consequently, the hotel was full of children running around and it was impossible to find a quiet area to have a drink. We were looking forward to our short break to get away from our own children so a little irritating. Room wise it was very nice, overlooking both fields and countryside. The bathroom was adequate but the towel quality was very average (worn and not soft or fluffy) and our bed was of a good quality affording a nice sleep. Their Michelin star restaurant was yet again very nice but not exceptions and we enjoyed all our courses albeit it the starters arriving tepid. On weekends breakfast begins at 7am and finishes at 10.15, we decided to avoid the early morning rush by arriving down at 10am however, no tables were available and we had a 30 minute delay before a table could be found. Hotels often overlook the importance of providing a good breakfast, this is a major mistake as it's the last impression a guest will take away from their hotel. Breakfast at Mount Juliet was very good. Overall the staff were very friendly and helpful but we felt there was not enough of them to staff the hotel, particularly a five star hotel. We would stay there again just not at Christmas.",3,2015,12,20
239,Not five star !,"So looking forward to this relaxing night away but on arrival to the room the wardrobe door wouldn't open waited for someone to fix it until we got bored. The tea coffee etc had not been replenished even the empty sugar packets were still there, subtitles were on the television and I couldn't remove them. So decided to go to the restaurant for lunch -waited and waited for the car service to bring us until I suggested to the receptionist she call again. He was waiting in the restaurant for two imaginary guests to bring the other way. We have only been here a hour and my husband is fit to burst. Not sure if we will be staying either. How utterly disappointing .",1,2015,12,16
239,Fantastic,We went with our 10week baby. They couldn't have been more accomodating and helpful. Food was delicious. Facilities excellent and grounds perfect for walking a pram in. Great mid week deal meant it www good value for money too.,5,2015,12,11
239,"Relaxing stay, beautiful location","We stayed here for two nights  immediately after our wedding to relax and it was perfect for that! 
We had a lovely room, breakfast is great (cooked fresh to order, plus buffet available). The bar food in Kendall's was really disappointing but we had dinner in the Lady Helen, which was delicious and a lovely experience overall. The grounds are fantastic, I only wish we weren't so exhausted from the wedding and had more time to explore them! The wifi was patchy, but really, that's not what you go there for! We each got massages in the spa, which were fine, but really nothing special to be honest, for the price. 

We had a really relaxing break and would definitely return.",5,2015,12,10
239,Mount Juliet missed the mark.,"Myself and my wife stayed for night recently to mark our wedding anniversary, it was an indulgence so it required a special occasion. Being people that really enjoy sampling Irelands fine dining restaurants (when the budget allows) , The Lady Helen Michelin starred restaurant was on our list for quite a while.
 
To begin with our arrival was a bit of a let down, unbeknownst to me my wife had called ahead to organize a bottle of champagne to be waiting for us in the room which was not there and we didn’t see fit to call and ask for it as we felt the surprise was ruined but not to worry right?, as there is a beautiful bar only a few steps away with a roaring fire and amazing views over the river and accompanying lands, WRONG. We went down to the bar, my wife took a lovely seat by the window for me to be told that due to the incoming wedding the bar was closed to paying guests, guests that pay a premium to stay in the main house. We had no option other than to go up to the clubhouse up the road for a drink which was noisy and nothing like the tranquility of the bar in the main house. By the time we were allowed to return to the main house bar at 6pm it was pitch dark and we had no view to enjoy. For me, when you’re paying as much as it was for one night I just don’t think it’s in any way acceptable to be denied a drink in the bar.
 
Dinner was just fantastic. We had initially booked in for 8:30pm but we happened to be ready to eat earlier so the restaurant was able to seat us at 7:30 which we were thankful for. I won’t go into too much detail on the food, just to say that it’s most definitely Michelin star level cuisine. We sat and ate lovely food and drank delicious wine and after, waddled into the bar for a nightcap then to bed for what was a great nights sleep.
 
It is clear to us that we will return to the Lady Helen but I don’t envision we will ever stay again, for the money I don’t feel that the standard of accommodation warrants it and added that to use the pool or spa you must leave the main house and trapes up to the road meaning you cant wander back to your room in your robe and slippers after a spa treatment or a swim for example.

Unfortunately our short stay was not faultless and that’s the lasting memory we have",3,2015,12,01
239,A very disappointing lunch.,"Today I had lunch in Mount Juliet Hotel, in the hotel bar. We were in the Hotel, by arrangement, because Hunters was busy. It is not the first time I have been to the hotel but it is a while since I was last there. I had soup which was excellent and excellent beef in a terrible ciabatta sandwich. We all had a glass or two of Prosecco, it being close to Christmas, as well as both sparkling and still water and I finished with a very good coffee. What really let the hotel down was the terrible service, having to ask repeatedly for the same order. Not, in my opinion, good enough for an hotel of the reputation of Mount Juliet.",3,2015,11,29
239,"Adequate For x1 Night, Relaxing Stay","Stopped for a Thursday night whilst in the area on business. No problems at all, excellent customer service when checking in & out. The rooms was more than adequate with clean sheets & a good walk in shower. The breakfast offered in 1st class with a wide variety of options. Highly recommended.",4,2015,11,21
239,The most relaxing weekend ever!,"This time last weekend we were sitting down to a beautiful meal in Kendall's restaurant. Staff , food and atmosphere all fabulous. Had relaxing treatment in spa,another lovely meal the previous night in lady Helens, service exquisite. Breakfast superb.This hotel has a lovely atmosphere, olde world elegance with a charm all of its own. Cannot recommend highly enough. Definitely worth the trip down from Belfast, I hope to return . Thanks to all the staff for a fabulous stay",5,2015,11,14
239,Relaxing Stay,"Stayed 1 night in the main hotel.   The room was spacious and had everything one could need including tea/coffee making, bottled water,hairdryer, dressing gowns, etc.   The bed was large and very comfortable.  Went for a walk around the grounds which are beautiful and then went for a swim in the pool which I couldn't fault.  We had the early bird dinner at 7 pm in Kendals Restaurant.  The choice was not extensive.   However, we had an excellent 3 course meal for €28 per person. Service was very good and I would recommend this restaurant.  Breakfast was excellent with beautiful fruit and different breads and cereals to choose from.   Had full Irish breakfast seated at a window overlooking beautiful scenery.",5,2015,11,13
239,A must see,7 ladies booked here for a birthday surprise and it was amazing. We booked 2 lodges are we're glad we did as we felt in 4 bedrooms we wouldn't have the same room to sit and chat. We had a dinner booking at 730 and it was the best meal I've ever had. Breakfast was yummy also. It's a pricey hotel but u get what you pay for and nice as a treat once in a while ,5,2015,11,10
239,Truly Delightful!,"We loved the experience from the minute we drove through the gates of the estate.  In fact, I'm still mulling over the experience and may do for some time to come.  
We swam, steamed and relaxed in the spa before sampling the delights of the 7 course tasting menu in the Lady Helen restaurant.  For around 3 hours our palettes were tickled and tested with very clever and precise combinations of flavours and textures and it's clear to see why they have the Michelin star.  
Rooms are extremely comfortable and the breakfast the following morning was very generous and again, outstandingly delicious.  
We can't wait to come back and stay again.  A truly delightful experience.
Thanks to all staff for making our stay so wonderful.",5,2015,11,09
239,Lovely estate,We spent a night here as part of a golf package.  We opted to stay not stay in the main house but instead in the section above the other restaurant.  The room was lovely with a modern bathroom but it was freezing cold.  We called and eventually someone came over with a plug in heater but we were frozen until we got that!  The estate is beautiful with lovely autumn colours and the golf was good too!,4,2015,11,03
239,Second visit of the year,"Visited back in February and had a wonderful stay so decided to return in October. Even booked the same room so that we could observe the birds coming home to roost in the evening. Everything about the stay was really good and lived up to our expectations, from the morning breakfast to the walks around the estate, from the comfort of the bed to the power of the shower. Staff were friendly and the place has a cosy feel. Wi Fi is good and the lounges with fires burning in the evening are a treat. The only downside on this trip was that the bathroom was infested with a swarm of flies that were there for the duration of the stay (three nights). 
There are some wonderful walks along the river Nore and Woodstock at Inistioge is a beautiful place to visit. 
The President's Bar in the golf club does wonderfully casual food and is very family friendly (which was nice to observe). All in all, I would return if the opportunity presented itself, but I think I've now covered this neck of the woods and there is far more to discover!",4,2015,11,03
239,Special!,"The main hotel is a bit special, do not confuse it with the courtyard when booking, the hotel is 'old world' with calmness and professionalism rarely found nowadays. The Lady Helen restaurant has a Michelin Star, the rooms are magnificent, ask for a river view, breakfast is out of this world!",4,2015,10,24
239,Amazing place,Stayed in main house for 4 nights very nice room and plenty of room the grounds are lovely even not being a golf player 3 places to eat all very good would go back as it is so nice lovely river views from my room,4,2015,10,18
239,5 star experience?,"We stayed in the Rose Garden cottages rather than the main house where we stayed previously due to a wedding taking place.
The two bedroom apartment was well fitted out and had two bathrooms and a kitchen and lounge which was perfect for our family of two adults and two teenagers.
At a cost of almost 300 Euro for a night, breakfast for another 15 Euro per person in the golf clubhouse seemed a bit of a Ryanair stunt so we passed on that. Breakfast in the main house was not an option but we were advised of this in advance.
When we arrived the bedrooms were cold but a phone call to reception had concierge drive over in minutes and sort it out- full marks there.
We opted to eat in Kilkenny itself ( Rinnuccinnis) as there are lots of good atmospheric places even if it is a little drive away.
The leisure centre is adequate rather than spectacular and they still insist on swimming hats.
Overall it was a pleasant experience and the autumnal colours around the estate were very impressive.",4,2015,10,17
239,Amazing Afternoon Tea,Met friends for a beautiful Afternoon Tea on a Sunday and it was just fabulous.  Very reasonably priced I thought and there was a lot of choice and all tasty.  The staff are very helpful and friendly going out of their way to make your afternoon enjoyable.  I'll definitely be back for more.,5,2015,10,15
239,absolutely amazing!,"This is an absolute perfect place. We stayed in the main house and the room was spacious and cozy. We really liked the old and unique furniture. They could introduce pay TV channels though.
The bar downstairs has beautiful views over the lands and you can watch horses.
The leisure centre with pool, sauna and steam room made us relax. I hope when we are coming back there will be a hot tub as well. The Spa was great, they are taking good care of you and we felt relaxed after an hour of massage.
We ate in both restaurants and the food was really good! the steak was prepared to perfection.
Horse riding is fun as well. Even if you never sit on a horse before, the staff is taking well care of you.
All staff members in general were really nice and you could feel that they are enjoying their jobs! I wish I could remember all their names... but special thanks to the chauffeur/bellman who took special care of us. He was quiet young and really, really nice.
I hope I can go back one day to relax.",5,2015,10,14
239,Luxurious treat in a beautiful estate,Fabulous room and amazing breakfast in a beautiful setting. Highlight was the guided tour of the estate by Des. Service was excellent. Golf club food mediocre but food in the main house was a high standard,4,2015,10,10
239,Good hotel in Stud Farm Country,"We stayed in the Black Earl room which was very spacious with a window seat to watch the stud horses playing in the fields below - very bucolic.
The staff are faultless. My only concern is that the hotel is used by tour groups and this meant that we could only eat in The Lady Helen restaurant once during our stay - this is an excellent restaurant. The first night we had a short walk to Kendals restaurant at the golf course clubhouse - this restaurant is OK but not as good as the other. If it rains the hotel has a car to move between the two locations.",4,2015,10,08
239,Beautiful spacious estate,"Our room was not in the main house, it was out by the golf course. It was very nice, clean, spacious. Had double doors out onto a patio. The estate is beautiful. They say they have many activities but none were offered to us or mentioned at all. The check in staff is not very friendly or informative. A falconer comes to the estate for Hawk Walks and that was the highlight of our stay. Very beautiful property, wish we could have experienced more that they advertise they offer.",5,2015,10,04
239,A luxurious step back in time,"This stunning estate was the highlight of our 2014 trip to Ireland. Top notch staff, amazing views and the most comfortable pillows of all time. For months after our trip I literally dreamt about being in that bed again. We had a stellar corner room that wrapped around and every window held picture perfect views. The entire experience was like being at Downton Abbey (but with modern plumbing) or something equally as perfect. There is no shortage of formality here but the Irish warmth definitely kept everything from feeling uppity. 

We spent our time walking the grounds (spying on the world class horses), a trip to the spa (me) and golfing (him). The pre-fixe dinner was grand (we always love good food) and the breakfast was just as good. One night we had to visit the clubhouse for dinner. They have a large selection and it was much more informal than the main house. We also visited town for light lunches during our stay. 

I can't say enough about our stay. We would love to take our children back at some point to experience this brush with a more grand, formal past. For us this place is magical.",5,2015,09,30
239,Lady Helen's was a complete let down,"I have to say I was left very disappointed after our meal at Lady Helen's restaurant at Mt Juliet.  I felt the food was extortionately overpriced and although the flavours were delicious, the quantity was nothing short of ridiculous.  There's fine dining and then there's ripping people off in style.  We were a party of 8 people celebrating a 40th birthday.  3 courses was €75 a head.  Without drinks, that's extremely expensive so I'd expect amazing food and service.  The flavours were great, but the crab starter had practically no crab (there was about enough to fit on one tine of a fork - if that.  With one single crab they would have served the entire restaurant for a couple of days.  I had fish for main, again it was very tasty but with one tiny piece of carrot and one other tiny piece of vegetable, with a single carrot they could have fed the whole restaurant for a couple of days.  The worst thing of all was the service.  On mentioning that I wasn't happy with the amount of crab, I was met with a reluctance to rectify the situation.  Eventually they did bring me another dish which did have a little more crab.  Two members of our party had been delayed due to a crash on the motorway and when they arrived we realised that their place settings and chairs had been removed.  No one jumped to get them set up, they had to get their own chairs.  As we were finishing our starters, they asked if it would slow everything down if they ordered a starter and were told YES! in a most unfriendly manner.  I instructed them to order their starter anyway, which they did.   I have to say, I was absolutely shocked at all of this.  Paying €75 for three courses, I would expect 5 star service.  What we received was more like 2 star.  Mt. Juliet estate is a beautiful place and the golf course is fantastic but I wouldn't rate Lady Helen's in any way shape or form.  Visit Monart instead, they know the true meaning of quality and service.  Top quality 7 course meal for €45 a head and service that I can safely say has only been matched by the staff in Singapore.",1,2015,09,29
239,A Luxury Country Estate.,"Steeped in heritage, Mount Juliet is one of Ireland's leading country estates. They pride themselves on their family culture, while at the same time maintaining a high level of service and hospitality. My mom and I stayed here for two nights. Our room was located in the main house and was comfortable and quite large with a pretty walk-out garden.

The 1,500 acre estate offers many exhilarating activities and sporting opportunities. Hit the links on the estate's 18-hole Jack Nicklaus golf course, salmon and trout fish in the two rivers that run through the estate, or head over to the archery and skeet shooting centre and channel your inner Robin Hood!

As an equestrian enthusiast, I was eager to check out the Mount Juliet Equestrian Centre and managed to convince my mom to go horseback riding with me one morning through the estate's mature unspoilt parkland. A visit to the world renowned Ballylinch Stud is also a definite must! Located on the edge of the estate, the stud farm has a long breeding tradition and is responsible for many world-famous racing horses.

There is a lot to see and do on the estate itself, let alone the surrounding area, and if you're only staying a few nights I would highly recommend a guided tour of the estate and its grounds with the hotel's host Dez! Dez was the perfect host, very knowledgeable, a great story teller and loads of Irish charm. Blessed with the gift of the gab, Dez kept the tour fun and entertaining with his vivid and colourful tales. My guess is that there might have been a bit of exaggeration thrown in for good measure, but it just made the story all the more interesting.",5,2015,09,28
239,Beautiful views but left very hungry!,"The Mount Juliet estate is absolutely beautiful and the staff are very friendly and welcoming.  The room I stayed in was okay, clean which is good. Unfortunately, I felt the food was extremely disappointing and I wanted a burger after eating in Lady Helen's after dinner as the portions were so tiny.   I felt my partner and I were offered rounds and rounds of bread to try and fill us up.  I had a crab type dish and the waitress announced a plate of ""extra"" crab to accompany my dish...this ""extra"" crab consisted of a bowl about the size of your palm with a jelly substance and an inch long length of crag and 5mm wide.  Partner had pork belly, again tiny portion maybe about 3-4 inches long and inch and half wide of pork for a main course. Wine was nice.  There was no night time entertainment so early night I guess. The next day we went for breakfast.  There was table service but we were told the table service would be ""the same fry from the buffet"".  With that I made my way over to the buffet were most of the food was gone (it was subsequently filled up when we set down).  I had an Irish breakfast (bacon, egg etc) the food was medium temperature when I put it on my plate.  I had to wait to toast the bread on a toasting machine (not a toaster) by the time i had (a) lifted the food up (b) toasted the bread (c) got myself a drink the breakfast was stone cold.  The spa..I found the staff very friendly but the beds quite uncomfortable before this I went for a swim where I was told I needed a swim hat €4 (fair enough) I told the lady I had no wallet with me (as I was in my spa dressing gown) and she was stern with paying the €4 didnt ask if I wanted a spare so she put it on the room.  When I was in the pool another two people strolled into the pool with no swimming caps.  One rule for some? The material on the ceiling of the pool was covered in stains from leaks and the window in the ""grotto"" was covered in moss (on the inside).  The good thing about MJ is the staff and the surroundings.  They make you feel really welcomed.  I really enjoyed renting bikes and cycling around the estate, Unfortunately the food for me was well below par in terms of portions and I was still hungry when I left the restaurant.  I understand the concept of fine dining but this was too little for me.  I wasn't blown away with the flavours of the food.  The bar was very nice and the bar man made us a wonderful gin and tonic with pepper, which was delicious.  Maybe we were just unlucky on the day but I wouldnt be rushing back anytime soon based on the food I'm sorry to say.",2,2015,09,21
239,"Mount Juliet is the place for peace, relaxation and great food.","We were guests at a wedding at Mount Juliet on 28.8.2015.  Everything relating to the wedding was perfect, and most enjoyable.     We stayed in the main house (thanks to all concerned at Mt. J.).   Our room was the essence of comfort, and everyplace we used was comfortable and spacious.   Food at all times was so delicious! During our stay, we had walks around the estate, and some of the party enjoyed golf. In all departments, staff were courteous, eager to please, and friendly",5,2015,09,20
239,Disappointed,"Looked forward to our stay. A beautiful setting, lovely entrance. Check in personnel- surly, not friendly. 
Ate at the golf club location, food was good and friendly waiters. Breakfast in the main house, very nice, friendly wait staff. Dinner at Lady Helens on property was delicious and again, wait staff friendly- extremely quiet- toooooooo quiet!
Bar in the manor house didn't carry our preference so they had to run to golf bar to get the only bottle on property! Can't they carry 2 bottles of  the same liqueur? We ended up caring the bottle back and forth for them!!
Towels in bath were rough, soap was harsh and turn down was, well, no big deal. Towels weren't refreshed when left in tub.
Again, most personnel friendly but not the check in.
Bellman was wonderful. There's no lift so be ready to climb stairs or ask for a lower room! 
Summer would be very hot in rooms as we were there in Sept. And still had to open windows, no fans, no air.
Understand that the manor is a preserved building and they cannot make changes to structure, but rooms are very dark, lamp shades are old, yellowed. 
Need to add, if you like to watch TV, not much to see here.",3,2015,09,17
239,Beautiful and Romantic Setting,"We stayed here for a couple of nights in July of this year.  Staff were excellent.  The building is beautiful and very well-maintained.    Located in the countryside and away from the city which is very nice.

Very peaceful and relaxing.

Excellent food out to restaurants and very good service.  Would highly recommend.",5,2015,09,16
239,Great stay and amazing dinner in The Lady Helen,"We stayed in the main house and enjoyed a spacious room near the front. 
The room was beautifully furnished and the bed was very comfortable. The ensuite bathroom was large and well stocked.
We enjoyed the tasting menu in the Lady Helen and we promised ourselves that we would be back soon. The next time we will select the wines paired with each course.
The staff were excellent, very attentive and helpful and the food was amazing.",4,2015,09,15
239,Wonderful stay,"Such an incredibly romantic and beautiful hotel. We loved absolutely everything about our stay including the food, room and all facilities and hotel grounds. 
Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone....especially for a romantic getaway",5,2015,09,15
239,Excellent two night stay,"I have just returned from a mini break in Mount Juliet (main house).From the time we checked in until the day we checked out everything was superb from accommodation,service to food.I would highly recommend this to anyone.",5,2015,09,14
239,"Would definitely come again, lots of activities, lovely staff","First off, I'd like to say I would come again. All the staff there were very helpful and friendly. Lovely grounds of course.

We came mainly for the horseback riding. It's not a core function of the estate like golf, but they do have horses and you ride for an hour a day. There is lots of space to ride and you may be in a small group or on your own with the instructor. You ride through the grounds, through grass and forest, and along the river. It's beautiful.

There is also the ability to do falconry, which you do as a single person, or in the group you came with. Very reasonably priced and a fantastic instructor. It's for a full hour and you get lots of photo opportunities.

We stayed in the main house, which was quite cozy. However, do make sure you ask for a river view as it is quieter and more peaceful. Facing the front of the house was a bit noisy. A few little things I wish that could be changed is there are no light blankets for napping. A simple crocheted blanket on the bed for that afternoon nap would have been terrific instead of the big heavy comforter. Also a map of the estate would have been very helpful, perhaps in the services directory book. These were not in every room, which made in room dining a bit difficult sometimes. 

There is a quaint spa on the premises as well. Both me and my traveling companion got treatments of a massage and a facial. The same esthetician does both treatments, which was very convenient. The massage was nice and relaxing. The facial was very relaxing as well, with an excellent scalp massage. There were no extractions during the facial, maybe it was just the kind I had. Both treatments were very nice, but not the best I'd ever had. I did really like the one therapist doing both treatments.

There is also a pool, small fitness room, steam room, and sauna available. The pool was heated, but not hot, and just over 4 feet deep all around. It's fairly good sized, good for laps or lounging about. They have a lovely stone grotto with a bench at one end of the pool. It was a really enjoyable few hours there. You must have a swim cap to go in the pool, but if you don't have one you can buy one at the pool for 4 Euros.

You can easily get there by train from Dublin.if you're coming from the airport you take a bus to the Heuston train station (very cheap and can use a credit card in the ticket machine). Once at the train station buy a ticket to Thomastown. It's a little over an hour's journey. Once in Thomastown you can call Mount Juliet and they will pick you up. It's barely a five minute drive.

Finally, a little thing that has serious impact that I wish could be fixed is when they send you a confirmation email it included the equestrian and spa appointments as well. Those are on another system so the main reception doesn't have access to it and you have to email or call those places separately to confirm. 

Definitely recommend! ",5,2015,09,14
239,sadly disappointed,"Returned for our annual visit have been enjoying visits here for past 9 years - I understand the hotel is under new ownership and management  but was not expecting such a change as it was a Conrad and then went back to being held by a smaller hotel group . I fell in love with this place at first sight and each visit we try to stay for as long as possible -unfortunately this year even though I booked in February for an August stay we could only stay for a block of 6 nights not the desired 10-12 nights-  I guess the tour bus groups  take over the majority of rooms and there is no way to stay any longer. We return time and time again as we have always been made to feel most welcome by the entire  staff- I must say that the biggest thing the place has going for it are the staff some of who have been employed here for their whole lives, they are proud of the estate the grounds the jobs they do and go out of their way treat our family with genuine care and hospitality. The employees here are the estates truest most valuable  assets. We noticed that our friends here seemed on edge ,witnessed wait staff being yelled at for pausing to speak to us for a brief second  everyone we encountered seemed to be walking on eggshells.. We  spend every meal here and rarely go off estate spending our days horseback riding and golfing- we are very concerned that changes in staff would  be the downfall of this once great place, Sean the golf pro is wonderful,  the equestrian program and its staff Jenny,Tara,Elaine, Amy  are top notch as well as the horses, the golf course grounds are  the finest in all of Ireland  and the gardens are breathtaking - Im certain they are not cheap to maintain  but know that its a great team of people who keep the place running top notch.  Anna in reception and  our porters Jacob and John and John  and Des always so welcoming - Xavier and Anne Marie have a great team their food is always delicious we have never had a bad meal. The bar with Stephen,David and our favorite servers Trish and Anne Marie treat us like family- I could not imagine the place without any of them they all put their heart and souls into their work. Wanted to mention that I attempted to add on 2 more days at the end of my stay  and in doing so would need to cancel our reservation in Dublin - a new employee someone whom we did not know told me they had availibility for the next 2 nights and I went about canceling my prior reservations - Im relieved I decided to ask him a question about the rate as I found out then he only had us booked for 1 additional night ! Then  I spent the next 2 hours trying to rebook for a room in Dublin as we needed 2 nights-I had a penalty to cancel my earlier reservation as well . He didn't seem too concerned for us and made a joke out of it.    We wanted to address this with the manager but he was unavailable .  I realize that its a huge undertaking and its a costly place to maintain  my only hope is that the new ownership sees what truly makes this place warm and welcoming and makes us want to return .",3,2015,09,14
239,Jaded and Restaurant a foreing land,"I booked 2 rooms for a family 60th birthday , good expensive rooms. Tatty, no A/C, it was very warm, and dear god the restaurant was poor for a 5 star, Slow service from the bane of Irish tourism, foreign waiters with attitude. Some staff were lovely, outside the restaurant. I would point out the golf course and on course houses as a negative, though the views over the River Nore were beautiful",3,2015,09,11
239,Mount Juliet was a hit for every member of my family,"I went to Mount Juliet in 1997 as a single woman and this time returned with my husband and my two daughters ages 11 and 13. My daughters and I love to ride horses and my husband is an avid golfer.  We stayed in one of the Rose Lodges which I thought were fantastic.  Since we were active it was important to have access to a washer and dryer which were on the first landing as you entered the cottage. The kitchen and baths were newly renovated and clean.  I thought I would miss a wood fireplace, but the gas fireplace was wonderful.  The views were beautiful and we felt very private.  My husband enjoyed the golf and my daughters and I loved the riding.  The trails were fantastic and we were able to jump and gallop in fields.  The staff at the barn were so friendly and kind to the animals.  We were able to walk to the stable from the cottages which was nice and easy.
Breakfast was my favorite meal of the day.  The dining room was empty and we were able to have a custom breakfast each morning.  I was sure to have salmon at every meal.
I had a facial at the spa that was wonderful and one of my daughters enjoyed a swim in the pool. In every situation the staff was nice and always helpful.  I also found ti really nice to have some many people from Ireland working at Mount Juliet.
If you have a chance go explore the breeding farm at the base of Mount Juliet.  There were so many beautiful baby horses.  Make sure you try archery with Shane.  It is so much fun and the views driving there are magical.",5,2015,09,11
239,Beautiful hotel and spa,"We have just returned from a mini break to Mount Juliet and yet again have had a wonderful few days.    The spa staff were very professional and the treatments were excellent.    I stay in a lot of spa hotels so I know a quality one when I stay in one.

The meal in the Lady Helen restaurant was fantastic - well done to the chef and the waiters and waitresses - excellent service and very efficient.   Also breakfast in this lovely room was also outstanding and lived up to it's previous high standards.

 I understand that the hotel now has new management, I would therefore like to emphasise to the management that overall their staff are of the very highest standard.   This is one of the reasons we return time and time again to this resort, because we know we will be greeted with a warm welcome and everyone will do their utmost to make our stay an enjoyable one.

The one concern we had on this visit however was when we tried to have a meal on our arrival at the presidents bar restaurant.   We were under the impression that there was no need to actually book a table here but when we got there many of the tables were reserved.   This eventually meant that our only choice was to sit on high bar stools around a small bar table to get a meal which I must say up to that point, we had been looking forward to after a long journey.   We were kept waiting for a long time for our food and when it arrived it was not of the usual standard of Mount Juliet.

We were given a small reduction on our bill, but nevertheless the experience was disappointing.

However,  well done to everyone else I have mentioned.  We will no doubt see you soon again.",5,2015,09,07
239,Excellent Hotel,"My family and I are currently staying at Mt Juliet. I read the reviews and whilst most were positive there were a few negatives too. We arrived with mixed expectations. After our first day/night all I can say is what an excellent hotel! Food very good and reasonably priced. Staff very friendly and professional (must mention to Derek the porter). Lodge accommodation also excellent. I can't recommend Mt Juliet enough 10/10!!

Spectacular.
Luxurious.
Welcoming.

Cosy.
If heaven was a hotel it would be Mount Juliet.
Although we only stayed 1 night for three years we felt like royalty.
No faults anywhere.",5,2015,09,01
239,Beautiful Place,"Very nice grounds, and the older building with the top shelf restaurant, reception and finer rooms is quite appealing.  Our room was on second floor of a building in another area about 100 yards away that was ordinary but adequate (and costs less).  Breakfast in Kendell's room downstairs was a disappointment both days, and dinner and drinks one night at President's bar (also downstairs form our room) was okay.  The pasta would have been great if not overcooked.  Formal dinner at Lady Helen was quite good and service appropriate to fine dining.  You should request a table by the window in advance, as the view is spectacular.  Overall, hotel staff was friendly and helpful.  Hotel is a little bit out of town, which was good for the rustic surroundings and we did not care to drive anywhere for dinner each night anyway.",4,2015,08,31
239,Magic of Ireland Hospitality,"Emerald first class hospitality. What endears comes natural  and is reflected by all staff and team household members each an ambassador to their profession.

239,"Top quality accomodation, with a warm welcome.","This was our second stay at Mt Juliet. We had the same room in the clubhouse both times and it was to a very high standard. Spacious, clean, with a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was excellent, with a large walk in shower area. We dined in the clubhouse and the food was to a good standard and was reasonably priced. We've found all the staff to be professional, yet very friendly and helpful. The grounds are fantastic, and it's lovely to see the horses from the stud farm, cantering round their paddocks by the river. We can't wait to visit again.",5,2015,08,28
239,Never to Return: It is over-priced and not suited to a couples retreat - 3 Stars at best,"We stayed on a Monday night, we had received information from the hotel advising check in was 4pm, which in my opinion is very late, considering check out is noon. We arrived early and took a walk around the grounds, our room was ready at approximately 2.30. We paid €180 (no breakie) & upon check we were advised we would be staying in the golf club part. The room was 3 stars at best, needed a coat of paint and some pictures it had no ‘hotel information’ book & was very basic. Not worth €180! We used the leisure facilities which were also 3 star at best,clean but they did not look anything like the pictures and wear & tear was visible.  The hours for the children in the pool are from 9am till 12 noon & from 3pm till 6pm – this was not enforced in any form!! We are in the clubhouse and the food was edible - not very tasty. Later that evening my boyfriend went to the bar for some snacks, the bar was empty and the girl asked if he was a member, when he answered no she explained he would have to walk 3eet to the other side of a wooden divider before she could serve him – BOTH BARS WERE EMPTY!! This was the final stray and demonstrated poor judgement from the bar person and ridiculous elitism!!  We could understand this is the bar had been full of ‘members’ but after paying that much for a one night stay and to be told to had to walk three paces to buy peanuts and a coke it soured our stay even more! At checkout I was not asked ‘how our stay was’ or spoke to at all really so I did not bother voicing my complaints as it appeared the staff did not wish to know. We will never return & further more my friends was contemplating holding her wedding reception in MJ – after I relayed our experience she is no longer considering it. It is over-priced and not suited to a couples retreat.",1,2015,08,25
239,"Accomodation tired, grotty and vastly overpriced.... food was good... service hit and miss","Mount Juliet is living on it's reputation but slowly dying on its feet. Management need to wake up and start operating it to a standard commensurate with the prices being charged. Our room in the Hunters Yard was pokey and dark; the decor outdated. The mattresses need to be replaced, the window did not close properly. Two lampshades were broken. The common areas are dark and a bit battered. The lift looks like it is on loan from a warehouse. The receptionist who was present on our arrival was cool and disinterested. Although the general level of training of staff is substandard, many were naturally very pleasant and helpful, others neither. The food in Kendall's is pretty decent and appropriately priced... breakfast was ordinary enough.... We treated ourselves to dinner in the Lady Helen Restaurant which lived up to it's Michelin star rating. The setting is wonderful. It is a shame that those now operating Mt Juliet conspire to achieve so little with so much. Either charge 3 star prices or re-invigorate the Hunters Yard (we cannot comment on the main house). Ireland now has many hotels of the highest quality. Unfortunately Mt. Juliet can no longer be ranked amongst them.",2,2015,08,24
239,Two small complaints the rest great,"Our stay at Mount Juliet was fantastic. The staff were impeccable, the room was gorgeous, we got free acces to play a putting competition amongst ourselves with putters lent for free, we took full advantage of the beautiful walking trails and we rented bikes from reception for free. It was a perfect night away for me and my boyfriend. We ate in the golf club because the hotel restaurant was fully booked but we were both very satisfied with our food, great portion sizes and reasonable. The breakfast was great. One complaint would have been the smell of sewage coming from the pipes in our bathroom, but I'm sure it was beyond the staffs control. I made them aware the following day and they said they'd send maintenance down asap. Hopefully no one else was woken by it like we were! The other complaint would be that we called down for water in the evening time, and we got four bottles sent up to us. I was delighted, very quick service. However, on the bill the following day, the four bottles cost us €22. Extremely overpriced. I've been to a lot of hotels and mount Juliet is the first out of any hotel 3-5stars that has ever charged me for water when I've asked for it. Bit ironic considering how much you're paying for a night. Otherwise, the place is great! ",5,2015,08,24
239,"Nice park, outdated rooms","We stayed at this hotel for two night during an Ireland round trip. It is located beautifully in an old park. The building looks great when you arrive, but our room (as most rooms as we understood) was located in the ""clubhouse"". The room was small, the bathroom dirty (mould in every corner of the shower) and the interior was shabby.
The restaurant was great. Food was tasty, staff friendly and helpful and breakfast also better then average.",3,2015,08,23
239,A mixed Bag but a good experience overall,We had a nice comfortable room overlooking the Nore with great views of Ballyinch stud farm.  We enjoyed dinner at Kendal's.  We also enjoyed the Lady Helen but had a more mixed experience in the latter restaurant.  The food was for the most part excellent. I did et a very poor crab starter which came on two different plates.  It was like the chef could not make his mind up.  Neither was good.  The wine waiter was annoying: he brought us Champagne that we did not order.  He also later brought us a Glass and then just swiped it off the table without saying anything.  Clearly brought to the wrong table again.  We could not understand the waiter who brought the bread.  The Maitre-d was very professional.  For the prices we would have expected better service and more food.  There were lots of cobwebs outside the bathroom window and lots of pieces of paper stuck to them!  Some of the staff were absolutely brilliant - but not all.  The main thing I remember about the hotel is it spectacular setting.,4,2015,08,23
239,Nice stay- will be coming again,"We stayed there on a Saturday night after a last minute decision of fleeing Dublin for the weekend.We stayed in a ""superior room"" on the manor, ground floor. We got a package which included dinner at Kendall.

Everything was set when we arrived, we stayed in room 14, its size was OK (we were staying for a night) however I was expecting something larger (I think the ""superior"" makes it sound more important...). The decoration is beautiful and every detail seems well thought to accompany the surroundings. The bed was very nice and comfortable (and huge - which is always a plus!!) The only two things I could say about this room is that the lights of the cars filtered through the curtains at night and it was a bit annoying as they woke me up a few times, and the fact that we could hear our friendly neighbours upstairs (you can hear the steps coming and going :) - They woke us up in the morning - This is an old house after all, so the only thing I can suggest is: REQUEST A ROOM UPSTAIRS! and that solves both issues!

Dinner at Kendall was forgettable, I wish we were advised to have dinner somewhere else with our toddler. VERY quiet restaurant, dim lights and not worth the value for the food you get.

The next morning we had breakfast at the lady Helen Restaurant and it was very nice, the staff was very attentive! 

The checkout could be a bit more welcoming for people who are waiting... perhaps a sofa? or a couple of chairs? I was very surprised we weren't asked about our thoughts of the stay... however the Valet did ask, he was great fun, even remember our little one's names (those little details are the ones that will make us return to Mount Juliet some day)

After breakfast we enjoyed a lovely walk through the gardens.

My suggestion if you're going with young children: Book a babysitter and have dinner at Lady Helen restaurant. Enjoy the quiet and romantic atmosphere. 
I believe we'll wait a couple more years until we return to Mount Juliet... it is lovely but I believe more suitable for families with older kids.

PS: Really got lost when going out... there were no EXIT signs!!! still we got to do a little tour around the golf court ;)

239,"Fantastic, Beautiful, Professional and Relaxing.","This hotel and golf estate has some of the most beautiful grounds I have seen. The second you enter the gates you know this place is special.
Hotel staff are very professional and welcoming.

The rooms were great, not the biggest but set out in a brilliant configuration where you have your own space and outdoors area.
Looking from the outside, the other more luxury rooms seem to be amazing. Next time and bank balance permitting I will definitely try those.

Great bar, rich in history and relaxing ambience.
The best full Irish breakfast I have had in a long time! I could not fault it! 

I would highly recommend this hotel!",5,2015,08,19
239,Our favorite place in Ireland - hands down.,"We recently completed our third stay at Mount Juliet, spending two weeks in June on the property.  This place just gets better and better each time we return. 
 
There is a tranquility to Mount Juliet that just has to be experienced to be believed.  The peace and serenity that permeate the resort is remarkable – it makes for a truly relaxing get-away.  The clean air, the quiet (other than the chirping of the birds and swish of golf clubs!) and the incredible amenities just make for an ideal escape.  Without exception, every member of staff is helpful, friendly and thoroughly professional.  They all seem to genuinely love what they do, and it shows.
 
In terms of activities, there is plenty to do. If you’re not content walking the breathtaking grounds of the estate, there’s the relaxing spa, a wonderful equestrian center open to riders of just about any ability, fishing, golf, a kids club for the little ones (note that it opens during Irish school holidays, which start about a month later than the US - or at least, the Texas - summer break), biking, a playground, etc.  No shortage of things to do.  Best of all, Kilkenny is just 15 minutes away.  We rate Kilkenny as one of our absolute favorite Irish cities – lots to do and see, great food, decent nightlife and shopping, and so on. 
 
The dining at Mount Juliet is also outstanding.  The Lady Helen is a real treat.  We went three times during our stay and enjoyed each experience immensely.  Its reputation on the Irish culinary scene is well deserved – fresh, local innovative food without being overly pretentious.  The staff know their stuff, too, from their descriptions of each dish to the remarkable wine pairings that come with the tasting menus.  Worth every penny, and then some!  The more casual outlets are great, too.  The bar was a personal favorite of ours for lunch.  The kids even enjoyed the food, which is a rare occurrence in our household!
 
The accommodations at Mount Juliet are always great, too.  Our situation was a little unique.  We booked about 10 months ahead of time (yeah, we were a little excited about returning!), and ended up booking an accommodation type that was ultimately not available, but we were well taken care of (a very special thanks to Louise in reservations, who handled everything wonderfully, as always, and even came to check on us the day after we arrived.  Much appreciated!)  We’ve stayed at the main house, the clubhouse, a stand-alone home and the Rose Cottages over the years.  You just can’t go wrong with any of the options available to you.  They’re comfortable, impeccably clean, well-appointed and relaxing.
 
We’ve already started planning our return for two weeks in 2016.  Mount Juliet truly is our ‘happy place!’",5,2015,08,18
239,Fall from grace...,"Myself and my (now) wife stayed in Mount Juliet stayed in a Hunter's yard room in 2009 on one of our first weekend's away as a young couple. We returned this year to relive some of the magic and we hoped to find the same experience...

Unfortunately we did not have a great stay. The check-in system needs to be re-thought. A top quality hotel would not have several guests crammed into a small warm room while listening to other guests affairs. 

For a romantic couples' stay, two poor quality single beds pushed together is not acceptable. I remember fondly the ""floating on air"" feeling of the beds in 2009 and returned to a major disappointment. Fortunately the bed cushions are still soft and fluffy. The bathroom was high quality and it's nice to have a private mini-balcony in the room. We were left two robes in the wardrobes, one was Mount Juliet branded and one was not branded. Both were harsh and uncomfortable to wear down to the pool.... Where we had to pay €4 each for swimming caps. Three young girls got into the pool without caps and were promptly handed returnable complimentary caps, go figure. The pool area is crying out for some investment, some modern waterfall massage features or a jacuzzi. The TV in the bedroom was dated and some kind of personal welcome would have been nice (The Twelve Hotel in Galway leaves personalised plates with cake for every guest). 

We had a nice dinner in the President's bar, however a table of 6 children (no adults) were placed beside us in the conservatory, which would be unacceptable in TGI Fridays yet alone a quality hotel. Breakfast in Kendal's was nice but if you are putting The Full Irish on the printed menu, there should be an option for it to be brought to your table. My poached eggs came awkwardly on a separate plate. Every hotel has a buffet breakfast. Table service at breakfast separates the classy ones.

Check out again was in the warm and cramped reception, where I had to help myself to the room temperature Ballygowan water. 

This place holds a special place in my heart. My grandad was buried wearing a white Mount Juliet cap (I bought myself a navy cap for his memory) and I watched the world's best golfers play for the WGCs there in 2002 and 2004 with my dad. I really hope things improve at Mount Juliet so I can be proud of these stories as I tell them over the years...",2,2015,08,18
239,A fabulous family holiday,"We have brought our children to a few (not too many)locations around Ireland but this place ticked all the boxes for us all! It was a truly great experience for us all. The staff were really amazing, no request was awkward. I changed our dinner booking 3 times on a bank holiday Saturday and I felt really bad about it but they were so accommodating.The whole team of staff were really great and were really concerned that our stay was a really good one. The Hotel and grounds are absolutely beautiful & the food in all three restaurants top notch.We will definitely go back !",5,2015,08,18
239,Disappointing two night stay,"We stayed in a club house room just off the hunters yard. First impressions of the grounds and main house were very good, beautiful drive up to the main house through the golf course. Check in was like entering the principles office in school, awkward and slightly intimidating. Only got one room key. We were shown to our room & helped with our bags which was helpful. 

There was a musty smell when we entered the room, the carpet had seen better days in the hall & the room was quite dark. The travel cot was set up already which was good. The shower was really good, however the shower tray overflowed onto the bathroom floor when on full strength. We had to get the duvet changed as it was badly stained in two places, visible through the cover. Food was good in the presidents bar and in Kendell's restaurant. We had a lovely breakfast in Kendell's on both mornings, however the carpet and furniture had dryed food stains where we were seated. Something had obviously been dropped either earlier that morning of the night before and had splattered across the furniture. Service was only OK considering the star rating of the hotel, the pro shop staff were very helpful. The club house room we stayed in needs a revamp. Our stay was ok but definitely didn't have the wow factor that we were expecting",3,2015,08,14
239,Birthday present ,"I was surprised with an overnight stay here recently.  We stayed in the hunters lodge as we were playing golf also and recommended to stay here instead of the main house.  My first impression was that the accommodation was not 5 star.  It was basic enough but it was clean and the room was fairly big.  After a game of golf I love to soak in a bath but I was disappointed that there was no bath only a shower.   We decided to dine in the hunters lodge that night.  The food was absolutely beautiful but found the service a bit slow.   The surrounds of the estate were lovely.  There is crazy golf which was well laid out, lovely walled garden and a kids play ground.  I even tried the swings and zip wire a bit if fun.  My opinion is there are far better 5 star accommodation out there. ",4,2015,08,14
239,A great start to our tour of Ireland,"My wife and I were touring Ireland in our E-Type Jaguar with 12 other classic cars. This was our first stop and a delightful start to the tour. On arrival our bags were immediately collected from our car and whisked to our room which exemplified the excellent service that we received throughout our brief one night stay. The location of the hotel is stunning and the quality of the room was very good.
We ate in the Lady Helen restaurant which we were told had a Michelin star. The food was good but not exceptional; however, the friendliness of all the staff and the quality of service was outstanding.",4,2015,08,12
239,Lovely old Manor House,"We stayed 2 nights in Mount Juliet Manor House in July. It's a lovely old manor house and staff were always very helpful especially Rachel when booking our stay. The house though full of guests is friendly,quiet and relaxing, with lovely a atmosphere.",5,2015,08,12
239,Superb,"Had a great stay in Mount Juliet for two nights, staying in the main house - the room was spotless and we had a lovely view over the river and grounds behind the hotel. We had the nine course tasting menu in the Lady Helen one of the nights (highly recommended), and dinner in Kendals the second night as the Lady Helen restaurant was closed on Sunday, with afternoon tea one of the days too. The grounds are beautiful with plenty of walks throughout the estate, and lots of roads and paths to venture down.

The food in the Lady Helen lives up to its Michelin Star billing, and the hotel simply oozes quality throughout. A special thanks to Martin G, Des and the two Aga's who looked after all of our requests - many thanks guys.

Will definitely be back for a second visit soon!",5,2015,08,11
239,"The best of Irish country house luxury, and magnificent Michelin-star restaurant","Conscious of Mt Juliet's strong reputation, we were hoping it lived up to expectations. From the moment we arrived, and experienced the lovely welcome from staff, we knew we were going to enjoy this. The hotel is beautiful - the best of traditional Irish country house luxury, without being at all ostentatious or stuffy. Our room in the main house was extremely comfortable, had lots of space, a big bathroom, and nice views over the stunning surrounding countryside. Champagne afternoon tea, served out the front of the hotel in the sun, was beautifully presented and delicious. Later on, dinner in the Michelin-starred Lady Helen restaurant also in the main house, was magnificent. Service was attentive and friendly but not at all overbearing. The food was sublime and generous too, given all the little extras, amuses bouche etc. Overall, a superb night's stay - highly recommended.",5,2015,08,07
239,Perfect!,"I recently spent 2 nights here and they had to force me to leave. It was perfection for me and I loved everything about it from the second I arrived at the front door of the stunning 18th century manor house which is where we stayed in a lovely, large room with a fine view of the river and pastures beyond. Dinner in the Michelin starred Lady Helen Dining room was transcendent....one of the best menus and wine pairings I've ever had. The staff is gracious and eager to serve. There is a complimentary tour of the 1500 acre property which you must reserve when you arrive and do not miss this. Des, your guide knows everything about the estate and you'll see hounds, horses, homes and more. The gardens are lush and fragrant. Mount Juliet is simply and elegantly (but not stuffy at all) sublime. ",5,2015,08,01
239,wonderful retreat and comfortable environment,"We spent four nights at the Estate.  It was simply wonderful.  We had a room in the Clubhouse and it was very comfortable, quiet and spacious.  The outdoor spaces are beautiful, there are great walking trails, the golf course is beautiful and the setting is very peaceful.  We found every staff member to be friendly, very helpful, accommodating.  This was one of the most comfortable retreats we have experienced.",5,2015,08,01
239,Afternoon Tea at Mount Juliet Hotel,"My mother having just passed away, a friend took me for afternoon tea to Mt. Juliet House. We were not shown to a room just told to go 'over there'. We were not attended to and had to look for a waiter. Our tea and coffee were brought to us 20 mins before our food. We had to ask for a pot of coffee. The front room where we sat was continually being used as a corridor for people passing through to their rooms. We had to move into the other room and carry everything ourselves. Once our food arrived we were not attended to again or asked if we needed anything else. We left after not having seen any staff, there was nobody there to thank us for our custom or any normal service at all. While the food was fine, there were no d'oile's and we were not offered a galss of sparking water or wine which is usually part of afternoon tea. Overall the service was very poor and for the price of €60 it was quite apalling. I would not recommend Mt. Juliet for afternoon tea unless it improves dramatically.",3,2015,08,01
239,Weekend break,"We stayed here for a weekend in July to celebrate a birthday. It's a fabulous country estate that delivers on charm, luxury, food but it's the service that sets it apart. The staff are warm, welcoming and seem genuinly happy to engage with the guests. For a five star, there's isn't the fussy over formality that similar properties we have stayed in provided. We loved the warm Irish hospitality that was evident from the minute we arrived. 
Room: we stayed in a suite in the main house. Big, airy, stunning views. A min bar would have been a welcome addition but room service was v prompt. 
Food: fantastic The award winning Lady Helen doesn't disappoint. Beautiful setting and lovely fresh local food that delivered on flavour. We also ate at the club for lunch, great salads, sandwiches. 
Overall: I loved this hotel and will definitely be back. Staff told us upgrades to the golf club house and spa area are in the offing which will make this beautiful estate even more special. 
",5,2015,07,31
239,Exceptional,I stayed here twice once in the club room and second in the honeymoon suite. Both experiences were quite different however the manor room was like a scene from downton abbey deer roaming the grounds adjacent to the hotel. We had afternoon tea also where we were presented with champagne a lovely gesture might i add. So tranquil. So picturesque ,5,2015,07,27
239,Memories Made for a Lifetime,"It's hard to even write a review of this experience. I have so many fond moments and memories of my stay it's hard to include them all and rave about the service level we experienced.
The main building is lovely. It's right out of Downton Abbey. So much is still intake from when the family still lived here that you get a clear understanding of Irish country living. It's elegant, stately and historic and the views are stunning! 
Our room was comfortable. We overlooked the horse and cow pastures. The Irish green fields were such a pleasure to sit and take in. It was magical.
We had plenty of space in our room. Keep in mind this is an old house over 200 years old, so the water might not be hot enough, a light might flicker or you might hear the guest in the room above you - in a Hilton you might complain, but here it's just part of the charm of staying in an old country house.
The staff is lovely. There is no hospitality like Irish hospitality! We were made to feel welcomed the minute we pulled up. The staff is warm, kind and friendly. Young Jacob gave us an excellent tour of the main house. He's full of personality and hospitality. Dessi gave us an excellent ground tour, that I will treasure for years. My favorite part of the tour was visiting the kennels! The staff quickly turns into old friends. 
We saw the gardens, the horse paddocks and the famous golf course. The grounds are spectacular. 
We had dinner in the Lady Helen (see separate review) and each morning we had a hearty Irish breakfast in this historic room to start our day.
I loved my stay here. It's a top experience of Irish living and a favorite travel experience in my travels. The staff went above and beyond our expectations. The spot that it sits on God's green earth is breathtaking. I can't wait to come back, but for now I will relive my fond memories in my head!
",5,2015,07,26
239,Good but not great,"We stayed here for just one night to celebrate our wedding anniversary, and thankfully we had received some vouchers to offset some of the cost. I'd always heard good things about Mount Juliet, and in my mind was expecting a 5* experience. Alas, that was not the case.

The room in the old house, on first impressions was nice - old style, but i don't mind that - it's not as clean as it could be - windows in particular were filthy. The main issue with the room however was the heat - We've never experienced anything like it and lay awake for over 2 hours in the middle of the night with the windows open to try to get some air in. 

As part of our package we were booked in for a spa experience - it was fine
The pool area was very disappointing, with mold growing on the inside of windows and the locker areas ( the ladies in particular) very untidy.

We ate in the Presidents Bar, and the meal and staff there were very good.
Breakfast was also good, with a nice choice.

I did mention the unbearable heat to the reception staff on check-out, and was told something about possible insulation issues?

In summary whilst overall it was OK, it was far from what we were expecting. With the quality of hotel choice in this price bracket now available in Ireland, I could honestly not recommend it to anyone ahead of other places I've stayed - nor would I be likely to return......Not a bad experience, just nothing special",3,2015,07,22
239,Perfect hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights for a wedding which went very well. Brilliant location. Rooms are traditional but put together well. Very clean throughout. Pleasant, friendly and helpful staff.  Food was perfect. Played the golf course, very challenging but well worth the money. Was in absolute prestine condition.

Would highly recommend staying here.  Couldnt fault any aspect of it.",5,2015,07,21
239,Excellent stay in the country,"We had an excellent stay here, though it started a bit bumpy. When we arrived at the hotel after a rather long day and drive there was a wedding party just in front getting their photos taken. Unfortunately we got lost in that shuffle. Once we were able to settle in we had a lovely stay. We enjoyed the hotel and especially the surroundings very much. There is an equestrian center with lovely mounts (but make sure you reserve a ride when you book the hotel).  You can take short of long walks, the country side is breath taking. The restaurant in the house is incredible, make sure you book a dinner here. The staff in the office was a bit stiff and not personable but the rest of the staff was lovely once you got to know them. If you make a reservation ask if there will be a wedding. If so, pick another time if you can.",5,2015,07,20
239,"Great staff, rooms need attention","Stayed in the converted stable yard where the rooms are relatively modern and fairly standard in design. But the views over the grounds are very restful. What was not so restful was the bed - which was not of high quality. There was also a strange electronic thrum in the room which seemed to come from outside -perhaps the room was too close to the kitchens of Kendalls Restauraant?
But the original house looked the part and the grounds are gorgeous. Breakfast in Kendalls was a bit lacking in choice but the staff there and elsewhere in the hotel were outstanding - friendly, efficient, welcoming and with genuine charm. 
Facilities in the room - other than the bed - were not bad. There was a good desk, a safe, an ironing board, and a tiny but well equipped shower room. I am not so sure that the towel holder should be right up against the lavatory but that could be easily fixed.",4,2015,07,17
239,Amazing family stay!,"We stayed in one of the Rose Cottages during the first week of July with our 3 kids aged 4-8. What can I say? We had the most relaxing break we have ever had with the kids.

For the kids there is the Little Rascals kids club from 1-5pm every day. They RAN in the door everyday and never complained once, so it was great for my wife and I as we were able to enjoy our time away from them and not wonder if they were ok. They also ran a cinema club and high tea 3 of the evenings we were there. The staff working there are very kind and competent.

There were extra activities like golf, tennis,  horse riding and archery too so they were kept going the whole time! 

The food in the bar is very good and well priced. Only complaint would be menu is a little limited (esp with Desserts), and service was slow/not attentive at times. I'm not sure if this was down to lack of staff or training, maybe a bit of both. 

The Rose Cottages are very nice and private. Loads of space and very well appointed. Finally breakfast is very good.

We will definitely be back!!! Thanks to all the staff there for our great stay. ",5,2015,07,17
239,Try and stay in the hotel!,"Thought I was staying in a fantastic 5 star hotel. Sadly I did not know I was in a lodge some 300 yards from the hotel. The lodges are part of the golf complex. Breakfast for us unfortunate ones also in the golf complex not the lovely hotel you can see in the distance. Booked trip via Your Golf . No idea if price differs between the hotel guests and lodge guests. There is a fine resteraunt in the hotel. Expectation of the trip was high reality completely disappointing. Be careful in what you book.

239,Wonderful Family Stay,"We stayed a week at Mount Juliet in early July after having stayed 10 days around Easter this year. Our three kids (between 3 and 7) enjoyed our first stay so much that we decided to return for the Summer and we were not disappointed. We stayed in one of the Rose Garden Cottage and the setting is perfect for a family: one large room for the parents with ensuite bath, one large room for the kids with ensuite bath, a large living room with working fire place, a fully appointed kitchen, a dining area inside and one outside. A home away from home, very private and cosy but with the playground, kids club and pool a two minutes walk away.

This is a perfect place with kids with a Kids Club open from 1pm to 5pm with High Tea and movie nights from 6pm to 8:30pm. The staff at the Kids Club is extremely nice and attentive and our kids just had a wonderful time. Ever felt guilty about leaving your kids to a kids club? Not here, our kids could not get enough of the Kids Club, so our only critic is that the Kids Club should open earlier in the day.

Besides the Kids Club there is an extensive kids program, some activities are complimentary (movie night) and some are for a very reasonable fee. Our kids did archery, golf, falconry, photography and tennis and had a great time. Each time the staff was super nice and attentive. We also arranged for swimming lessons which were very reasonably priced and the two teachers were super nice (and super effective).

With kids so busy, mum and dad can relax and enjoy the holidays. We had a wonderful dinner at the Michelin star Lady Helen with a baby sitter arranged by Mount Juliet picking up our kids after their Movie night at the Kids Club and putting them to bed. What else can you ask for? We will go back next Summer

We will definitely return.",5,2015,07,14
239,Beautiful property,"My husband and I spent two  lovely nights at Mount Juliet Estate, one night in a Riverview Room and one in the Presidential Suite. The Riverview Room was enchanting with a lovely wide arched window overlooking the river and the pastures beyond it. We awoke to the charming site of 15-20 mother horses with their foals frolicking in the fields - what a delight that was! The room was beautifully furnished and the bed amazingly comfortable with everything in immaculate condition. We then moved to the Presidential Suite for our last night in Ireland. It was absolutely lovely with a full arch wall of tall windows overlooking the river and pastures. The room is appointed beautifully and the suite includes a dining room/study as well. The rest of the facility is charming and the grounds are breathtaking. We couldn't have asked for a better way to end our trip. I hope the new management will retain the old school charm of this beautiful property and not change it into a modern hotel. It is truly a gem that took us back in time with its tradition and graciousness.",5,2015,07,13
239,Perfect place for a wedding,"We attended this estate for two consecutive  days as part of a wedding celebration. The ceremony and all entertainment took place on the estate grounds.

It was an all-round fantastic experience. From the scenic surrounds, the exceptional service, the delicious food, the spacious and luxurious rooms, right down to the elaborate rooms and bars that they can offer for various stages of the celebration.

Definitely worth investigating for similar such events, but would also pose a great way to spend a day playing golf and enjoying the food/drink.",4,2015,07,13
239,Style and Comfort in converted Manor House.,"We were attending a wedding in Killkerney  and as most accomadation near the wedding venue were taken by the bride's family attending en masse from America, we thought Mt Juliet where we had lunched and dined in the past, would be suitable despite a fifteen mile journey. I am glad we did.
We had expected to have rooms at the clubhouse, a separate building from the main house but on checking in we were pleasantly advised that an upgrade meant a garden room in the manor house. We were taken through to comfortable size and understated elegant rooms with a classical bath/shower room. There was a french type window that led to a private walled garden. In temperatures that reached mid 20ªC , this proved a welcomed bonus of having natural breeze and fresh air.
The food was extremely good throughout. Breakfast choices extended to a fresh catch of the day, which staying several nights afforded me the opportunity of having the cod one morning and turbot another. The turbot was delicious beyond expectations and quite up to a Michelin star award. A third breakfast was full Irish Breakfast which had black and white pudding and  haggis in addition to bacon, sausage ,eggs (any style). As we were out most meals at the wedding do, we did manage a lunch at the club house where an American clam chowder was as good as any I ever had and a fish and chips which was hard to beat.
The walks and views around the estate were beautiful, well maintained and charming staff (in the main Eastern European )made this a very relaxed and enjoyable stay. I forgot to mention that if golf is your thing, the Mount Juliet Estate is in fact a golfing destination with apparently superb courses. If in the area but not looking to stay do at least try a meal here.",4,2015,07,12
239,Return visit - just wonderful!,Our daughter had her wedding reception here earlier in the year and although we stayed for the weekend we didn't get to enjoy the full Mount Juliet experience.  Got a good two night midweek  deal on Luxury Breaks and headed back.  Stayed in the old manor house which is a must to experience the full delights of this wonderful venue.  No river view this time but a well appointed spacious room facing the gardens.  Large bathroom with old style free-standing bath and separate shower.  The peace and quiet was amazing.  Ate in Kendals restaurant in the clubhouse one night.  Staff very attentive and friendly.  Went for the early bird menu which was good value with plenty of choice.  Breakfast in the old house was very relaxing although the selection didn't seem as extensive as our previous weekend stay. Lovely walks around the estate  and the old house has plenty of rooms just to sit and lounge watching the horses going by.  Swimming pool area a little tired but good to be able to retreat to on a wet day.  Not forgetting the spa where I had a wonderful facial.   Perfect place for a nice relaxing break and would return in a heartbeat if available on a similar offer.,4,2015,07,11
239,Beautiful setting and lovely rooms,"We stayed here a couple of nights for a family wedding. The staff were very attentive and couldn't do enough for you as a guest, they were welcoming and accommodated anything you could need. I did think however the food in the clubhouse was a little overpriced and ran into an issue on our last night as the key to our room snapped off in the lock causing havoc (i had other family needing to get belongings out of our room so they could leave for the night). To the staffs credit they worked hard to resolve this issue for me and eventually we gained access. I would recommend staying in the manor if you do choose to stay here.",3,2015,07,10
239,Lovely country house,"Terrific country house with gorgeous views and parkland.
Stay in the main house.
Dinner in the Clubhouse was a little precious but good.
Easy drive from Dublin.  Rooms were very comfortable. Ours had beautiful view out of house over river.
Downstairs of house, while architecturally beautiful was a little worn.
Wifi did not work in rooms in main house.
This is very golf oriented hotel. Lovely grounds for walking.",4,2015,07,09
239,Afternoon Tea.....,"Had afternoon tea here today and I just love Mount Juliet. What can one say about such an institution? Of course as a member of The Blue Book I would expect nothing but top class service in beautiful surroundings and of course Mount Juliet does not fail in this respect. Our party consisted of five adults and three children, we were made feel very welcome and at home. Thanks for the lovely afternoon, looking forward to a return visit. Kieran",4,2015,07,07
239,Really enjoyable stay,"I booked this hotel for my annual  few days away with my dad when I was home in Ireland for a few weeks.   I contacted the hotel beforehand to discuss preferences, and any concerns I had and found them so helpful. The reservations team took time to ensure I chose the right type of accommodation for our stay and I was delighted with their recommendations. We stayed in the rooms beside the golf course and the room was very comfortable, the bathroom was lovely and the outside terrace was an added bonus especially as we were blessed with excellent weather and my dad enjoys a cigar so he did not have to wander too far from his room which was perfect for him. On our first night, due to the unseasonable warm weather the temperature in the room was uncomfortable but the following morning the housekeeping staff changed the bedding to sheets and blankets which ensured a much better sleep. Breakfast was lovely, the usual platter of cooked choices though I was slightly disappointed it was a buffet, they did cook poached eggs to order and there was a choice of fish available also. Unfortunately my usual favourite of smoked salmon was unavailable on both mornings. What makes Mount Juliet stand out is the service from the staff and their friendly & professional manner, nothing is too much trouble. We also got a lovely welcome letter with a bottle of wine and canapés when  we arrived back on our first night which was a really lovely touch. Thanks for going that extra mile. The grounds of the hotel are stunning and you could spend many hours exploring the beautiful countryside. The main house where reception is located is an old property and there is an odour of old house when you arrive. It is faded grandeur but I am sure the new irish owners will in time bring it back up to a high standard in time. Really enjoyed our time A truly lovely stay. Thanks ",4,2015,07,06
239,Much More Than We Expected,"We enjoyed our stay in the Rose Garden Cottage so much that no one wanted to leave. Every other accommodation during our trip was compared to Mount Juliet. The cottage was beyond what we were expecting; two large comfortable bedrooms, two large modern bathrooms, a full kitchen, a living room with dining area, a laundry room, and three balconies. All looking out on beautiful grounds.
The casual food was quite good at the President's Club and the staff was courteous and attentive.  The grounds are beautiful. It was an easy drive to Kilkenny, Thomastown, and Waterford.  It's not completely blemish-free which is part of its charm. Very, very comfortable. ",5,2015,07,01
239,"Amazing food, poor hotel","We were really looking forward to our stay at Mount Juliet as we had previously visited the grounds and had lunch at the clubhouse bar. We realised the hotel is an old country manor and were prepared for old school decor but what we found was old grotty carpets, peeling wallpaper, windows that couldn't be opened, wooden furniture in poor condition and the tiniest double bed I have ever seen in a hotel. After a poor night's sleep we found we had no working lights which made it impossible to use the bathroom without leaving the door wide open. The lights were working again on our return from breakfast before we had a chance to let reception know. 

The saving grace of our stay was a fantastic meal at The Lady Helen restaurant. The 8 course tasting menu was simply one of the most amazing meals I have ever had in Ireland. Breakfast the following morning was also delicious. 

At checkout I mentioned to the man at reception how much we had enjoyed dinner but that the room, bed size and lighting were not up to scratch to which he replied ""oh the standard rooms aren't great"". For 170 euro per night I would expect my standard room to be bloody gorgeous! 

My advice would be to stay elsewhere and save your money to eat at The Lady Helen twice! The standard of food is really spectacular. Such a shame the accommodation falls short.",2,2015,06,29
239,Beautiful!,"An amazing place.  The property is beautiful and the staff and service are over the top too.  We also ate at Kendals Brasserie, one of the restaurants on site, had more great service, and the food and wine were delicious!",5,2015,06,27
239,A place of A bygone era !,"Stayed here for 2nights in the main guest hotel, our room was very comfortable and big, it was very relaxing, bed very comfortable. Bathroom good, we had dinner at the Presidents club 1st night and our meals were good, 2nd night we had a meal at Lady Helens which we really enjoyed, we didn't do any of the activitys but did speak to some people who did and we had good reports, also enjoyed having drinks in the main lounge, all staff were on the ball and friendly. Definitely would stay here again.",5,2015,06,24
239,10 year anniversary trip,My husband and i had a wonderful stay at Mt Juliet. We had amazing accommodations and experienced wonderful service and hospitality. The high point of our stay was riding horses. We rode every day and took beautiful trail rides thriugh the woods and countryside with Tara Monaghan who works at the equestrian stay. She matched us up with perfect horses and made iur rides each day adventurius and interesting. We can't wait to return next year as this is one of our favorite travel destinations in the world. Thank you!,5,2015,06,23
239,Pretty much perfect,"We recently held our daughter's wedding here. The location is stunning, the hotel is stylish and comforting and the staff are amazing. This hotel has recently changed ownership and will benefit from some expansion and updating but to be honest it is already in a league of its own. Only 30 or so rooms means you can book the hotel for yourself for a wedding party. The rooms are special with views to match. Special mentions to Maurice, Alma, Des and Catherine in housekeeping for looking after us so well. Best wedding meal we have ever had! Mitchellin star well deserved.",5,2015,06,23
239,Beyond disappointing...never again.,"This is a painful review to write. I had taken so very much time and energy in researching which properties to stay at during my recent journey around Ireland. I understood that the hotel had been sold and knew that usually results in changes. We booked a two bedroom cottage (the one their web site says ""delivers all it promises"" for two nights, spa treatment, fly fishing, dinner at Lady Helen. The ""luxurious"" cottage..FILTHY, holes and large stains in the dining chair slipcovers, a kitchen with dirty stove top, dirt under the wastebasket, someone elses hair in the bathtub, corners full of dust, my BEDSPRING stuck out, room NOT de-feathered as requested a LONG time in advance, a balcony covered in bird poop and spider webs unuseable, cottage entry full of weeds and webs...very dirty windows, very tired furniture, and carpets that were far beyond just light traffic stained, FILTHY...they simply ""forgot"" what had been ordered for activities and tried to talk us down from a full day private fly fishing to half day..and the rest of the list is just simply unbelievable. What the HECK happened here? YES before the GM replies with ""we took care of some adjustment to the bill"" reply, let me just say, you will NEVER take care of the two precious days of a journey I planned a year for, you can NEVER give me that back. You can NEVER compensate me for the hours of time I spent on a precious journey speaking with managers of a supposed five star...or for my extreme disappointment. 
On the good side, the grounds are extensive and with stunning views, the golf course looked exquisite, the ""mansion"" from a distance is exquisite, a man named Des is such a treasure , the twenty minute spa treatment was lovely, and the Lady Helen food was exquisite..the service in a state of panic due to staff shortages. I think there are so many more options than Mount Juliet until they get their act together. I have rarely ever had to write such a terrible review but I would not like this to happen to anyone else who thinks Mount Juliet will be a two day dream stay  ....Shame.",2,2015,06,23
239,golf,The course was impeccable-one of the best I've ever played. The greens were true. The golf pro was extremely helpful and courteous. He even met us at the end of the round to ask about the experience and suggestions to improve...,5,2015,06,23
239,Wonderful Experience,"Mount Juliet was one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at.  Our first floor room was  large and extremely comfortable.  The restaurants were excellent.  The 1,500 acre estate and Jack Nicklaus golf course is beautiful.  We took a walk around the grounds across from the hotel.  It took an hour and was very pleasant.  Walked past cow and horse pastures, through woods.  The public areas are warm and comfortable.  The bar room is cozy and warm.  Our two night stay could not have been any more pleasant.  We recommend this hotel enthusiastically.",5,2015,06,16
239,Dream Breakfast,"Beautiful location and grand old house. Staff very attentive and friendly. Was very impressed that they phoned me a few days before to go over everything (lady called Mary - lovely person). I was advised to prebook the restaurant, which I did not because you never know what you want to do before you get there. This was a mistake as we could not get in the fine dining restaurant either night we were there. We did get in the other restaurant Kendals, which was very nice. However one night we could not get in either and were disappointed had to go in the golf club bar which was busy and hard to get a seat. Food there was fine, but more a pub style. So if you really want the restaurant experience, book ahead. The golf club bar is much better for drinks, the prices in the hotel bar are steep.
The bed was very, very firm and quite bumpy. I mentioned this to the maid and she immediately got the housekeeper who put a mattress topper on. Efficiently dealt with. So, worth asking, for a more comfy night.
Finally, the breakfast was really superb, every possible thing you could want. To be honest probably the best breakfast ever. Would go back. ",4,2015,06,15
239,"Peaceful and so, so relaxing","We stayed for two nights in April, with another couple. We would not usually stay at such an expensive hotel, prefering to spend our money on fabulous food. However, they were doing a deal for dinner, bed and breakfast which made it a good proposition. We then had a stroke of fortune, which allowed us to stay a second night. What a treat!

We were met by Jakub, who could not have been more helpful. We were shown to our rooms in the main house. They were enormous, but comfortable, with a large bathroom. We had brought board games with us, so took them down to one of the lounges, where we played in the afternoon, whilst being served coffees and drinks. This is the perfect place to relax.

Dinner was the seven course tasting menu, and did not disappoint. Afterwards, we were given a crash course on Irish whiskeys.

After a sumptuous breakfast - I recommend the eggs Benedict - we went on one the walks, which took us through the stud farm; with fields of foals and their mothers. In the afternoon we had a spa treatment, which just added to the relaxed feeling. That evening we drove into Kilkenny and had dinner at Campagne, the other Michelin-starred restaurant in Kilkenny; another wonderful evening.

We dragged ourselves reluctantly away the next day, feeling super-chilled. We hope to have the opportunity to return.",5,2015,06,09
239,Worn out rooms,"Gorgeous magnificent grounds. This hotel is very far from town and requires a car to stay.  The rooms are very warn out and haven't been refurbished for many years.  One could feel the springs
in the mattress and the king was two twin mattresses put together.  Had to order a standing heater because heat was controlled by office and not on at night.  Windows were old and single paned.  Jakub helped immensely with the heating problem and Des was a lovely and informed guide for the grounds. The young women at reception seemed to be distracted and not very warm or welcoming. No lift, too many stairs and poor breakfast quality. We travelled in Ireland for 3 weeks and enjoyed several other hotels, Sherborne, Killarney Park Hotel (WOW), Adare Manor, Hayfield Manor.",3,2015,06,06
239,Top Class,"Hard to fault anything.  This is a superb hotel in every respect, with a magnificent golf course on site and gorgeous walks within the grounds.  Michelin Star restaurant served a memorable dinner.  Many guests were attending corporate events and I suspect a lot of their business is of that nature.  Not cheap but worth it.   

Very minor quibbles would  be the wine list - offering only one white and one red in half bottles and a pretty narrow selection of wines by the glass.  Very limiting in trying to match the lovely and imaginative menu.  (They do offer a menu option of accompanying wines but this was pretty expensive.)

Second quibble would be the over-heated bedrooms - presumably catering for those not used to Irish weather but way too warm and very hard to adjust. 

But overall a top class establishment and highly recommended.",5,2015,06,05
239,"Shocking stay – old hotel, staff NOT trained.","This hotel is trading on a name from the 1990’s but with room rate of €230 a night; I don’t know how they are getting away with charging these prices.

-We booked a double room – received a room with 2 single beds pushed together. NOT ON!!
-No biscuits in the room and the toilet in the bathroom was shaky
-The bedroom overall was outdated, musty and smelt.

-Dirty cutlery placed in front of me at the bar when I ordered lunch
-The worst of all was when we were relaxing in the steam room, a staff member (girl, mid 30’s, red hair) came into the steam room, opened the door and said “we’re closed”, left the door open and switched off the lights with us still sitting inside - what the hell is that about? You don’t treat paying customers like that and especially from a health and safety perspective it was a stupid thing to do. Plus, there were still guests in the swimming pool so why was she rushing us.

-Went for dinner - asked the waitress “what the specials were” and was told “the soup of the day is broccoli”, seriously, the staff are NOT trained!!!!
-Asked for vinegar - a bottle was left down with an opening that was as big as a 500ml bottle, I thought this had to be a mistake and asked the waiter for a new bottle to be able to sprinkle out the vinegar and he said “no, this is how it’s served” – Yes, if you want your whole plate douched in vinegar – seriously, not on.

-Breakfast – Toast was put down on the table, with no butter, had to ask. Coffee served, with no milk, had to ask, seriously these items come hand in hand, the staff are NOT trained.

-On check out, I informed the 2 girls on reception about the above issues, and I told them that I have NEVER complained in a hotel before, but our stay was not good and for the sake of the hotel’s future they needed to know what was going on. In fairness the 2 girls on reception actually seemed genuinely concerned and said a manager would phone me to discuss the issues. Like I said to the girls on reception, it says a lot about a business if Management care enough to pick up the phone and call their customers to find out FIRST HAND what is going on. Did I get a phone call?  – No I didn't– I came home from work yesterday to an “automatically generated” letter from Mount Juliet apologising for the stay we had -”what are you apologising for Peter Wilson, General Manager”?? when you heard our complaint 3rd hand and you specifically didn't address any of our “issues” in your letter? How would you know what complaint we specifically had when you weren’t bothered to pick up the phone to hear for yourself? This confirms to me that NO level of service exists in Mount Juliet, especially when Management don’t provide it at the “Top”, why should their staff? There is only one place Mount Juliet is going and that’s downhill fast. YOU CAN’T KEEP TRADING OFF YOUR OLD NAME FOREVER.",1,2015,06,04
239,Feel like a King,"This palace hotel once was the palace for nobility and has been renovated as a luxury hotel, in a lovely location surrounded by golf courses, horse stables, river, and beautiful landscape. If you want to play golf on a beautiful professional course, this is the place.
The hotel provides tours of the grounds by one of its staff, and would highly recommend as you see the entire grounds, the horse stables where they raise thourghbreed houses that compete in major races. Expect to be treated as a Royal and enjoy.",5,2015,06,02
239,Lovely stay..,"I think Mt.Juliet speaks for itself.  It's a beautiful property offering a lot of activities.  The staff are both kind and knowledgeable.  We had a lovely room that provided extreme comfort, stairs provided for good exercise, and cleanliness was well-noted.  Truly enjoyable stay!",5,2015,05,31
239,Potential to be fabulous!,"Overall we had a great time at Mount Juliet but I felt the hotel was let down on some (easily remedied) points...

Pros; 
Venue- stunning location and beautiful grounds.
Staff- so friendly and personable.
Ambience- a lovely feeling and buzz around.
Food- from breakfast to dinner- amazing!

Cons;
Accommodation- bedroom in Main House slightly musty and bathroom very outdated & shabby.
Bathrobes- we were horrified when we opened the wardrobes to see the old, shabby and stiff bathrobes. Far from luxurious and comfortable. We left them where they were!
Overall Cleanliness- this was by far the biggest disappointment for me & really let the whole place down... dirty windows throughout hotel (bird poo and water marks ruining the views & restricting light), dirty mirrors, glass stains on surfaces, all the public areas could have done with a good vacuum and some soft furnishings in hall and sitting areas were (actually) threadbare... I could go on but I won't.

I hope that the management actually take this feedback as constructive from someone who has stayed at some of the most amazing hotels across Ireland and Europe. The potential this place has is huge & by changing and improving a few things the overall experience and feeling would be fab!",4,2015,05,30
239,Service not great in bar/restaurant,"We had a golf tee time to get to and took forever to get and pay our bill. Service was lacking such that I had them cancel my dessert. Like I said we were there to play golf and didn't want to have to rush to the first tee. We weren't alone as someone approached the bar at the same time to get/pay their bill for three coffees. And strangely it wasn't for a lack of staff. There seemed to be plenty and the restaurant wasn't crowded. They just seemed to lack proper training, supervision, and organization. Not the Mt Juliet I've visited 3-4 previous times.",3,2015,05,28
239,A grand estate,"We stayed two nights at the end of April.   I was looking forward to a country retreat as a contrasting experience to our stay in Dublin.   We were not disappointed.    Mount Juliet's splendid manor house is positioned overlooking the River Nore and sits in the middle of a fast estate that now is home to a large working stud farm.   We stayed on the third floor and had panoramic views of the rolling countryside.

Staying at Mount Juliet was a very relaxing time.  The two breakfasts were very good, with the option of ordering off the menu and/or partaking in a lavish buffet.  We opted to eat dinner in the clubhouse, one night at Kendall's and the other night just a pub sandwich at the President's bar.   Both meals met our expectations for quality and service.

One item of note is that there is no lift, so senior citizens should take this into consideration and maybe opt for a lower floor.  Also, the shower arrangement has a glass plate that is fixed and does not slide (at least in room 12) making it awkward to initially adjust the temp and get into the shower.   Again, this may be an issue for older guests.   

We especially enjoyed hiking the wonderful grounds, but be aware signage is nonexistent so it is a good idea to take along the provided trail map.",5,2015,05,27
239,A wonderful stay,"We stayed in Mt Juliet for 2 nights for a family wedding at the start of May, and we had a really fantastic time.
The service was very friendly and efficient without the staff ever becoming obsequious. The food was excellent and the general surroundings were welcoming and comfortable.
I would recommend it highly for a couple, group of friends or a family,
it is definitely one of the best hotel experiences we have had as a family.",5,2015,05,27
239,"This hotel doesn't try to be great, it just is!","My wife two children and I were lucky to stay here as part of a wedding party in early May.
We must say that this hotel is probably one of the best we have stayed in mainly due to the fact that it is just so elegant, welcoming and relaxing.
What makes this hotel is the staff attitude, from the moment you arrive, the gentleman who took our cases and just made us feel so welcome advising that our room wasn't ready but not to worry and to head into the lounge and just relax. 30 Minutes later our car was parked, our room was ready and our bags were happily tucked up in the room.
Everyone was so helpful and made for a great weekend.
OK this was my wife's sister's wedding so we were in great form, but every time we looked for something it wasn't a problem for MJ staff.
The wedding dinner was in the Lady Helen restaurant and I must say I just can't work out how the chef catered to a Michelin star level for 90 guests all sitting at one time. The food was just exquisite and the wine sublime.
Another big call out to the management on the night that didn't bat an eyelid to our children who were running around (as you do at weddings...apologies to any other guests!) and for looking after them so well!
We stayed in a family room in the main building which was just huge with a bed that felt like you were sleeping on a cloud.
I have read a previous review where they complained about the breakfast, I must say I can't agree with this as the two breakfasts we had were superb with sublime French toast and crispy bacon. 
Overall we had a really enjoyable time at Mount Juliet and would love to return, my title accurately describes our feelings about this hotel, unlike lots of other hotels that try really hard to be great, Mount Juliet doesn't need to as it just effortlessly is great.",5,2015,05,24
239,"Lovely room, shame about the breakfast","We had one night here to catch up with friends. Our rooms were both beautiful. Our friends had one overlooking the front garden. Ours was smaller with a window overlooking the roof and another the back garden but it was still a lovely room and our bathroom was gorgeous. The bed was extremely comfortable and I didn't want to leave...until I had breakfast. How disappointing. Cold toast. Dry mini croissants. Tasteless bacon. Unpleasant sausage, dry black pudding that was horrid. Even the tea tasted like cheap tea bags. It wouldn't stop me staying there again but it would have me looking for somewhere equally as lovely but with a decent breakfast. €389 B&B it's the least you'd expect.  As my husband said you'd be disappointed if it was €10 for breakfast (it was €22). 

We had the seven course taster menu. This was fun and interesting to do as a group and had one standout course (cod with chicken jus) and the others very good. 

Drinks in the bar were good - friendly staff and lots of choice, but no mint and no limes on a Friday evening was a bit disorganised. 

Unfortunately, I wouldn't race for a facial or massage. They were ok, but expensive. The girls were sweet but very young and we all felt that they were 'going through the motions' without any understanding of what the movements felt like for us or what they were for in terms of the facial / massage. 

Despite this we had a really lovely day and night. It was a great venue to catch up with our friends and chill out without kids. 
",4,2015,05,19
239,Oozing charm and class,"We stayed one night in the main house at Mount Juliet Estate. Our room was a large superior room and it was both larger and superior to most hotel rooms I have stayed in. An oversize bed was extremely comfortable and we experienced no untoward noise at night despite the hotel being full.
We had a reservation that evening in the Michelin starred Lady Helen Restaurant to sample the tasting menu. The hotel does not allow advance booking of particular tables so I would recommend an early sitting to be able to avail of a window seat and enjoy the river views and the horses running in the fields. The food was spectacular and the service was professional and unintrusive.
Despite a 7 course dinner, I was unable to resist breakfast the following morning where again excellent food was matched with helpful and friendly service. We took a long walk in the grounds before reluctantly climbing in our car for the journey home. Thankfully Kilkenny is now a very short journey from Dublin time wise so we'll be back soon again! Keep up the good work!",5,2015,05,18
239,Excellent,"We returned to Mount Juliet after a few years away and it is just as nice if not better than before. I could not fault the food especially the breakfast which we were looking forward to from past experience. Regards, David Barron",5,2015,05,09
239,Wedding and Golf,"We had a fantastic experience at Mount Juliet, we stayed in the Manor House as part of a wedding party. The room we stopped in was excellent with Queen sized bed, plenty of wardrobe space and a sitting area with a huge separate bathroom with shower, roll top bath and his and hers sinks. The food in the restaurant was also excellent, unfortunately it was closed on our first evening but we had a very enjoyable meal in the clubhouse. There are lovely walks around the estate and the added bonus of one of the best golf courses in Ireland! We managed to get a tee time with ease and at a very reasonable residents rate. Would not hesitate to go back",5,2015,05,08
239,A classy experience,"Just spent 2 wonderful nights at Mount Juliet with my family. We enjoyed a fabulous meal in the Lady Helen restaurant on our first night followed by an equally excellent meal in Kendalls the following night. Leisure facilities were top notch too! All in all top marks to the hotel & staff.
",5,2015,05,06
239,Quick Visit,"Two reasons I would go back to Mount Juliet.. 
1.. The Spa.. Absolutely excellent.
2.. The Staff.. So friendly So helpful and accommodating.
 
Hotel was very clean and the food in Kendalls restaurant was fabulous.  The breakfast was great too and served in a bright and airy restaurant.  

We stayed in the Clubhouse which was a hotel in itself.  Everything right there including the golf course.  Unfortunately we didn't have time to have a walk around the estate.

The only downfall of our stay was the bed!!! It was two beds pushed together.. not comfortable...

Mount Juliet is definitley a place to relax and unwind and also has plenty to do for children.",4,2015,05,06
239,Restaurant v's hotel,"Lovely restaurant, pleasant staff, reception was a bit unorganised on our arrival but gentleman at the desk was pleasant. I could not fault the food, it was just simply beautiful. The only minus was the room. It was dated and a tray with packets and long life milk is just not on a par with the rest of the setting! Only a little observation!",4,2015,05,05
239,Our Wedding In Mount Juliet,Cannot say enough about this venue. We held our wedding here and staff were highly professional and could not have done more for us on the day. We were made feel very special as were all our guests.Unbelievable setting with gorgeous views and fantastic food served to us from Kendals Restaurant. A huge thanks to all at Mount Juliet for making it a wonderful and memorable day. Special thanks to Alma Creed our wedding coordinator and Martin Gallagher (Manager).,5,2015,05,03
239,Fantastic Hotel and Golf Course.,"Great hotel. Been few times. Very popular with locals, tourists, anglers and golfers. Also near fantadtic villages/towns of Bennetsbridge, Thomastown, Inistigue. 
Famous areas for hurling. Great for walks, scenery, history, golfing, fishing and eating.
Kilkenny City is one of the best medeval City in Ireland if not Europe fantastic history and architecture.
Hotel gets very busy at meal times at week ends. Especial bar meals and Sunday lunches/dinners. 
Expensive to stay, dine and drink and good value for what it offers.
Excellent staff and well looked after facilities.
Will be back.",5,2015,05,02
239,Truely a great location!,"We stayed here for two nights, three days, for a corporate business and golf weekend. The staff were really attentive and helpful and 'went the extra mile' without being asked. Food was very good. the atmosphere and ambience here leaves nothing to the imagination. There is so much to do; golf, spa treatments, horse riding, fishing, clay-pigeon shooting, archery, walks, tour of stud farm, etc etc. you could never get bored here.",5,2015,04,29
239,Old World Charm and Service,"A truly unique experience.  We stayed for only a few days, but we were greeted like royalty from the moment we arrived.  The manager took the time to personally escort us throughout the premises.  He actually took the afternoon to explain everything that was included in our stay.  He took us to the stables (which we decided to explore later with an amazing tour guide), the dog kennels (in case we wanted to hunt), throughout the meadows, the raging river, and the beautiful bridge across it.  He then introduced us to the staff and all the facilities inside the manor.  Dinner was itself an amazing old world service experience with top-notch modern cuisine.  In a nutshell, an experience we're looking forward to repeat.",5,2015,04,28
239,Did not Stay - Just enjoyed afternoon Tea experience,"Went to the Mount Juliet estate outside Thomastown in County Kilkenny Ireland yesterday after with friends to enjoy the special Afternoon Tea Experience.
It was a very welcome experience and the surroundings of this old house added to the ambience. Beautiful setting in the large room with open fireplace and surrounded by wonderful paintings.
The tray was well stocked with a variety of different styles of sandwiches and delicious selection of deserts too. yummy. It was so relaxing and the sun was shining and . . . well all was well in the world in that moment.
The hotel could do with a little updating - it has been sold recently and I understand that there are major plans to redevelop.",4,2015,04,28
239,Very Comfortable,"Room was beautifully appointed and everything about the bed was great. It was a lovely place to stay. Dinner was good and we especially enjoyed Maurice who served us. Thank you for your care and enthusism, Maurice. Can't wait to find an excuse to go back.",5,2015,04,25
239,A few cracks ..,"Beautiful old country estate & home.  Dinner in the Michelin star restaurant was beautiful. Tasty, healthy and well presented.  The two course menu we chose at €65 per head was complemented by some lovely chefs surprises and petit fours. Our room although pretty, was noisy and too warm and the lovely sash windows refused to stay open.  Unfortunately the hotel have failed to invest in any blackout blinds so not only was it an uncomfortable and interrupted night of sleep it was an early start when the sun came up.  The hotel bar was possibly the most restful room in the house ..a little too sedate in the evening but the views during the day were beautiful.",3,2015,04,19
239,Golf mad,"Stayed overnight on 16th April in Rose Cottage and had a wonderful time. We didn't have any bother with check-in. Mount Juliet staff especially in The Presidents Bar are exceptional. So naturally pleasant and efficient. No is not in their vocabulary. Best posh fish and chips I've ever had and I would drive the 3 hours from Belfast just for another helping. The cottage was clean and warm. Great beds. Golf course excellent but I expected no less ( bunkers more like beaches ). Loved it and will definitely be back. 
              ",4,2015,04,18
239,Beautiful place to stay,We stayed this week for 2 nights. We had breakfast & 1 evening meal included in our deal. We stayed in a Superior room in the main house & it was beautiful. The room was spacious & so peaceful. Breakfast & dinner were very tasty with plenty of choice. There was a wedding taking place on our second night but we never heard any noise that would have interrupted our sleep. The grounds & estate are wonderful. I had planned to run & cycle during my stay but due to an injury I had to leave my fiancé do them by herself. She said that it was ideal & there are no shortage of routes to run or cycle. We will definitely be back & hopefully I will be fully fit to enjoy the estate next time.,5,2015,04,18
239,Not as amazing as i thought it would be,"I stayed here for one night for my wedding anniversary.   We booked a suite and overall the good points did outweigh the negatives (just about). 
Check in at the hotel was painless and quick.   We were to be shown to our room but having waited a couple of minutes we asked passing random hotel worker to point us in the general direction of where the room would be. 
The hall of the suite was big but a little dark.  The bedroom was lovely and cannot fault the decoration.  The only thing that it missed was there was no TV in the bedroom. 
The bathroom was nice.  Bath a little small for long relax in it.  The water pressure in the shower was excellent.  There were a few cracked tiles on the bathroom floor and the door could do with a touch up of paint as it’s a little grubby. 
The one disappointing thing is that from a hotel of this level I would have expected that robes were provided automatically in the room and I had to ring down to get them and wait a good bit to have them. 
The one negative is that I booked the B&B option and was a little stunned to find out that it only included a continental breakfast and that for a hot breakfast it was €20 per person.  I got the pancakes and while they were nice I don’t think they were worth €20.   The cost of the hot breakfast (when breakfast was supposed to be included) left a bad taste in my mouth. 
The setting of the hotel is amazing.  So peaceful and relaxing.",3,2015,04,14
239,Lovely girls getaway!!,"We had a really nice break away in Mount Juliet. The setting of the hotel is a beautiful, country estate with a sprawling drive to the main property. The hotel grounds were very well maintained, with really nice walks and gardens. Our twin rooms were very spacious, and comfortable beds. Both rooms had window seats and dual aspects so great views of a meadow garden at the back and overlooking the entrance to the hotel to the front. All staff were extremely helpful and courteous. Food was really tasty too. Dinner in Kendals was really tasty and very filling.m",5,2015,04,13
239,Old fashion hospitality,"Extremely charming country house, beautifully kept with fantastic common grounds and the famous golf course.
We had a superior room in the main house (which I recommend) with a spectacular view. 
Dinner at the Lady Helen restaurant was great and so was the breakfast.
Having a drink in front of the fireplace at the bar was also great.
Staff very nice, professional and  helpful. I hope to go back in the future.",5,2015,04,13
239,Fantastic Stay as always at this beautiful hotel!,"My family and I stayed at Mount Juliet over the Easter weekend. This was our second visit to this hotel and we were just as impressed if not more than the first time. We again stayed in the main house which I love as the rooms are so spacious! Our room catered for 2 adults and 2 children and at my request they also made up another spare bed so my kids would have even more room. My children attended the kids High tea which they loved and then went straight onto the supervised movie night which gave us time to go and enjoy a quiet meal. We ate in Kendal's and the food was fantastic as was the service. This hotel is just super for families with so much to do from swimming, golf to horse riding you could not ask for more! I would highly recommend and looking forward to returning again very soon.",5,2015,04,08
239,Want to go back,"We just spent a thoroughly relaxing 4 days in the King of Ossary room. Great staff in all areas, wonderful food in each restaurant with roaring fires in the main house lounges. My only small niggle was the little lecture given before each course in the Lady Helen restaurant, this despite all the information already being shown on the menu.

 Although there are many nice artisan establishments in the locality, a must visit is the Truffle Fairy Chocolatier in Thomastown. ",5,2015,04,04
239,Beautiful hotel but slightly disappointed,"Stayed here recently and while it is a beautiful hotels i was left slightly disappointed.I found the reception area quite odd and informal. Our room was quite large with beautiful views. The grounds are fantastic, you can go horse riding or just enjoy a stroll. What was really disappointing was the spa and leisure facilities. You have to leave the hotel as these are located in a different building. Both are extremely outdated. The spa is very old and small and relaxation room is a small room with few what look like old couches with few throws and your offered a glass of water! We eat in Kendal, food was nice, but there was a mix up with our order/ bill which didn't help. I don't want to sound negative as the hotel itself, the rooms and staff are all great but these little things did reflect on our stay, but then again i do enjoy relaxing by a nice pool and enjoy using the spa, so if these things dont bother you I'm sure you will love your stay.",4,2015,03,31
239,Wedding venue.,I cannot recommend this enough.  The staff are fantastic and worth particular mention. I was at a wedding and the venue was perfect. The grounds are really good and my kids loved exploring among the trees. It's a bit pricy but you get value for money.,5,2015,03,29
239,Great Staff and Superb  Dinner.,We visited Mount Juliet at the end of January.We were in a Manor Superior Room. We got a great welcome from the staff and were well looked after by them. Our room was lovely and spacious but the bathroom was absolutely freezing. It had no radiator only a heated towel rack.The television reception was poor. We could not get BBC 2 which was a pity since we had been following a serial. Two of the lamps did not work although the bulbs were promptly replaced. The evening meal in the lady Helen restaurant was superb. The breakfast was just o.k. No lift.,4,2015,03,23
239,"Wonderful hotel, wonderful activities, wonderful staff!!!","We stayed in Mount Juliet for a night to celebrate my birthday. We stayed in a beautiful room and had booked in for Archery and Horse Riding. We started off with Archery which was fantastic and we had a great instructor called Shane. He had great advice and we enjoyed every minute of it.
Then we relaxed before we had dinner in Kendals Brasserie which was delicious. 
Then the highlight was the following morning when when we were brought out horse riding by our instructor Tara who was very knowledgeable about the history of the estate and brought us around the beautiful grounds. She had a great sense of humour and was a great instructor.
We chose Mount Juliet because it was a beautiful hotel with activities that we have interest in but there really is something for everyone. It has luxury, a choice of restaurants from pub food, to brasserie food, to a Michelin Star restaurant, so something for everyone, and a very welcoming staff.
It is a 5 star hotel, so it isn't cheap, but I think you really get what you pay for, and it was a perfect getaway for my birthday.
Big thanks to the activity instructors, Shane and Tara who made the stay for us!!!",5,2015,03,16
239,Keep up the good work,"Booked the President's Bar for a special family lunch. The restaurant was closed that day, so I was a little worried that the bar might not be up to scratch. I need not have been. The staff were aware in advance that it was a family occasion, and I have to say they did everything to ensure we had a lovely afternoon. The service was great, food lovely and they made an extra effort to make the celebrant feel special. The bar was very busy that day, but we did not feel we were disadvantaged in any way because of this. I notice a couple of recent poor reviews and can only think these reviewers were very unlucky, because I find the standard of service in Mount Juliet to be consistently excellent.",5,2015,03,14
239,Sunday Lunch Fiasco at Mount Juliet Kilkenny,"Went for Sunday Lunch in Hunters Bar at Mount Juliet 7th March 2015 - party of 4 adults & 1 child
I had phoned the previous evening to book a table but told no need to. On arrival on the Sunday I asked the waiting staff for a table for 5 they asked if I had booked as tables were reserved I explained I had phoned the previous evening and been told no bookings required. I was ahead of my party so while I waited they managed to get me a table in the terrace part of the bar. We ordered pre lunch drinks and one of us ordered a glass of chardonnay when wine arrived it certainly wasn't chardonnay and no explanation offered for serving wrong drink. When consulting our waitress about the menu we were told the soup of the day was turnip soup! Obviously none of us choose this unusual soup and chose for our starter haddock fish cakes, the special of the day was a roast pork roast dinner - two of us choose this special as our main course and asked for the gravy to be served separately which the waitress couldn't understand and repeatedly said it was served poured over the meal before it was serves eventually she understood that we wanted it served separately in a jug . We then ordered a bottle of chardonnay and when it came we noticed it wasn't the wine we ordered and pointed this out - her first reaction was to argue but when we suggested she looked at what she had written down when taking our order she took the bottle back to the bar and pointed out their mistake she returned with the same bottle and said they hadn't any other bottles chilled so we decided to have it and luckily it was very nice. The first course came which was very nice but spoilt by the waitress clearing our table while some of us were still eating. Then the main course arrived the roast pork plates consisted of 2 slices of beige tough pork that was dry and very beige, mashed potato , cauliflower and a galvanized bucket of gravy served on the plate. It was so terrible that it was like something from a comedy sketch that we had to laugh. When we asked for the vegetable that are advertised on the menu it was served with, our waitress pointed to the cauliflower and said they are the vegetables. When asked for apple sauce none available, no crackling. no roast potatoes - a truly disgusting looking meal. We then had desserts/ coffee. I paid 189 Euro for this meal and as I was hosting this lunch for members of my family who I was visiting for the weekend we all chose to make light of it and I did not want to cause  any discomfort  for my guests I chose not to complain. The waitress was lovely but badly trained and who ever was in the kitchen had no idea of how to cook or present food. The lack of management was very obvious at every level and the owners really should analyse the whole organisation  and consider getting a professional manager and chef  as this mars Mount Juliet's  reputation",1,2015,03,13
239,Amazing,"Just back from a truly wonderful stay in Mount Juliet. Have stayed many times and will continue to return due to the outstanding grounds, facilities, food and most importantly customer service. So many hotels miss the importance of standards and customer service, this is what differentiates Mount Juliet from other establishments.  Nothing is too much trouble, staff are pleasant, professional and lovely.  Dinner in the Lady Helen is a treat for the senses and well deserving of its Michellin star. Dinner in Kendals was also really good, relaxed and less formal. Special mention for the manager there, French guy, who sorted out special food order for our very picky child!  He was so lovely and understanding. It's this type of attention and helpfulness that mean we will be back.

I know the hotel has recently changed hands but I truly hope the new owners keep up,the same high standards and levels of service and don't let it turn into one of the many run of the mill hotels that we have.",5,2015,03,12
239,Training in customer service needed in clubhouse restaurant,"Took a drive out to Mt Juliet for coffee and a cake on Sunday afternoon 8 March about 3pm. Restaurant was very busy and staff said they would come back to us when a table came free. However they just left is standing in a group (6 of us) in the middle of the floor in everyone's way. There were plenty of tables outside where it was not raining. We had to ask if we could sit there and then had to send one of our group in to ask for menus. Apparently we couldn't be served with food outside as it might rain so we ordered coffee. This was at 3.10. At 3.25 we were given a table inside where we waited and waited. At 3.40 we called a staff member over to ask where our coffees were. She told us there were lots of coffee orders and they were very busy. No apology, no 'let me check for  you'. At 3.45 coffee delivered. No time for cake as we had to leave at 4.  Just then we saw a waiter delivering food to a table outside. 
Customer service, Mt. Juliet - that's all you have to be concerned about. And your customers don't need to feel guilty for ordering coffee just because you are busy!  ",1,2015,03,12
239,Outstanding,"Our family has an annual get together (2 adults and 2 grown up children). Mount Juliet is our first choice. The manor superior rooms in the main house are awesome. The Michelin star restaurant is outstanding. The facilities include clay pigeon shooting, archery and golf in a wonderful rural setting. It is not cheap but its worth skipping a few mediocre weekend breaks and break the bank on this one.",5,2015,03,10
239,Pricey but accommodation definitely worth it. Restaurant not so much.,"We were a group of friends and we stayed in the lodges. The houses were fantastic. We loved the sitting room with fireplace and having a kitchen was marvellous. I'd defintiely come back here with children or for a romantic break. The main house with bar is stunning. We didn't eat in the MIchelin-starred restaurant but took a deal that included the less posh restaurant. This was the only thing that let down the place. The decor is outdated, the menu full of mis-spellings, starters are under the heading entrees and our waiter disappeared for 45 minutes after serving us our main courses. Other staff ignored us during his absence and we had to ask for more water and later, for our table to be cleared. The food was good; it was just not a great experience and unworthy of a 5* hotel.  
Having a swimming pool on the grounds was a wonderful bonus as it was a bit wet and windy for a walk but on a fine day the park would be great for a stroll.",5,2015,03,08
239,24hr of Relaxation and Rest,"Myself and my friend both working mums at last managed our 24hr escape. We needed somewhere to relax, eat, sleep and recharge. I have stayed other hotels with 'great offers' and been woken by rowdy guests I knew this had to be different. Having stayed at the Rose Garden Lodges before I knew it would be perfect and it was.  Even though we arrived at 11.30 for our spa bookings at 12 I was very pleasantly surprised to be given our key and were able to drop off our bags. The Lodges are beautiful and solid with big comfy beds, gas fire, and basically home away from home. We had two mini treatments each and they were fine, had had better but for the price I was happy and the staff were lovely at every step so far. The pool area is dated but didn't bother us at all. Lunch in Presidents bar was fine.. not amazing but not overpriced so suited me fine. Again staff excellent and Irish which I personally love.  Even when a difficult customer was being rude the staff were effortlessly professional.  We later had dinner in the same bar. My steak was overdone and not particularly fantastic just ok and a bit pricey for the quality I got. However if I was coming for the food I would have eaten in The Lady Helen.  A fantastic undisturbed sleep followed.  Breakfast was disappointing only because on a previous visit last year there was a much bigger Buffett selection of breads and granola and pastries. It was considerably scaled back for some reason and I think that is a huge pity as I was bowled over last time. Again however the staff at brecky are wonderful and I love Irish staff for how they are naturally with people. In a nutshell I would still go back for the scenery, the walks, the immediate chill out feeling and the staff. Having amazing food and the full scale breakfast back would make it perfect.",4,2015,03,08
239,Sheer Luxury,"Stayed for a Thursday night with my wife in February.  We had recently realised that the Lady Helen Restaurant had received a Michelin Star and wanted to try it out.
The Website had an offer of B&B plus a 7 course tasting menu in the restaurant.
When we arrived John saw us walking from the car park and came and assisted.  He escorted us to reception where we were quickly looked after.  John showed us to our room and showed us where everything was on the way.  The room was spacious and clean with a large bed and a nice bathroom and a little garden which would have been lovely to sit out in during summer.
We went to the bar and had a fantastic afternoon tea which was quite filling.  Service was excellent and we sat with a great view over the river and surrounding estate lands.  Many of the guests were out walking.
Dinner was excellent and the tastes of all the courses were fantastic.  There were quite a few waiters and waitresses looking after everyone.  The only one blemish was the waiter who brushed the table after courses - he did the job to tick a box and not necessarily clean the table - would be better off if this wasn't done at all.  
Retired to the bar for a relaxing drink afterwards.  Plenty of room for all.
Breakfast was excellent and the service was good.  Plenty of choice including healthy options (freshly cooked porridge etc).  There was a queue for seats as we left but I would guess that happens when guests leave it until the last minute.
Would we go back again?  Without a doubt",5,2015,03,06
239,Very nice hotel but not 'all that',"Hotel is the house, then there are other rooms out along the estate. We stayed in a courtyard. The room was nice but no great shakes. The restaurant down stairs was nice but no great shakes. There was a leisure centre but the pool was slightly pathetic, no jacuzzi and it was quite small. Grounds were nice but just ok. Golf course was lovely though so that was a saving grace. Overall, a bit over priced and not as fancy as it thinks it is. Not a patch on the K-club.",4,2015,03,03
239,Top Class,"This is a fantastic hotel in a great city. Both the service and the food were excellent. The estate that it is located in is incredibly idyllic and it is a ten minute drive from Kilkenny city, with many fantastic attractions and restaurant to enjoy. I will visit again.",5,2015,03,02
239,Average - could be better,"The setting is gorgeous and the staff are great but the service should be better. The good stuff first. The lady Helen Restaurant serves Haute Cuisine. If you like golf or equestrian then you are in for a treat. The spa however is dated and a bit grubby ( toilet seat in the men's loo was not cleaned underneath - job had been half done and it turned my stomach). The pool is excellent if a bit dated - while we were there the fountains were not working and we were charged for swimming caps - even charged again after we had misplaced one.

There is no room service if you are staying in the cottages .You must order then walk or drive to the golf club to pick your food up! they could do better for the money you pay.Also for me  - most irritatingly is the very poor (practically useless) WIFI signal in our cottage) Our stay for three nights cost over 1400 Euros. In conclusion I would not go back but I would not discourage anyone from going there for the first time particularly if you like golf or horses both of which are catered for to the highest standard.",3,2015,02,27
239,santa train at mount juliet,"this was a wonderful experience, the entire journey was magical, the staff really made the children feel special, there was no rush. Santa spent time with the children and the presents were good. We stayed the night also and the hotel is wonderful, our room was charming and the staff were so helpful, there are plenty of walking trails around the grounds to keep children busy.it is certainly one I will return to.",5,2015,02,18
239,"Beautiful hotel, Lady Helen a perfect special occasion restaurant!","My husband and I stayed at Mount Juliet recently mainly due to the Michelin star Lady Helen restaurant. We wanted to stay somewhere and have a really good dinner as we were celebrating our 8th wedding anniversary. I had not expected the grounds to be so beautiful and the hotel has a really relaxing old world feel. We had a lovely lunch in the main hotel - really tasty open sandwiches followed by good coffee, but the Lady Helen restaurant was the highlight of our stay! We had the 8 course tasting menu and each course was beautifully presented and tasted amazing. The restaurant is a gorgeous room (I felt like I was in Downtown Abbey for a few hours!) and service was really attentive but not intrusive.  We stayed in the Hunters bedrooms as we got a great deal online and I really liked the modern but comfortable style of the room. We had french doors overlooking the estate and as weather was freezing cold and sunny the view was amazing. The bathroom was lovely with oversized shower instead of bath. The only disappointment was the potato cakes I ordered at breakfast in Kendalls Restaurant - they were tasteless and clearly not freshly made - after our amazing dinner I expected more! Overall we loved our stay and will hopefully return soon, we will just need another excuse / special occasion as it was an expensive stay, but we have great memories of our weekend.",4,2015,02,16
239,Sometimes it's the little things ...,"Was in the estate this weekend for their ""mount Juliet Run"" in aid of charity. For starters this was a fantastic event, well organised with incredibly helpful and friendly staff. Everyone was so well looked after. I for one will definitely be back. 
We then had lunch in the Main House where again staff were excellent - only disappointment was when standing/entering the front doors of this beautiful old house/hotel you are looking at two big ugly bins for cigarette butts, also the entrance lobby smelt of cigarettes as that's where some of the smoke ends up. Sometimes it's just the little things that make the difference! ",4,2015,02,15
239,Beautiful and well worth a visit,This was a beautiful place to stay in. Grounds absolutely outstanding. Rooms lovely and very comfortable. Staff all delightful and friendly. Breakfast outstanding. Used the pool and facilities and all great. Had the most beautiful dinner and a great selection . No complaints and definitely would love to go back.,5,2015,02,12
239,Perfect for a large family,"My family and I rented a house on the Mount Juliet Estate for my Dads 60th birthday, and it was great. 

The houses are fully kitted with a modern kitchen and 2 cosy lounges to relax in. We stayed in a 4 bedroom house, each with a lovely en suite. The houses are pure perfection for a big gang like ours.

We sampled the archery while there which was wonderful. The instructor was great and we all exceeded our expectations. My nephew enjoyed the swimming pool as a way to keep entertained.

Lots to do and see and a great chance to relax. Lots of dining options available too.",4,2015,02,06
239,Xmas stay at Mount Juliet,"My partner and I spent the Xmas period at Mount Juliet again this year, and the accommodation and standard of service remained of the highest quality.    There is so much to do around the estate.    I visited the spa again on this visit and the spa treatments were excellent and the staff are always friendly and helpful.    The food and the atmosphere in the Lady Helen restaurant is excellent,  there are other places to eat such as a snack in the Bar in Mount Juliet house or in Kendals restaurant at the Hunters Yard which is only a short walk away from the main house.   It is also possible to eat in the Presidents Bar at the Hunters Yard.  In our experience we had great food and wine in all of the options, and the service was also very good.

We had some great walks around the estate.   The whole trip was very enjoyable and relaxing.   A very enjoyable Xmas!",5,2015,01,17
239,Pre Christmas treat,"We went to mount juliet to visit Santa and the Santa train.  It was a wonderful weekend with excellent ambiance, staff and food.  The family rooms are ample in size and very well furnished.  I am looking forward to our next trip.  ",5,2015,01,12
239,Wonderful food...service could be sharper.,"We enjoyed a wonderful two night break here, our third visit. 
The 1500 acre estate has great walks for all legs.its a spa hotel but we have never used it. We prefer the walks.
We got into our superior room about 3.40. Rooms seem to be cleaned late as on our second day our room hadn't been cleaned by 3.30. Room is spacious well provided bathroom. However along with the kettle there is tea and ..instant coffee! We recently stayed in a city Center hotel in Nottingham and each room had an Expresso coffee machine. You would think that in a hotel like this each room would have a coffee machine.
Breakfast is individually cooked. My wife asked for medium fried eggs but they were dry and hard. Likewise my poached eggs on EggsBenedict were hard. We were told the chef would be informed.
The breakfast was disappointing ; limited fresh fruit, little by way of Danish pastries. Could do better here.
Our evening meal at The Lady Helen Michelin Starred Restaurant was superb. The food was outstanding. Starters we had were veal sweetbreads and quail. It's the depth of the flavours and the way each item of food works together. The menu is clever, fresh and delicious. There is plenty of good food around but here the food is a cut above most other restaurants in Ireland ...that's why they have a Star! Mains. Rabbit and Langoustine , venison. Sensational. My wife had the cheese but I had an apple with, custard, ice cream. It's along time since I enjoyed a desert like this one.
While the food is really fantastic the experience was wanting. Having been to a dozen or more Michelin Starred Retaurents food is primary but what takes it to another level is the experience. At Ramseys 3 Stars the food is wonderful but so is the attention. It's incredible without being intrusive. I felt The Lady Helen lacked leadership. Where was the Maitre'd? The staff are  nice and friendly but no one seems to be in charge. At the start we had a glass of water each, no one filled them once during our two hour meal. At any and I mean any Restaurent in the States they are continually filling your glass with fresh water.  We had to ask for more bread twice before it came. We had our tea and coffee but had to ask after 10 minutes for the petite fours. Finally they came.
It might be because of the two adjoining rooms but it felt like a market as the staff rushed and hurried through from one to the other. As we were sitting at the door...
The food is first class but the service and overall experience is sub standard. It needs leadership with someone floating around looking after the customers needs. 
We had a great stay and loved our meal but the ""experience "" was disappointing.",4,2015,01,06
239,Great accommodation - but not pleased with restaurants,"We stayed for a few days at Mount Juliet, and found the town house to be excellent. It was clean and well outfitted with comfortable beds and living quarters. 

Since we were only there for a short break, we did not bring much in the way of groceries, and planned to rely on the restaurants located at Mount Juliet. We were disappointed, to say the least, with the quality of food at the golf course restaurants. The breakfast offered in the main hotel was not at all impressive, and was extremely overpriced. 

Our other issue with Mount Juliet are the restricted recreation hours for children. When we visited the weather was not fantastic, and the only activities that could be enjoyed were indoor activities. Unfortunately, the pool is not open to children all day, as it is for adult guests. While we understand that this allows adult guests to enjoy themselves without children nearby, it seems a bit ridiculous to enforce when there are no other guests present and it's pouring rain.

Having said all of this, we would stay here again if we were staying for a longer period of time and could prepare more of our own meals. We would also hope to time it better with the weather, so that outdoor activities could be enjoyed.   

The estate itself is simply beautiful and entirely peaceful.",4,2015,01,05
239,Christmas Village experience not worth it all!,"We first  heard of the ""amazing Christmas Village"" in September when my wife and I spent a weekend at Mount Juliet for our wedding anniversary. We were told by several members of the hotel staff that the Christmas Village was magical with fabulous elves, reindeers, baking with Mrs Claus, a fabulous train ride through the estate for a brilliant Santa experience for children. We decided to book it there and then for 20 December so that we could surprise our son (8 yrs old) and start our family Christmas holidays with a special and magical over night stay at Mount Juliet. 

We arrived at Mount Juliet and we were welcomed by the staff and much excitement was in the air as we were shown to our room. We had a lovely room and our son was delighted with his bed and the loveliness of the room. We had a few hours before our allotted Santa experience so we enjoyed the house and the very hospitable staff. We then went over to the Christmas Market which was lovely with great market stalls and lovely vendors which we really enjoyed.

When our time for the Santa experience came (it was evening time by then) we all went to the ""train station"" near the Christmas Market along with all the other parents and children (around 40 people in total by my estimate). We were really shocked. The place was dirty and looked like it had not been cleaned/tidied up all day. It was heavily littered with empty coffee and tea cups, loads of water cups/bottles,  food containers all over the tables and the  bins were overflowing. There was even a discarded nappy bag on the floor which really grossed me out. My feet were sticking to the floor because it was so untidy. The chairs were tossed about the room which gave the place a really unsettling air. Given that this was where our ""magical"" experience was meant to begin we were shocked and disappointed to say the least. 

The waiting area also only had 1 elf who was supposed to be giving the children their ""elf"" names. There was no music or Christmas atmosphere at all and the one elf was working on her own so the children who weren't getting their elf names were bored and there was nothing for them to do or see while in this "" North Pole Train Station"". After about a 10 minute wait all of the folks/kids booked for the ""train"" were hearded into Mrs Claus' ""kitchen"" where it way Mrs Claus and another lone elf. A cringe-worthy skit between the lone elf and Mrs Claus began which was so long and non-interactive that most of the kids and adults were bored and wanted to leave from the hot and airless room for the train. After this 15 to 20 minuted skit we were again hearded to the Elf Training College where we were greeted by 2 elves who were trying to be entertaining and engaging at least. After about 10 minutes at the Elf Training College we boarded the train for our trip through the ""magical forest"" to Santa's grotto. The train was full and the train conductor was funny and interactive with the children and parents. The tour itself however was farcical. We passed a shed with a sign that said Donner and Blitzen where the children were told that the reindeer had ""escaped"" and the kids should ""try to fnd them"". In other words no reindeer for the kids to see at all. We then passed a wooden ""wall"" painted like Santa's Workshop with no lights or anything. Again the train conductor gave a flimsy excuse about not being able to look inside etc. When we finally got to Santa's Grotto (which was right next to where we started at the dirty ""train station"") we were treated by another lone elf. This elf decided to just throw fake snow at the kids who were waiting to be called into Santa. We were one of the last ones to see Santa so we got to sit in the ""waiting room"" with this one elf throwing fake snow at the kids and doing nothing more imaginative or fun than that. Again there was no music or anything to entertain the children waiting to see Santa. Much of the snowflake was being gathered from the floor by the way, which was dirty at this stage following a long days use.  When we got to see Santa it was fine but by no means ""brilliant"" or ""magical"". The elf who was helping Santa did read all the details we gave them regarding the naughty/nice details. A few pictures were taken of our son and the family and the whole ""Santa"" time was less than 5 minutes if that. We were them asked to leave and sent to the picture stall where we had to pay €10 for 1 picture. The entire experience was the bones of one hour (a lot of it spent waiting). 

Needless to say we were really disappointed and we don't recommend it. The main house/hotel is wonderful and has a great team but this 'magical' Santa visit was far from magical and indeed was a major disappointment. Would not recommend it.",3,2015,01,04
239,Best yet,"Had xmas dinner there ,it's our 3rd year but this was the best yet,I could not find one fault with anything or anyone ,The service the food the setting it was all top class ,I was a bit worried about the early sitting but they put no pressure on us at all ,It was a lovely day Well done.",5,2014,12,27
239,Fantastic location and accommodation-pity about the dinner experience,"We went to the santa experience in mount Juliet for the 3rd year running. We stayed in the house this year, and would recommend the rose cottages instead for a family. The santa train was well run as usual and the children enjoyed it. The Christmas market was much smaller this year so a bit disappointing.  The biggest problem was with dinner. For the second year running they were unable to cater adequately for my son who is coeliac-despite emails and phone calls notifying them of the fact he is coeliac in advance. He ended up having cheese and bread, as he was not keen on the only option available-Cajun chicken (he is 6, and not into spicy food at all).  Last year we put the lack of gluten free food down to bad luck (even though I had notified them then too) however when it happened again this year I was really frustrated.  We spoke to the manager the following day, who could not have been nicer and apologised profusely......but that is exactly what happened last year.  I would really debate going back next year. On the one hand the experience of the Santa train is magical and the rose cottages are really lovely and comfortable, but on the other hand I cannot understand how a hotel of this calibre cannot cater for a coeliac child.",3,2014,12,26
239,Beautiful Estate,We spent two nights here just prior to christmas. We stayed in the Rose Garden Lodge and loved it. Our room was spacious and nicely appointed. We loved the Christmas tree - would highly recommend this accomodation especially for a family.,5,2014,12,23
239,Fantastic Getaway,"Mount Juliet is a perfect overnight escape only 90 minutes outside of Dublin. The service was fantastic, the food was fab and the golf course is in amazing shape, especially considering it's mid-December. We didn't get a chance to try out the spa or the fishing but are eager to return in the Spring. It was a Really pleasant evening away.  The only thing to note is that there are a lot of kids around due to the Christmas Market being on.",5,2014,12,14
239,"Christmas Village, Santa Train and Weekend Break","I'm just back from a great weekend at Mount Juliet. Myself and my wife went with our 15 month old. The Hotel staff were warm and friendly and made every effort to make our stay hassle free.

Eating
We ate in the Michelin star restaurant on Friday night which I'd recommend. I like my food but often find Michelin star food too rich, not the case here. Very enjoyable and relaxed dining experience. (Hotel organised a great babysitter for us)

Breakfasts were perfect, and once again the staff were very helpful with high chairs etc. I had boxty with fried eggs from the kitchen each morning and added bacon and sausages from the buffet. Often hot breakfasts in hotels are greasy but these were cooked and presented with care. Freshly squeezed OJ each morning was a nice start to the day.

We ate in the club house one evening, standard golf club fare, cheap and cheerful.

Room
We stayed in a room in the courtyard. It was a great size with a comfy bed. TV had Sky Sports which was a great distraction during baby nap times. We were a little concerned about noise from the Xmas market outside but it wasn't a problem. We were in room 89.

Christmas Market and Santa Train
The hotel was full with families visiting Santa. The train experience was magical and all credit to the hotel for running a very special experience for children and adults alike. One particular note of credit about the quality of gifts that Santa gave, well worth the extra cost.

I will definitely be returning again next year for another Christmas get away.",4,2014,12,07
239,Faultless !!!,"10 of us Just back from an amazing weekend in MountJuliet, Christmas decorations were up and you couldn't wish to be in a nicer place.
Everything was flawless , food was super in all restaurants, in the club house , presidents bar, and St. Helens.
Every member of the staff were so genuinely friendly it made leaving very hard,it wouldn't be fair to single out anyone , so we'll done all of you....
Golf course was in great condition also
Looking forward to next visit already...😀

239,Great Hotel !,"Stayed here for 2 nights, from start to finish a great experiance. Very relaxing, lovely rooms and the food is great. The lady helena restaurant was amazing, the best michelin star restaurant i have eaten in. But the real stars of the show are the staff! So friendly, they make you feel right at home. I will definetly be back soon ",5,2014,11,25
239,Relaxing Heaven,"Booked this hotel for a couples weekend. From the moment you drive through the entrance you know it's going to be a lovely setting. The house itself is nestled in woodland and on a golf course but luckily and no offense to golf resorts but you did not have any golfers in the main house. The golf club was separate so there was no ""pint drinking"" and caddy cars to be seen near the hotel! 
The rooms were exquisite, old worldly but extremely clean and we'll maintained. The staff were excellent and so accommodating and made you feel right at home. 
We ate in lady Helen, recommend it...for what you get its very worth every penny! Lovely selection of wines and a relaxing night then by the fire. Take a bike to cycle around the grounds! What better way to spend a nice weekend. 
Must say a massive thanks to Eileen at the front desk,  do pleasant and helpful and Peter from the restaurant served me probably the nicest lamb dish I've eaten.

Thanks for a special weekend",5,2014,11,20
239,Happiest Memories,"We picked Mount Juliet for our wedding last April. We wanted somewhere private in the countryside.The initial planning stages were all dealt with superbly by Lil the wedding organiser. We couldn't wait to share this special place with our wedding guests. The driveway through the grounds is beautiful, you really feel like you are getting away from the everyday. The hotel itself is lovely inside, the decor is luxurious, the chairs and couches are inviting and comfortable. The atmosphere is different to a normal hotel, it feels like a home, especially with the warm welcome from Des the host. The most special touch for the wedding was our cake, the staff had it set up in the dining room  on a beautiful display. The dinner in Lady Helen was such a special treat. The staff were attentive and friendly to all of our guests. We stayed in the Suite for the night and I have never stayed in a more amazing room. The view from the window alone, of the river and the horses is worth it. The four poster bed was so comfortable. The bathroom was huge with a really nice shower. The whole day felt like we were the only guests at the hotel, it was so private and quiet. This is the perfect place for a private wedding. I would like to thank all of the staff, who work so hard, they made our wedding day so special, and helped in every way they could, especially to Brid and Lil.",5,2014,11,18
239,Quintessential Ireland,"Solid stay all around, a special thanks to Des & Lil for making our stay truly special. Beautiful grounds, the perfect place stop and smell the roses. 

One point that I will add is that the house has excellent free wifi for all guests. We were getting 13mbps down and 7mbps up, best wifi connection we had on our whole trip.",5,2014,11,15
239,Nice hotel but overpriced,"Stayed midweek in a ""superior"" room, very nice hotel on beautiful grounds. Room was well appointed and clean but small by today's standards.
On the first evening ate at the Presidents bar, very expensive for what is shopping mall restaurant food rather than fine dining, waited for twenty minutes for someone to take a dessert order, eventually paid and left without dessert.
On the second evening we ate in the Lady Helen restaurant, very nice starter well presented. Main course of turbot was small and tired to say the least, not exactly inspiring. Dessert was very nice and again well presented, however bottled water at five euro and fifteen cents is quite frankly a rip off! Staff were pleasant and helpful generally but I feel this hotel is living on a reputation that it does not live up to.
I could only recommend this hotel if the prices were reduced by at least fifty percent.",2,2014,11,06
239,disappointing,"We recently spent a long weekend in Mount Juliet with our children and extended family. The grounds are beautiful, my husband was impressed with the golf course, however, it is not a friendly destination for children.  

I found the staff quite unhelpful.  While dining in Kendals we asked for some bread (we could see baskets of bread on the service table behind us).  However, the waiter refused and told us he could not bring bread until after he had taken the order.  We were a party of 10 people so it took some time to order.  Luckily I had some yoghurts in my bag and could feed my 18 month old but I feel it shouldn't have been such an issue to bring bread to the table.  

We also ate in the Lady Helen, we were all disappointed with the meal.  It was bland and for a Michelin star restaurant we expected a higher standard.  

On our final day we went to the swimming pool but I would not bring the children in as they are not allowed at certain times during the day.  The pool was empty, there was no one in the pool but we had to leave with 2 disappointed children.  There is a small playground but no other facilities for children so we ended up going back to our lodge.

Mount Juliet is suited to older golfing enthusiasts.  I was very glad to get home.",3,2014,11,04
239,Absolute Luxury,"My friend and I stayed in Mount Juliet for one night in August.  

I had heard rave reports about it and really wanted to experience it for myself. All I can say is that from the moment I arrived until I left I was really blown away by all aspects of Mount Juliet and it's surrounding estate.

It is a manor house with the presence of grandeur from the moment you enter.  It is furnished beautifully throughout in keeping with it's period.  The bedroom was amazing with a magnificent bathroom located in the main house with a river view.

We enjoyed a pre-dinner drink in the bar before dining in the Lady Helen Restaurant which we are still talking about!  As someone who loves to cook I was really enthralled by the creativity and imagination of the menu which made it really difficult to choose each course as I wanted to try a bit of everything.  

We had a very early breakfast the next day as unfortunately we both had to go to work and return to the real world.  Again another wonderful dining experience....I had the best scrambled egg ever with smoked salmon, raspberries, yogurt and honey, delicious coffee and some freshly baked brown bread but the choice went far beyond that.

We could not have asked for more....except a longer stay!! Really looking forward to making a return trip in 2015.",5,2014,11,03
239,Doesn't Get Better,"This was our favorite stay on our two week tour of Ireland. The estate is in a beautiful setting and the rooms are both spacious and luxurious. There are many activities available to the traveler from riding, falconry, golfing, shooting to fly fishing. The gardens and landscaping surrounding the estate are beautiful and one of our favorite treats was walking the grounds in the early morning. We've stayed in a variety of 5 star hotels throughout the world and this stood out among my favorites. The staff was very helpful and professional. Couldn't have asked for a better two night stay.",5,2014,11,02
239,Gorgeous friendly country hotel with something for everyone ,"Beautiful country estate with great range of facilities and an amazing two Michelin star restaurant. Archery, fishing, riding golf, swimming spa and very lovely staff. Not cheap but very good value. JERPOINT glass also worth a. Visit ",5,2014,11,01
239,Beautiful romantic stay at Mount Juliet,"We've just returned from a two night stay at Mount Juliet and have come home rested and happy.

We had a rare two nights away from our busy family life so were v excited about coming to Mount Juliet.

We stayed in the Earl of Carrick room in the main house which is a beautifully decorated bedroom overlooking the river. I can't praise the room more highly, decor was gorgeous and the views from the windows were so beautiful. We woke each morning to the sounds of birds and soft neighing of horses. 

Afternoon tea in the drawing room was fantastic. A beautiful selection of sandwiches and bite sized cakes.

We had the 7 course tasting menu in the Lady Helen restaurant. It was excellent but while the restaurant has a one star Michelin rating, I wish there was a 5 star rating for service. I want to particularly mention Maurice in the Lady Helen restaurant who was exceptionally informative and helpful. We've eaten in Michelin star restaurants before and often the service is stuffy and overly formal. Maurice was the exact opposite and really added to the experience. Really, we can't thank him enough for making our night so special. 

The landscape around Mount Juliet is stunning, woodland, hills and the beautiful Nore. It really is gorgeous. We went for many walks enjoying the views.

If you want a special romantic few nights away, I would highly recommend Mount Juliet.

Thank you to all the lovely staff there.

A",5,2014,10,29
239,Amazing landscape,The building and the gardens are incredible beautiful.  The rooms are also nice but they could be a little bit better for the price.  Despite all that we had a great time.  I would strongly recommend if you are passing by the Kilkenny area.,4,2014,10,28
239,Beautiful Country House,"Booked, via hotel website, two nights as a treat in Mount Juliet. We decided to make the most of it and avail of what they had on offer. Clay pigeon shooting, the instructor was just fantastic, I had never shot a gun so was a bit nervous but he put me totally at ease explaining every part. Who knew Id be so good at it. Afternoon tea was delicious, served overlooking the river in the front room. I could of sat there for hours daydreaming. Dinner in Lady Helens the Michelin star restaurant, luckily we booked in advance as it was busy. We enjoyed it but preferred dinner the next night at the Golf Club, I couldn't fault the food or service maybe we just have simpler tastes. Went for a spa treatment the next day, the treatment itself was OK but I didn't like the changing rooms on the next level, I felt a bit uncomfortable wandering around in a robe and slippers outside the spa. Also some alarm kept going off while relaxing afterwards which made me leave early. 
We went for a few walks around the estate and it was so peaceful and nice, the grounds are so well kept. Dessie who drove us to the clay pigeon shooting is a wonderful asset to the place, he was a wealth of information very engaging and made us feel totally at ease.
Booked a delux room in the main house and was looking forward to the wonderful views, while our room was beautiful it overlooked the car park and as there was a wedding on there seamed to be a steady stream of people in and out. Not what I had expected from a delux room. I received a phone call a few days before we arrived to advise that there were weddings taking place on both days of out stay, I though maybe this could of been communicated at the time of booking, a few weeks earlier, so I was a bit disappointed as we could of easily changed our dates.",4,2014,10,28
239,Worth Every Penny,"never fail to be disappointed, a must for the golf fanatic who likes the added luxury. Don't be put off by the price of The Lady Helen restaurant as this is an experience of a lifetime. Just hope the new owners don't try to change it too much",5,2014,10,24
239,Best of the Best,"My husband and I spent several days at Mount Juliet Estate as part of a two week holiday touring southern Ireland. We both agreed that our time at the manor was very special in so many ways. We stayed at the manor and had a gorgeous room overlooking the horse pastures and river. It was named Kendal Grove and it was lovely.  We ate at the manor dining room and at the clubhouse ,both were excellent.  What made our stay so extra special was the  thoughtfulness of the staff. We especially were grateful for Eds help when we had  issue  with one of our credit cards. We were not sure how to rectify the issue with our credit card company seeing as we were not carrying a cellphone. Ed overheard our conversation and offered suggestions and advice. He even produced his own phone and made calls on our behalf to our credit card company. In short order our issue was resolved. Thank you Ed!  We hope to visit Mount Juliet Estate again one day.",5,2014,10,21
239,Excellent.,"We stayed in Mount Juliet last week and it was wonderful. We stayed in the Earl of Carrick room, room 19 overlooking the river. Stunning room, huge and very beautifully furnished. The bathroom was elegant and modern but we found the floor to be extremely slippy when wet so be careful.The bed was enormous and hugely comfortable. The staff we met thru out our stay were friendly and professional.

There were a few things we felt could be done better. (We travel a huge amount so this is in comparison to other hotels). The bar area was very nice and we ordered some drinks. We had to ask if there were any nuts or snacks, indeed there were and we were then given some but they were not replenished despite us ordering another round of drinks.

A group of american guests asked if there were playing cards available and there were none. This should be rectified….

There are fabulous fireplaces in the Manor House so why are they not lit ? Not one fireplace had a fire lighting, instead the heating was going full belt and it was really very hot. We opened our windows in our room and left them open overnight and it was still warm !….

The grounds are stunning and the walks we took were lovely. The pool area was very nice and I hear that they are going to extend and refurbish it…which is a good idea as its quite small and I would imagine if there were children in it it could be very noisy and busy. It was perfect the day we were there.

I have written a separate review of the stunning Lady Helen restaurant.

All in all we loved our stay and would definitely go back.",5,2014,10,20
239,"Great Stay in Mount Juliet, Great Staff at Mount Juliet","As someone that is well accustomed to staying in luxurious hotels, I have high expectations.  Our stay in Mount Juliet (main house) was just fabulous.    There were two staff members in particular that deserve a special call out.  Maurice and Anne Marie .  Maurice was part of a team that ensured our experience in the Lady Helen Restaurant was thoroughly enjoyable.  In addition, he looked after us in the bar helping us choose a nice whiskey's, he definitely went above and beyond his role in the way he looked after us.  His passion and energy for Mount Juliet was inspiring.    

Annmarie the breakfast supervisor was also very kind to us.  Each morning she had a cheery and welcoming demeanour which ensured our morning got off to a great start.  I cannot thank them both enough for the superb customer service care they provided us.  The commitment to their work that the team at Mount Juliet had made a hugely positive difference to our stay.  We will absolutely be going back to stay in Mount Juliet, thanks everyone.",5,2014,10,13
239,Fab golfing trip,"Lovely estate, 4 of us stayed for 2 nights and had 2 rounds of golf at end of this week. The hotel and buildings all have a bit of character about them..def a great spot even for romantic break with the spa and leisure facilities plus miles of areas for walks! For those who wish to play golf, great course and in superb condition for October! All the staff couldnt b more helpfell. Hope to get back down again for another stay",5,2014,10,12
239,Just fabulous! Faultless!,"We stayed here for just one night (and would have loved to have stayed longer!) The main hotel building is just beautiful and you feel as if you are staying in a stately home. We had booked a superior room, but were given a complimentary upgrade to a superior river view room, which has to be one of the loveliest rooms we have ever stayed in.  With three windows looking out over the river and the stud farm, and with beautiful furnishings it was stunning. The staff welcomed us like old friends, and Jacob, who showed us our room and drove us up to the restaurant in the evening was a star, and obviously very proud of the hotel.  He spent some time with us chatting about the history of the house.  The Lady Helen Restaurant in the main house was closed the night we were there so we ate in Kendals Restaurant which is about 200 yards away at the Golf Club. As it was pouring down we were driven to and from the restaurant.  The food was excellent and we had a delicious meal. Again all the staff were lovely and service was great.  Breakfast in the Lady Helen Restaurant was also excellent, and such a beautiful room.  There are some lovely walks around the estate, with limited time we only did one of the shorter ones across the river and around the stud farm, but absolutely stunning on a sunny autumn morning!  The only slight downside that we didn't really have time to use the pool, which looked very inviting.  We will return, hopefully for longer next time. Perfect place to relax.",5,2014,10,11
239,"Very good, but not great...","Overall I have to rate this experience as very good.  The golf course is beautiful and the golf pro (Shawn) was great.  The estate is absolutely beautiful.  I recommend booking a tour if you can.  The hotel is a beautiful old manor that is a great idea for a hotel.  However, they need to fix a few things like cleaning the grout in the shower in room six.  Some of it is white and some of it is black.  Also, the chair and couch in room six is so stained and worn that we refused to sit in it.  Some of the wallpaper in the hall is coming loose from the wall.  I understand these are very minor cosmetic issues that I am sure will be taken care of.  I have to say that every meal I ate here was superb.  I would have given it four stars instead of three, but they have a sign as you enter the main gate that reads, "" No dogs allowed.""",3,2014,10,08
239,Irish Perfection,"My husband and I had been told about how lovely it was to stay at Mt. Juliet from friends who are very well traveled and like us love to ride. This resort is the perfect place to relax and enjoy the beautiful surroundings. We stayed in the main house which gives one the sense of being a guest at a country estate. Mt. Juliet itself goes back to the time of the Normans and had been privately owned until 1987. The new owners/management have maintained the feel of a stately home but have incorporated the outstanding service and amenities of a luxury hotel!! Our room The Kendall Grove may be one of the loveliest hotel rooms we've ever had.  The view from our windows was overlooking The Noor River and The Bally Lynch Stud Farm, one of the premier race horse farms in Ireland. 
Breakfast is served in two different beautifully deccorated dining rooms. There are three different restaurants to meet one's dining needs. I was there to be able to ride everyday. The riding program is outstanding,with great hacking out cross country and lessons if one so desires. The riding staff is knowlegeable and great company!! We had a tour of the estate with ""Des""(hope I'm spelling this correctly) who is a living historian for the estate and the region. Because he knew I was very interested in Thoroughbred blood stock he arranged for us to visit  the stud farm where we got to see the famous stallions and the mares with their foals.  A wonderful experience!! We are not golfers but I can certainly see the lure of the sport. The golf course was just beautiful. Mt. Juliet is only about an hour and a half rom Dublin(based on the traffic).A glorious place;we will be returning.",5,2014,10,08
239,golfers paradise,"Stayed recently for 2 night's , what a brilliant resort , played golf both days , and enjoyed dinner in both the club house and in the main house , it realy is one of the top places in ireland to get a little break away even if you don t play golf , a little pricey but well worth it,
Well done to both staff and management,  ",5,2014,10,07
239,Great experience,"We spent two nights at the Mount Juliet recently, and loved it.  Fortunate to be in the Presidential suite, we did not make use of all the room we had!!!!!  But the accommodations were clean and well kept.  Not really our style, but nonetheless we realize most places in this area are all the same vintage.  We loved the views out all sides of our suite -- the horses grazing across the river, and the views out front.  We had a delightful afternoon in the sun with our scones and tea on a surprisingly warm September afternoon.  Laura at the front desk was incredible... helping us with so many accommodations, and Ed in the bar was a riot!  Laura even let us follow her back into town one evening so she could help us find our restaurant.  Great service... and they explained hurling to us, as we had never heard of this sport before.    Good value as well.... We passed on eating at the Lady Helen (aghast!!!) but we were so tired of fine dining.... We did get to Campagne which is 1 Michelin star as well, and it was more casual and delicious!",4,2014,09,29
239,Lovely stay,Stayed here recently with my husband and it was a truly wonderful experience. We stayed in a suite in the main house which was simply gorgeous. The decor was beautiful and the bed was incredibly comfortable. We ate in Kendals. The food was delicious and the service was friendly. Breakfast in the morning is plentiful and fresh. Walking around the grounds and using the pool facilities was a lovely way to while away the following day. I would definitely love to return again soon. Thanks for a lovely weekend.,5,2014,09,26
239,Expensive - but worth it,"We availed of the 'play and stay' break which included Bed, breakfast, dinner in Kendels restaurant and a round of golf. The accommodation was not in the main hotel but in the courtyard rooms which are good but not luxurious. We were disapointed that we were unable to eat in the Michelin starred 'Lady Helen' as there is a 3 - 4 week waiting list. However the food in Kendels restaurant was excellent with friendly attentive service. Breakfast is served in the main hotel so we got to experience the quiet elegance of this beautiful building if only for a short time. The golf course lives up to its billing as one of the great courses in Ireland and is a real test but not for the faint hearted. Its a long course so consider taking a buggy. Only one critisism - there is very inadequate signage on the course so it was sometimes difficult to work out where the next tee box was! Lunch in the Presidents Bar rounded off a great day. At a cost of €389 for 2 before any extras such as lunch and wine at dinner it is expensive but a real treat. Next time we come back we hope to experience the tasting menu in the Lady Helen and maybe stay in the main house. Started saving already!!!",5,2014,09,24
239,A little piece of heaven,"I have stayed at Mount Juliet four times over the past 20 years.
During my recent visit, I was disappointed at the poor quality of the golf shop.
I have seen better merchandise at municipal courses and there was very litttle staffing.

The main house is wonderful, but once again poorly staffed.
No one ever in the bar to serve, the alternate restaurant is too loud, too bright and is not open every night.

The golf course is great but there are very few rakes so many of the bunkers have foot marks all through them.
The stables are is a second thought. The grounds around them are terrible. The changing rooms are a mess and there is almost no help.
The fly fishing room has very little gear and the gillie is not especially helpful unless you hire him.

Lots of room to improve and regain what has been lost here through the years.
Wifi access is a joke.
A pity really.",4,2014,09,23
239,Great golf course,"The course was in as great condition as I have ever seen it,played as part of a society and everyone of us sang it praises.its a real pleasure to play there and something all golfers should experience. Keep up the good work.",5,2014,09,22
239,Mount Juliet -a very special place.,"Four of us stayed in Mount Juliet for two nights last week and it was a most enjoyable experience.We were made to feel most welcome there and and all members of staff we met were really friendly.We had dinner in The Lady Helen-the Michelin star restaurant and that was wonderful.I had always thought of Mount Juliet as being a ""golf Hotel"" but I was wrong.There are many activities for non golfers as well.The walks around the estate are beautiful and very well signposted,Just outside the front door there was a selection of bicycles free for the use of guests.This is the first Irish Hotel I have visited that provided bicycles and was most welcomed.We also had a meal in Kendall's restaurant and lunches overlooking the golf course at the President's bar-all very enjoyable.We left Mount Juliet feeling happy and satisfied.It is a beautiful place but overall I think it is the welcome and the friendliness of the staff that make it a very special place to visit,",5,2014,09,20
239,Should have stayed longer,"We took a side trip to Mount Juliet while visiting Dublin on a group trip. We took the train to Thomastown, about a two hour trip through the countryside. We were met at the train station by Desmond, a delightful Irish gentlemen and the overnight trip only got better from there. Magnificent grounds, outstanding accommodations, very agreeable staff, stunning golf, and excellent food.  My one complaint is with myself.i should have booked a longer stay.  We missed the 18 hole mini course, trout fishing, clay shooting, and horseback riding.  I will find my way back.  ",5,2014,09,20
239,Beautiful Location,The Manor House and grounds are breathtaking. We were traveling with our daughter and son-in-law. We had a reservation for 2 rooms in the Clubhouse but we're upgraded to one of the cottages. It was so quaint and at the same time updated. Bathrooms and kitchen were very modern and comfortable....even had a gas fireplace in the living room. We went skeet shooting (Shane was the best teacher!) and horseback riding. Des was very friendly and informative. We had dinner in the dining room...a gastronomic experience...great spot for foodies. It's about a $30 cab ride into Kilkenny...don't mill Matt the Millers...great food and music!!!!,5,2014,09,16
239,Pure Luxury,"We stayed here for one night in August. It was very luxurious. Our room was very pretty although the picture shown when we booked looked much bigger. We stayed just one day but packed a lot of activity in. I went for a trek in the equestrian center followed by lunch in the golf club. The trek brought us around the grounds of the estate which is vast with the best of countryside to soak up. All the horses in the stable looked excellent quality and Chad and I got on very well! Every riding level can be catered for from little to large and beginner to experienced. Lunch in the golf clubhouse was reasonably priced and filling. The service was very good. We then used the swimming pool for an hour before having afternoon tea in the house. This was pure relaxation - just bliss. After showers and a snooze in our room we then had a cocktail in the bar before having a 8-course taster menu in the Lady Helen Restaurant. This meal was one of the best I have ever had - ever. The food was first class as was the service. The next morning we had breakfast in the house which again was excellent and a walk around the estate in the sunshine before checking out at 12. I would love to do this every summer!! While there we felt a very warm family feel. Lots of kids cycling on bikes or heading our golfing. The estate is so safe to walk/cycle around as all the little roads are small and the cars drive slowly. The estate have holidays houses on site which you can rent, I think this would be a great option for families who want to stay for a week or more, they would have plenty to do but it is more economical than the main house.",5,2014,09,12
239,What a Place,"We had traveled many miles around Ireland before arriving at Mount Juliet.  My biggest regret is we were only able to stay one night.  It now becomes our next bucket list destination to spend at least a week.  The hotel is in the country, situated adjacent to a world glass golf club.  The views from our window was of pasture land, cows and horses grazing..what a spot.
The service was outstanding from everyone we encountered and food was very good.
Plan your trip to spend time at the great place.",5,2014,09,11
239,Absolutely amazing wedding day,"We chose Mount Juliet as the venue for our wedding in August and are so glad that we did. The day was faultless. Every staff member went above and beyond to help make our day perfect. The food was spectacular, and the accommodation beautiful. We can't recommend this hotel enough. Thank you to all the staff for helping make our day so special. ",5,2014,09,06
239,"Beautiful hotel, relaxed comfortable service, great food","We spent two nights at the hotel in Mid-August with our whole family (brother, sisters, spouses, kids, parents etc.) to celebrate my parents 50th wedding anniversary.  We all stayed in the main manor house rooms which were all beautifully appointed.

This hotel has perfected the art of gracious hospitality.  Service was relaxed and friendly with staff going out of their way to help ensure everyone enjoyed their stay. We stayed in a room with a door out on to a walled garden that was shared by two other rooms and was really quite lovely. Some other family members had rooms with views overlooking the river with horses grazing beyond the river.  The hotel has its own private golf course (which the golfers in our party loved), in addition there is a stud farm, lots of beautiful walks and gardens in the extensive grounds, a little mini-golf area which is lots of fund for the non-golfers, tennis court, archery, bikes etc.  In short there was something for everyone regardless of age.  The restaurant in the manor house has a michelin star and the food is superb.  The reception rooms and bar in the manor house are beautifully decorated with very fine plaster molders on the ceilings etc and great views over the river. We had dinner in the manor house the first night.  Our party had its own dining room but the overall atmosphere throughout the manor house at night was quite glamorous. During the day time, despite the surroundings, the manor house is quite informal with people coming and going in outdoor gear whether to golf, bike, ride or just walk the grounds.  We had dinner the second night in the restaurant up in the clubhouse, which was less formal but very nice.  When we came out from dinner there were a few musicians sitting at a table in the bar playing guitar etc and singing. It was a nice fun atmosphere.  We all ended up in the games room upstairs goofing around.  In short, we had a lovely, relaxed break with great food in a beautiful setting.  The staff are to be complemented on the genuine warm welcome and great service they provide. Kilkenny is only about a 20 minute drive away so there would be lots of site seeing for people who were looking to explore the countryside a bit.  We go to Ireland at least once every year to see family so we will definitely be back.",5,2014,09,05
239,The Perfect Wedding,"I am just back form am family wedding in Mount Juliet and it was truly wonderful. It is a great setting for a wedding, drinks reception in the house followed by the main reception and dancing in the clubhouse. The food was beautiful and the service was impeccable. Perfect location for those who want to golf or go horse riding the next day. They also put on a great barbeque for us the day after the wedding.",5,2014,09,02
239,Idyllic Family Retreat,"Mount Juliet cottages were perfect for our family of 6. We had 2 spacious bedrooms with our special requests for the two small ones executed exactly as requested. We were able to eat casually which is our preference every evening with lovely menu and excellent prompt service. Breakfast in Kendalls was Buffet and so so, choose from the hot options on the menu instead.
Mount Juliet is a beautiful estate with plenty for adults and kids. Would highly recommend.",5,2014,09,01
239,"Low-key luxury, well-equipped","An overnight stay is not long enough to fully assess this luxury golf resort outside Kilkenny but we much enjoyed our brief visit.   

Mount Juliet’s multiple facilities are distributed over a large area and moving between them might be unpleasant in bad weather.  However, our 'clubhouse' room was beside our choice of restaurant - Kendals Brasserie, junior to the Michelin-starred Lady Helen, a five minute walk away in the former manor house.

The general style is contemporary country house elegance, understated and without excess or bling.  Our bottom-of-the-range room was adequately sized and furnished but its shower-only bathroom was rather small.

Dinner in Kendals was a pleasant experience and we thought it good value.  The food was excellent but the cheerful waiters/waitresses were overworked, leading to delays in service.  The clientele was eclectic and the dress style decidedly informal.

Breakfast is a somewhat awkward-to-use but otherwise good and well-stocked buffet.

All the staff we met were professional and pleasant.  WiFi is free throughout the complex and easy to access.

Overall, an enjoyable experience and we would have liked to stay longer.",5,2014,08,29
239,"Excellent service, very special place.","Wow, this place is amazing. Stayed with my mother for one night as a special treat in August and wished we had stayed longer. Lousie in reservations was exceptional and really made our stay so special. Des was fantastic on the history and tour of the property, what a wealth of information he has and thank you Edwyn at the bar for your homemade ginger ale receipe which was enjoyed with brandys in the bar! Dined at Kendalls restaurant which we thoroughly enjoyed and breakfast in the Lady Helen, beautiful spot over looking the river. The hotel staff are amazing, I could not fault them old fashioned good service all round. Our room was big, comfortable and clean and had amazing views over the river and property. There is a wonderful feel about this place and I will definetely return just next time for longer!",5,2014,08,28
239,The Best of the Best,"i've stayed in Mount Juliet Manor house with my husband and also in the cottages with friends and I have to say the standard was amazing the attention to detail all the little touches felt i was being pampered from the minute i arrived until our farewell goodbye.  We ate in the bar, the restaurant and St. Helen's Restaurant and each one was so wonderful from the staff to the food.  We used the leisure centre which was fabulous and the Spa would make me travel from Kerry to Kilkenny just for the treatments alone, I fell asleep so many times on the bed i got embarrassed until i was told it was a complement to them that i was so relaxed.  i could have stayed their all day infact i did one day as i had booked my husband treatments but he decided to go shooting instead so i gladly took his treatments as well as my own. We went shooting and archery together which were brilliant couple activities especially when i won, the horse ridding was excellent as we got to see the stunning grounds where we might not have seen otherwise.  The staff couldn't do enough and the hotel should be very proud of them all.  i would highly recommend this hotel for any occasion.",5,2014,08,28
239,"Comfort, style, atmosphere and beauty","Visited Mount Juliet for first time recently - two nights B & B and one dinner. A sublime experience. The main house is full of atmosphere and so comfortable whether in lounge, bedroom or restaurant. Dinner was really delicious in the hotel restaurant - as was our meal the second night in The President's Bar. Everything so fresh, cooked to perfection and served with attention to detail. Our room was at the top of house, a lovely bay room with four windows. The ceiling was not too high, which resulted in the room being cosy and spacious all at the same time. The bathroom was well appointed - however, at this stage of my life I prefer a separate shower [rather than over bath].

There are spectacular views everywhere, and though busy, the hotel had plenty of nooks and crannies to retire too.

We can't wait to return!",5,2014,08,28
239,new broom,"oh i love mount juliet. played with my 3 buddies today. the new owners have given all the staff a wake up call about working in modern ireland. 14 staff have got the chop. the pro shop was so well stocked. francis was so helpful behind the counter. the locker rooms and showers were the best ever. the corse was in top condition. the burger at half way is great idea. we didn't like the fact that the tees were so far forward. but we loved it anyway. will be back for sure.

239,Luxuriously self indulgent,"on arrival to the hotel we were met at the door by staff, immediately I knew I was in for a special meal and indeed I was taken on a food journey of delight, attention from the waiting staff was splendid. .A basket of beautiful breads arrived all with great taste. We chose a taster menu with 7 courses. The food was amazing, from the scallops to the duck. Food presentation was superb and  divine on taste. On the down side the wine which was very nice but a bit expensive. Its a beautiful  old building full of charm and the staff were excellent. After our meal we had a wonderful walk on the grounds., wonderful experience. I look forward to returning",4,2014,08,24
239,One of the best in Ireland,We have being here twice this year and what a special place it is the food staff hotel and location are superb and offers a real treat congrats to all the staff on there Michelin star thoroughly deserved ! Grounds are amazing to walk or cycle it's one of our favourites in Ireland !!,5,2014,08,18
239,Pretty wonderful,"Stayed at Mount Juliet for two nights in July and found it to be a little oasis. Fabulous grounds, with a long drive in, which is quite magical as you see the horses and river and, eventually, the beautiful manor house. Our room was lovely with very pretty views over the river. A little shabby in the decor, e.g. itchy, wooly armchairs and a lumpy duvet. We loved sitting in the lounge reading our books and had a fabulous afternoon tea on the lawn. Also had some beautiful walks by the river. Our spa treatments were good and my husband loved the golf. There were also excellent quality toiletries in the bathroom. We enjoyed a fabulous, unusual meal in the Lady Helen restaurant. 

Overall, very nearly 5* but just not quite in view of the shabby in places decor and the customer service - we found some members of staff in reception frankly snotty, we booked hot stone massages only to be told they'd forgotten to turn the stones on to heat and we couldn't have the treatments and we were sold a dinner, bed and breakfast package, then were told the only dinner reservation we could have was at 9.45pm. We raised these issues with the manager and he was absolutely excellent and apologetic. Bit disappointed though - at this price you expect something very near to perfection.",4,2014,08,18
239,Disappointment,"This is a beautiful golf course. The service however was not superb . The sink and she shower were both clogged. The light bulb at the desk was burned. I was really hoping to ride horses as they advertise a greta equestrial facility .  The website did not suggest you  needed reservations, there was no link to even send an e mail to inquire.  When we got there, they said they would not be able to rent me a horse because I shoudld have called.  No where in the website or when we made room reservations was it suggested  we neede to reserve a horse via telephone.

239,Country perfection,"First the spot is the definition of pastural. Over a horse stud farm, with cows, thoroughbreds horses, and lush green grass and trees. 
The hotel provides service that is second to none (we stay at Four Seasons, and this place is every bit as service oriented).
From the person who brings our luggage, to the desk, to the bartender - Ben - you have no worries, just relax, watch the cows and enjoy.
Kids- plenty of activities for them  to run around, from horses, to cycling, swimming, and the amazing putting greens. 
If I were to have a few days left in life, I would spend them here.",5,2014,08,13
239,Highly Recommended,"Stayed recently with a group of friends and I can't praise the hotel enough. From the minute we checked in it was paradise. It's such a peaceful estate with gorgeous walks to take around it. Accommodation was lovely and very comfortable. Our stay included spa treatments of which I had a Pre-Natal massage. I can't speak highly enough of my therapist Eadoin(think I have it spelt right). Her professional and friendly manner made me feel so at ease and I left feeling so relaxed and I know baby enjoyed it too. Overall, the spa and pool facilities were good but could do with a bit of a re-vamp. 

Food on the estate is excellent with friendly and competent staff throughout. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and were made feel very special. Will definitely be returning.",5,2014,08,13
239,Pleasant Golfing Weekend ,"Recently stayed at Mt Juliet for a golfing weekend. We had originally booked a lodge but on arriving we were told there had been a booking oversight and a lodge wasn't available so we were given rooms in the golf club suites. The guy that was checking us in didn't really explain why and only offered a token apology. The golf club suites were very nice and in hindsight probably suited us better due to the close proximity to the course. We had food in The Hunters Yard on the Saturday which I was a bit dissapointed with - I ordered the Chicken Caesar Salad which was smothered in dressing so I couldn't taste anything else. The chicken breast was dry and a bit rubbery. I have to say the breakfast was easily the best I've ever had. Overall, a good weekend apart from a the check in and salad. Mt Juliet is a magnificent golf course and estate. Will return!",4,2014,08,12
239,A beautiful classy spot,"Stayed with family for a week in lodge accommodation.
The organisation of our trip and welcome we received was really 5 star.
For kids there are multiple activities to keep all entertained from walks, cycling, tennis, swimming, putting and horse riding. The policy of junior golfers free with an adult after 4 pm is to be applauded, and was a fantastic opportunity to play a truly fine parkland course of international standing.
A special mention to the resident teaching pro Sean Cotter, a great teacher and interesting raconteur.
The only criticism was the slightly disappointing meal in the Kendal restaurant but then it's hard to be critical as I sipped a fine white as the sun set on this heavenly wooded vista.
With weather we enjoyed this week Mount Juliet is a truly magical location and fully deserves a five star billing. Would return in the morning if we could!!
",5,2014,08,09
239,Special afternoon,What a beautiful spot.Everything was to my satisfaction.We had our drinks & snacks in the lounge overlooking the river & the horse & cow fields.Breathe taking.We strolled around the exquisite gardens.,5,2014,08,05
239,Fab place,Just back from a two day golfing break in Mount Juliet. Could not fault it all. Everything was just perfect and the staff were fantastic. You can park the car up for your complete stay and not have to sit back into it till home time .Mount Juliet is one of the most relaxed places I have been to.,5,2014,08,05
239,Lovely surroundings,"We stayed end here for two nights on a golf/spa break with friends. We had a beautiful room overlooking the river.
The golfers enjoyed the course. The buggy hire was €35,club hire,€25.

We ate in the Lady Helen restaurant one night,Kendals the next. We had a table for 8.30 in the Lady Helen as there was a large party in at 6.30. Service was very slow,the main course not coming until after 10pm.

It is about 1 and a half hours drive from Dublin Airport.

The hotel has recently been sold,so who knows what changes there might be!",4,2014,08,03
239,What can I say our third visit Simply The Best Hotel In Ireland.,"Faultless we love it you must stay here its the best.

The staff in mount Juliet are second to none we feel like we are The Lord and Lady of the Manor every time we stay.

So much to occupy all on the estate you never need to leave.",5,2014,08,02
239,Disappointed about the food,"The setting of the Hotel is wonderful, Being a foodie I was left feeling very disappointed with the breakfast quality. Everything seamed to be pulled out of a package and put on the buffet area.  I did expect better from a Irish country estate house. I would nt go back again.",2,2014,08,02
239,Beautiful Irish Manor House and Estate,Enjoyed a splendid degustation menu dinner with matched wines on our first evening. This is a beautifully maintained estate with lovely old Georgian rooms in the main house. Enormous bedroom and bathroom in the main house. Great breakfasts with very attentive and knowledgeable service.  Wonderful Jack Nicklaus designed golf course and the opportunity to walk the grounds surrounding the course.  Superb wedding location. All in all a delightful holiday experience. Thoroughly recommend for a special getaway.,5,2014,07,30
239,2 Night Golfing Break,"Francis House Children's Hospice Charity Golf Event.
2 nights B&B and dinner in the Clubhouse. 2 Rounds of Golf. The whole experience was fabulous.
The Golf course and facilities were excellent.
Food in the Clubhouse good and reasonably priced.
Breakfast served in the Manor House which was a five minute walk away but Staff offered a lift. The walk was exhilarating with super views.",5,2014,07,29
239,Escape Reality,"I have been coming to Mount Juliet at least annually since I was 9 years old, I am now 27! I love this place it is truly fantastic and a wonderful relaxing experience.
I just wanted to give the place a review to show my support
One area they could look at modernising is the health club and pool but it is still great as it is.
",5,2014,07,27
239,Lovely Irish Manor,This manor house was the classic example of what I think of as a true country manor house. The grounds are beautiful with a walled garden & trails. There are many activities to do there. I went to the spa & it was very good. My husband did the skeet shooting & felt the person running it was excellent. There is a golf course & a few different restaurants & bars.,5,2014,07,23
239,Super Experience - Lovely Staff - Hotel needs TLC,"I have read and spoken to many people that have stayed at Mount Juliet over the years and with this in mind we headed for a 2 night B&B and 1 dinner stay in Kilkenny.
The golf was super and the reception by the staff as you would expect at a 5 star resort - A warm Irish welcome.
The Manor House is lovely and the food in the 1 star Michelin restaurant superb.
The hotel and in particular the Club House where we stayed needs some serious TLC.  It feels and looks worn out.  The carpets in the Club House (Presidents Bar) has a sour smell and needs sorting.
Maybe the new owners will give it a good overhaul and bring it back because in its current state it is not 5 star.",4,2014,07,23
239,Mount Juliet what a wonderful venue for a wedding,"Having just returned from my son's wedding at Mount Juliet, I cannot speak highly enough of this amazing place. The grounds are stunning with a river running through. One could spend many hours exploring. The House has beautiful rooms and suites with views over the grounds bringing such an air of peace and splendour. The service was top class and the most accommodating. Staff always on hand to cater for requirements. Food was A1. A magnificent golf course, a beautiful spa and leisure centre. Club house with excellent food. This was an utterly magic place for the wedding with everything running perfectly. Cannot recommend it highly enough.",5,2014,07,22
239,Fantastic birthday break,"We stayed here recently on a two night break which I had booked as a surprise for my boyfriends 40th birthday.
Overall we had a fantastic stay.The mount juliet estate is beautiful, steeped in history and surrounded by rolling breath taking grounds.
We stayed in the beautiful manor house which overlooked the river...magical views!!
The rooms are tastefully decorated with nice little thoughtful touches here and there.
We ate in both kendells and the wonderful Lady Helen restaurant which is more than worthy of its michelin star.The food,staff and service was excellent.All of the staff we  encountered during our stay in Mount juliet were warm,attentive and friendly  without being in anyway obtrusive.
We used the spa and leisure centre which we enjoyed immensely. If we had one tiny critism it would be
 that the leisure and spa areas are a little on the small side and would benefit from being extended and perhaps a thermal suite added.Maybe the new owners will consider adding this.
This review wouldnt be complete without mentioning
 the lovely Des who provided us with transport, tales of history and lots of laughter.He is a wonderful asset to the Mount juliet.
Overall we had a really enjoyable stay and would most definitely return
Many thanks to all at Mount juliet for a very enjoyable break.",5,2014,07,21
239,Best and Worst of It,"It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. We've been in London for 7 days and Ireland for 6 days now. The best meal - Lady Helen's by far. The worst meal - Kendal's, where the rib eye steak, though cooked perfectly, was so tough and ""gristly"" as to be almost impossible to chew. The room (33 in the main building) was beautiful and nicely appointed. It was also hot, with no way to cool it other than opening windows without screens and inviting in various ""critters.""  The ambiance in Kendal's was really very nice. In Lady Helen's, not so - just plain and relatively austere. A flower here or there would have helped immensely. The spa services were excellent. I wish I could say the same for the golf course, but it is long and otherwise relatively ordinary. The greens were blotchy, there has been no attempt to repair divots, the golfers don't make much effort to find and fix ball marks, other than a snack counter on the 10th tee, there are no services on the course (including no water available) and the signage to guide golfers from one green to the next tee are nonexistent. Though I'm glad I played it once, it's not a course I would return to. In all, we enjoyed our two nights at Mount Juliet but can't truly rate it better than ""good.""",3,2014,07,17
239,Great Manor House,"Stayed 2 nights at Mt. Juliet. Room 20 was at the top  of the stairs. You felt as though you were a family guest in the manor. We had a wonderful view of the river, and the horse pasture. The golf course is a Nicklas design, and in excellent conditions. The staff at the pro shop was very helpful and arranged for rental clubs and cart. If you want to stay in an authentic manor house with magnificent grounds, then Mt. Juliet is the place.",5,2014,07,13
239,Almost magically,"I cannot express how truly wonderful this place is. The surrounding scenery as you arrive in is breath taking. The accommodation is impressive and the food delicious.  But what really made our weekend was the staff. They were unbelievably helpful and so friendly. I heard many commenting on it. One member of staff did share that he felt lucky to work in a place such as this and really enjoyed the energy about the place. I know that there are some changes afoot and I sincerely hope that this does not negatively impact this establishment. It's a wonderful retreat..so much so, that on checking out we re booked a break in 4 months time. ",5,2014,07,13
239,Getting it right,"We had brunch here a couple of weeks ago and were unfortunate enough to arrive at the same time as a golf society outing. As a result of the staff being so busy we were ignored and waited almost an hour for service. There were three of us and we were chatting so it wasn't such an awful experience, however we were getting a little peeved by the time we were served. The waiter drew the manager's attention to our experience and before we had time to complain about the delay the  manager apologised and told us that we would not be charged for our food. This I think is top class customer relationship management. Anyone can get things wrong and we were walk ins. It is impressive when an establishment responds so quickly to the needs of customers. I compare this to an experience in a Dublin hotel where I complained about raw chicken and was argued with. Both ends of the spectrum!",4,2014,07,11
239,Wonderful afternoon tea,"Today we enjoyed afternoon tea in glorious sunshine on the lawn in Mount Juliet. The service was friedly, helpful and relaxed. The food was delicious - a savory plate of  smoked salmon on soda bread, ham and mustard triangle,  salad morsels, mini -bagel with tuna. The scones were deliciously crunchy with lemon curd, reaspberry jam and cream. The sweet section was slivers of chocolate cake, fruit cake, lemon cake, coffee eclair, cheesecake and an green almond (maybe pistachio) mousse. One piece of advice - don't eat lunch beforehand! Our tea and coffee pots were refilled.
Afternoon tea costs 17.50euros per person and was well worth it. The grounds were magnificent and a stroll around was essential after gorging on the delicious food. This was my first visit but I hope to return.",5,2014,07,08
239,Fantastic Weekend....Simply Wonderful....,"We have just returned from the most wonderful weekend in Mount Juliet. We hadn't been there before but had heard nothing but good reports - we were not let down. The service, food & laid back atmosphere were all perfect. Peaceful, elegant but not over the top. The estate is just stunning - we had great weather and were able to go for 2 long runs while we were there to take in the beauty of it.
We have stayed in some of Irelands nicest hotels and this is by far at the top of the list!
If you choose to have a break here you won't be disappointed. 
Simply Wonderful.....",5,2014,07,02
239,Pure bliss....,"I have recently returned from a week staying in the clubhouse on the Mount Juliet Estate. I booked through In the Saddle for an equestian riding holiday for 5 nights with 3 hous riding each day.

I travelled alone in the end as my girlfriend wasn't able to join me and I didn't want to miss out, I've never travelled alone before for more than a night and this was the perfect place to have my first solo holiday, I can't wait to return.

I arrived on Sunday afternoon having driven myself from Dublin airport (very easy drive) and proceeded to the main house for check in, I was immediatley blown away by the views as I drove through the estate and the interior of the house was just beautiful it was the perfect mix of being grand and ornate but also comfortable and homely.

The ladies on reception were very friendly and helpful, giving me all the details I needed to set me up for an afternoon exploring. The lovely Jakob then helped me to my room by escorting me to the clubhouse and taking all my bags for me whilst giving me more ideas for my stay including recommending a tour with Des.

My room was a light and airy double, it was cleaned to a very high standard each day, as I was on the ground floor I enjoyed a terrace with table and chairs leading onto a lawn perfect to catch the afternoon sun. The bathroom was lovely, perfectly clean and very new and modern. Bed comfortable and very large with a TV in front of it with a good range of channels.

As my riding didn't start until the next day, I began by unpacking and then following one of the trail walks around the estate. There are a few walks to choose from of varying legnths so there's something for everyone. Being horse mad, I instantly chose the walk which took you through the paddocks and through the Ballylinch Stud, it was a lovely short walk and I was delighted to see all the mares and recent foals in the fields playing, if you stand long enough they'll come and say hi!

Each evening I ate in the Presidents bar, making the most of the sunshine I sat on the terrace and enjoyed the views, all the staff in there were extremely friendly and service was great. Trish especially was very helpful and friendly. The food was fabulous, not too fussy but superbly cooked, I cannot recommend the burger enough I had it two nights in a row!!!

My riding itinery each day was to have a trail ride for two hours at 10am and then a lesson in the afternoon from 2pm-3pm, the equestrian centre is a lovely 5 minute walk from the clubhouse, or you can take a bike from the main house. I was met by the lovely Tara at the stables who signed me in and off we went! 

The rides around the estate are beautiful, if you are an experienced rider you will be able to experience some brilliant long, fast canters, try out the gallops and even pop the cross country fences if you wish. One particularly hot day after XC we took the horses into the river to cool off. All the horses here are loved and well looked after, they enjoy their jobs and are the perfect mix of being honest and steady horses whilst still having a bit of petrol in the tank for those wanting to kick on!

I loved my lessons each afternoon with Tara, I chose to have show jumping each day but had the option of flat lessons or more trail riding too. Tara set up a nice little course for me and each day added in an extra element such as bounces or raised the jumps so I felt I had progressed during the week. Everyone at the stables made me feel very welcome and I was very sad o ay good bye on the thursday afternoon. I rode the two Maggie's each day and wish there was room in my case to take them home!

On the Wednesday Tara organised for Des to pick me up after my riding has finished to take me on the tour of the estate and I'm very grateful she did! Des was so lovely and funny and what he doesn't know about the estate probably isn't worth knowing! We explored the house as I learned more about the history, then enjoyed a drive around the golf course and fishing lakes, followed by a trip to the hunt kennels to check out the hounds and finished at the Ballylinch Stud where I could look around the stables and learn more about the fantastic racehorses that had been bred there.

I also enjoyed the spa and leisure centre in my stay and everyone I came accross was very friendly and willing to help, it was the perfect break away from the hustle and bustle of London and I can't wait for my next opportunity to return.",5,2014,06,24
239,Amazing Breakaway for 2!,"We're just back from a night away in Mount Juliet, and I plan on returning as quickly and frequently as possible. The hotel was beautiful, the grounds are breathtaking, and the service is impeccable.
Genuinely the staff could have been any friendlier / more professional. 
The Lady Helen restaurant (Michelin Star) was magical,  - and I have no problem suggesting it was the best meal of my life to date!",5,2014,06,23
239,Lovely,Not guests at hotel but live nearby. We spent a few lovely hours over afternoon tea today in Mount Juliet. It was peaceful and service was excellent without being intrusive. Lovely food and perfect for 2. Nice walk to walled garden after.,5,2014,06,20
239,"Idyllic, magnificent, bliss","It is difficult to find fault with this marvellous hotel From the moment we arrived we were blown away by the wonderful service from staff. We were shown to a beautiful room overlooking the river and the endless green fields. Even our enormous bathroom overlooked the river. We sat outside the main house and had a glass of wine in the evening sunshine before we went to the Lady Helen restaurant for our 8 course tasting meal. All the staff were very knowledgeable about every aspect of the dinner and Maurice managed the room extremely well. My husband opted for the wine pairings which he found complemented the meal completely. We had a wonderful night sleep, not a sound to be heard except the singing birds in the morning. Once again we took breakfast in the lady Helen. I have eaten breakfast in this room before and I must admit that it is one of the best breakfasts you will get in ireland in my opinion. The only problem with coming to Mount Juliet is that you have to leave!!!",5,2014,06,20
239,The tour continues,"Mt. Juliet House is ths combination of two estates, Ballylinch and Walton's Grove.  The manor house was built in the late 1700's.  It has been updated, modernized and expanded and gives guest a full plate of things to do; fishing, equestrian centre, golf, sporting clays and a leisure center with a large indoor pool.  Three restaurant venues are offered' Kendall's dining room, Lady Helen's dining room and the President's club bar.  The first two are a bit formal while the last is casual.  The rooms are comfortable, clean and the service impecable.  The vistas across the horse farms and gardens are beautiful and relaxing.  A very nice stay and Kilkenny is a short distance away.",5,2014,06,20
239,Beautiful Hotel,"We spent two nights at Mount Juliet during our two week tour around Ireland.  Being able to overnight in a manor house was something uniquely Irish for us and we enjoyed our stay a great deal.  Our room was spacious and nicely furnished with a great view overlooking the river and horse pastures.  We enjoyed our sole evening meal at Lady Helen's restaurant, as well as the Continental Breakfast the hotel offered.  

My partner took advantage of the spa at the hotel and said the staff and service were very good.  We also made use of the gym facilities which, by comparison, were spacious and well-equipped versus other hotels in Ireland.  We also made use of the free bikes the hotel had available which gave us a chance to see more of the property's scenic setting. 

All in all, a great stay.",4,2014,06,17
239,What a place!!,"We decided to go to Ireland and our travel agent booked us this magnificent hotel on our way to Limerick and it was one of the best hotels that we have stayed in.
It is a must to have a GPS to get there if you do not know the place.
Once you get there, you will not believe the size of the estate, it is a must to go and take a long walk to see almost everything.
The hotel is a beauty, every room is different in size, furniture, view, charm but they are all magnificent.
The service is great, everybody is helpful and nice.
Do not forget to make diner reservations if you are planning to eat in the restaurante of the hotel.",5,2014,06,15
239,Lovely Break,"Came for an overnight stay as visiting relatives close by . Setting was fabulous as well as the staff , room and breakfast . Totally recommend this place for anyone looking for a perfect getaway . Well done to all .",4,2014,06,14
239,Amazing resort amazing Service!,This place is breathtaking. The people are super accommodating and very professional. We just couldn't get over how beautiful the resort was the whole time we stayed. Our young kids had a blast horseback riding and all the other activities. The golf is truly one of the best and the sporting clays was a great experience also.,5,2014,06,13
239,A little slice of heaven,"Just spent the afternoon in the fabulous Mt Julliet hotel, in the drawing room, overlooking the river and fields of horses with their foals, indulging in a wonderful afternoon tea. The two tiered cake stand had a great variety of savoury and sweet bites, which we didn't manage to finish, with pots of tea as we wished. The environment is soo pleasant, all in all, a real treat. 
 We then had a lovely walk for an hour or so in the very pretty grounds. The staff were very pleasant,  helpful and yet not ""in your face"". Can't wait to go back, in fact,  we are already finding a reason and a date to return. We weren't staying, but oh I wish.....!",5,2014,06,11
239,Extremely poor staff service.,"Stayed midweek in night in May. Room was not too bad and dinner in the club restaurant was lovely. However I find the spa itself and the service at the spa very poor. On the morning of the day we were checking out I went for a massage. Unfortunately I only realised I left my gold chain in the pocket of the spa robe only when we were nearly back in Dublin. I rang the Spa immediately only to be told that laundry has been taken by the laundry company already. I was told it was company A so I rang them and was told they don't do they laundry anymore. I rang back the Spa and was told 'oh it must have been the other one'. Seriously???!!!!! Would you not find out first??!!!! I was also told that someone is trying to contact the laundry company and they will come back to me once they have some info. I'm still waiting!! No one rang back! I rang main reception asking to talk to a Manager. Was told she will call me back!! Nothing till today. Obviously they don't care! So long the money was spent and bill paid, that's all they care about!! I accept it was my fault to leave it in the spa. However it would have been nice from the hotel to at least pretend that they are trying to  help! ",1,2014,06,10
239,Great Jack Nicklaus course,"The grounds and golf course of this house are beautiful. Stayed in a clubhouse room which while not huge was adequate and comfortable. Snacked at the President's bar which was good. Dinner in Kendall's restaurant was very good probably the best fillet of beef I've ever had cooked, just right and very tender - meal and wine were delicious. Put off our morning tee time due to heavy rain. Did manage to get out around 4 and was very glad we had. The course is challenging, beautifully laid out in stunning surroundings The course played very well considering the rain we had. So glad we played. Service varied quite a lot reception was just OK, Clubhouse staff not that helpful. Restaurant staff in President's Bar and Kendall's were very good, breakfast staff just OK.",4,2014,06,09
239,Great hotel with great food,"Stayed midweek on business and had dinner in The lady Helen restaurant, we opted for the tasting menu. The food was fantastic all locally sourced ingredients and all 5 courses were really
very tasty. This restaurant really does deserve its new Michelin star.
We only found out it had one after we complimented the staff on the food.
The staff were excellent and added to the enjoyment of our night.",5,2014,06,05
239,Very special,"Wow, it has it all. Beautiful Hotel, best park land golf course in Ireland. Fantastic restaurant. Nice bar, great staff. Rooms are really nice. It is a special place for a getaway. Well worth going too. ",5,2014,06,02
239,Fantastic!,"I just stayed here with my parents from the 25 may to 28 may. We had the most wonderful time and didn't want to leave today! We wish we could've stayed there a few more days, it was idyllic ! We stayed in one of the Rose Cottages which had 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. Very nicely furnished, very modern , felt like you we're at home. It also had a washer, dryer and a full kitchen which was very handy! 
I highly recommend getting the Afternoon high tea, it is so delicious and it is so lovely to sit in the very grand room at the front of Mt Juliet house with views overlooking the river and fields. We also had an amazing dinner in the Lady Helen Restaurant, very good service and they gave us a few amuse bouche courses along with our two courses and a very generous plate of petit fours!
Also we dined in Kendals in the club house, the food and service there was excellent as well! Also loved the buffet breakfasts in the morning! 
I also had a massage which was so relaxing! I highly recommend it!
We will definitely return for a longer stay when we return next time to Mt Juliet.",5,2014,05,28
239,Breathtaking,"Mount Juliet Estate is one of the most idyllic places I've ever been. Beautiful mature trees, rolling green meadows, foals in the fields, old roses creeping up walls, it's picture perfect. 
Food in Lady Helens restaurant, a massage in the spa and a cycle around the 1500 acre estate on a glorious summer day made this a perfect getaway. I will be sure to return to this fairy tale setting.",5,2014,05,28
239,Relaxed luxury,"Our stay in Mount Juliet was second to none. A six course gourmet meal followed a round of golf on the magnificent course, while my partner enjoyed the spa facilities. The rooms were big enough for a concert and decorated beautifully. All very quaint but with the few modern touches that are needed today. All in all a great experience and a beautiful location.",5,2014,05,27
239,Lovely experience,"Main house was lovely, all the walking u could want, bicycles and horses also.food was excellent and staff were more than helpful. ..lovely quiet room's , comfy bed and lovely un suite facilities. ..would definitely stay there again",5,2014,05,27
239,Beautiful morning horse riding in the woods,"I spent a lovely morning horse riding with Tara and some of the owners last week.  Riding along the river and  through the woods covered in bluebells and wild flowers, it is difficult to think of a nicer way to spend the morning.  Tara was brilliant and we covered lots of ground at a good pace for everyone.  

Quality of the facilities is very high and I'd highly recommend it as part of your trip. Also excellent for building up an appetite for afternoon tea!",5,2014,05,26
239,Wonderful stay at a fantastic hotel and estate,"My partner and I have recently returned from another visit to Mount Juliet   Each time we visit we return home feeling really relaxed and have a real feeling of having had a holiday.   Mount Juliet is such a stunning place to stay.  On this occasion we stayed in one of the Rose Garden Lodges which was extremely comfortable.    We did some of the estate activities such as golf, spa treatments, clay pigeon shooting.  The spa treatments are very relaxing and the staff are excellent.   We thoroughly enjoyed every activity on the estate we took part in.

We dined in the wonderful Lady Helen dining room twice during our week stay.  In our opinion the service in this restaurant is extremely efficient and professional and the food is delicious and very well presented.

We also ate in the Presidents Bar up at the Hunters Yard and again the service and the food are both excellent.     The relaxing and friendly atmosphere in the bar and lounge area in Mount Juliet house is wonderful.    The staff are extremely professional, efficient and made us feel at home, all the staff helped to make our stay absolutely enjoyable.     We feel as though we are completely at home at this resort and we give a very big thank you to the staff for all they do for us when we visit.

We will be back!",5,2014,05,26
239,Stayed for two nights. All was great,"Really enjoyed my third stay at Mt Juliet. This was my first time staying in Juliet House. Very central to everything in the resort. Rooms were good size and had all the amenities. 

Good level of service all around. Breakfast was great. Nice to have a view of the horses at the stud farm across the way.",5,2014,05,18
239,"Beautiful property, amazing staff","We stayed in the old house in the Gerald Grace room, the same one Jimmy Carter stayed in.  It was large and had an amazing view across the river and fields where the horses grazed and the colts played.
  
I have to commend the staff, they were amazing, from the time we arrived until the moment we departed they were always friendly and attentive without being imposing. We had a problem with our navigation system and the staff researched where we could get it fixed the next day, including driving directions so we could find the shop, that was a life saver and we felt they went above and beyond the call of duty. 

We also want to recommend you ask Des to give you a tour of the estate which includes the history of the house and property, a visit to the hunting dog kennels and the horse stables where several mares had given birth within the last few days.  The tour is free and Des has so many stories about the estate and life here over the decades, it will enhance the overall experience, so be sure to ask for him.  

We ate dinner in the Lady Helen dining room.  I wanted to partake in the Wednesday special tasting, but unfortunately unless everyone at the table orders it you can't get it.  My husband wasn't interested so we just ordered off the menu which was wonderful but I think the tasting would have been over the top.

Mount Juliet exceeded our expectations.  I understand it is for sale and hope the new owners maintain the staff and excellence we experienced.  We would definitely like to return.",5,2014,05,17
239,Attention to detail,We stayed in Mount Juliet (old house) for 2 nights while at a wedding. The main house is fantastic and much more importantly the staff were fantastic and the overall attentiveness and attention to detail was amazing. This is the type of top hotel in which staff are delighted and go out of their way to make sure you remember the stay.,4,2014,05,14
239,Nice place for a quiet weekend or girly retreat,"During a recent girly trip, we stayed here in one of the houses on the land. really nice and peaceful areas, lots to do for our group, facials, spa, afternoon tea., Quiet difficult to get spa treatment bookings even a month before our stay which disapointed some of our guests. Most of the staff at the Hotel super friendly. The Restaurant was amazing, steak was really good an extensive wine list. 
Nice place for a quiet weekend or girly retreat.",4,2014,05,13
239,Perfect Stay,"It was our first trip to Ireland. Had we known how wonderful Mount Juliet was, we would have stayed all 8 nights here and done day trips to all the places we visited.  If we ever go back, we will do just that.  Beautiful, quiet, charming, elegant. . . and the service was wonderful.  The staff was amazing.  They all went out of their way to make our stay memorable. Tea on the front lawn was lovely. We stayed all over Ireland this trip, we did not skimp; Mount Juliet was by far our favorite.  Sorry we did not stay longer.  Thank you to all involved for the lovely stay.",5,2014,05,04
239,Taste of Wednesday..fabulous,"I recently spent a night in Mount Juliet to celbrate my mums birthday...we had the tasting menu on a wednesday evening..i can honestly say it was fabulous. The attention to detail, presentation and excellent variety of courses was a real treat. The pace of the meal was perfect, service excellent and having previuosly been for a two star michelin tasting menu in Spain this was even better. We didnt go for the accompanying wine tasting menu but had a lovely bottle of Dog Point which is often hard to find. May I also say my mum has Coeliac disease which we had notified in advance, this s no problem, each course was adapted if necessary and a special dessert was made. Would highly recommend tasting menu. 
The hotel is on the market and needs some attention but is very comfortable overall. The room we were in was huge with a large bathroom with big bath and separate large shower. The third bed was a sofa bed which wasnt very comfortable but a second mattress was brought down when requested, the staff were very helpful and friendly.
While having a delicious breakfast the next morning, there were horses running around fields in distance, a group of children were out for a trek and hares were running on riverbank it was a really idyllic setting. The estate is beautiful a real escape from the city.",5,2014,05,04
239,Have to disagree with last review,"Compelled to write a review as I feel the last review was harsh, unfair and untrue. I recently had the pleasure of staying here and had an amazing time. It's an old property and that is the whole charm of it. It's steeped in history and is so authentic. It's classy but understated. I found the rooms to be charming and of a five star standard. The staff made our trip so special, they were so friendly and attentive without being intrusive. They were so professional and courteous at all times. Having visited the Merrion on many occasions for me there is no comparison, it's a complete product of the Celtic tiger, fake and false! If you want the genuine country house with excellent food, service and staff and can appreciate the genuine article then Mount Juliet is for you. If you are after the over done trappings of past wealth then head to Dublin 2's finest hotels!",5,2014,05,04
239,"really, really run down","We stayed in the main house with a river view… It was all quite bad.  Disorganized check in, thread bare carpet, bulbs out in chandeliers, peeling wallpaper, tired bathroom, below par linens…unfortunately I could go.  The bones of the house itself are lovely but it is in dire need of an overhaul!  The staff was scarce and mostly seemed confused.  Our level of expectation was perhaps too high after leaving the Merrion in Dublin, but this was truly a grim hotel.

On the bright side, we had a wonderful dinner at the golf clubhouse.  The food and service there were excellent.",1,2014,05,01
239,Mount Juliet hotel,"Fantastic hotel, helped by being upgraded to the main house on arrival. Beautiful rooms, spotlessly clean, friendly, efficient and effective staff. Fabulous breakfast, fantastic golf course with wonderful views.",5,2014,05,01
239,Old School Class,"We recently stayed here over two nights during Easter with one child, and it is excellent.
Starting from the top:

Check-in: Reception was prompt, with all 5 star requirements met including full run down of the hotel, facilities, etc. etc. Concierge service was offered as expected and service level was superb.

Rooms:
We stayed in the clubhouse, (at the back of the golf course clubhouse). Rooms were well decorated, spotlessly clean, looking out over a quiet and well maintained garden. Showers were powerful, linen was crisp, and all was well. One slight teeny tiny niggle was the presence of a marquee function type construction in the courtyard. I'm assuming it is a temporary fixture, but it was a touch unsightly upon entry, but it didn't detract much

Food:
We ate in presidents bar on both nights, Salads, fish dishes and kids menu's were very good (although priced as one would expect) Bar was very comfortable, service was also very good

Bars:
I frequented the bar in the main house and the clubhouse presidents bar. the latter was more formal with the usual stiffness and eerie quietness, and the latter was buzzy and atmospheric, so one could take ones pick. Guinness was excellent, and they have a range of craft beers (hats off the the bar management)

Facilities:
Gym - small but well equiped
Pool - 17M (not great for training if you want to do so), but very clean and a pleasant place to be. Sauna and steam rooms were of  a high standard
Golf - It's Mount Juliet! Under 18's play free at certain times with seniors that pay the good value green fees
Others - Horse riding, shooting, walking, fishing, tennis, table tennis, cycling
For the Kids- Kids club at usual times, playgrounds, and all of the above (maybe not shooting)
Running/Walking - Absolute dream for runners and walkers, grass and tarmac trails, through forestry, by rivers, through paddocks, and over the golf course... and miles of it.
The big house - Well worth a meander...

Accessibility: Flat tarmaced roads good for wheelchair access. Ramps everwhere you would expect. Some gravel footpaths in places. Bathrooms in the non-disabled rooms may be a little tight for wheelchair access... but it seems good overall

Location:
20 minutes from Kilkenny, 50 from Waterford, but no reason to go near them to be honest.

To sum up.... well worth it.. Pre-celtic tiger charm, and that's no harm....",5,2014,04,29
239,Lunch in Presidents bar,"Came here for lunch only (Presidents bar) with 2 young children. Top prices but food was very average. I had soup and sandwich combined - €11 nothing special. Black coffee - €3, Cappucino - €3.30 both very good. Glass of standard Chilean red wine - €8. Will not be in a rush back.",3,2014,04,27
239,Fabulous Hotel,"I spent a long weekend here with my wife.  It was the perfect weekend with the exception of the weather but this could not be helped.  Excellent accommodation and food.  The staff were also very friendly, happy to give lifts between the main house and the clubhouse.  I left feeling very relaxed.",5,2014,04,26
239,Fabulous hotel with teen-operated spa and tiny rooms,"The hotel looks wonderful and is well maintained. The drive in is really awe-inspiring. Everything is spick-and-span, and spotless. Perfectly manicured lawns and not a thing out of place.
There are lovely walks around the grounds that go on for a good distance. You can see beautiful horses and even some donkeys. Given nice weather, they're wonderful and would recommend anyone visiting to go to the walled garden - it's really special.

My qualms with the hotel are over their misrepresented rooms. We booked what looked like a spacious room, but were put into what most definitely looked like the cheapest room. We were then assured that that room was of the same standard we had booked. I don't know whether I was lied to directly to my face (maybe they ran out of rooms even though we booked months in advance, or more important people were given them over the average Joe) or whether the hotel really does swindle patrons this way by categorising tiny rooms as the spacious ones advertised on their website.
This was a special occasion and we were prepared to splash out for it. We considered 3 similar luxury manor hotels and would have certainly booked the alternative had we known our actual choice of room wouldn't be given. We intended to have room service breakfast in what we thought would be a comfortably spacious room with sofa and table; it ended up being a crunched up affair of an armchair and a chair over a tiny coffee table that barely fit our two plates on it, never mind the tray. The wardrobe was behind furniture and therefore awkward to reach, it was very small, as it was also used for the safe and ironing board, and was rather short for longer clothing.

I would definitely commend the hotel staff as they all were really courteous (assuming they weren't lying to us) and accommodating as far as they could. They did offer to move us to a lodge, but the main reason we booked to stay at the hotel was to have the luxurious manor house environment and room, not an apartment or cottage that could be anywhere.
Unfortunately already arriving there late in the evening we didn't have a choice to go to one of our other considered hotels, which also offered spacious rooms, and were - I guess no other way to call it - stuck with the room we were put in (I wouldn't consider the lodge a viable choice, as that's not what I wanted and not what I booked).
They offered us a discounted rate for the inconvenience. Unfortunately it hadn't been applied at checkout and we felt like beggars reminding them of the promised discount - not a nice feeling considering I would've thought it would've already been applied as a measure of apology. The money difference wasn't huge and I don't care so much about it, but it would be wrong for them to get away with getting full rate for that room.

Being a lovely hotel I'd have loved to give it 5 stars but considering how our experience with the room there soured a special occasion, it made me want to leave a 1 star - therefore, I've averaged it at 3.

The Lady Helen Restaurant, which I'll be sure to review separately and rate it the full 5 stars it deserves, was nothing short of wonderful. The food is really delicious, and the sorbets and treats between the courses to cleanse the palate were all delightful. The wine pairing were worth it and we very much enjoyed our meal there.

We also took the opportunity to book some spa treatments. I did not like the spa. The leisure centre layout is more suited to families with kids, not for a romantic couple's weekend. You need to walk outdoors to get between the pool and spa area. The relaxation room is awkward with very wide high up couch/bench. You have to climb up onto it and either sit really far back with the edge cutting into your calf or sit up forward with your legs dangling, optionally reclining far back into an uncomfortable and unattractive pose. I can't remember what choice of refreshments there was, but it wasn't much and you'd have to go out to the spa reception area (admittedly just there, maybe you could just shout out from up high on the couch if you're brazen) to request a drink. I wasn't impressed with their masseuse and my partner had the same experience. The massage was inconsistent and not particularly effective. I had one arm and hand massaged and the other wasn't even touched, it felt a bit lob-sided, if it can be called that. Maybe because of the poor massage we noticed that no one there looked older than a teen or early-twenties (they might well have passed all the qualifications to tick some boxes, but they lacked experience I'm guessing), so I don't know if it is properly run.

The President's Bar is nice, nothing spectacular, but boasts photos of celebrity golfers at different opens.

Maybe given some time, I'll be willing to go back, if I have some spare cash to waste. At the moment though, I still feel the annoyance of a special weekend ruined.",3,2014,04,23
239,Perfect Getaway,"I surprised my wife with a one night getaway to the Mount Juliet. I had heard so much about the place and had very high expectations. In fact I expected a very stuffy, posh experience were I half expected to feel a little uncomfortable but I couldn't have been more surprised or pleased with the experience. The grounds are fabulous. I wish I played golf. The hotel itself is beautiful. From a visual point of view you really couldn't ask for more. We stayed in the Black Earl room and it was by far the most comfortable room I have ever experienced. Was it stuffy? No. The place oozed class. It was posh enough and grand enough to warrant its reputation and cost but it was relaxed, welcoming, comfortable, friendly and if you could stay here for 3-4 days you'd be so relaxed and refreshed. One night was not enough. We had dinner in the Lady Helen and tried the 8 course Taster and it was wonderful. Some of the food was simply exquisite. The venison was lovely, so nice but what the chef done with the scallops and the cod was worth it alone and dishes i'd like to try again on their own. The accompanying wine was also a lovely feature and the knowledge of the waiter excellent. The Taster meal is a real experience and even though took nearly 3 hours it didn't feel like it, didn't feel over the top. It just worked for me. The fact that despite all the gravitas of Michelin star there was  a nice friendly atmosphere epitomized by the bar staff. Ed the real craftsman of cocktails makes a mean Jag well worth it if you like Whisky and have had your fill of Mojito. If it makes sense we felt like royalty from the time we checked in until the time we left. Even the communication before hand by Mary about what is on, where its on just did a lot of the work for you and all we had to do was arrive, enjoy and we did, we really did and will be back one day. Kilkenny is also not far away and a lovely small city. After staying there I really do see the appeal. It was not what I was expecting. It was not this massive, stuffy affair but a simple, elegant, relaxed and absolutely beautiful place that has made a lasting impression. There are various little things that I'd love to go into but I'd implore you to go and check them out yourself. My wife and I had a lovely time and too all concerned Thanks!",5,2014,04,22
239,A little bit of a let down,"The grounds of Mount Juliet are absolutely beautiful as is the main building, however I think I expected a bit more from our stay. The pool wasn't particularly warm and the pool complex is a bit dated. You could expect more from a hotel of this standard. It was packed full of kids when we went. We had to pay for swimming caps. Surely these could have been complimentary?
However our room was beautiful and the breakfast was delicious. Beautiful view from the breakfast room.",3,2014,04,07
239,Lady Helen Restaurant - Great Value,"After Locks getting a star a year ago I was a bit sceptical about this new recipient. We went for the Wednesday night gourmet tasting with matching wines. To our delight the food was, in my opinion, Michelin Star quality. The flavours were of a modern earthy taste, with each dish containing contrasting textures. The courses arrived at an even pace and all the flavours combined very well, with the venison probably the highlight of a very fine meal. 
However the wine service left a lot to be desired, with half the dishes served before the wine, and if we hadn’t asked for it, we might have ended up like the table beside us, whose desert wine arrived after their plates had been removed and coffee ordered. Some things jarred about the room as well, no chandelier, curtains left open after dark and waltz music which might be contemporary with the house, is more suited to dancing than dining. 
The house, room, grounds and staff, were as expected by reputation, wonderful.",4,2014,04,07
239,Another piece of heaven,"Once again we have just spent a lovely weekend at Mount Juliet. This places must be one of my favourite places on earth to visit as I feel myself relaxing the very minute we drive through the gates.  We stayed once again in the Rose Garden lodges which are little town house style buildings which are set out as either upstairs or downstairs apartments. We have stayed in both over the years and all are beautifully appointed. We have never had a problem with any of them, rather we feel like we're cocooned in the lap of luxury while we're there.  Everything you could possibly need for a comfortable stay is in the lodges. This year they've changed the suppliers of their toiletries and they're supplied by the handmade soap company and are really gorgeous. 

When we arrived this time we were given the 'chauffeurs lodge', but I have to say I didn't like this at all. I've stayed in both the house and the Rose garden and loved both but the chauffeurs lodge did not impress me at all and I immediately asked for a room change. It's decorated in a very olde-worlde style, and in fairness it probably appeals to some people but it's very creaky and I found it a bit spooky. The stairs is very steep and the stair carpet is very worn. There was a funny smell in the second bedroom, though the beds and the cottage were spotless, as is everywhere else in Mount Juliet.  

We ate in Kendals on the first night and in the main house the second night and the food was excellent on both occasions. I used the spa while I was there and it was very pleasant and relaxed and there's a lovely relaxation room where you can stay for as long as you like after your treatment, though as I was under time pressure I didn't avail of it this time. 

I can't wait to return to this beautiful place again and would recommend it to anyone. Just avoid the chauffeurs lodge!!!!",5,2014,04,03
239,Pure Luxury!,"We visited Mount Juliet as part of a group on a 'work/leisure' weekend, in late March 2014. From the broad sweeping entrance, driving along the avenue through the horse paddocks and the flower-carpeted woodlands, to the imposing estate house itself, you couldn't but be impressed. The staff welcomed us with a smile and made us feel like long lost relatives coming home! The roomes are just pure luxury and the open fires and genuine old-world feel to the estate had a warm and 'cozy' atmosphere. Food was way past excellent and the service was impeccable. Everyone seemed to want to help us with whatever we wanted to do and we had the real feeling that nothing was a bother to the staff. The only slight 'negative' was the spa. This is functional and the treatments were good but the physical layout of the spa is not really conducive to relaxation: No relaxation room. You go there, have a treatment and leave. It's not the sort of spa centre where you are encouraged to hang around and relax after a treatment. Having said that, This is a golf club and it may be expecting too much to have a luxury spa facility as well. The weather was not good and as we were golfing, this put a little 'dampner' on that part of the weekend, but we can't blame the weather on the hotel! This is a top quality resort and we will definitely be back.",5,2014,03,30
239,"Excellent in all areas - Rooms, Food, Atmosphere, Facilities and Service","I visited Mount Juliet for a friends wedding and stayed 2 nights in the Clubhouse where the wedding reception was taking place.  I had friends staying in the main house and also in a Rose Garden Lodge.  

Rooms:
Clubhouse rooms are modern with lovely views over the golf course.  The Rose Garden Lodges are also modern yet cosy and are fully equipped if you want to do self catering. The main house is just 150 yards away (2 minute walk) or if you are a guest the hotel will send a car to bring you between the 2 if required.  Rooms in the main house are period Georgian interiors so if you want the whole country estate living experience you are better booking into one of these rooms.  Wifi is available in all areas and reception was very good.  

Food:
Wedding reception was in the clubhouse (Kendals) and food was excellent.  Breakfast was also served here each morning if you are staying in the clubhouse or Rose Garden Lodge. Make sure you are on a B&B rate as breakfast is €22.95 otherwise.  For breakfast there are buffet options from continental to full Irish.  The menu also offers a variety of items including pancakes, French toast and eggs in a variety of styles.

Service:
Faultless.  Can't say enough about the staff in all areas of the estate. Working in the hospitality industry is not easy but they all seem to genuinely enjoy working on the estate and it really shows.  I felt at home but very well looked after the whole time I stayed there.

The Estate:
Mount Juliet Estate is breath taking.  There is so much to do from one of the many walks around the grounds to the leisure centre, spa, golf, clay pigeon shooting, archery or simply sitting in the main house reading the paper, having afternoon tea looking out over the river.  

All guests seemed relaxed and enjoying their stay.  I can't wait to return here. Hopefully soon!!",5,2014,03,25
239,"AMAZING HOTEL, FOOD, SERVICE & HORSE RIDING!!!","We came to mount Juliet for 2 days primarily for the equestrian centre on the estate. The riding was AMAZING!! The staff, Jen and Tara in particular, were great.....excellent instructors and their enthusiasm and confidence in you push you to learn more and more and we improved LOADS!! The horses and facilities were top notch!! The scenery on the hacks was stunning and great fun. Also having access to their cross county course & a chance to fly along ""the gallops"" were truly memorable. The hotel itself, food, staff and service were superb.

We enjoyed it so much that we booked a 5 day stay 6 months later for our anniversary. We were upgraded to a larger room in the main house which was hugely spacious, comfortable and elegant. The food was excellent again, this time we enjoyed a night in the lady Helen restaurant preceded by drinks in the bar...Maurice looked after us and set our evening up perfectly!! Trish also looked after us well over at the president's bar and Kendalls restaurant which was excellent all round.
Primarily for us it was about the riding, and again the equestrian centre did not disappoint. Jen and Tara continued to provide excellent schooling, hacking and cross country experiences. The horses were fab and we really couldn't fault it. They even managed to arrange the sun to come out at the exact moment we needed it to be dry for tackling the cross country course!

We highly recommend this to any horse lovers who also want a luxurious break away.......or for anyone who wants to relax in beautiful surroundings with excellent service, food and facilities. We will be seeing you all again soon!",5,2014,03,21
239,"Delightful, high quality with friendly service","Stayed for two nights with rooms in the main house. Arrived early and went to the drawing room overlooking the river. Wonderful view. Late snack lunch which my companions enjoyed. I felt a Guiness was the better option.
Then to our rooms, more like junior suits. Huge beds, spacious sitting area and a small walled garden shared between the three ground floor rooms on our wing.
Dinner was one of the main reasons we chose Mount Juliet. The Lady Helen Restaurant has a Michelin Star, it probably deserves another one. Had the tasting menu. Beautiful food, perfectly cooked and perfectly presented. Great Scallops, wonderful Venison. No difficulty in serving something else for those who couldn't have a particular food.
A good nights sleep.
Breakfast was as good as one would wish. Hot food was cooked to order not the more common buffet. I had the fish of the day which turned out to be Turbot, delicious.
The grounds are extensive. Golf for those that do. I was more interested in the walks which are mapped out. The walk to the stud, on to the East gate, down to and along the river i thought very pleasant.  
Dinner the second night was of the same high quality.
Problems. Just the one. A poor shower with a slow draining shower.
Cost. Two nights, two dinners, two breakfasts and alcohol of various types. About €450 per person.",5,2014,03,19
239,Afternoon Tea,"On Sunday I went to Mount Juliet for Afternoon Tea, only to be left shocked - the sandwiches resembled something you'd find in a kids lunchbox, and the tea pastries were very basic. This was obviously not the standard we were expecting from such a wonderful Hotel.",2,2014,03,18
239,Lovely stay,"Few weeks ago I stayed with my family for a couple of nights in Mount Juliet. 
We booked one of the Rose Garden lodges. The Rose Garden lodge had everything what you need, very comfortable. 
We had breakfast in Kendals, which was ok. The buffet was bit outdated, You could do with some extra work..... 
On two evenings we ate in the casual restaurant in the Hunters Yard, both nights the food was great, service excellent. Its great to see multinational team working in the restaurant, at the same time very professional and friendly. 
My husband had birthday that night, all the service team including manager were singing ''Happy Birthday'' and he got a lovely dessert plate. I thought this was great extra touch. 
After the dinner we went to the bar for a drink. We did enjoy that. 
We were seating in the bar at around 8 - 9pm, very good atmopshere with the little candles on each table. 

My kids just love Mount Juliet, they have a games room, which is a great idea.

Kilkenny is lovely town, its a must see if you are staying in Mount Juliet.

We will be back soon to Mount Juliet, we already are planning holidays in summer.",5,2014,03,14
239,Impeccable - I felt like I had stepped into a scene from Pride & Predjudice,"We stayed in the Rose Garden Cottages at Mount Juliet Estate for 2 nights and I can honestly say that in years to come, when reflecting on my life, the total experience at Mount Juliet is one that I will recall as being incredibly sumptuous in every aspect.  The cottages are 2 bedroom, beautifully finished with all the mod-cons and the bathrooms (there are 2) were so beautifully presented and clean.  The king beds are beyond comfortable - like being wrapped in a cloud. I felt like the lady of a country manor staying here.  We dined in Kendall's on our first night, by the open fire.  The ambience, service and food was spectacular.  You know those nights when you don't want to leave because it's just so perfect?  That was our night at Kendall's.  Additionally, the President's Bar is cosy, welcoming and that perfect venue for an afternoon drink and snack.  I was so upset to have to leave - I felt totally at home here.  Worth every cent.  Spoil yourself.",5,2014,03,02
239,Perfect,"Just returned from a two night stay, we were made to feel very welcome and look forward to returning later in the year. With so many extra touches.
It was our wedding anniversary treat. We stayed in one of the lodges, which were great.
Had breakfast in the club house. 
We booked our wedding anniversary dinner in kendals.
This was a real treat. We got two glasses of prosecco on arrival. Which was excellent extra touch. 
Food great. I had the steak with the cafe de paris butter. Oh my god! Excellent! 
Our waiter Michel was so funny. He couldnt do anything better. 

The only negative, my wife went for manicure in the hotel spa, she wasnt happy at all. Thats not what you would expect from 5 star property.
No doubt we will be back and have recommended this to many friends and family.",5,2014,03,01
239,Excellent Family Stay,"Stayed for a week in one of the Rose Garden Lodges.It helped that the weather was excellent.Don't play golf but did one of the golf walks which is much nicer than actually playing golf.Daily activities for the kids (7, 6 & 4) particularly golf, horse riding & gardening (which surprised me) & they loved the ""Little Rascals"" clubhouse.Very relaxed atmosphere.We dined in the Lady Helen twice-best meals I've ever had & staff are excellent.
Was offered lift back to our lodge after very long night in the bar even though it was a mere 400 or so yards from the main house.

Highly recommended.",5,2014,02,28
239,Tranquil,"What a wonderful retreat. The grounds kept us in awe. We enjoyed the horses at Bally Hinch stables  we ate our breakfasts in the Lady Helen room, and the decor felt  like a royal setting. Gorgeous  architecture. Although we are not golfers we rode around the estate on bicycles. It was romantic and beautiful.",5,2014,02,22
239,"Excellent hotel, second restaurant a real let down","Stayed here for the 10k run weekend, and have been several times before. Overall the estate is superb, excellent facilities and staff.

The Lady Helen Michelin star restaurant is one of the best in Ireland for quality and presentation, however the sister restaurant of Kendal's couldn't hold a candle to it. 

Main course of sirloin steak ordered medium rare was delivered quite rare, which for an estate of this quality is disappointing. After sending it back, a new steak was sent out this time overcooked. Also, the quality of the meat was very poor - very fatty and quite grizzly, I had to leave a portion of it as it was inedible. Desert was also a let down, however staff were attentive and courteous when I pointed all of the above out. 

Standards must improve, it took some gloss off an otherwise excellent hotel. I would not (possibly never) eat there again, but hotel is excellent, as are staff, facilities and estate.",4,2014,02,18
239,Unforgettable stay,"We stayed in mount juliet on st valentines day and it was a wonderful experience.  Mount juliet is set in beautiful kilkenny countryside and if you like country estates and old worlde charm, mount juliet is the place to go. We didn't stay in the main house instead we were in a lodge. It was spacious and luxurious. We ate in the lady helen restaurant and it was fabulous.  Our waiter, i think Maurice was his name, was knowledgeable and pleasant.  The food was indeed michelin star. The leisure centre was ok, little bit dated. Breakfast was a buffet style, perhaps a hotel of this standard might do better but food was good. Wish I could have stayed longer and will be back. ",4,2014,02,16
239,Taste of Wednesday,"The reason we visited Mount Juliet was to experience the dining at The Lady Helen restaurant.
The Wednesday night Tasting Menu is exceptional good value .. 8 courses for €55 which includes a glass of Prosecco. We also opted for the wine pairing for an additional €29. Service was excellent, Maurice was most helpful and knowledgable. My partner cannot eat meat but it was not a problem, the venison course being replaced by turbot. From start to finish it was a wonderful meal, the Michelin Star is well deserved. Looking forward to returning soon. 
We had a ground floor room in the main house with access to a small walled garden which would be most pleasant for a Summer visit. Wheelchair accessible bathroom.  The only disappointment was the couch in our room which was stained and torn and in need of attention. My partner used the swimming pool which is in the Clubhouse and had the bonus of courtesy car down and back.
Overall a great stay.",5,2014,02,12
239,Lady  Helen Restaurant,"The food here is incredibly good. It has recently been awarded a Michelin star and it is richly deserved.  The genius in the kitchen is matched by the superb front of house experience. Maitre D Maurice expertly leads a well drilled, knowledgeable and friendly team who give impeccable service.  And the dinner price is little more than you would pay in any run of the mill place.  Well worth a visit.",5,2014,02,05
239,Lady Helen Restaurant - Outstanding!,"I can't recommend the Lady Helen restaurant at Mount Juliet highly enough. Food was fab, service second-to-none, wine first class.  Bar with open fires was the perfect location for pre/post dinner drink in January. Their Michelin Star is well deserved. Don't miss it!",5,2014,02,05
239,Best of Kilkenny,"This hotel is one of my favourites. Have been a guest staying overnight, also  attended weddings and used all the facilities. Pool is a bit small but as I am not an olympian it suited me fine. The setting is wonderful, the best of lush Kilkenny county. I think the trees are amazing in every season and I have been there in all seasons.  The staff might not all be from Kilkenny but are well trained, friendly and helpful.",5,2014,02,02
239,Excellent hotel - well deserving of its Michelin Star,"My wife and I stayed here last week for one night with friends celebrating a special occasion. I must say that Mount Juliet is a very special place. We loved it and had a most enjoyable evening. The bar before was cosy and the other guests chatted with us which lead to a very relaxing atmosphere. As for the meal - we had it in the Lady Helen restaurant. We chose not to have the taster menu, as one of our guests is somewhat fussy as to what he eats!! Well the food was magnificient - we were all delighted with our choises. The Michelin star was well earned. All I can say is that it deserves whatever awards it gets! The only fault I found was that the wine was very expensive.
We were upgraded to a superior room. The room was beautiful, quiet, and the bed very comfortable, but for for people in their seventies it was a long climb up to the second floor.
The breakfast was also beautifully cooked and presented and the staff were very pleasant at all times. It was a pity that the weather was so wet and wild, as the grounds looked magnificient and we would have loved to have had a good walk around. Hopefully the next time!",5,2014,02,01
239,Exceeded our expectations,"An amazing trip, horse ridding, cycling, hours spent playing in the pool and exploring the grounds without ever needing to get into a car!  The Gluten Free range of food was superb and made freshly to order.  All the staff could not help enough and when I phoned 2 weeks later to see if I had left my shoes there, they located them and posted them too me, just fantastic service through out!",5,2014,01,31
239,Beautiful hotel but....,"We stayed here over New Years. The hotel and the grounds are absolutely beautiful. The decor is in keeping with its time, so if you like romantic old world charm then this is definitely the hotel for you. Our room was also nicely decorated, and very spacious. We ate in the Lady Helen restaurant for New Years Eve as part of the Gala Ball, it was pleasant but to be honest I've had nicer, I don't think I'll ever forget the strength of the goats cheese mousse!! The breakfast in the hotel was only okay, it did exactly what it said on the tin so to speak. We ate in the clubhouse twice over the course of the 4 days, unfortunately both times the service was shockingly poor and no apologies were made for this but the food was very good. The leisure centre reminded me of something from the early 90's, anyone who saw that show the Brittas Empire will know what I mean. All in all we had a pleasant stay, it was relaxing and romantic which is exactly what we had been hoping for. Unfortunately its not hard to leave with the impression that the hotel is trading strongly on it's setting and wedding trade, as overall it lacked that wow factor you might expect from such a hotel.",4,2014,01,29
239,Absolutely lovely!,"I stayed here with my husband for 2 nights and had a wonderful experience. I highly recommend on all levels: from the food, the rooms and the grounds. For those that like Downton Abbey, Mount Juliet provides that feel although with a modern Irish twist and excellent hospitality. Do note that this is an old estate home so it does not have elevators. I packed a bit heavy and felt horrible when I witnessed the porter lug it up 3 flights.

Our room was nicely decorated and the bed was extremely comfortable, I practically melted into it. Best nights sleep I've had in awhile. We had dinner at both of their eating establishments, the Kendall and the Lady Helen. Both where excellent and I would highly recommend either. 

While staying at Mount Juliet take some time to tour the grounds, the views are beautiful-from the gardens to the horses and colts that dot the fields. 

During our stay we even went shooting which the hotel offers and it was so much fun! I'm far from a gun nut and have actually never held one prior (well minus at arcades) but it is must do if you have the time. The game keeper was terrific. He helped a novice like me get over the jitters of the recoil and I was knocking down clays in no time. 

I can't wait to go back!",5,2014,01,25
239,Superb stay..,We're just back from a fabulous two night break in Mount Juliet. We stayed in the manor house in a beautiful room- The Earl of Shannon which had a beautiful river view. Everything was superb and faultless. The staff were welcoming and very friendly especially Edwin in the bar and Maurice in the Lady Helen restaurant. The food in The Lady Helen truly  deserves its Michelin star and is an absolute credit to the Head Chef and his team- magnificent.. The Spa is also lovely and relaxing. The estate itself is also beautiful. As we stayed midweek - Thursday & Friday it was exceptionally reasonable for what was on offer (including the Michelin star meal). Highly recommended!!,5,2014,01,25
239,Best restaurant around,"Lovely old house, great food , pleasant walks and what beautiful countryside. A personal feel to everything, it was like being a privileged house guest in a country manor. The staff were warm,friendly and helpful. The Lady Helen restaurant surpassed expectations.",5,2014,01,25
239,"Relaxing, lovely staff and food to DIE for","Just floated home after a lovely relaxing overnight girlie break at Mount Juliet. Got a really good midweek deal for a spa, B&B and dinner special. Really nice olde-worlde vibe with warm real fires and exceptionally friendly staff. (Maurice, you're a legend!) Enjoyed a really good facial and massage in the spa which is small and separate to the main house but the real highlight was dinner. The Lady Helen is out of this world - I think we spent about three and a half hours savouring the seven course tasting menu which was exquisite - the quail, oh my GOD...divine. I nearly licked the plates, wonderful service, really comfortable beds and pillows and beautiful estate, I'm already looking forward to the next time.",5,2014,01,25
239,A Great Experience,"Myself and my wife stayed here recently over two nights.  We had a clubhouse room which was perfect for our stay.  The room was nicely furnished, there was tea and coffee making facilities and a TV with all the channels properly tuned.  The bathroom was fine and well stocked.  The room was very hot on arrival but once we turned off the radiators the temperature was perfect.  The bed was extremely comfy and for someone who finds it hard to sleep when not in their own bed I was delighted.  We ate in Kendals that night and the food was very good, my only gripe was the restaurant felt cold, it was a wet January night and our plates were cold so unfortunately our meals were cool before we finiahsed.  Having said that I have eaten in Kendals many times before and had never been given cold plates.  The Breakfast the next morning was lovely, we ordered off the menu as there was no buffet at the time we ate, the food was lovely but once again cold plates.  Overall it was a lovely and relaxing experience.",4,2014,01,21
239,"Great, relaxing break","We stayed at Mount Juliet one night in January and unfortunately the house was closed for refurbishment, so we had a room in the clubhouse. 
The room was nice and comfortable but not even close to the rooms in the house, where I had the privilege of staying a few years ago. 
Being the Lady Helen restaurant closed too, we had dinner in Kendal's, which was nice, simple but tasty. I heard the Lady Helen restaurant got a well deserved Michelin star and I can say that the couple of times I ate there for work functions it was absolutely amazing. 
The service was excellent overall.
The grounds are beautiful and I really enjoyed my 8km run around the golf course (despite the rain!)
The leisure centre is nice too, the pool was crowded with children when we went so we couldn't really swim but the kids seemed to be having a great time! 
I would highly recommend a visit to both couples and families. There's something for every taste at Mount Juliet and you won't be disappointed.",5,2014,01,18
239,Excellent Santa Experience,"I have to say I totally disagree and can’t believe the bad review the Santa Experience received. I meant to review sooner but go side tracked. A huge well done to the staff and management of Mt. Juliet – our party of 6 found the entire experience fantastic. We have been to various other venues to see Santa over the last few years and found this year’s Mt. Juliet experience totally amazing for young and old. The elves at check in were courteous and engaged with the children. The show with Mrs. Claus was funny and entertaining, even if she did have a strong Meath / Louth accent! She constantly referred to the different children by their name which was a lovely touch as they were too young to realise she was reading their name tags. The waiting area before the train had entertainment by 2 elves who told jokes and the children got to participate. The train came and our excellent guide Michael was hilarious & spoke to each passenger on the train. The last area before Santa was a large room and plenty of colouring and drawing to keep the children occupied. Finally in to see the big man himself who was fantastic, jolly & rotund like Santa should be. He spent loads of time talking to the children and as he knows everything he had lots of personal facts to tell the children which astonished them!!!! It was such a welcomed relief not to have to spend any of the waiting time to see Santa penned into a tiny room with a large crowd which we experienced for several years in different venues. The only comment or recommendation I would put to the organisers is to have some more illumination features on the journey down to Santa, like snowmen, reindeers etc. A big well done to all 10/10.",5,2014,01,14
239,"Very good, but a couple of small things could make this place amazing!","I stayed here with my wife for two nights the weekend before Christmas.  The location and the drive up to the house were very impressive.  My wife booked the room maybe three months before hand.  She reserved the presidential suite for the two nights.  Following a smooth check in we where shown to the room, which wasn’t the presidential suite.  But it was a lovely room none the less.  The porter was quite insistent that this room was nicer than the presidential suite even though we were charged the same.  I wasn’t in the mood to argue with him, and being honest, the only thing that would have been more impressive was a dancing monkey butler in the room.

We went down to the Lady Helen Restaurant which had recently received a Michelin Star, this was by far the highlight of the weekend for me.  The food was impeccable, my wife had to stop me from licking my plate, everything was that good.  The wine list was extremely impressive, although I didn’t have a budget to sample a bottle of the €5000 Petrus or Château Lafite Rothschild, but none the less I was suitably impressed.  Only for the Restaurant wasn’t open on the Sunday I would have eaten there on the second night.

The next day we took a walk around the grounds, visited the Christmas market and even managed to harass a couple of reindeer.  We then went back to the hotel for an afternoon drink or eight, when we got back to the bar it wasn’t busy at all, maybe there was six tables occupied, between the bar and a side room off the main large room.  My gripe was that ever other un-occupied table had a reserved sign on it.  We managed to find one without the reserved sign on it, only to be ushered immediately from it.  I was about to complain to the lady, but she directed us to seats at the top of the stairs, and promised us that she’s keep the next table in the main bar that came available.  To be fair within two minutes she found us a table.  My point to the management is that you should be a bit more accommodating when it comes to looking after your resident guests, I realise that it’s a busy time of year but reserving almost every table was a bit off putting.  It makes sense to look after the people that staying there overnight, saves them from writing reviews like this.

Other than that we had a lovely time.  The staff were very nice and knowledgeable.  A special mention to the Sommelier in the Lady Helen, he was very nice and knew his stuff.",4,2014,01,10
239,Amazing weekend,"I came here with my family; we surprised my parents as a wedding anniversary gift. My parents stayed in the hotel while we stayed in one of the houses. I could not fault this place. The house we stayed in was incredible. There were three couples, two children and a baby and the space was superb. The house was so clean and well equipped. My parent’s room in the hotel was just beautiful. On the Friday evening we ate in the clubhouse and the food was beautiful. It was very child friendly with a games room upstairs where my active nephews could play safely while we relaxed over drinks downstairs. We had a nightcap over in the hotel bar. The main house is spectacular. The staff are exceptionally friendly. On the Saturday, we all had a beautiful breakfast and some of us went to the pool while others played golf at a nearby club. Slight complaint, I did not find the leisure club staff very friendly, the €4 charge per swimming hat was a bit steep and I found the pool very cold as did my nine month old niece who had to be taken out after less than five minutes as her teeth were chattering with the cold. It would be perfect for someone who is swimming lengths to keep warm but not really for just relaxing in. We had a lovely lunch in the clubhouse followed by a walk through the stunning grounds. I and my boyfriend wanted to take my five year old nephew cycling. There were no bikes available but a member of staff very kindly drove us around to look for bikes and when that was unsuccessful, he dropped us to the playground. That evening we had the most amazing meal in the hotel restaurant. I am a vegetarian with a major dislike of mushrooms and they could not have been more accommodating. The staff were just so friendly. I and my two sisters left before the others at 1.30am and when we got outside, the ground had begun to freeze. When I asked if we could have a lift back to the house, it was absolutely no problem. Another beautiful breakfast the next morning and we were all sorry to be leaving. My nephew cried when he was told we were going home. All in all, massive compliments to you and your staff. I would happily stay here again and recommend to others.",5,2014,01,06
239,Excellent,This is our third time staying here at mount Juliet. Once agin this hotel exceeds itself on all standards. The food is excellent with an interesting but top class dinner menu. The service that goes with this is an example to the rest of the hotel industry in Ireland and the rest of the world. The staff are so friendly making us feel at home right till the end of our stay. We will be back.,5,2014,01,02
239,A Lovely Stop,"As part of the itinerary of my Husband's 40th birthday tour of Ireland, we had an amazing stay at Mount Juliet. Even if you aren't golfers (and we're not), the quiet, peace, charming walking trails and atmosphere at MJ is simply radiant. 

We were lucky enough to be upgraded to the private condos. They are gorgeous and extremely well-equipped. It was so nice to be able to do laundry half-way through our trip! Lot's of families around, but still perfect for a couple.",5,2013,12,22
239,A Pleasure,"Congratulations to the Lady Helen restaurant for gaining a Michelin Star. My wife and I availed of the Tasting Thursday meal and overnight before the award was made but even then we knew that we were experiencing something special.
We had a seat near the window in the dining room and enjoyed beautiful views. The windows was covered with midges and I was concerned that they would gain access, but they didn’t.
Service was superb – friendly, reserved and professional. The food was magical: the chefs had managed to elevate the mundane into the stratosphere of culinary pleasure with each course producing more ‘ohs’, ‘wows’ and satisfied ‘ahs’ than the previous one.
We spent most of the evening in the dining room, enjoying each treat the meal presented. I did notice that the couple beside us had not abided by the dress code. Prior to our visit we had received an email stressing the importance of the dress code, but, on the night, I felt that the application of the code was not consistent.
After the meal we enjoyed a drink in the bar, where, again, service was superb.
Our chalet/lodge/Clubhouse room was compact, but we were there for the food so didn’t spend much time in our room. I did visit the bathroom during the night and the sink was covered with midges: they disappeared in the light.
I have recommended Mount Juliet to many friends, one of whom was lucky to be there when Bruce Springsteen stayed (and sang) there after playing in Kilkenny.
It is a real treat and I am delighted that the excellent work of all in Mount Juliet has been recognised by Michelin.",5,2013,12,18
239,Sanat Visit at Mount Juliet Estate,"We made a special effort to book this trip based on information we had received from others, we booked the 6:00pm train to gain the extra bit of atmosphere. We had an hour to pass in the market before we checked in, it was a nice market, the weather outside was not good, however the whole village was under good cover and weather did not matter.
Our kids are 10 and 6, they enjoyed the experience but the biggest grievance we had was that there was no photographer available to take a prized photo with Santa, you are depending on a young 'Elf' to take a picture for you. I also wonder what the cost for an adult include? There is nothing included in the adults charge? 
On the positives; Mrs Claus was great, Santa was very good with the kids, the elf on the train had lost of energy and the other elfs tried hard to entertain.
The negatives; No Photo, Price for Adults, lack of displays at nights on the train journey.
We ended up visiting another Santa the day after to get out annual picture taken. Come on Mount Juliet get with it for 2013 or risk being left behind!!",3,2013,12,16
239,Excellent pre christmas treat,We stayed in Mount Juliet in the old Manor House and attended the santa train recently. It was fabulous from start to finish our room was pure luxury the staff was very helpful. I have done other santa type experiences over the years however Mount Juliet is in my opinion the best one yet. Mrs Claus was very entertaining and a refreshing break away from the stereotype Mrs Claus figure. The train at night is just pure magic with all the lights and the train conductor was brilliant.  My daughter was so excited when we found Rudolph along the route and I thought the passports was a nice touch on the train as well.  Our Santa visit was extra special as our daughter was in awe as to how Santa knew so much about her and I have to say the Santa on duty was brilliant and the gift was better than anything we got else where. I think we have found our santa experience we are going back again next year with all our extended family well done,5,2013,12,15
239,Santa Visit,This was our third year visiting Santa at Mount Juliet and I have to say it was by far the best we have done Santa trains for many years and nothing compares to this year at Mount Juliet. A few days before our visit the children received personal Letters in the post from Santa which were beautifully done. On check in at Mount Juliet the received their special North Pole passwords the elves here interacted very well with children as did Mrs Claus in her kitchen making sure to speak to every child the too elves in the story room where funny with their jokes and story's and again on the train the conductor made sure to speak with every child Mount Juliet is a beautiful estate and with all the trees lit it looked magical from the train as for Santa he was amazing and all the little facts I had emailed about the children where repeated. We never felt rushed and posed for many photos with Santa the gifts the children got were of very good quality.  It was an amazing experience that my children will remember for a long time.,5,2013,12,13
239,Mount Juliet Santa Train 2013,"We have been going for the last 3 years and this year we went on Saturday 7th .  I'm delighted to see that year on year the staff have continued to evolve the whole Santa experience which means this was the best year yet. I thought the whole visit flowed really well.  We loved Mrs Clause making the gingerbread, the train trip was a delight and the Santa was excellent.  My daughter started school this year and the Elf told this to Santa.  When he asked here want school she was in and when she said a Gaelscoil he started taking to her in Irish.  (what was her  name, how was she, etc.) She was thrilled!  The presents were also high quality and age appropriate.

Picked up some lovely treats at the market and we all had lunch there as well, it was a great day out for all the family and a fantastic start to the Christmas period.",5,2013,12,13
239,Santa Train Experience was fantastic,Took my Nephews and Niece to the Santa Train experice in Mount Juliet on Saturday 7th. They absolutely loved the experience. Arrived early had no issue with parking and had lunch in the President's bar where service was friendly and prompt and food was very good value I felt  as we were in a 5* property. The train was booked for 4.20pm and we browsed in the christmas market until the appointed time. The kids loved Mrs Claus and loved helping make Gingerbread. When we got outside to go on the train it had just turned dark and the train pulling up all lit up was a magical sight. The train ride was lovely and soon they were finally meeting Santa. They loved thier gifts and Santa knowing little pieces of information about them meant he really must be watching all the time so they were still good all the way home! We didn't experience any delays and we all loved the entire experience.,5,2013,12,12
239,Santa Village,HUGE HUGE HUGE DISGUST  at the WASTE of money on the santa train in mount juliet. upon arrival we checked in and the so called elf had no personality and so did not want to be taking part in this experience. In Mrs Claus kitchen again a huge huge huge disappointment again what on earth is the point of it??. From then we went in to d next room a soooo called story room which again the 2 young girls had no interest in being elfs or doing their job to entertain children. The train ride was a disgrace nothing to look at going around again a waste. The santy how ever waas delightfuln a very warm friendly man who was great with children and was the only part of the trip worthwhile. on a whole the trip was hugely disappointing and a waste of some hard earned money. most def will not be back nor will i be recommending this to anyone.,1,2013,12,11
239,The Santa village,We brought our 4 year old granddaughter to the Santa village yesterday  6th. December which was very disappointing. We arrived all excited was booked for 2pm  had a bit of a delay in a cold waiting room after that went to see Mrs. Claus bake some gingerbread men who interacted very well with the children but was dragged out a bit then we were put into another room to wait for the train we were met by two elves we couldn't here them  eventually got on the train saw two reindeers was quite bored as we were told that Rudolph was missing which my granddaughter was upset about and it was never explained why the he was missing arrived at Santas grotto they had colouring pages for the kids to colour. There were three elves there they looked bored  not great at interacting with the children there was a television on in the background with a soccer match on  oh they also had Christmas music playing in the background . We were last to be seen the music continued in the grotto and we couldn't hear what Santa was saying. I had submitted a bit of info about my granddaughter but there was no mention of it at all I was so so disappointed.  I thought they would have given us a tea or coffee complimentary as it was cold it would have been nice. Don't think I would go back next year,2,2013,12,07
239,Santa Train: Magical experience but the delay was terrible,A must for when its just dark. The grounds were fabulous. Real festive feel. A short delay when we arrived but nothing much. Complimentary drinks and gingerbread men kept the children occupied. Mrs Claus was very good and the elves were extremely friendly. It all was going fabulous and the kdis were very excited until we arrived back into a room after the train journey where we had to wait for Santa. And wait we did. It was over an hour.  People should have been told there was such a delay at least then we could have went out to the market or walked out around the grounds and come back. There should have been more activities for the kids while they waited. Prehaps face painting. They kids were very restless. Once we got into santa he was lovely and well versed on information about the kids. THere was no rushing and the kids loved the gifts they received.  It would have been nice to have a professional photo to take away as a momentum.,3,2013,12,04
239,Family celebration in mount juliet November 22-24,"We stayed in the Rose Garden lodges for 2 nights.  We had an absolutely wonderful time.  The staff were attentive, courteous and extremely obliging. The food was excellent - I loved the brown bread.  Leisure centre and pool were lovely and the spa an absolute must.  The visit was made even more special by a tour of the estate by Des the events manager.  I couldn't recommend it highly enough.
Francesca, Dublin",5,2013,12,01
239,Lovely Weekend Break and Great Value,"Just spent a lovely night in Mount Juliet with my bookclub.  The whole experience was wonderful and exceptional value.  Mount Juliet is in a beautiful part of Ireland and the setting was gorgeous with the autumnal trees.  We had lunch in the lounge, toasted sandwiches and a glass of wine before going horse riding for an hour in the afternoon.  We were blessed with the weather and the sun came out just as we set out on our trek.  Most of the riders were complete beginners and the horses were very steady and we had a lovely amble around the estate, which was perfect for our group.  Our dinner in the Mt Helen Restaurant was delicious.  Our rooms were close together in a side wing of the house and had a country house feel rather than a hotel feel to them.  The service was excellent through our stay with nothing seeming to be any trouble at all.  Breakfast the next morning was relaxed and very good.  Some of the group then went to the spa whilst others went for a swim, or a cycle around the estate.  Everyone loved their visit and I have been spreading the word to all my friends.   Cannot wait to go back.",5,2013,11,26
239,"Thoroughly enjoyable, high quality location for a relaxing break","We gathered as a family for a surprise celebration for my wife's birthday. The Mount Juliet (MJ) team joined with us in the conspiracy to keep it a secret right up to the moment they walked into the Lady Helen restaurant. The quality of service is quite simply outstanding and every member of the MJ team we met took personal interest in helping us enjoy our stay. A special mention for Edwyn, Shane (clay pigeon shooting) and Catherine (house-keeping manager). We dined in the Lady Helen (formal yet relaxed) and Kendal's (seasonally decorated with a glowing hearth and candles) both of which served lovely meals. The only quibble would be regarding the price of the wines. Our accommodation was in the Club Rooms which were perfect for accessing the spa and leisure complex. The frosty weather enhanced the  beautifully manicured MT estate (and the colorful Xmas season lights & Santa Village added a special magical touch at night). I am delighted to recommend MJ to you - enjoy.",5,2013,11,25
239,"Lovely Weekend, with a little room for improvement","Just spent the weekend in this Hotel/Estate. Much about this hotel is outstanding; the scenery around the estate is unrivalled, and the staff are superb! The estate house exhibits all the opulence you would expect from an estate house of its kind.  Like everything there is room for improvement: We stayed in the club house rooms, and they are quite small. They are without doubt pretty, but nothing more. We ate in Kendals restaurant ( clubhouse), and it was ok, but nothing to get too excited about. The estate house is a little walk away from were we were staying, but this isnt an issue once the weather is fine. ( if it was raining, it could be an issue alright).
Yes it is not the newest of hotels, the swimming pool area is a little dated, but again I didnt mind this too much. Got a peep inside the lodges, and they are fantastic, so if I were to make a recommendation, I would say book the lodges rather than the clubhouse rooms.
All in all, we had a great experience in the estate, but wouldnt rush back to kendals.",5,2013,11,24
239,The best five star hotel in Kilkenny (that's not a 5 star),"I can see why it's not a 5 star, the accommodation is spread out over the estate. There is a shuttle that will drive you to/from the main residence, but it's inconvenient at times. Service was top notch. Better than other 5*s I've stayed in. The restaurant was, needless to say, outstanding. Proved why it earned a Michelin star. Wines were way overpriced but that's par for the course in almost all hotels and restaurants, so can't fault them for doing that. We stayed in the Rose Garden Lodges. They're normal 3-bed houses fully furnished, fireplace, kitchenware (even plates/cups/cutlery for kids) and even spare beds. Would definitely go back again.",5,2013,11,21
239,Fabulous!,I stayed at Mount Juliet last Saturday night as part of attending a wedding. The grounds and main house are beautiful. We received a warm welcome and all the staff throughout our stay were friendly and professional. The room was large and bed extremely comfortable. I loved that the toiletries were Irish made. The only area of improvement is for all items served as part of the Irish breakfast to be hot when serving. I definitely recommend staying at Mount Juliet and would love to return.,5,2013,11,15
239,Almost perfect,"It's 25 years since we've stayed in this delightful hotel, and the grouting around the edge of the bath looked about the same age. I fail to understand why so many top class hotels allow this small and easily remedied detail to go unfixed. Your first reaction is: this hotel must be dirty, if they allow this to happen.
Mount Juliet is in no way dirty (outside of the bath), and relaxation descends on you like a mist. The food is superb, from breakfast through to a dinner interrupted by so many amuse-bouches that you could nearly skip a couple of courses and still feel replete.
The grounds are delightful, the rooms large and grand with massive beds, and the staff attentive almost to the point of concern.
We could not figure out why it had taken us so long to go back. Oh yes, of course. To allow them time to fix the grouting.",4,2013,11,10
239,Weekend Break,"I visited Mount Juliet with my husband we stayed for 2 nights from the staff,rooms, spa and restaurants it was truly a wonderful experience. We stayed in the house the views are amazing from the rooms, its above 5* a hidden treasure we cant wait to visit again",5,2013,11,07
239,Great relaxing break,"My husband and I spent a weekend at Mount Juliet recently (2 nights) and it did not disappoint.
The setting is amazing and staff were exceptional. A special mention to Shane (Clay pigeon shooting instructor), Des (Host) and Ed & Maurice in the bar. If you are lucky enough to spend a night here at Mount Juliet - if the only thing you do is take the tour with Des - you will not be disappointed. The estate has so much history and stories that need to be told :) 

We had dinner in the Lady Helen (8 course tasting menu) on Friday night and dinner in Kendals on the Saturday night - both outstanding. The carrot & bacon soup in Kendals - amazing :)

The only one negative I have is the size of the room. From reading previous reviews - we made the decision to stay in the Manor house to get the full experience. Our booking was for a ""Manor House Classic"" which essentially is a double room. The size of the room was very small - barely room to get in or out of bed on one side and the bed itself - small double bed. So that was disappointing. Just be careful when booking.",5,2013,11,06
239,Afternoon tea..,"Fantastic relaxing experience. From the moment myself and my wife walked in through the front door we got our 5 star experience. Every member of staff were a delight to talj to and could not have been more helpful. We were shown to our table by the window which was set perfectly and told our afternoon tea would be with us shortly. We first got our fresh coffee in a pot and not 10 minutes from sitting down our treats arrived. Sandwiches, scones, biscuits and mini cakes wonderfully arranged and presented. Ed looked after us extremely well, plenty of coffee and warm irish hospitality. We even had a chat with Des the estate host who invited us back to do a tour of the house and grounds. We shall certainky take him up on his invite and hope to return again soon. A truly great place to visit.",5,2013,10,26
239,5 Star !!,"We were very fortunate to spend one night recently at Mount Juliet, and 'seriously' enjoyed our stay. We had one of the master suites, complete with 'four poster', overlooking the river and stud farm paddocks. The 'tasting menu' dinner was superb, and the staff could not have been more helpful, both in the dining room and administration areas. It is a 'must' for a return visit within 12 months. 
Well done on achieving your 'Michelin Star' !",5,2013,10,20
239,Wonderful Treat!,"I visited Mount Juliet for a break with friends this week, what a treat!  From the first person we met, everyone is so friendly - all the hotel staff and the staff at the golf club.  They just can't do enough to make your stay pleasurable.  We had dinner in the Lady Helen - it was nothing short of magnificent.  Breakfast was sublime.  The bedrooms are divine, everything one could wish for, and so luxurious.  The golf course is immaculate, and the walks around the estate are just breathtaking.  I hope to return for a longer stay next time.",5,2013,10,19
239,What a find! Wonderful Irish hospitality and service.,"Stayed here in September and can't wait to return. We stayed in a suite over-looking the river and horse stud with a beautiful sitting area, comfy lounge and fabulous King bed. Perfect - we went to town (Kilkenny) for dinner and ate at a great italian restaurant near the castle, but breakfast at Mount Juliet was lovely (small buffet with limited options but menu you can order off and they bring you whatever you like) and we also ate at the Golf Clubhouse on the terrace which was nice. We used the hotel's free bicycles and rode around the estate and took a lovely long walk over the bridge to the horse stud. Splash out on the suites - they are worth it. Staff nice - barman in particualr was very friendly and chatty. Great hotel and would definately go back for a few days break again.",5,2013,10,14
239,"Relaxing, comfortable with beautiful setting",We stayed in one of the gorgeous cottages on the property and wished we could have spent a week there.  It was beautiful and had all of the conveniences.  We had dinner the first night at the restaurant on the grounds - delightful.  We prepared dinner in the kitchen in our cottage the second night.  It has all of the amenities.  We had a chance to wash our vacation clothes in the laundry room of the cottage while we were able to enjoy the beautiful land surrounding us.  One of our party did the equestrian package and had a wonderful time.  I can't say enough about how we enjoyed our stay.  I want to go back with the whole family.,5,2013,10,14
239,Mount perfection,"Flawless . We stayed for our 20th anniversary and got a beautiful room with sweets and wine as gifts from the hotel . Breakfast delicious , food in golf club superb . All staff friendly and courteous . Golf course beautiful 5 star ! Could not fault the entire experience .. A hidden gem",5,2013,10,13
239,Breathtaking,"Mount Juliet is on 1,500 acres of heaven.  I was only there one short night, but the grounds are breathtaking.  We had a room that overlooked the horse pastures.  The room was large and the bathroom was pristine. It was like out of a scene from Downton Abbey with the double doors that led into the room.  Breakfast was in a small and quiet room overlooking the fields.  I was not able to explore the many amenities that Mount Juliet had to offer. I was able to enjoy a lovely drink crafted by the in house bartender, who was knowledgeable and experienced.  I would go back if I had the opportunity.  Thomastown is a great location, not far from anywhere.",5,2013,10,10
239,"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!","Just spent an amazing three days at Mount Juliet Hotel celebrating our wedding anniversary.  All the staff without fail were warm, friendly and so helpful.  We had two stunning dinners in the Lady Helen restaurant.  The food was out of this world - edible art on a plate!  Michelin star was so well deserved. This hotel is special; total chill out place but there are lots of activities available should you desire them.  We will be back again....would highly recommend MJ to anyone looking for something special.  A true five star hotel but without the stuffiness that some other five stars allude to.",5,2013,10,08
239,"Beautiful place, marvellous service","We recently spent a weekend in Mount Juliet Hotel and it is such a lovely getaway place. The staff are so helpful and friendly and everything about the place is relaxed but professional. Dinner in the Lady Helen restaurant was one of the best meals we have ever had.. very well deserving of its recent Michelin Star. We did the tour of the house and the estate which again was a very relaxing but pleasant way to spend a few hours. You have the option of walks, cycle paths or drives around the 1500 acre estate. We will definitely be back.",5,2013,10,07
239,Very disapointing Afternoon Tea,"Expectation was high but we left feeling very disappointed. We had booked the Champagne Afternoon Tea and the greeting at reception was excellent. However, the table was not dressed or ready. The quality and quantity of food particularly the sandwiches were very poor and very boring.  Coffee was served by the cup (v small) and you had to try to get the attention of the waiter to ask for a top up.  Overall, ok experience but nothing special. ",3,2013,10,05
239,A Truly Beautiful Place to Stay...,"Just finishing our stay at Mount Juliet, this is our third visit here over the past 18 months. We had afternoon tea today in one of the many beautiful drawing rooms and it was superb. In less than 24 hours you can unwind here and leave the city behind. 

This morning after breakfast we trail walked around the grounds - over the rivers, passed the paddocks full of young foals and through the forest. We then went clay shooting in the afternoon and back into the pool and steam room for the late afternoon - just a perfect day.

The reason we come back to Mount Juliet again and again is the staff, they are a fantastic bunch of people. They love what that do and are passionate about being part of the experience, nothing is too much trouble.

The food is exceptional, and I am a fussy vegetarian! I cannot recommend Mount Juliet enough, you have to be here to experience it, if you get the chance, take it and enjoy.",5,2013,10,04
239,Afternoon Tea,"I am sorry to say Champane Afternoon Tea in Mount Juliet Estate was a big dissapointment, Sandwiches were average my husband asked me did they make sandwiches early that morning he never complains!!! We received this as a Christmas present and only got to use it last Sunday,Scones were nice other cakes not so good . Feel sorry for the family member who purchased same as they thought it was a great choice. Sorry guy's a big dissapointment!!",5,2013,10,03
239,Special Place,"Stayed earlier this year and was so impressed that we brought along 2 friends who were celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary.  We stayed in Rose Garden cottage which is finished to the highest specification, well kitted out with most comfortable beds.  Included in our price was breakfast in the main house plus two rounds of golf. Dined first night in golf club, whilst good enough food, menu was limited, second night we dined in Lady Helen restaurant where the food was superb.  The hotel had just been awarded to a Michelin Star and we shared in their success with complimentary drinks.  The staff are to be complimented on their friendly attentive service.  Can't wait to return",5,2013,09,28
239,Out of this world,"Went on a midweek break to celebrate our wedding anniversary to Mount Juliet and we were not disappointed.  When we arrived early to check in we were given a tour of the main house which was interesting and then we were upgraded free of charge to one of the rooms in the main house and the room was fab.  The food was excellent but the staff really make this place special, very friendly and chatty. We ate in the Lady Helen and it was amazing.  There is plenty to do here, I used the driving range, we went for walks as the grounds are big, used the leisure centre which was good and we also ate in the golf club house and this was also very good.  Will be returning next year.",5,2013,09,28
239,Beautiful hotel,"My husband and I stayed at Mount Juliet in July. The hotel property is unbelievably beautiful. It is a drive from  Dublin, but well worth it.  We were warmly welcomed by the staff. Everyone we met were very kind and courteous to us. We had a room in the main house, everything about it was perfect. The room was beautiful, large and extremely comfortable. We hiked two of the suggested trails. They both were beautiful, passing the tranquil lakes,gorgeous river and beautiful horses.We had dinner at the restaurant and the Grille, both delicious. The view from both tables, outstanding. The breakfast in the main house was great, with lots of choices. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay. We will be back!",5,2013,09,28
239,Wowed by the service...,"Just back from a weekend break on the estate of Mount Juliet.

We were just blessed with the weather and it was fantastic to see everyone out enjoying the sunshine.

We had one of the Rose Garden Lodges which was just beautiful and an easy walk to where ever we had to get to.  The lodges are really well kitted out and very comfortable.  Loved it!

We brought horses with us and they too had pretty upmarket accommodation.  The yard is lovely and very secure.  The main purpose of our trip was to enjoy the equestrian offerings of the estate.  They have plenty to offer in the line of trail riding and a fabulous sand gallop.  The only part I feel lets them down is the cross country course.  It isn't actually a cross country course, just a field with a selection of fences.  I imagine if you had a need for schooling an eventing type of horse this might be more useful, but if you want to cross some country with natural obstacles, this wouldn't be the place to do it. 

However, even though this would usually be the big thing for us, we settled down to enjoying the estate and the beautiful scenery.

All rides are accompanied (I'm sure just incase someone might take a mad tear across the golf course lol) and it's all very controlled and PC.  

The only other area that wasn't brilliant was the menus in the restaurants at the Clubhouse.  I am not at all fussy and I struggled on both nights to find something that I liked.  I think they really could improve on this.

The really, really big plus and where I feel Mount Juliet excels is with their staff.  I have to say, across the board (equestrian centre included), the staff are marvelous.  We could not have been better taken care of.  Nothing was too much trouble.  We were offered a porter at every opportunity as we didn't have transport other than the lorry which stayed parked at the yard.  I was very impressed, totally 5* service and all done with a smile.  It's a bit unique in Ireland at the moment, but maybe the worm has turned.  

If you want a truly relaxed luxury break I would recommend Mount Juliet highly.

Look forward to a return visit!",5,2013,09,23
239,"Beautiful setting, comfort at it's best!",I stayed here for 2 nights with the family and could not recommend it highly enough. I played a round of golf and the course is world class. The room in the main hotel was very comfortable and the staff are very friendly. The swimming pool is clean along with changing areas. The only downfall would be the food menu in the golf clubhouse is basic but that aside everything else about this hotel and facilities are up there with the best I've stayed in,5,2013,09,21
239,Staff is the best,"They have a lot of immigrant staff here who are SUPERB and the best part of the resort. The clubhouse food is mediocre but the main dining room food is exquisite, as is the service, the massages are totally mediocre and not worth the money. The grounds are lovely. As in many places in Ireland the bathrooms are illogically designed. Why I can't have my towel next to my shower instead of across the room is a mystery ! Breakfast was excellent!",4,2013,09,19
239,I WANTED TIME TO STAND STILL..............,"Spent a wonderful overnight here including their 8 course dinner menu........a pure delight of the taste buds, we loved it , what a great way to celebrate my sister's birthday.
Every member of staff deserves a big pat on the back, so helpful and good at their jobs. 
The hotel has so much to offer, golf, spa, tennis, putting course, snooker, free bikes to explore the wonderful gardens etc...I could go on but why spoil it.....do yourself a favour and go there.....
Value for money hard to find these days but Mount Juliet has it just right.
Can't wait to return...........I'm dreaming about it !!!!",5,2013,09,18
239,"Mount Juliet Estate, Thomastown, Ireland","Beautiful facility with a very attentive staff. Possibly one of the best on our trip. We were supposed to stay two nights and stretched it to three- wished for more!  Excellent service was the norm and they seemed to really try go the extra mile to make our stay. Rooms were spacious, clean and incredibly comfortable. Food and drink were very good( actually the bartender in the main house is in a league of his own). Worth the trip. Be sure and see Jerpoint blown glass just across the road",5,2013,09,17
239,Afternoon tea,"Today we took advantage of the walking tour of the gardens with 
Pat the gardener who was very knowledgable and generous with his skills. This was followed by afternoon tea we had a table with a view across the river towards the Stud. The whole experience was enjoyable and will be repeated.",4,2013,09,16
239,Wedding stay,"Stayed here for a wedding with the main event hosted on the grounds.  Have to say what a great place it is. Food was top quality and the staff were great.  A very special note for Alex in the bar who went out of her way for the guests during our stay, ensuring everyone had a safe and enjoyable night.
Highly recommend overall. ",5,2013,09,14
239,Best of Trip,"Traveling with three couples, this was the only spot where we extended our stay.  Wonderful rooms, beautiful property, fun staff and a reasonable rate - not inexpensive but fair for the quality and breakfast included.  Will surely return.",5,2013,09,13
239,A glorious setting for a family wedding,We stayed here recently for my cousin's wedding. I have been here for golf and other events but never to stay. We stayed two nights in the delightful rosé cottages which are spacious and well equipped self catering facilities but with the quality oh a five star hotel. My only comment would be that they are quite dark - perhaps brighter paint and cutting the ivy etc would help. We loved the fire. The service was friendly and professional - great eggs and potatoes boxy for breakfast and good fish and chips in the bar. The grounds are stunning and my husband had a surprisingly clear run at 18holes on the Saturday. The gym is a little dated but it does the trick. The grounds are the best thing about Mount Juliet - the real thing does not disappoint from the photos. It was good value for money too.,5,2013,09,10
239,A perfect experience. And not only for golfers,"Mount Juliet, near Thomastown is the most beautiful country estate. 
We went to the Lady Helen restaurant with friends for their tasting menu on a Thursday evening.
It was a really wonderful experience. We had about 8 courses and I think some extras too. All beautifully presented and so unusual and delicious.
The quail and foie gras was so good. But then so was everything else.
The staff were great and quietly efficient. They moved around politely and were not unnecessarily 
imposing in any way. I really enjoyed the night.",5,2013,09,08
239,Exquisite,"The Mount Juliet Estate is a beautiful property, you drive into it through a stud farm (adorable!) and then end up at the manor house situated on a hill with a picturesque view. The main house was lavishly decorated and very beautiful. The room was also very pretty with excellent views. The service was very good throughout our stay, though we could not get into the dining rooms because we did not book ahead. The food that we did have however, at the casual restaurants and at breakfast was excellent, (a very good kids menu, also). We took full advantage of the property, walking through the walled garden, jogging the vast wooded trails, fishing in the river, horseback riding and using the complementary bikes to see the property. The spa was very pleasant, but however the pool area was catered to kids in a big way. It was crowded with kids and not the best lap pool, but however there are restricted ""adults only"" swim times. You need a bathing cap to enter the pool, so bring a shower cap from you're hotel room. However the hotel is still highly recommended because of its many assets, (especially good for families also).",5,2013,09,06
239,Exceeded expectations!,"As we are getting married here in November, we travelled to Mount Juliet for our wedding menu tasting in the Lady Helen restaurant, so I will start the review with the food.  All of the dishes we tasted were out of this world, and the wines we tasted were equally delicious.  Making a decision for our wedding menu was extremely difficult as everything we tasted so amazing!  I highly recommend the Lady Helen for anyone staying here, and to echo other reviewers it is definitely worthy of a Michelin star.  Breakfast the following morning was 5 star standard, with a great selection in both the buffet and cooked to order menu (I had amazing pancakes with maple syrup, bacon and fresh berries).  
The room we stayed in was spacious and elegantly furnished, with the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in.  Little details in the room like still and sparkling water, an array of organic tea/coffee/hot chocolate with a designer-style kettle, and homemade toiletries in the bathroom add to the 5 star feel of this hotel.
For leisure we used the pool, which was nice and quiet as there are allocated times for families. My one and only criticism during our stay would be the absence of shower gel and shampoo in the shower/changing area in the leisure centre, which surprised me as all of the other public bathroom areas in the hotel had luxury soaps and lotions etc.
After breakfast on our day of departure we went for a cycle around the estate, as the hotel has bikes for guests to use during their stay.  It was really beautiful to explore the grounds and to cycle through the stud farm and the river.
Even though we only stayed for one night, we were so relaxed afterwards that it felt like a week!  I cannot recommend Mount Juliet enough, it is perfect, and I can't wait to go back in November for our big day!",5,2013,09,05
239,Fabulous venue in any weather!,"We spent three days at the beautiful country estate during the coldest March Ireland has experienced in 50-60 years. Despite the swirling snowflakes, it was a delightful, peaceful respite in a very active trip. We spent 6 hours riding horses through the heavily wooded hillsides, watched golfers and hikers combating the bitter cold, and relaxing in the spa and pool. The food at the Lady Helen Restaurant was superb and the fresh salmon was the best I've ever had!  This resort offers a Jack Nicklaus-designed competitive golf course, a thoroughbred breeding farm, miles of trails, and an attentive staff attuned to meeting or exceeding every expectation.  I will return!",5,2013,09,03
239,"Beautiful country retreat, lovely getaway location but the chef needs to taste his food","A beautiful old house set in the middle of lovely parkland and forest.  We went for a couples getaway and it fit the bill perfectly.  Lovely reception rooms for lounging around in, really nice long walks and great activities on site for the more active.  The leisure centre is in a separate building so doesn't really work as part of the hotel but its still ok - nothing special but perfectly acceptable.  
Lovely bedrooms, we stayed in a Manor House Superior room and could not fault it.  The staff at Reception were very pleasant but pretty useless - did not know pricing of stays, did not get back to is with regard to booking activities, didn't follow up on any of our queries.
We stayed 2 nights, ate in the Golf Club House the first night - very good.  Then the main house restaurant on the second night.  Prior to dinner we had enquired about booking in for a 3rd night but after eating there decided it was not worth staying around for.  The dinner was such a disappointment.  Staff are not trained and from beginning to end it was a shambles.  The food all looks beautiful and is very impressive when it is brought out, but the Chef needs to start again.  The flavours are mismatched, nothing actually tastes good.  I'm not a big foody, but found myself getting really annoyed with the food, it is such a badly constructed menu, and they are getting away with it because it looks good - but it is not good food.   Get rid of the freeze drying machine!  Taste your food and get back to basic good cooking.  This is an expensive venue and I will go back but will not eat in the restaurant, it should be much better for the prices and setting.",5,2013,09,02
239,Wow!,"Booked this at the last minute and it was a great choice!  The main house oozes history, the rooms are small but in the context of the house they feel fine.  The bed is perhaps the most comfortable I've ever slept in.  The golf course is spectacular!",5,2013,08,29
239,Gem in Kilkenny,"Spent two nights in Mount Juliet during July. Hard to describe how wonderful this estate house is. Lady Helen restaurant was among the best I have had had the pleasure of eating in.  Bed rooms were very spacious, comfortable and relaxing, slept like a log. Breakfast was excellent. Staff well in tune with the needs of the 5 star visitors - we were treated like we were part of a family. Bar although quiet (Sunday and Monday and nights) although quiet was very cosy.
Fantastic walks around the grounds and lots to do in the estate - fishing, horses riding, archery, shooting and golf. Kilkenny city and the many attractions in the county would keep any tourist busy for the best part of a week.",5,2013,08,29
239,bliss,"Stayed here with family for a weekend break, beside the fact that there is every activity you could possibly want what makes Mount Juliet special is the welcome of the staff, in particular I would like to thank Jenny for the wonderful trail ride through the estate. The horse are obviously well cared for and well trained and Jenny managed to make two nervous but enthusiastic riders feel confidant. Dinner was an event but again made special by the staff,golf course is a real challenge, we stayed in a self catering cottage and for a family break catering for different ages I could not recommend Mount Juliet highly enough",5,2013,08,27
239,Golf Weekend - Ryder Cup,Thanks to all the team in Mount Julliet for a great weekend  - it was great to be back in the best hotel in the world...those magical gates you pass through worked their charms once more it's friendly professional staff make you so welcome - thanks Mount Julliet.,5,2013,08,26
239,"Very very nice, stunning grounds for all the family","Superb golf course, great playground and trails for bikes. Super dining experience also. Couple of swings wouldn't go a miss for the smaller visitors and a playroom would benefit many smaller visitors and their parents also.  Would recommend.",5,2013,08,25
239,Best dinner of a four week holiday,"What jump s out the most of this lovely spot was the dinner we had in the main dining room. We were totally blown away. Hadn't read any of the reviews ahead of time , otherwise we might have known.  But really there is  that  sense of contentment of discovering it for yourself as well. From the quality of servers , the food itself, all the little extras and spaciousness of the room we give this one top marks and it takes a lot to do that. For the hotel itself, we enjoyed the high tea outside, the walking trails,the helpful staff who were very good at their perspective roles. Anything to improve on? Yes the quality of the bedrooms. Our room,  whilst spacious , was tired looking with a ripped bed skirt on the love seat. They have upgraded some of the river rooms and perhaps ours is soon. I would recommend they have cotton duvet covers as that is the future I think for cleanliness. I know lots of people just pull off those bedspreads and put them away when they enter a room not knowing what has happened on those things. Their white towels are not to the standard of a five star hotel so I would recommend heavier ones.Overall a lovely spot and experience however.",4,2013,08,21
239,Afternoon Tea. Absolute treat!!,Booked Afternoon Tea as a surprise for my friend.  As you coukd imagine she was absolutely delighted.  I have to admit when we arrived I felt we were just fobbed off to go pick a table and someone would be with us but after choosing our table we sat only for 5/6 mins before someone came over and that was it.  We were spoiled rotten from there on. It was such a relaxing enjoyable experience. Fresh scrumptious sambos and an erray of desserts.  Just delicious.  We also had mojitos which were made to a T. So fresh and refreshing. Before we left they treated us to s glass of bubbly for my friends birthday. So thoughtful.  An experience we won't forget.   Will definitely return xx ,5,2013,08,19
239,Beautiful setting but let down by quality of food and clubhouse service.,"We stayed in a clubhouse room.  Pretty basic room with rather tired decor.  Size is good and bed was just super.  The clubhouse itself doesn't lend itself to comfort.  It is hard to decide where to sit as it has a feeling of sitting in a corridor with adults and particularly children running by on a regular basis.  I felt service was quite poor but I put this down to some staff particularly those outside of the clubhouse restaurant not being particularly happy in the job they were employed to do.  Clubhouse menu is also disappointing and could do with some updating and a bit of practice on how to make a coffee correctly!  Unfortunately the restaurant in the house was closed whilst we were there so we did not sample it.  

The house itself is beautiful / we frequented the bar at night and the view was just beautiful.  We dealt with 3 porters whilst there - 2 Irish and one polish - they were fantastic with very enjoyable humour. 

Very good golf course. 

I would recommend a visit if you have not been and get a reasonable deal but it wouldn't be a place I would return to before Adare manor, ashford castle or Waterford castle. 
",4,2013,08,14
239,Lady Helen's-fine dining exemplified,"Stayed here for 2 nights...no major issues as one would expect from such an establishment. 
But the food-my god the food. Lady Helen's is THE best place I have ever eaten. The food and service unbelievable.
As someone with over ten years in the industry this is one of the only places I'd take my staff on a training exercise.
Stay here-but primarily eat here. You won't regret it and you can thank me later",5,2013,08,14
239,Beautiful setting!,"We stayed here a couple of nights, ate in the dining room, golfed, and our friend went on a horseback ride.  It is an old hotel and had it quirks - no AC! But all in all a wonderful stay. Ver attentive service and staff was very accommodating. Beautiful golf course with fabulous views. Only drawback is that it is a 15 minute taxi ride to Kilkenny if you want a dinner outside the resort.",4,2013,08,14
239,Superb,"Had a grand time at Mt. Juliet. The staff was very friendly and warm. My son and I enjoyed our archery lesson with Sean who was most helpful and we had a wonderful horseback ride afterwards with a very nice young lady who was most delightful. The food there was very good. Highly recommend making dinner reservations in advance as they book quickly  and we had some difficulty, but the staff did accomodate us. We tried the 8 course meal which was delightful. for 75 euro each. It was beautifully presented and the flavors were unique for each course. The quail and duck were perfectly cooked and the presentation pefect. The rooms were quite comfortable and roomy. The baths were quite large and in excellent conditon. Very clean throughout. Very comfortable even with no a/c.Charming, wish we had more time to spend there as there was lots to do. We stayed Lady Mary's room which was very lovely. The staff all around were very attentive and quite freindly.",5,2013,08,11
239,Comfortable stay,We stayed as a family in the suites. They were nice but our unit seemed to have a lot of wear and tear. Several things were broken and furniture was worn. The grounds  are beautiful and the golf was great. I guess for the price I expected a little more. Lady Helen's is not a meal for teenagers :) too fancy.,4,2013,08,09
239,This Resort has it All.,"We loved our first stay at this resort in their Presidential Suite which is very good value when you see what the suite provides with regard to view and size it really does take some beating.

We moved into the suite as the Boss Bruce Springsteen moved out only hours earlier.

There is so much to do on the resort for all Golf, Archery, Clay shooting, Walking, Swimming etc.

Please read the book on the estates last owners it really is a lovely story.

Just stay you will not regret it the grounds are just beautiful.",5,2013,08,06
239,A Fabulous Retreat,"My wife and I have had the pleasure of staying at Mount Juliet three times this year. So Far!!

We have always stayed in the main house so I can't comment on the lodges etc. The rooms are a really good size and well decorated. Staff are attentive, friendy and efficient. Ask for a river view room; the views are especially spectacular early in the morning and this time of year when the mares are out with their foals.

I must comment on the Lady Helen restaurant. It won the Best Hotel Restaurant in Ireland a few months ago and it is easy to understand why. The food is absolutely fabulous and I am sure it must be in the running for a Michelin star.

The golf club is a short walk from the main house and is a great spot for a drink and casual dining. There is always a buzz about the place with golfers and friends having pre and post round food and drinks. Again, the staff are great.

We will be back as soon as time permits.",5,2013,07,29
239,An abslute gem,"We had booked the lodges, but were upgraded to the main hotel.  This is former country estate, and they make it seem as if you're a guest at a country estate rather than a hotel.  Theservice is efficient and correctly understated.  The rooms are very large and completely in character with the country house feel, with huge bed set in large proportioned rooms.

We ate in the main hotel restaurant, and had the 8 course tasting menu.  It was easily for me the best meal of our trip, and must be verging on Michelin star quality.  Breakfast was great, set you up for the whole day.

The golf course is a superb park land set up, as befits a country house hotel, you'll remember the third for a long time if you par it like I did.",5,2013,07,26
239,A Great Location for a relaxing break,"We had the pleasure of bring some overseas friend to Mount Juliet.  We booked the Cottages as it provided a great facility to have two bedrooms and sitting room, like a mini suite. We booked dinner in the Lady Helen Restaurant and the food was fantastic, unfortunately we were seated beside a radiator (heater) which could not be turned off and it was 29%C outside.  Notwithstanding this the food and service was excellent and very well presented.  The estate is fantastic and the management provide guests with suggested walks which are highly recommended.  Highly recommended and our overseas friends were very impressed.",5,2013,07,23
239,A delight in the country,"Thoroughly enjoyed the setting, facilities and the food.  Best breakfast we had in Ireland. Evening meals were likewise excellent.  Lots of outdoor activities and close to many sites.  Would definitely return.",5,2013,07,20
239,Superb Setting,"Treated ourselves to a midweek break during the hottest week in Ireland this year. Attentive service upon check in and dined the first night in The Presidents Bar where food and service were both good.  Bedroom a bit cramped and very hot, advised not to leave windows open overnight which made it very uncomfortable.  Breakfast service slow and staff were very disorganised with no real supervision.  The hotel is in a superb location and the golf course is in excellent condition, however I believe hotel could do with some refurbishment and staff could improve their customer care.",4,2013,07,15
239,Great venue,Loved mount Juliet stayed in the clubhouse and attended a wedding in kendels we had our drinks reception in the main house which was lovely. The food at the wedding was second to none . Lovely terrace to sit out and a lovely view . But with all the finery etc I have to say the staff were outstanding so pleasant and helpful they work really hard but they had a great attitude and were so friendly this I can't express enough well done and thank you all for making a great weekend even better,4,2013,07,09
239,Afternoon Tea was most enjoyable,"Went to Mount Juliet for afternoon tea, an experience I hadn't had previously. I must say it was extremely relaxed, served outside in wonderful sunshine. The food was superb, presentation and service were excellent. We really enjoyed it.",5,2013,07,08
239,Breathtaking!!!!,"Mount Juliet is just breathtaking, we just spent 5 nites staying  in the cottages, they were georgous & had everything you needed. We ate in the hotel & clubhouse, the food was amazing.....The kids loved everything there from the pool, to cycling, horse riding, getting to see the hunting dogs & horses & the staff were great & Des was brilliant!!! ..we will be planning to stay again very soon as it was so enjoyable...",5,2013,07,07
239,Evening Tea,"We paid a visit to Mount Juliet for meal on Sunday evening, this we found to be a great experience, the food was fantastic the scenery is outstanding and the staff make you feel like a millionaire, great work gentlemen, a big thank you to Liam, Ed, Daniel and Jacob for the way they took care of us.
Thank you.",5,2013,07,07
239,A Wonderful Stay,Mount Juliet is a breathtaking property with indescribable views.  The golf course is stunning.  There is an 18 hole putting/practice green as well.  The Club house is wonderful.  The food is amazing and the staff were beyond friendly and helpful.  The pool and grotto/fitness area was very lovely and unique.  We went horseback riding and bike riding and walking through trails.  The horseback riding was worth the price of the trip.  The rooms were lovely; large and well appointed.  The bar/bartenders were wonderful and very entertaining.  The whole experience was wonderful and one of our best stays in Ireland.,5,2013,07,06
239,WOW WOW WOW,"This place was like something out of a movie! We stayed in the main hose in a beautiful room with a view overlooking green pastures with horses playing by a creek... I'm not joking! Intoxicating beauty everywhere! Oh, and a world class golf course designed by Jack Nicklaus... no big deal. The Restaurant was phenomenal as well. Too bad we only stayed one night on our road trip across Ireland!",5,2013,07,03
239,Astounding,"Fabulous property, exemplary staff, amazing facility, lovely rooms, lovely grounds, amazing food, beautiful countryside, loads to do....no words can describe..Its an experience, just so enjoyable. Go!",5,2013,06,28
239,"Wonderful Wedding""","Got married in Mount Juliet in November 2012, with a Civil Ceremony in the most beautiful room with views of the River followed by a reception in Kendals! The entire day was perfect and everything from the food, venues, accommodation was amazing. The staff were so down to earth and pleasant. They made it such a special day!!",5,2013,06,24
239,WOW!,"I arrived at Mt Juliet late last week and was treated to an unmatched level of service. At 10:30 at night staff happily and helpfully were able to make me a sandwich, sort out my husband's transport for the next day, let me use their phone, and brought me to my room and did so seemlessly. Especially great service from Laura, Liam, and Agnieska- many thanks for helping make my arrival after a long day of work and travel so nice.

I stayed in Kendal's, the Clubhouse, for two nights. The design of the room was very much to my taste and the bed just so, so comfy I could have slept forever. 

Breakfast in the morning was taken down at the stunning main house and was just fabulous. I think I gained 10 pounds! Many Americans struggle with the size of rooms in Europe, and the rooms, portions, everything were more than sufficient. In fact, one could say everything was just perfectly gracious.

Impeccable service, stunning setting!",5,2013,06,07
239,Stunning property and service to match,"We just spent the June long weekend here to celebrate my wife's birthday. The property is stunning. There is so much to do here. You can do as much or as little as you want. We spent an hour at the archery range before our fine dining dinner on the Saturday night then an afternoon fishing the lakes and then onto the river before a more casual dinner at the brasserie in the club house. The thing that sets this place apart from a lot of other similar types of properties in the country is the service. The staff are fantastic. Des is there to great and welcome guests and show them around to the various activities and a young guy Ed in the bar was so friendly while still remaining professional. These guys are not forcing conversation, they are generally interested in meeting people. Also, I mentioned the reason we were staying the weekend when i booked it a month earlier and a birthday message was written into the dessert at dinner. It's these little touches that cost a hotel nothing, but makes a guest remember why they enjoyed their stay so much. Well done Mount Juliet.",5,2013,06,04
239,Our favorite place to stay in all of Ireland.,"We only stayed at Mt. Juliet for one evening, and wish that we had stayed longer.  With a corner room in the manor house, facing the River Nore and the horse paddocks, it was lovely!  From the moment that we were greeted at the door and our bags taken up the stairs to our room, until our departure, everything was perfect.  Wonderful service, beautiful room with a comfortable bed and a perfect view.  We took an early morning walk on one of the walking trails on the property and enjoyed the quiet beauty, and the fragrant blue bells. During our 8 night stay in Ireland, this property was our favorite.  We hope to return one day.",5,2013,06,03
239,Hard to fault anything.,"We stayed for a week and although the weather didn't always cooperate we enjoyed every minute. It's a beautiful place to wander around and there is plenty to do. The Lady Helen restaurant is especially good. We were sorry we didn't have time to eat there more often. The staff were consistently excellent, displaying genuine warm hospitality rather than the forced politeness you find in some establishments. Although I raised an eyebrow when the price for a week's stay was originally quoted, I feel now feel that Mount Juliet is good value. ",5,2013,05,30
239,"Wonderful, Beautiful Grounds.  Most Comfortable Bed on the Planet!","The acres of grounds here are beautiful to walk around, The staff was very attentive, professional and courteous. Our room service came very quickly.  Oh, and the bed was possibly the most comfortable thing I have ever slept in in my life.  Seriously!  Overall a top notch stay!",5,2013,05,28
239,Impressed,"We have just come back from a 2 evening package that included golf. The total experience was fantastic from start to finish . The grounds in terms of scale ,great walks and scenery would be well worth the visit in itself. However all aspects of our stay were a joy to behold . The staff were extremely polite and very accomodating and the food was of the highest quality and presentation. For those golfers amongst us ( good and NOT so good!) then your in for a real treat playing one of irelands best golf courses . Overall a great stay and we will be back...however if i had one very small complaint it would be the showers in the changing rooms  had some with no  shower gel / shampoo dispensers which did annoy my wife. A small point that im sure will be fixed..Well done to everyone",5,2013,05,28
239,Trip to Irland April 2013,"Mount Juliet Estate has a fantastic location! I was amazed about the size of the premises! It is a good sample for bringing up a traditional house to a first class standard in the modern times. Everything you desire for a geat holiday is offered with special charm. We were suprized about the exellent service and friendliness of the staff as well as the many opportunites for learuse in such a traditional place.

Only disadvantage: Kids hours for the pool are limited.",4,2013,05,25
239,A Much Needed Break,"Our 3 night break was wonderful from the moment we arrived to the afternoon we said goodbye.  Mount Juliet is situated in the most idyllic and tranquil setting. We stayed in a Riverside room with a wonderful view of the River Nore and post and railed paddocks of TB mares and foals from the Estate owned Ballylinch stud beyond.  Simply our idea of heaven.  All of the Riverside rooms were beautifully refurbished earlier this year and I believe one of the owner,s daughters was responsible for choosing fabrics and soft furnishings.  The room we stayed in felt so relaxing and on each of the 3 nights we both had an excellent night's sleep.   We are not golfers but when we saw the Estate golf course we were very tempted to play when we saw  superb layout of the course.  Although it was only constructed in 1988/89 it is complimented by running water, mature trees and the row of copper beech trees viewed from the Clubhouse  were magnificent. We enjoyed our food in the Clubhouse very much and my only complaint is that they did not serve Rose Champagne!  However, there is a very good wine list available and one can enjoy anything from nibbling a simple scone and jam to a three course meal.   We twice enjoyed dinner in the main hotel 3 Rosette Dining room, the Lady Helen, which exceeded all our expectations.  The food was simply amazing.  Rarely have we stayed anywhere with such friendly and welcoming staff.  Without doubt the handpicked staff are a great asset to the hotel and all of those we met were not only a pleasure to talk to but they ensured our stay was both comfortable and enjoyable.  The Estate grounds are beautifully maintained and we enjoyed sauntering along both the short and longer walks which were filled with the fragrance of the bluebells in the wooded areas.  We visited the stud farm with its 5 resident TB stallions and we had such a fun time shooting clays on the Wednesday morning where Shane allowed me to feel so relaxed (I had never shot before) that within a few shots I was hitting the clays. He also gave my husband some excellent tips during his lesson.  All three of us got along so well and during the few hours we spent with Shane we had such a hoot.  The history of Mount Juliet is amazing - from the time the name for the Estate was chosen to the present day.  My only regret is that I only had one Spa treatment and that we did not stay longer.  Although I think if we had we may just have been a little too spoilt!.  We are desperate to return during the Autumn.months and one never knows we may just try our hand at golf!",5,2013,05,18
239,Just Perfect!,"Just back from a glorious 24 hour escape to the beautiful Mount Juliet.

Our stay was simply perfect from start to finish.  A beautful room overlooking the rear of the house. A truly fabulous meal in the lovely Kendal's Brasserie complete with extra heplings of butter drenched, glorious purple sprouting broccoli. My husbands ribeye was cooked to perfection and melt in the mouth gorgeous. Breakfast in our room arrived freshly cooked and hot.  We both indulged in wonderful back massages and facials in the intimate, quiet, lovely Spa.

Hats off to the charming and gracious staff.  Sincere thanks for a fantastic break!

We'll be back soon.

239,Wish I Could Have Stayed Longer,"Unfortunately, we were only at this lovely 5 star resort for one night. Beautiful enormous room with wonderful bucolic view of a river and pasture. Comfortable king bed. Excellent dinner at the Club House. Great golf course. Good service. Only complaint was the arbitrary closing of the swimming pool 15 minutes early at 7:45 pm which denied me the short swim that I so badly needed.",5,2013,05,09
239,A most relaxing break,"Mount Juliet house and estate offers a most relaxing break in luxurious accommodation and wonderful surroundings.  Excellent and unfussed service. Great food.
Walks through the wooded grounds, along the riverbank, and through the stud farm are most enjoyable.  The estate presents a different aspect in each season and the young Spring born foals were with their dams in the paddocks during our visit.",5,2013,05,09
239,Birthday heaven,"Spent two nights in the Rose Cottage compliments of my family. From the moment we checked in we were made to feel very welcome and relaxed. This estate is amazing as was our accommodation. The decor was warm and inviting, spacious rooms and beds you just didn't want to get out off. Breakfast and evening meals were also served to a very high standard and an enjoyable experience.  Will definitely be back.",5,2013,05,07
239,Perfection!,"My boyfriend and I recently stayed here for his birthday. From the moment we checked in, the whole experience was perfect! We were upgraded to Rose Cottage which was amazing- plush, spacious, cosy and homely with a great view of the golf course. The Presidents bar was great for some lunch and a glass of wine to unwind after the journey. Next to the pool, the both times we were in the pool we had it to ourselves which was nice- it would have been great to have a jacuzzi also! Dinner at Kendals was faultless- beautiful view, great food and excellent service. 
The whole stay was sprinkled with little surprises for my boyfriends birthday which was a lovely touch! Everyone we met were really friendly and welcoming. 
Our only regret is that we didn't stay longer. Next time we will use one of the bikes to explore the beautiful estate more. One thing is for sure, there definately will be a next time!",5,2013,04,28
239,Questions??,"This was my 6th annual visit to Mount Juliet. This year we met with another couple on my recommendation. The estate is as beautiful as ever, although some of the rooms appear to becoming a little shabby, but I would understand that & no doubt future maintenance will take place. I have two issues (as opposed to complaints!) Firstly,  The Dining room in the main house, both for dinner & breakfast really needs some soft background music, it was stiflingly quiet. It appeared to us that this year the serving staff have become very formal? Way too much 'sir & madam' painfully so! I do understand that some guests may like the formality of this, however on my previous visits this wasn't my experience. Perhaps the previous servers 'read' the dining guests & addressed us accordingly.  My second issue (& this happened the previous year) The use of the word 'package' & 'supplement' at the dining table, (combing it with sir & madam, doesn't take the sting out) It really downgrades the whole experience. Our bill leaving the hotel was almost €400, so I really have an issue with the package/supplement wording. Mount Juliet should take the hit on the steak and scallops or whatever food it is or else incorporate into the cost elsewhere! The staff in general ate excellently Irish!!  Finally, I am currently at a hotel that offers a complimentary glass of  champers/cava at check in, what a nice touch?..",4,2013,04,20
239,Idyllic retreat,"Beautiful large room in the main house with a view of the river and foals. No minibars in the rooms but room service is available. Coffee making facilities in room are basic, a nespresso machine or similar would be nice. 
The breakfast buffet is quite limited but there is excellent brown bread. The cooked breakfast is great, I can really recommend the Eggs Benedict. Breakfast is served in the Lady Helen restaurant in the main house, try to eat there in the evening too, the restaurant has 3 AA rosettes and was wonderful. Kendall's brasserie is good too but has more emphasis on steak and chips etc. 
Nice public areas with lots of squashy sofas and plenty of warm fires by which to read a book. Wifi is free and reasonable. There are attractive low-impact walks around the grounds. The Muzak in the public areas is a bit irritating though, it's not very loud but I did feel sometimes like I was in a huge lift.",5,2013,04,15
239,Magnificent,"Just returned from a family wedding here.  It is a beautiful idyllic estate, magnificently maintained.  The food was superb, and the breakfast in particular was incredible.

But by far the biggest asset is the staff. I have never come across such a consistently high level of service delivered with such warmth and friendliness",5,2013,04,14
239,Their home is your home,"My wife and I spent a few days in the main house in March. As many other reviewers will confirm, the house, the dining, the golf and the estate all superb. However, what really brings us back each time are the wonderful crew who treat everyone as very welcome guests and for whom no request is too much trouble. 
Do bear in mind however that the estate is in the heart of the countryside and bring walking gear if you are not going to play golf. Mount Juliet is easily accessible by road - satnav is useful (but not essential) for the final section off the motorway.",4,2013,04,12
239,Caught in time...,"Been to Mt Juliet several times over the years since it was a private home.  The evolution of the estate is truly remarkable given the headiness of the go-go years in Ireland.  The grounds and facilities maintain the old charm of the original estate.  The service is excellent.  Good number of Dubliners weekend there.  The manor house and rooms could use some work...refresh paint, etc. 
The pool also requires some work refreshing stained curtains, etc.  The obvious depreciation of the estate will require action to maintain its uniqueness.",4,2013,04,05
239,A fantastic stay at the most beautiful hotel!,"My husband and I and our 2 children stayed in Mt Juliet estate last Thursday the 28th of March. We were staying in the main house which was just beautiful! Our room was very big and comfortably fit all four of us! The facilities were fantastic for kids, we took the bikes from outside the door and went around the estate! There was a lovely playground for the kids. The pool was also a big hit! The baby loved it as it was heated!! That evening the hotel were great at organising a babysitter for us as we enjoyed an amazing meal in the main restaurant! We could not fault the restaurant, food and service all excellent! This is a fantastic hotel that has great luxury but also accomdated children and has plenty to do!! We highly recommend it and will be back!",5,2013,04,04
239,December disappointment,"Why wife and I try to take a weekend away in early December each year ahead of the crazy season, this year we took a two-night break in Mount Juliet. 

It really is a nice spot, attentive staff etc. however, the Christmas fair which runs for three weeks in December is overbearing! For a five-star hotel, they let themselves down with the focus and priority they give the Market. The Kendels restaurant caters for the Market, so guests have no daytime place to eat & relax, rather be force-fed and rushed on, by the admission of the manager ""as we need to get as many covers as we can on that table""....WOW, thanks for making me feel special!  I actually said that quote to the hotel staff, who just shrugged their shoulders and said that's the way it is during December. It would be nice then if they said that on their website - ""Three star experience during December""! 

It's obviously a cash cow, but hotels need to be sure of what they are, a five star resort or a thoroughfare for thousands of people daily. 

Nice hotel, just not in December! ",3,2013,03,31
239,"""Oh My--Oh MY"" PURE BLISS!","This review is a little late in coming to you on our opinion on Mt Juliet,we stayed for a few days in December2012 in the main house attending a wedding,which was carried out axactly as planned,the staff are so genuine and helpful,nothing was too much and all requests carried out with a smile.
It is such a relaxing country hotel and the surrounding land a pleasure to walk,cycle,ride around,be it in december ,april or high summer!
golf course very good and well kept.
all the bedrooms seemed very cosy ,and decor in keeping with the style of the house,suites to die for and so roomy,
the lady helen room for dinner was excellant and i could honestly say we had the best venison ever,it cut as if you putting your knife through butter(irish --of course!)the christmas festival was on so there was plenty of action and excitement about.for some unknown reason,iwe do not like the pool---no reason,had a massage,fine.
would we go back?without a doubt.by the way,we attended a wedding there,well done,mt j.!",5,2013,03,30
239,"Close, but no cigar","A surprise visit, arranged by my wife, who (a long, long time ago) learned to drive on the private roads of the estate whilst it was still privately owned. We (and a friend) had a two night deal here with golf included. Our room(s) were in the main house which has the authentic faded Anglo Irish feel. Above average size, with ""old fashioned"" Bathroom fittings. Very pleasant outlook over the river. The first evening we ate in the restaurant (Kendals) which overlooks the driving range (separate from the main house). Nothing stood out on the menu but overall we had a very pleasant meal. Breakfast both mornings was taken in the Lady Helen restaurant - really lovely room (try to get the window table) & a very nice selection of fresh dishes from which to choose.
For our second evening meal we decided to go for the Tasting Menu with wines in the LH restaurant. A really good choice although some of the dishes were more regular portion than
tasting. Yes I know, we didn't have to eat all that was put before us but it seemed a shame not to. A nice touch was a surprise delivery (not ordered or requested) to the table of a plate of hand made chocs (We think our server must have overheard us discussing  a birthday celebration) 

We had 2 rounds of golf on the estate which were again very pleasant but we were perhaps
expecting more of a ""resort"" experience than we received.

Our main disappointments were

1) How grubby/dusty the public rooms were. We also had the impression that guest rooms were only superficially cleaned .
2) Golf : No starter on the 1st Tee with Tees/Scorecard/Welcome etc
3) Golf : No staff in the Halfwayhouse - at Mid-day..........
4) Golf : Ladies Restroom at the HalfwayHouse was not cleaned on a daily basis  

Overall : A really lovely place, very peaceful & relaxing. With more attention to detail, this could really make the top 10 of ""must visit"" hotels & golf.",3,2013,03,27
239,Relaxing weekend,"Booked a two night, 1 dinner package off the Mount Juliet website for my wife's birthday weekend. Immediately contacted by email to see what dinner, spa or activity bookings we would be interested in. All bookings requested made effectienly for us. On arrival very impressed by surroundings. We had a river room room in the old house. Right on the top floor. Room and bathroom both spotless and well appointed. Nice view also. Had dinner in Kendals restaurant on both evenings. Very impressed with food quality and service. Plenty of good walks around the estate. Also used the SPA.Treatments were good if not great and staff friendly. One thing that initially annoyed me was that the SPA, Pool, Kendals restaurant etc are in a different, unconnected building to the old house. This was not clear on the website. However by the end of the stay we didn't even think about it, and was actually nice walking back to the main house after dinner on Saturday evening, even though we were offered a lift by the hotel shuttle. Breakfast very nice on both days. All in all a very enjoyable trip. Would stay again and would recommend to a friend.",5,2013,03,27
239,Wonderful Break,"This is a wonderful hotel and every staff member we met was fantastic. We stayed in the Club House rooms which were beautifully decorated and ate in the Lady Helen restaurant where the food was super. In the restaurant we had possibly the nicest server we've ever encountered. Morris was so friendly and helpful and was full of tips and information about the estate, Kilkenny and the restaurant itself. He really is brilliant at his job and is a credit to the hotel and restaurant! Breakfast in the clubhouse was well stocked, nothing you could have wanted for. Overall it was a superb experience and one I have told many people about since returning!",5,2013,03,26
239,Great relaxing break!,"Booked a two night break with one evening meal off the Mount Juliet web site. On check in we were upgraded to a room in the old house which was a bonus. Unfortunately we could not get our dinner in the old Helen restaurant as this was booked out (we had tried a week before we were going on our break). Thankfully Kendals restaurant was top class and we doubted the old Helen could have been much better. Great choice on their menu and very few supplements for those (like us) who are on the inclusive dinner package. Staff in Kendals were friendly and the overall atmosphere in the restaurant was really good. The bars in the clubhouse and in the old house were quiet enough but I suppose it's not for the bars that people go to mount juliet for! Our room in the old house was fine, it was really warm even though the radiators never seemed to be on. It was small but adequate and clean. Bed was comfortable and we had a really good sleep. Breakfast in the old Helen was excellent with great choices of hot food from a menu. Service here again was excellent. All in all we had a really enjoyable break, very relaxing with great food and nice staff. Will be recommending Mount Juliet to our friends & families.",5,2013,03,25
239,The Finest of the Fine,"I have just returned from a weekend in Mount Juliet Hotel and cannot begin to describe how truly wonderful the place is.  We arrived Friday evening tired and weary and John the Porter took charge immediately as he came out to greet us and took our luggage and lead the way to reception and then to our room.  The reception staff were so friendly and check in took about a minute.  On arrival to our room our first impression was jaw dropping.  We had a river view and although it was one room, it was made up of a lovely sized sitting room then bedroom with huge bed and the thickest pillows I've ever come across!  My husbad usually goes hunting for extra pillows but there wasn't a peep out of him.  The view was stunning with the river Nore sailing past at speed as there had been quite a lot of rain (really, in Ireland?!!!).  Beyond the river is a stud farm where you could see mares with their very new foals larking about and beyond that again, forrest.  We dragged ourselves down to the bar for a well deserved pint of the black stuff and Edwyn the bar man was a peach!  Really friendly and when asked, gave us the low down on things to do, places to see etc.  Lovely guy.  We went up to the Presidents Bar for dinner (well, Ireland were playing football against Sweden (they drew) and we were told there was a tv in the bar, hence the (husbands) decision)!  Food was excellent and the service was second to none.  After a good nights sleep we had a sumptious breakfast.  Fresh fruit followed by the tastiest Eggs Benedict on smoked salmon - I want the chef to come home with me!  After a lovely day we were joined by two friends who live close by, for dinner.  They decided to stay the night as they didn't want to drive and thankfully they had a room available in the Rose Cottage.  They did a very good deal for them on a last minute basis and the ROOM was pretty much their own private cottage.  We had a peek in and, like the hotel, high end, high quality and first rate.  We had dinner in the Kendalls restaurant and the food was superb.  I had a mushroom starter followed by a goats cheese pasta dish and I have to say it was probably the nicest meal I've ever tasted, ever (no offence darling Mum and husband!!!).  We finished up back in the hotel with hot whiskeys (it was cold out in our defense) and then had another great night's sleep followed by another fantastic breakfast for all four of us.  The menu is truly fabulous with kippers, porridge etc.  All in all, the hotel is so beautiful, so well appointed, lovely and quiet, friendly staff, log fires roaring away, people reading, the tinkling of laughter coming from the dining room.  I truly cannot recommend this place highly enough for a totally relaxing weekend away from it all and the nicest staff and clientele.  I want to go back and I want to go back now!!!",5,2013,03,25
239,Excellent Spa Experience,"Recently I booked a pregnancy massage in the Mount Juliet Spa. 
It was the best massage I had in my life. 
I am six months pregnant And I can say I was little bit worried as I did not know what to expect. 
My therapist Sinead was just great, very gentle and she knew what my needs and expectations are. 
It was my first night after the massage without any pains. Great!!!
I will be definetely back in 4 weeks time for another massage. 
Thank you Mount Juliet Spa and big thank you to Sinead. ",5,2013,03,22
239,Great place but with a few negatives dragging it down!!,"We stayed here on Saturday the 16th and Sunday the 17th of March on a two night B&B and dinner on one evening package.  The hotel is fabulous and we stayed in the manor house (main house).  I booked a classic room and dinner in Kendals restaurant on the Sunday evening. I tried to book the Lady Helens restaurant a couple of weeks in advance for the Saturday night but I could not get a table, which was disappointing as we were guests of the hotel.  

On Saturday we checked in at around 2 PM. Our room was not ready so we decided to wait in the bar and have a coffee. The bar was really nice to sit in and the service was good. We had booked spa treatments for 3 PM so at 2:40 we decided to check if our room was ready. I was told that the room was ready and a very disinterested receptionist handed me a key, and said you are in room 21 and then ushered us away. I stopped and asked were the room was and after making a face and rolling her eyes she replied that it was on the 1st floor. Before I could respond to this, one of the other staff members, who was clearly more helpful, stepped in and said that he would show us to the room and take our bags.

The room was to the left of the entrance on the 1st floor.  The room was really nice and was nicely furnished, it was very small but we were happy enough. We then went and had our spa treatments (full body massage each) which was really enjoyable.  After this we went to the Presidents bar for a bite to eat, we found this to be over priced for bar food and the quality only okay.

We then went back to our room to relax for a while and we realized that the TV remote was missing, the safe was broken, the fridge was not stocked and the room service menu page was missing from the book. I rang reception and they sent up the menu and we finally got a TV remote about 1 hour later.  Later on we found that the room got really warm and the cause for this was that the radiator was stuck on and could not be turned off. As a consequence we had to sleep with the window open and didn’t sleep well as we could hear lots of noise from outside as we were right beside the entrance to the hotel.

The next morning we went for breakfast which was lovely with a great selection to choose from.  When we returned to the room reception rang and offered an upgrade to a river view room for the second night because of the problems we had had. This was very welcomed and was a really nice gesture by the hotel. The room its self (room 22) was miles apart from the other room. It was large and very comfortable with an amazing view. However oddly enough it did not have a fridge or stereo were the other room had. If you are staying at the hotel I would suggest paying the extra money for this room as it is streets apart.

We then went and did the clay pigeon shooting and archery, the guy instructing us could not have been more helpful and made it really good fun.  After this we went horse riding and again we had a great time. I’m a total novice and the girl instructing us was great and very helpful. I would highly recommend both of these activities.

At 9PM we went to Kendals for dinner (this was included in the price of our package). The restaurant was not busy, for our starter we both had Carpaccio of Veil and for our main course we ordered the salmon and a fillet steak but we were told that they had none of either of these left, so we ordered the rib-eye and trout. We both found the starter to be only okay as the veil was cut so fine that you could barely get it off the plate and it had a big blob of sour cream on top of it. Our substitute main courses were nice but we were really disappointed by the fact that the other two mains we ordered were not available. This isn’t acceptable for a 5 star resort and if they don’t have them they should not be on the menu.  We ordered the selection of sorbets and a pecan and apple crumble for desert, neither of which we finished as they were not very nice, thumbs down for Kendals.

On check out I thought the bill seemed a little high but on quickly checking over the bill I didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary so I paid. When I arrived home I examined it in greater detail and found that I had been charged 90 euro for dinner in Kendals on the Sunday night. I rang the hotel and they told me that I had had my inclusive dinner in the Lady Helen restaurant on the Saturday night. When I explained I did not they apologised and promised to charge the 90 euro back to my account.    
 
All in all the location and setting is lovely but I felt it was let down by the customer service and quality of food which I feel is all well over priced for the standard received. Yes we were upgraded for the second night, which does go some way to redeeming the hotel but to then make another mistake and over charge on the bill was a bit much. I spent over 1000 euro for two nights on accommodation, food and activities and to have that number of problems with check-in, the room, food quality, not being able to get a table in the main restaurant and being over charged on the bill is simply not good enough.",3,2013,03,20
239,nice weekend break,"stayed in clubhouse, fabulous room, cosy bed, right next to leisure centre, spa, bar, and kendals restaurant, unbelievably convenient for everything we wanted. were offered upgrade to main hotel but declined as its a bit of a walk from restaurant and leisure centre. food and service at kendals was top notch. goats cheese starter was not nice at all, but choc fondant dessert was the best ive ever had. sat by the open fire in the bar for a drink afterwards. really nice evening.
pool area is nice, sauna, steam room, but no jacuzzi...?? not a big deal. breakfast was really nice buffet and plenty of choice. the only thing that annoyed me was that they ask on the check in form what newspaper you would like for the morning, and then at check out we were charged for it. i only read the paper at breakfast and they had the paper there for free anyway. not exactly a big cost, but i just don't like that sneaky charge. would i return? definitely. ill bring the clubs next time.",4,2013,03,18
239,"Not family friendly, you pay top prices but have limited access to facilities.",Booked in as a Christmas present for my wife. We have a young baby and it was our first time away. The website promotes it as a family friendly venue. I booked well in advance and requested a cot. we were disappointed to be put on the 1st floor with no lift. We requested a ground floor room and were told the only one they had was a disabled room with no bath. We obviously need a bath for the baby so we took the upstairs room. We had to ask 3 times for the cot and it finally arrived at 10.30pm! The dining room is also not suited to young family's and we had to leave before our meal was finished. The next day we decided to go for a swim around 1pm but were told that no kids were aloud in the pool between 12-3pm as it was reserved for members. The pool was totally empty!!!At no point was I told that I was paying 5 star prices for limited access to the facilities. This is no way to treat paying guests. This is a couples place and should not be marketed towards family's.,1,2013,03,17
239,A romantic retreat with countryside comfort,"Mount Juliet house is old world elegance, cosy and comforting with rooms that won’t disappoint you.

Room 19 called ‘The Earl of Carrick’, is a river view room overlooking the river Nore which from the window looks like a silvery gash in a lush green landscape.

The room is large with a walk in wardrobe and large bathroom with separate shower. Natural light is good and clever use of fabric and a calming colour scheme adds character to the room.

A deep pile carpet muffles the sound of creaking floorboards beneath. Window shutters and sash windows add authenticity to the country house feel.

There are in room tea and coffee making facilities but no mini bar or in room dining except for room service breakfast.  This does not detract from the experience.

In the evening with curtains drawn, well placed mirrors reflect lights of different shapes and sizes which add interest to the room.

The drawing room and other public rooms are magnificent and we loved the wood burning fire in the hall.

There are seemingly endless activities such as equestrian, fishing, golf, walking, but we were happy enough to enjoy the immediate surroundings of the country house and sinmply do nothing.

If you are travelling down from Dublin, then Kilkenny City and castle is well worth a visit or stop off a few miles before Mpoount Juliet in a little place called Bennetsbridge where you can get a decent coffee and home cooking in Nicholas Mosse.

If you like picturesque villages then close to Mount Juliet is the hidden away village called St. Mullins. 

The Bircher muesli let breakfast down just a little but for dinner my goodness a delicious dining experience awaits you.

We ordered the ‘Lady Helen signature tasting menu’ for dinner and we were bowled over by the presentation and taste of each of the eight course tasting menu. 

We love food and enjoy visiting some of the most respected restaurants in Ireland and abroad. The food served at ‘The Lady Helen’ on this evening 14th March was so incredible it was simply the best we have ever tried anywhere. The chef was in such a good mood.  

If the opportunity arises and if Head Chef Ken Harker and brigade Rowe are on duty you are in for a real treat.  The food they produced has to be the stuff Michelin stars are made of and we can’t wait to return.",4,2013,03,16
239,Lovely but a tad corporate,"Mount Juliet is a lovely estate, set in one of Ireland's most bucolic regions. Surrounded by stud farms and with an idyllic river flowing past, you could not ask for a more beautiful landscape. The main house is gorgeous, with ivy climbing the walls, and the greeting is first-rate. We stayed in a second-floor corner suite, with great views. The bedroom was huge and attractively furnished, though it was dated and bland. The age of the house made for uneven floors, so the armoire doors wouldn't stay shut, and just over all the feeling was not quite five-stars. Also, the sitting room was nothing short of dreary. The window looked at a rooftop and the driveway, and it was dark and depressing. Some cheerful furniture and good lighting would have made this a room to use for something other than storing our bags.

The bathroom was large and nice, though the fixtures, if memory serve, were kind of Continental cheesy euro stuff, not the high-end English and marble you'd expect.

The grounds and activities were all quite good. The golf course is solid, not an Irish gem, but playable. The service in the pro shop and the attitude of some of the grounds staff was pretty lacking, to be honest. Some guy scolded me for hitting some short chips to their practice green, when there was no sign, and I was not taking divots (I'm a low single digit, and GWAA member, and generally know what I'm about on a golf course.) The riding facility was very good, and the hack was pleasant, even if we did a bit too much walking and the galloping and jumping were pretty limited compared to what we've had at places like Skibo, Ballyfin, Lucknam Park, etc. but better than Gleneagles and a few others. There was a nice opportunity for my wife to hop over fences at the end of the ride, though, and the overall setting is just stunning.

The food was better than expected, and service excellent. The setting is fabulous if you get a window table. Room service could be slow. Overall, considering we had exceedingly dreary weather, we had a very nice stay at Mount Juliet, and it is definitely a property I woud recommend if you are going to be anywhere nearby. Because of the size of the place, it does have a tinge of the corporate feel, and I wouldn't be surprised in conferences were a big part of their business.

Mount Juliet is a first-rate property and with a little investment in furnishings and fixtures could be a true five star establishment.",4,2013,03,14
239,Parkland Paradise,"We stayed for 1 night with our 15 month old at Mount Juliet. The Estate is in a very rural location but is well signed from a few miles out and easily located. On entering the Estate gates and driving past luxury homes and the fine Golf course the place just cries out Class. We checked in at the old Mansion House Hotel, where the friendly staff made you feel welcome and promptly arranged for a butler called John? ( foreign lad), to lead the way back up to the club house rooms where we were staying. He was very friendly, genuinely helpful and even called back with a toy pony for our little one. He explained every thing we need to know. The club room was part of the old Stables conversion which surrounds an original courtyard. The room was spotlessly clean, simply decorated with a large comfortable bed, dresser, two chairs, table and ample wardrobe space. The pillows and duvet are the most comfortable either of us have ever experienced.  All the usual facilities were present including tea, coffee, bottled water and a 42 inch wall mounted TV.  There were double doors which opened up to a small balcony overlooking the golf course. The bathroom was small but modern and practical with no bath tub but a superb walk in multi head power shower. 
Our room was next door to the leisure centre which had the most delightful pool with its waterfall and little cave area not to mention a very secure and shallow baby pool. This Hotel certainly caters for families with children with the pool permitting children for several hours each morning and evening. A superb playground is behind the club house and cycling, trekking, fishing etc are all available for the kids and grown ups alike. The gym is well equiped with a sauna and steam room also in the leisure centre. We did not visit the Spa during our short stay. 
We decided to have dinner in the Presidents Bar/Conservatory which had a selection of simple wholesome food that was really tasty with service being second to none. It is pricey but not as expensive as the two main restaurants which are very fancy with an emphasis on Gourmet Dining. 
Breakfast was in Kendals and was a real treat. great selection of fruit, cereals, juices and the hot buffet. Additional items from potatoe cakes to smoked salmon could be ordered from the menu. The fruit, musili and yogurt cocktail is recommended as is the pans chocolate. In fact it is all good and your eggs are cooked to order. If it's not on the counter the staff will go and make it. The Staff at Mount Juliet are superb and a credit to the management.
I was late for my Golf Tee off time and the man in the pro shop (forgotten his name) was great even discounting the round just in case I didnt get it finished. I did finish it and what a pleasure tp play. One of the best courses I have played and I was joined for the finishing holes by a local member called Alan who was as friendly as the Staff. They really are nice people at Mount Juliet.
Another thing which did get my attention was the amount of CCTV cameras and even a security patrol van driving around the estate. The entrance has notices warning that the area is monitored and patrolled. This for us was reassuring especially with children playing and walking throughout the estate. This is a great crime deterrent ( even tho the area is probably safe anyway)
On check out we walked around the Main House Hotel. It is old and charming with antique furnishings and elegant surroundings. Certainly very charming and would appeal to many especially couples, however as a family with young kids I do believe the clubhouse is perfect.    Well Done Mount Juliet. We hope to return only for longer next time.",5,2013,03,12
239,Excellent friendly service and fine dining too.,Every single member of staff we encountered during our stay was genuinely friendly and helpful and it really added to our experience.  Dinner at The Lady Helen was top class from start to finish and shouldn't be missed.  We enjoyed lovely walks around the grand estate and had delicious lunches at The President's Bar and a very enjoyable dinner at Kendal's Restaurant both located at the Lodge.  The warm log fires and cosy lounges were great places to unwind after a long walk. We stayed in a superior room in the main house which was spacious and comfortable. If you want to get away for a few days of R&R and want to enjoy excellent food and service then Mount Juliet is the place to go.,4,2013,03,09
239,Top class food and beautiful surroundings,"We have just come back from a weekend at Mount  Juliet. The food it has to be said is out of this world. They take such care even preparing a salad. A Michelin star in the making. The grounds are beautiful and we enjoyed a terrific tour given by estate manager, Des. Staff are very helpful but service can be slow sometimes. Rooms are fine, very clean and lovely and big with a big bathroom. Could do with a better tv and movie options for a rainy afternoon. The only thing I did not like was the fact that the pool and spa are a walk from the main hotel. Other than that I would recommend it and we intend to come back with our kids. ",5,2013,03,07
239,Fabulous hotel - amateurish staff,"We stayed in Mount Juliet for a weekend at the end of February 2013. I had some misgivings before we actually went there as, although I had booked a restaurant and spa treatments, I received two further phone calls asking me if I wanted to book either. This concern was compounded on arrival when we were faced with a very disinterested receptionist and shown to an absolute minute room which was freezing cold. To be fair, when we mentioned the temperature it was immediately addressed and we proceeded to have a nice evening in the bar in the Clubhouse (although the food offerings in the bar are extremely limited). After a lovely breakfast the next day we attended for our massages in the spa. My massage was distinctly average and marred by the fact that the therapist had extremely cold hands.When I mentioned this at reception on the way out, I was made to feel quite uncomfortable. The rest of the weekend was very enjoyable and we had some lovely walks around the grounds. Dinner in Kendalls was pleasant, although not spectacular. I should mention the lovely barman in the main house who really helped us enjoy our stay. Overall, the house and grounds of Mount Juliet are fantastic - five star. A lot of the staff could, however, benefit from some training to match this level.",4,2013,03,06
239,My new favourite retreat!,"A fantastic weekend in Mt.Juliet, it is a magical place. The main house is so beautiful as is Hunter's Lodge / The Club House. The grounds are like what you would imagine Narnia to be with fantastic walks, bicycle or horse rides. Staff are only visible when you need them, your privacy and relaxation seems to be of great importance here. We ate in Kendel's which is in the Club House and both the breakfast and dinner was really superb. The added touches of ''home made'' marmalade, brown bread, boxty and scones made breakfast a delight and dinner was served with a smile, nothing was a bother or a problem. I have read some of the negative reviews here and I just don't think that those guests bothered to experience the added value Mt.Juliet offers from it's staff, grounds and beauty.",5,2013,02,25
239,Oh the Chocolate Fondant!,"I had such a lovely weekend here with my boyfriend last year. We ate in the Lady Helen on the Friday night, which was utterly beautiful, they really put  alot of care into the menu. I will say there was a lot of game and unusual ingrediants and so for anyone with a taste for plain food it may not be for you.

The pool is great and wasn't at all busy when we udes it on Saturday afternoon.

The staff were friendly throughout. We were in the Clubhouse which made the bar and spa easily accessible, otherwise you have a short walk over from the Main house or cottages",5,2013,02,23
239,Blissful experience,"Arrived last thursday for a one night stay with 8 course tasting menu. Started with a wonderful indian head massage, excellent value at 30 euro. then down for a pre-dinner drink followed by a wonderful meal. we didnt even have to choose the wines! fabulous room (No 2) with the best pillows I've ever slept on, an excellent breakfast served to our room and complete tranquillity. had a lovely walk through the paddocks before checkout. best hotel experience I've had in ireland and excellent value for money. we will definitely be back.",5,2013,02,23
239,Great February Stay,"One night stay in Mount Juliet with eight course tasting menu. Could not have been  a better antidote to February blues. Friendly welcome, wonderful bedroom facilities and delicious and comprenensive tasting menu. Outstanding value for money. Serious attention to detail, this hotel deserves your attention. Walk after great breakfast made this a memorable stay.",5,2013,02,22
239,Magical setting for self-catering celebratory weekend,"We were a party of twelve, a family with a very significant birthday to celebrate. What better location than Mount Juliet, it surpassed all our expectations, while remaining quite chilled out , thus  perfect for the younger and the more senior generations among us.  

We stayed at two Rose Garden lodges 55 and 56 which were conveniently located about 200 m from the main hotel. Both beautifully appointed and with all possible comforts, rainshowers, dining room plus living room with gas fire, plenty of glasses etc. Equestrian centre was very well run.  

We dined at the fine dining the first night, magnificent food, wine quite pricey but hey, once in a lifetime. Second night, much more informally we dined at Kendalls restaurant at the Golf Club Pavilion and it was superb, top marks for a  varied children's menu also.  

Pool is a novel shape with a cute grotto, and the golf course is gorgeous with some pathways winding through it for the non-golfer. Staff were all friendly, pleasant and obliging. The only fault I could find was the lack of lighting when walking or driving through the estate to find the self-catering houses as all the signs were there by day but of course at night, it was impossible to see. It could give one a rocky start to circumnavigate the estate fruitlessly at midnight after arrival (which happened to one of our party, ouch).  

Otherwise faultless, even our photos in the house look magnificent. The beds were very generously proportioned and I can recommend the Piers de Morgan superior room on the ground floor of the hotel with reasonably private garden as a bonus, which would be especially lovely in summer, Bliss. Enjoy.",5,2013,02,21
239,Lovely weekend despite a few hiccups.,"Went here with my family for a night away. We stayed in the Rose Cottages which are located a 5 minute walk from the hotel. The staff were so lovely and were always offering lifts in their shuttle car to the cottages even though they were a stones throw away.
The road out of the cottages to the bar at night had no lighting whatsoever and it was impossible to see where we were going- this could be improved.
We checked in on the Saturday morning and had rang ahead to book bikes for the family. We were told that there around 10 bikes available but they don't take bookings and that it was first come first serve.
When we arrived we were told that the bikes were all 'being repaired' and that there were none available. We went for lunch in the bar and came back an hour later to find that there were bikes available but had just been taken by another family. Disappointed, we went for a walk around the grounds instead. There are plenty of walks and loads to see around the grounds - beautiful scenery and a lovely stud farm. While on our walk we got a call to say that the bikes were back and available for collection so we went back and took off for a few hours. They could do with a bit of upgrading and a drop of oil, but they did the job.
There is plenty to do between walks, cycles, chipping and putting and the pool for activities. The cottages themselves were gorgeous, very spacious, well equipped, lovely and warm. However, we asked for an extra bed as there were 5 of us and it only slept 4. We got an old squeaky uncomfortable fold out bed which wasn't ideal but as we were only there for one night it did the job.
We went to the bar again for dinner and enjoyed a few drinks out in the conservatory. The staff were lovely and friendly and we very much enjoyed our night.
We all had a lovely weekend, depsite the little hiccups.

The hotel is very secluded (barely any phone signal!) so don't be expecting a night out nearby, but it's lovely for a relaxing weekend away.

The hotel is not cheap but we had a voucher. I'm glad we got to experience it.",4,2013,02,20
239,Fantastic every time!,"This is our 3rd trip to Mount Juliet in the 14 months and it never disappoints.  This time we went as my other half was taking part in the 10K Run held at Mount Juliet.  We stayed in room 8.  Oh! what bliss.  Giant comfy beds, excellent breakfasts, large rooms, beautiful walks, nice pool, playground and lots to keep our 4 year old entertained.  Worth every penny, can't wait for our next trip.",5,2013,02,19
239,Nice hotel but service needs attention,"Hello, my friend and I stayed at Mount Juliet recently. I have been to the hotel many times for afternoon tea and loved it! So much so that I decided to persuade my friend to join me for a one night stay there. We booked a twin superior room in the main house. We were really looking forward to the experience of staying there but when we arrived we got off to a very bad start.

We arrived at about 3.10 pm and when we arrived at reception we were told that the room wasn't ready and promptly told (without asking) that check-in wasn't until 4pm and that we would be called when the room was ready. In any event we decided to wait in the lounge and had tea but no phone call! At about 4.10pm, I went back to reception to see what the story was and was told that the room was in fact ready but that they forgot to call us as they were so busy! This is surprising as we saw other people being shown to their room as we had tea in the lounge. We were shown to our room in any event but it wasn't set out as a twin! I went back to reception to point this out and having acknowledged their mistake, we had to wait a further 30 mins while the room was prepared as it should have been. For me this is an unacceptable delay especially as we had ordered a twin months in advance.

By now it was 4.30pm and having travelled from Dublin we just wanted to get to our room to rest. I've stayed at many hotels in Ireland and in Europe and have never had such a delay in getting to my room. After all, this was supposed to be a superior room but the service was anything but superior! The porter said that our room would be turned down at about 6.30pm but this didn't happen! Now I can live without my room being turned down but if I'm told it would happen, I expect that it will happen. Perhaps the worst thing for us about this is that nobody in the hotel was a bit bothered about the poor check-in service. 

The food was excellent in general and we dined in Kendals restaurant. The carpet in the dining room and passage area to the rooms is very worn and tired. I saw a previous review pointing this out and they are not exaggerating! The windows were dirty, a small thing but something that a hotel of this class should attend to especially as the windows offer views to the river.

On the plus side the staff in the dining area were very helpful (thanks Anne-Marie) and the breakfast was excellent. The room was very spacious, clean and most importantly for me it was quiet at night. We enjoyed a nice long walk around the estate and visited the stables. In all it's a lovely place to visit and stay but the check-in service is not where it should be. If any of the management team read this review,  please try to improve on the quality of service offered to customers as people will notice and not return!

239,Perfect for 1 night chill out!,Arrived in Mount Juliet on thursday afternoon.  Had a nice leisurely swim in the pool before dinner.  Had delicious 8 course taster menu in the beautiful lady Helen restaurant  (compliments to the chef). Started dinner at 7 o'clock and left the restaurant at 10 o'clock!.  Service was excellent with explanation given for all courses.  Had a nightcap by the fire in the lounge before retiring to our luxurious room for the night.  Breakfast next morning didn't disappoint with a great selection on the menu to suit everybody.  Finished off our stay with a lovely stroll around the estate. A few minor details like no biscuits in the room and having to ask for more milk didn't take from our overall experience.  Well worth paying the little bit extra to stay in the house. Love this place!,5,2013,02,05
239,Not to be missed!,"Stayed last night in utter luxury in this wonderful hotel! Palatial room in the manor house, complete with 7' bed and French doors to a walled garden. Dined on their superb 8 course tasting menu in the Lady Helen restaurant. Relaxed in the lovely leisure centre. Staff throughout excellent. Wonderful breakfast this morning. We will be back!",5,2013,01,25
239,Totally relaxing Christmas at Mount Juliet,"Christmas at Mount Juliet was a tempting prospect which this writer had considered for a few years, but we could not tear ourselves away from our  Christmas preferences in South Kerry  -  something about old habits… We always really enjoyed our Christmas stays in Kerry’s best hotels. However, Christmas 2012 was to be spent at Mount Juliet and its peaceful stud farm estate traversed as it is by the beautiful river Nore. And we certainly had no regrets!

As always we were welcomed back, only this time the General Manager  was there in person at the front door. Reception was good as always. After the long journey from Ulster I gave up rather impetuously after some minutes of queuing at reception and I withdrew to the bar for a short time for a coffee because of others checking in and I could see that the young receptionist was doing her best to cope all alone.  

Accommodation was as expected/requested on the ground floor (a different part of the main house to our previous stays). Having side-stepped a kind offer of our ‘usual room’ which is a higher grade room, I was wondering afterwards how it would work out. i had stayed on the ground floor once before on my own and enjoyed it, so was confident that we would hardly be disappointed. We were  not disappointed. Very comfortable and peaceful as always! One minute’s walk to the Lady Helen or the Tetrarch Bar – heaven for someone who had worked fifty and sixty hours per week in a stressful job for several months on end!

 The Christmas schedule was a quiet affair which suited us, although another couple were to disclose over a drink during our stay that it was too quiet for them. True enough the entertainment in Mr Jenks’s Bar on one evening was a drab enough performance and as it was the only such entertainment it stood out all the more. The solo guitarist was rather melancholic and demonstrated few social skills in his communication with his small audience. That was the only negative of the entire stay and other guests remarked similarly to me.

From John and John (the Carlow brigade) at the front door to Jakob and Eugene in the bar, Louise and her colleagues in Reception, and of course the excellent Aga in Lady Helen to the kitchen staff and accommodation staff, we were treated very, very well. Thank you for making Christmas 2012 a nice memory!

Christmas lunch was in Kendals which is a short walk from the main house. Although a different kitchen and a different team to Lady Helen, it competed well and was a most enjoyable lunch. The menu was noteworthy and service excellent. One of the attentive porters in the main house offered to transport us in the courtesy car to/from Kendals but we opted for the welcome walk. Indeed a pre-lunch walk in the crisp winter air by the banks of the Nore was envigorating.

Earlier in the morning indeed we had been kindly offered courtesy transportation to/from a local church service which I had made an enquiry about as to the time of service. We declined but were grateful for the kind offer. Later indeed we passed the courtesy car on its way to the village with other guests.

Although I had been told some weeks earlier that the house was to be full of guests for Christmas, it did not seem so to us when we were there. Not an issue for us.  There was plenty of seating free, even in the bar before dinner, or later in The Major’s Room. In fact this writer felt just a tad guilty talking in the bar over a drink with a very interesting barman – because I was the only guest present there at 11pm on Cristmas eve. It was a good deal more populated on the night of 27th. Christmas night was also quiet but I felt compelled to go and keep another very pleasant barman company for a while.

I remember sitting in the Morning Room with an open log fire and a good book, and very attentive staff who later served some lovely food to my wife and me. Blissful!

The Lady Helen’s opulent setting and really great food is always the highlight of any stay. It thoroughly deserves its three rosettes. There is almost no other hotel restaurant in Ireland which consistently serves such high quality food.  Congratulations to all concerned! It surely deserves greater recognition. 

Breakfasts were again very enjoyable, much of it due to the hard work of the senior staff, and cook of course!

Whilst I have to be honest and say that I had observed a few basic oversights and repeated blunders in recent visits made by trainee/student waiting staff in Mount Juliet, there was no such inexperience evident this time. 

It was my wife’s birthday on 26th December and although we did not mention it I may have said something when choosing a nice bottle of wine from Aga. It was a very nice touch to find that when petit fours were served there was a subtle birthday congratulatory greeting created with chocolate on the serving slate. It was a lovely surprise delivered by Aga who for us is the star of evening dining at Lady Helen.

Christmas at Mount Juliet met all our wishes. We thank you for the wonderful surprise delivery to our room during our stay. Still enjoying! Thank you for a lovely relaxed Christmas.",5,2013,01,18
239,Used to be annual holiday,"I love mount Juliet really I do. I have been going there annually for over 10 years now. Last year I took a few days out during the summer as usual and enjoyed my stay. The equestrian centre is always a pleasure with really nice staff. 
This wasn't first time staying in the club house rather than the main house. The rooms are pretty small in the club house, mine was very ""compact"". To be honest it was not much cheaper than staying at the main house but was not 5 star standard. 
I always eat in the lady Helen restaurant which is always excellent. This time however, I felt extremely rushed by staff , who were bordering on rude at times. 
There was not much time between courses even, I could not understand the rush as the dining room was half empty. 
This time I actually took some time out to pay attention to detail and it needs a complete updating on decor. Frayed material on chairs, worn bed sheets just doesn't cut it for 5 star these days. Especially now people are looking for more value for money. The leisure centre is very small with limited extras, not 5 star. 
I always imagined my wedding at mount Juliet but I'm having a rethink. Maybe it's a break I need from it to explore other 5 star hotels. One problem is any I've visited so far have been better value and more luxurious. The golf course cannot be beaten however. This year I will break a tradition and not visit. I will miss my annual mount Juliet stay but if there is value and luxury to be had for less elsewhere then I will give it a try! ",4,2013,01,17
239,Pure Luxury!,"Myself and my husband spent two nights in Mount Juliet for a friends wedding last week. We stayed in the second bridal suite - no words to describe the luxury - Absolutely fabulous! Arrived and went to our fabulous room where my husband took some time out in the four poster bed, while I went to the spa for a pedicure and facial - Amazing - Fell asleep it was soooo relaxing - Just what I needed being 7months pregnant. Went to Kendals restaurant in the Hunters yard the first night - really good food and a nice glass of house red - Yummy..... Being pregnant we called the shuttle bus to collect us. Brought from door to door - excellent service! Wedding on the Friday. To start the day, the breakfast was excellent and we were well fed for the day. The wedding - well what can I say - It was a fantastic day! Room, Ceremony, drinks reception, meal and entertainment were all five star quality! Great day and night had by all! Thanks to all involved for making our stay so enjoyable - Great break away!!",5,2013,01,11
239,New Year's Day check-in,"The GOOD: 
The old mansion and its setting.
The rooms are spacious.
The history of the place.
The en suites use Acca Kappa White Musk. 
The hotel is near Kells medieval walled town, which is worth a visit, as is Jerpoint Abbey. 

The BAD: 
Breakfast service by waiters needs a lot of improvement. 
Instead of setting tables for guests who might or might not arrive, waiters should attend to the guests actually in the room, such as checking for milk refills and tea refills and butter refills. 
Not one glance was cast in the way of our or any other table to check all was in order. I would say it was wilful evasion. 
There were 2 slices of toast for 3 people, in effect a half slice for every person - 
the so called 5 star hotel seems to be rationing food. 
The toast was served immediately after being seated. 
No more was offered when main breakfast came. 
2 persons had the full Irish breakfast which was satisfactory, except no toast to eat with it. 
1 person in the group went for the ""Chef's Special"", Boxty (similar to potato cakes) with Eggs, thinking it's great that an Irish hotel is doing something traditionally Irish. 
Unfortunately that's where the surprise ended and the shock began. 
2 tiny ultra floury potato cakes arrived which didn't have any taste of potato. 
Furthermore if one took any of the Chef's Specials that ruled out taking the continental breakfast according to the hotel. 
The hotel doesn't satisfy hunger. 
The room service menu, the club house menu and the restaurants' menus all have pretty limited choices. 
5 of the 25 TV channels the hotel claims to have in its TV guide are not in Rooms 15 and 16 at least. 
No biscuits provided with the tea and coffee in the rooms. 
Several pages from the hotel services book were torn out in both rooms 15 and 16. 
Attention to detail is lacking. 
The hotel should check out Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin to sample a 5 star hotel's breakfast. 
I got one follow up phone call but the second promised follow up phone call never materialised. 
The hotel management rely too much on the house history and the golf clientele to see them through and not enough on service levels.",2,2013,01,08
239,Very enjoyable stay in a really beautiful setting,"I stayed at Mount Juliet for two nights between Christmas and New Year with some of my family.  We had a lovely stay, the staff and friendly and welcoming, and the hotel was very nicely decorated for Christmas.  We ate in the brasserie in the Golf Club on our first night and the food was excellent - we had the tasting menu in the Lady Helen restaurant on our second night and it was just excellent - great service, amazing food and great wines.  Mount Juliet is a really beautiful setting and there are lots of lovely walks around the estate.  I would highly recommend it.",5,2013,01,03
239,"A fantastic stay in a beautiful place, genuinely friendly staff, great equestrian centre.","We had 2 nights in Rose lodge between Christmas and new years eve. Both adults and children (10, 6 and 4) were very happy. Great pool, great pony trek, friendly service, good food(though not perfect). We all left feeling relaxed and looking forward to next stay. ",5,2013,01,01
239,Dream wedding location,"We recently attended the wedding of my brother and his new wife at Mount Juliet. I am usually critical of hotels as I stay in them frequently for business, on this occasion I am floored as I have very little to complain about. My only slight negative comment was the price difference between the bar in the club house and the main house. I appreciate it is more beautiful surroundings but a difference of €1.50 for a glass if wine is a bit extreme. Otherwise a fantastic weekend....",5,2012,12,31
239,Santa Train 2012,"We visited Santa on 21st Dec- very disappointing experience compared to last year, felt it was all about money grabbing this year as 2 trains were booked to go at the same time with the result that checking in area was too small for such crowds & waiting area to see Mrs Claus was completely overcrowded! Mrs Claus did a great job - felt reindeer kept in a small enclosed space & Santa train very disappointing - very poor lighting along the way. Our wait for Santa was not very long but Santa himself was very poor (had an accent) & was hardly able to engage the children in conversation! (Plus being able to hear other Santa's close by did not help!) We will not return next year! Car park too dark also for walk from xmas village to santa check in. Way too commercialised & not enough Xmas magic!",2,2012,12,30
239,Fab!,"A group of us stayed here recently for a work function and we were all very impressed. I haven't stopped talking about my stay since, it was so good! The room was amazing, the staff were very attentive (although the reception staff could be a little friendlier. I was surprised that they didn't ask how I enjoyed my stay when I was checking out) Everyone from the doorman, the bar staff, the restaurant staff, the people in the equestrian centre helped make the stay an enjoyable one. I did horseriding for the first time and loved the experience at Mount Juliet. The grounds are extensive and this was a lovely way to get a tour of the grounds. The horse trainer was really good and is really sensitive to your ability. Some of the others in our group did the clay pigeon shooting and this also sounded like fun.
The meal was superb. The table setting was ideal for our group size as you could hear what everyone around the table was saying. The meal itself was amazing but I would say that the wine pairing was a little on the generous side with the amount that was poured out. I expected small glasses of wine and couldn't finish any of it! But you got a selection of different wines to match each course which was great and I guess the larger glasses mean it is better value...We had the 8 course gourmet taster meal and the food was well selected and very well cooked. Really enjoyable and must be close to Michelan star standard with its taste and inventive dishes.
As for the rooms, well we stayed in the main house and the room I had was fab. It had everything you would expect from a luxury hotel like this and it was a decent size too. The bed was really comfy as well and the view was looking across rolling countryside.
I really can't wait to go back to Mount Juliet, I have been looking at their website already to see when I can return!! I knew it would be a nice place to stay but didn't realise just how nice it is until I stayed there.",5,2012,12,24
239,The Santa Train,"This was a wonderful experience from start to finish. Can I just start by praising Mt. Juliet for brilliant organisation - from the moment you register and check in the organisation is superb. The little touches are there with Santas Elf reading out details about our little man when he walked in - a small but classy touch.

Mrs. Claus storytime was great fun, a really well decorated and themed room, lovely warm personalty in Mrs. Claus. The Train ride was fun - I see other people commenting on the lack of lights etc.. along the route - ok fair enough, but it was sold as a train to see Santa at the end of it, if it was sold as a magical train ride maybe I'd take exception, but it did what it said on the tin, the conductor elf was good craic, and it was extremely pleasant. Santa himself was wonderful, beautifully decorated grotto, nice friendly manner with the kids and a nice gift.

All in all well done Mt. Juliet - a wonderful experience, we will be back next year - it was tremendous value for money - you get over an hours entertainment for the admission fee - that is so worth it!",5,2012,12,24
239,Mount Juliet Santa Train,"I booked the santa train for my 3 year old son, Isaac this year and all of us couldn't wait... the day arrived and i must say, Mount Juliet and it's grounds looked splended.. from the friendly staff welcoming us to the Christmas market's, all in all it created a great festive athmosphere. The santa experience was great, while there was a small delay it didnt diminish the overall experience and in fact it probably made Isaac more excited, isnt that what it's all about! We stayed over-night in the The King of Ossory, a beautiful manor house room, the only down side to our stay was, no room service and if so we couldn't find any menu or get in-touch with anybody to even ask. We are considering our family vacation in MJ next year.",4,2012,12,13
239,Santa Train 2012,"We booked the Santa Train in Mount Juliet this year as we had heard how great it was.  We arrived to what I would say was a cattle mart,  we got to hear Mrs Claus story and brought to the train,  I was thinking that the train was the best part from all the reviews I thought it would have had the grounds lit up a bit better down the back of the golf course was just fields with a few reindeer lit up we were very disappointed.  We then were brought into the waiting area for Santa where the previous hour families had still not seen santa, we were then made to lie up and wait for our names to be called.  we eventaully after 50 minutes got to see Santa which I was really disappointed with as there was no photo to be taken with him.  only for I had my phone with me we would have no memory of Santa 2012.  I wouldnt have even minded paying for the photo on the day seen as the train had been booked well in advance.  We had been to Tayto World last year which was a lot more enjoyable experience and we will be going back there next year.  overall we were very disappointed with the experience of Santa in Mount Juliet.",2,2012,12,11
239,Outstanding,"I have just returned back from Mount Juliet where my wife and I stayed for a very short break to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  From the time we arrived to the time we left, we both had an incredible time.  In fact, we both commented that we could not believe how quick the weekend went.  There were many highlights from the bottle of wine in our room (to congratulate us on our anniversary) to the food which was simply outstanding.

However, there was one person that represented Mount Juliet brilliantly.  Her name was Alex and she was our waitress on Saturday night in Kendal’s.

Alex was Friendly, knowledgeable, professional and very outgoing.  In these tough times, we tend to concentrate on the bad things and not spend any time on the good things.

I would appreciate it if you could please pass on our thanks to Alex for making this weekend one of the best we have ever had,

Hopefully, we get to do this again next year.",5,2012,12,03
239,Quality from start to finish,"Myself, my wife, our 2 friends and 3 kids stayed for a Friday night last week. Everything was as good as a 5 star hotel should be. On arrival the first thing I noticed was a nice welcoming note left by the General Manager, Mr Kirby. Also, the Kids beds were made up with care and attention as is the case with every aspect. Stay here once in your life so you can see what a true 5 star property should be like.",5,2012,11,26
239,excellent afternoon tea,I go there every year and the afternoon tea is excellent. The service is excellent and they are really friendly. Very accommodating for whatever the children wanted and the main hotel is beautifully decorated and peaceful.,5,2012,11,12
239,Flawless stay,"We stayed herein November and we cannot say enough good things about it. They blend beautiful scenic views,luxury and home comforts seamlessly. The staff are some of the most friendly and obliging we have ever encountered. Would recommend this place to anyone without hesitation 10/10",5,2012,11,12
239,5 star service,"Stayed here recently for a two night weekend break which included dinner . I found the whole experience wonderful and very relaxing , we opted for dinner in kendals restaurant on the saturday night .From staff service to the beautiful food we certainly had no complaint .We have stayed here on numerous occasations and it never fails to disappoint . I would have no problem in returning  or recommending Mount Juliet  to anyone , however we did find it expensive for drinks etc .",5,2012,11,08
239,Five star price for 3 star experience,"The following is a copy of correspondence sent  directly to Mount Juliet website at 10 p:m on 2nd November. Four days later ,my e -mail has not even been acknowledged.
""Myself and my husband have just returned from a night in your hotel. I had tried to book a two night break but this was the only time slot available and we took the opportunity as our  time  together is precious. I feel very disappointed with our experience as for the five star price we would certainly not rate it accordingly. The grounds and building are beautiful and after checking in around 3 pm and an hour long walk , we looked forward to relaxing in the bedroom before dinner. Unfortunately the heating was not adequate and after putting on extra jumper and putting up with it for a while my husband called reception. It didn't take long for maintenance to arrive  where they identified one of the radiators wasn't working and an oil filled radiator was supplied. By the time we changed for dinner , we were still cold and had to order hot whiskeys in bar to warm up. When dinner in Lady Helen restaurant being ordered, asked that we be placed near fire/heat. Disappointed no fire lit but was told that this was for customers comfort as room would get too warm (totally disagree!!!). Enjoyed tasting menu and in general good impression apart from glass of red wine which was unpalatable due to corkage. Replacement wine was provided.  Food presentation and taste top class but had to send back coffee as it was not hot . Bedroom had heated up by the time we returned and we had wonderful night's sleep.
Breakfast was good but I must make a point of letting you know that on the Breakfast Menu cover there is a greeting in Irish and I would question the standard of translation - it is an insult to any native speaker.  I pointed this out to reception on check out but was told that she herself had never seen it, but would report it. 
I don't wish to sound so negative but I think Mount Juliet is such a special place and we had looked forward to an equally special experience but did not feel we got that. Rather than tell others of our disappointing experience I feel that I should bring these matters directly to your attention.""
Lack of attention to e-mail has soured experience and I would not return or recommend it to any of my friends.  Better service in lower rated hotels to be had.",3,2012,11,07
239,"Amazing, wonderful service and Beautiful","I got married at Mount Juliet and all my guests stayed on the estate either in the Rose Lodges, Paddocks, Club House or the Mount Juliet House itself. Everyone had an amazing stay. The staff were friendly, warm and sincere. The grounds were spectacularly maintained and there was so much activities to partake in on the grounds from archery to fishing to horseriding to clay pigeon shooting. There is also a great spa and swimming pool! Truly wonderful",5,2012,11,05
239,Lovely setting with charming people,"We stayed here for six days and enjoyed the golf course twice during that time.  A Jack Nicklaus design, it is very playable with wide fairways and beautiful holes.  I stopped several times to take pictures of the trees with red, gold, and orange foliage.  An enchanting time of year to be there.
Many activities were available, including horseback riding and archery, which we enjoyed.  The pool does not allow children between 1-3 in the afternoon, so adults can have some time to themselves then.  Breakfast was lovely in both the main dining room and in the restaurant.  We stayed in the Rose Garden Cottages, which were two bedroom suites with large living rooms, a full kitchen, a washer and dryer, and king-size beds in the bedrooms.  It was perfect for a family.
Golf is fairly expensive, as are the golf carts.  It is possible to walk the course, though, as it is not a particularly challenging terrain.
Mount Juliet also has an 18-hole putting course, which was great fun for the entire family.  There is a spa but book your treatments before you go, as many of the days were fully booked when we arrived.",4,2012,11,05
239,service,had a good one night stay at mount juliet for a work occasion.  I left something behind in my room and was very surprised at the service after I departed to get item returned.  Many phone calls later with unresponded messages I got sorted< definitelty not what you would expect from an establishment promising five star service,3,2012,11,02
239,The best,"I'm giving Mount Juliet only five stars because I can't give it 14. 
It was quite simply the most enchanting experience I've ever had a hotel.  Now, we were in town for a wedding and perhaps they rolled out the red carpet for us (actually they literally rolled out the red carpet for us).
Everything about our experience there was top notch - for the food and the service throughout the estate, I cannot give enough accolades. (At both the wedding reception and our 'private' meals over our stay)

Really I can only say this-do yourself a favor and stay here.",5,2012,11,01
239,Top quality!,"Had a wonderful mid-week stay in Mount Juliet, everything about the place is superb and lived up to expectations.  Greeted by a very friendly lady at reception, and brought to our room by John who also drove us later that evening to the golf club for dinner. The nature of service provided by John typifies all that is good about Mount Juliet – friendly, unpretentious and top quality.  Had dinner in the golf club, which was superb.  Bedroom huge, in old country house style, with plenty of lounge areas downstairs to relax. Breakfast also was excellent. Could not recommend more!!",5,2012,10,31
239,Absolutely amazing!,"Everything about Mount Juliet stands up to the wonderful reviews you read on Trip Advisor. My husband and I were traveling with our 2 year old daughter and the Rose Garden Lodges were perfect accommodations for a family. We stayed for 3 nights and the rooms were very spacious, with comfortable beds, and they are beautifully decorated. I would stay there again if we are lucky enough to ever return. Most nights we ate in the golf clubhouse and the food was delicious! Great service & nice conversation with the bartenders so it was a very relaxed atmosphere. The grounds at Mount Juliet are breathtaking - we enjoyed walks around the property to see the horses and cows. Truly a wonderful experience!",5,2012,10,31
239,Heaven on earth,"My wife and I stayed at Mount Juliet for 3 nights.   What a luxury.   Staff could not do enough for any guest.   I played golf and after all the rain was very surprised how dry the course was, my ball never plugged, the course is truely a great test for any golfer.   My wife went for a spa treatment and was very satisfied and relaxed when she returned.  The rooms are superb, apacious and homely.   From the moment we arrived to when we left our experience was maasing.   I was walking from the car carrying my our bags when the portr pulled up in a car got out and took the bags for us, he is Polish and a lovely guy, he seems to have great knowledge of the old house (now the hotel) and the area, what a pleasure he was.   The reception staff also very friendly as ere the rest of the staff in the hotel and up at Kendals and the golf shop.
All in all a visit to remember and one we will surely repeat in the near future.",5,2012,10,23
239,A pleasant weekend,"Received a weekend away at Mount Juliet as a birthday present from my other half. It did not disappoint. The stately home was beautiful and the activities available were fantastic. The food was second to none. The only critism I would like to highlight was the very small double bed. It was a little cramped. This aside, it was a great weekend.",5,2012,10,23
239,Great Name - unless its for golf it needs to live up to it a bit more,I spent an overnight here with my mother with the intention of having a relaxing spa break and dinner. We stayed in the old house which was lovely and very authentic but apart from enjoying afternoon tea there everything else was located in the club house - approx 400m away. It is really aimed at golfers and for a spa break it just didnt work at all. We had to walk between the main house and the leisure club approx 400m outside - not too pleasant in a bath robe so it meant dressing/undressing. We missed breakfast because the main restaurant was so busy and kept us waiting so long that we had to skip it in order to get our appointment for the spa. Dinner was also in the club house which meant a cold and dark walk back to the main house - a bit shivery! The leisure centre is a right throw back to the era when a hotel with a spa was an unusual thing - now they are everywhere and this one just has not kept pace at all. It needs a serious overhaul. My guess is that everything in Mount Juliet is aimed at golfers so maybe I was just in the wrong place.  Staff were very good but it was a busy place and it just could not cope with the numbers.,3,2012,10,20
239,5 star accommodation with 5 star riding,"This is our second visit. We stayed in the Rose Gardens apartments. We like to cook in the evening so cannot comment on the main restaurant. The apartments are great. Nice and big but also homely and relaxing. The feature for us is the riding which my wife and 12 year old daughter love. It also has plenty for my six year old son - swimming pool, archery, play ground, etc. I can't comment on the golf because we do not play - but it looks amazing. The grounds are huge for walks, etc. The service has always been very good though and when we have lunch in the bar it has always been very nice with plenty of options for the kids.",5,2012,10,20
239,Double wow!,"If carlsberg did hotels they would mould it on mount Juliet. Staff, food and accommodation was top class. I would move in tomorrow, thank you mount Juliet. The food was just out of this world, the staff are one in a million. I will stay again and again, can I borrow your chef, please.",5,2012,10,20
239,Not worthy of 5 star,"I've stayed here a number of times but I think this might just be my last. It is just okay. The leisure centre is outdated and needs upgrading. The bedrooms and dining rooms need refurbishment.
The hotel staff are so robotic that after two days I was longing for human contact.
Thanks but I'll take my 700 euro elsewhere next time.",3,2012,10,13
239,Cannot rate this hotel highly enough,"Absolutely brilliant hotel, we travelled in a group last Easter. Had an amazing time, rooms were beautiful, as well as lobbies. Service was excellent, our driver was always to hand. We played archery on the grounds and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We were driven into Thomastown for dinner one of the nights also. Pool was great....full of kids until 12, when they have to leave, which suited us fine!!",5,2012,10,12
239,Not what we expected of 5 star,We booked for 2 nights as part of a five night trip away reviews led us to believe it would be highlight of our trip  the grounds are superb the house has a charm but the rooms in our experience were more 3 star perhaps the 5 stars relates solely to service  some staff were aloof barman and porter excellent  breakfast was average have had better in lesser hotels we left a day early it wasn't for us felt bit like the emperors new clothes everybody else seemed to b seeing it through rosé tinted glasses  on a positive bed was exceptionally comfortable and towels best of any hotel ever been  and maybe that's what d five stars is about,3,2012,10,10
239,Out of this world for a wedding,"My husband and I had our wedding reception in Mount Juliet House the end of September 2012. The level of service was unbelievable, the quality of the food at Lady Helen was Michelin star quality and the friendliness of the staff was exemplary. Everyone of the guests were so impressed with everything at Mount Juliet, from the stunning grounds, beautiful bedrooms and lodges to the amazing staff. We both travel abroad with work alot and we have never taken to Trip Advisor to comment on a hotel/restaurant but we felt duty bound to recommend Mount Juliet as a wedding venue to other potential readers. I promise that if you book Mount Juliet for your wedding or for a few days away, you won't regret it!. We are looking forward already to our first anniversary stay.........",5,2012,10,08
239,Real athmosphere in the main house!,"A lovely plush hotel with all modern comforts.  The bedrooms in the main house are really special. The reception rooms in the main house are really nice for afternoon tea or drinks in bar. The lady Helen Restaurant is superb.
The club house is great for sunday lunch and very baby and child friendly. The staff are attentive and efficient.",5,2012,10,03
239,Top notch,"Mount Juliet is undoubtedly one of Irelands and the world's top resorts. It is located in beautiful rural parkland. The rooms and lodges are exquisite. the bars and food excellent and the prices are great value for money. I stayed with three children, but I would recommend this hotel for any occassion. I will definitely be back.",5,2012,09,28
239,Beautiful Estate,Imagine staying in your own Country Estate? Well this is it ! Everyone is like family and they can't do enough for you. It is a magnificent experience. The food is outstanding with the veggies and herbs grown on the estate.,5,2012,09,16
239,The best posh nosh,"It is certainly a pleasure staying in these large country properties in Ireland, and Mount Juliet is no exception.  Room was large with a nice sitting area and a good bed.
The dinners were exceptional...very posh nosh....and wonderful.
Stay there...you won't be disappointed.",5,2012,09,15
239,Wonderful Experience,"What can I say that already hasn't been said about Mount Juliet? An absolutely wonderful stay, everythin from the room to the food to the service to the idyllic setting was just perfect!! Thoroughly enjoyable experience which we plan to repeat a LOT more frequently!!",5,2012,09,15
239,Another  visit to paradise,"my husband and son and I returned this August for our 4th visit . We stayed again in the manor house in a superior room #7 Lord Mount Garret Room , in the past I have stayed in the Lady Mary as well as Lady margaret Hartpole room twice, we were very happy and comfortable in our wing room. The thing that makes this place such a draw to us to return are the very people who work here , who are just some of the nicest people in the world, we have many friends here and  look forward to catching up with them each year. The gardens are wonderfull and are tended by one of the best gardeners in the world - the greens and landscape are proudly kept in spectacular shape , the stables and horses are top shelf and the ladies at the barn are super! This time I rode each day for 2 hours my husband and son fished and my son and I took golf lessons with the golf pro - who was wonderfull with us. We truly cant wait to return again , for an extended stay next time  and revel in the peace and serenity of this beautifull paradise.We hated leaving ..but to comeback again its necessary.",5,2012,09,12
239,One night wasn't enough.,"Mount Juliet was our mid-point stay-over on the way back from West Cork.  And what a place it is!  The entrance and road leading up to the hotel is fantastic.  Surrounded by golf course, rolling hills and beautiful wooded areas, it certainly was a taste of things to come.

When we rolled up to the front door, we realised that there was a wedding on.  This wouldn't have been the first time to stay at a hotel which was hosting a wedding and we weren't holding out too much hope for our stay.  But how wrong we were.

Checking in was wonderful.  Really friendly and courteous staff who didn't treat us any different because we weren't part of the wedding.  Being escorted to the room, we were told a little history of the place before being brought to our beautiful room in the main house.  And what a room.  Although a little hot, for the lack of a/c, it overlooked the main entrance and trees.  Simply wonderful, and with such a comfortable bed, it was divine.

Dinner that night in the Lady Helen restaurant was superb.  A small bit expensive but certainly worth the atmosphere and taste.  Staff, although a little young and nervous, did a wonderful job.  Breakfast the next morning was almost as good, and the view onto the river Nore and stud beyond, made it a wonderful backdrop.  The hotel has great roads and free bicycles, which we used with great delight.  The clubhouse too, has great facilities in terms of the leisure centre and spa treatments.

All in all, a wonderful stay.  Looking forward to returning for a longer stay in the future.",5,2012,09,11
239,Very Nice Stay,"This is a very nice property with excellent ambiance. The grounds are beautiful, the hotel is very nice, the staff gracious, and restaurant is very good. We stayed in a top (3rd) floor room with a river view room. The sleeping part of the room was large and very comfortable with a very good bed. As others have reported the bathroom was bit odd in that the shower head in the tub/shower was hung from the ceiling in the middle of the tub. We would definately stay here again if in the area. One word of caution, however; there is no elevator (or if there is one it is exceedingly well hidden) so stairs are it; if you have a stair issue ask for a lower floor room.",5,2012,09,09
239,"Stunning interiors, great service and food","The Manor room we had was great. Looking over the front pasture. Most impressed with the modern bathroom. Spacious  with a bath tub and seperate shower with 2 sinks. Service is so immaculate here, though not very warm. Lady Helen dinIng room is very beautiful. Love the plaster ceiling and walls. The food was superb. Had the scallops and foie gras, both were perfect. Main course were great too, Turbot and beef. Love the combination of truffle with the scallops and beef dish. 
All in all wonderful experience. ",5,2012,09,08
239,Simply outstanding,"Our family spent a week in Mount Juliet in late May.  It was our second time visiting the Estate, the last having been in summer 2009, right before the hotel was about to drop its affiliation with the Conrad/Hilton franchise.  We had such a wonderful experience the first time we stayed, we were hopeful that our most recent experience would live up to our memories.  It didn’t.  It exceeded our expectations and our prior experience in every single respect.

We initially made our reservation in August of 2011 – forward planning!  It was all done over email directly with the Estate.  We had reserved the Chauffeurs Lodge, a stand-alone cottage near the main house.  A couple of days before we were to depart the US, I got an email from reservations saying that the Lodge was unavailable, due to a maintenance issue, and we were to be accommodated in one of the Rose Garden Cottages.  The reservation agent explained that the Rose Garden Cottages is actually quite a bit bigger than the Chauffeurs Lodge, so we were fine with that, especially as we were travelling with our two young (10 months and 3 years) children.  The more space, the better!

When we arrived in Thomastown and approached the estate, all the reasons why we love this place came flooding back.  The breathtaking countryside, the serenity of the estate, the open space – driving down the meandering road through the estate that leads to the main house, you pass by pastures and cross over the river Nore with the imposing main house presiding over the grounds in silent majesty.  The approach just puts you in the perfect frame of mind after a long journey.

Stopping briefly at the main house, we checked in, were handed our keys, asked for our newspaper preference and introduced to a member of the concierge team, a young Polish man whose name I feel ashamed I don’t remember.  He offered to guide us up to the Rose Garden and help us with our luggage.  (After he had done that, he disappeared for a few minutes, only to return with a box full of kids DVDs for our little ones to watch – a lovely touch).

As we started getting our bearings in the cottage, we were struck immediately by two things – the place was much larger than we expected and it was decorated in a tasteful yet simple manner.  The layout is not obvious from the website, but you walk in to a little lobby – just big enough to take off and hang your jackets on the coat rack and sit on the specifically designed furniture to take your muddy boots off and place them underneath.  You then walk into an open area the is elevated above the living room and leads to the kitchen a dining area.  On the other side of the living room, there is a laundry room and one of the bathrooms on one side of the spacious hallway and a series of large closets on the right hand side.  The two bedrooms are at the back of the cottage.  The master has its own bathroom with a shower, rather than a tub.  The floor is heated in the master bath!  The second bath has a tub/shower combo.

As noted above, the furnishings and décor are tasteful and simple.  The beds are incredibly comfortable and the linens crisp and heavy.  Perfect, in my opinion.  The kitchen is stocked with most of the essentials you could need – basic pots and pans, dishes and the like.  There’s a kettle and a French press coffee maker.  The appliances include a top/bottom fridge/freezer (small by American standards), a cooktop and oven.    We were so happy with the accommodation from the moment we walked in the door – we had no idea, from our previous visit when we stayed in the main house, that the Rose Cottages could compare in terms of comfort.  But they did.

Over the course of our week there, we ate each of the restaurants, had afternoon tea on the lawn, enjoyed drinks in the bars, had spa treatments, went horse riding and even took some golf lessons.  Every single person we met was just wonderful – they could not do enough to make sure we were having the best possible time during our stay.  (Sidenote: Shortly after arrival, my wife developed an allergic reaction to some medication we were taking.  Not only did the front desk set us up with an appointment with a local doctor, the wonderful young Polish chap escorted us down to the village to make sure we found our destination.  The hotel arranged for my wife to be seen immediately, meaning she walked through a room full of other, waiting patients.  She was in an out in 15 minutes.)

The food here is great – from the more causal Kendal’s, to the breathtaking Lady Helen.  If you are there on a night when the Lady Helen is open, it’s a must-do.  The food is exceptional, the wine pairings spot-on and the service is beyond reproach.  If you’re lucky enough to get a table by one of the windows, you’ll be dining overlooking the peaceful grounds, with the forest and river before your eyes as the light dims.  It’s just beautiful.  The food is local, fresh and unique – there’s a tasting menu, which we opted for, and a-la-carte, too.  The more causal venues serve fresh, comfort foods appropriate to the setting.   None of the food is what I would consider overpriced for Ireland, especially given you at a top-notch resort.  But it’s not cheap, either.  Given the quality of everything we ate, I can’t complain.  One important point  to note – although the place may seem quiet, even empty, it’s required to make reservations for almost everything – riding, golf, dining, spa, etc.  On a couple of occasions we assumed that we could walk in and do various activities ‘on demand’ only to find that they were fully booked.  Plan a day or two in advance (especially for The Lady Helen and riding) and you’ll be fine.

I could go on and on – we have so many wonderful memories of our two visits.  It is no small undertaking to haul 2 kids under 3 years of age across the Atlantic to Ireland from Texas.  The destination has to be worth the journey.  We can’t wait to go back again, and that speaks volumes.",5,2012,09,06
239,Splendid Hotel And Golfcourse despite the weather....,"Stayed here with my wife in Aug 2012.

I had played golf 3 times here in the past 2 years and love the facility.

We decided to stay in the hotel and chose one of the pretty expensive but nice quality River View rooms.

Very  comfortable indeed and plenty of space in the room.

The bathroom was good but a little strange as there was no way of stopping the shower from drenching the bathroom floor. 

Many moons ago when they re-did the bathroom some bright spark put the shower head in the middle of the bath rather than at the end by the taps. The result is a very wet floor no matter how hard you try to not spray water around. 

The weather was a bit mixed buts that’s Ireland for you.

Golf course and hotel were great. Also check out the 7 Euro 18 hole putting course - worth spending an hour or two there. They never tell you about it at the hotel...... Its a lot of fun !!

When you come to a great estate house like this it seems a bit strange to have 75% of the staff in the Hotel to be Eastern European. It sort of doesn't feel quite right.

Having said that the Barman was a real character and we had some good chats with him. ( he was 100% emerald isle and proud of it ! )

If you like golf and fine dining this is great.

The evening meals were a little over the top in the restaurant, but were cooked well. Don't expect a plate full though as its posh nosh !

Will be back again in the future without doubt.......",5,2012,09,06
239,"Very lovely room, horseriding fully booked, restaurant closed","We stayed in Mount Juliet for 2 nights. We had a very large and beautiful room. We specially came to Mount Juliet to do some horseriding. The first thing we heard was that the horseriding was fully booked. Then we asked to have dinner in the main restaurant. The restaurant was closed on Sunday. On monday, we asked again to have dinner in the restaurant. It was possible, but only at 21h30!!! I sai it was too late for us, because we were touring in Ireland. Thanks to the food and beverage manager. She fixed a dinner at 19h00. It was a pity that the food in the restaurant was too salty.",3,2012,08,30
239,A piece of heaven on Earth!!!,"My family and i stayed in Mount Juliet for two nights.  We were visiting family in the area before heading home. It was our first time staying having heard great things about the place.  Unfortunately our budget wouldnt stretch to a longer stay!  We loved it, the house, the grounds, OMG the food!, the spa everything was just perfect.  Would highly recommend - i believe christmas is magical there - have to save for that!!",5,2012,08,28
239,Amazing wedding venue,"Attended a family wedding here.  The hotel is amazing, we stayed in the main hotel and the rooms are very very comfortable with lots of space and beautiful views.  Staff were very attentive and friendly.  The food for the main wedding meal was the best I have ever had a large function.  The breakfast next morning in the main hotel was fabulous with a great range of options.  The grounds are immaculate and well worth a stroll around.  The place is very relaxing and we will definitely return.",5,2012,08,28
239,Magnificent honeymoon destination,"Had an absolutely fabulous experience here, could only manage one night away after our wedding and so glad we made it to Mount Juliet, champagne on ice in the room, amazing staff, beautiful river view room, fantastic dinner in kendals, gorgeous swimming pool, chaffeur, we were made to feel like royalty and will definitely be back! ",5,2012,08,27
239,Country grandeur with all the creature comforts,"Stayed for weekend with my fiancé. We stayed in the house as opposed to the clubhouse.The room was extravagant and old world all at once. Service and food excellent. It has all the amenities even bikes and tours of this 1500 acre estate. Fully equipped swimming pool and spa, golf, archery and horse riding. Need I say more. True luxury near the great city of Kilkenny.loads to see and do.highly recommended..Loved it so much getting married there!",5,2012,08,20
239,"3 times a winner- Mount Juliet,kilkenny","3 times I have stayed at Mount Juliet & 3 times it has been the perfect getaway! From the professional & welcoming check in by Laura to the wonderful tour of the estate to the immaculate & varied style of rooms- again it was a wonderful visit!- a special mention to the exquisite food & service in restaurants- every meal was scrumptious!- thank you chefs!
Every single member of staff is a credit to Mount Juliet- this is hospitality at its best- thank you again & i do hope to visit again.",5,2012,08,17
239,Excellent hotel and resort well worth a visit,"My partner and I travel to Ireland a few times every year and we frequently stay at Mount Juliet when possible.   We most recently stayed there at the beginning of June and have another visit already booked for later this year.    Mount Juliet is a wonderful place.  The hotel is first class.  There are a few options for accommodation being, the Hunters Yard, Rose Garden Cottages and the Manor House and we have stayed in them all at different times.   The food in both Kendals restaurant and the Lady Helen Dining room is wonderful, and to have breakfast in the Lady Helen Dining Room is truly a memorable experience.  

 I sometimes find it very difficult to totally relax, but the moment I enter the Mount Juliet Estate I am totally relaxed - it has that kind of feeling for me.   The spa, staff and the treatments are excellent - I really enjoyed the head massage.  My partner plays golf and he praises the golf course. 

There are several activities on the estate and once we arrive at Mount Juliet we park the car and we don't need to leave the estate until we check out.   Nothing is too much trouble for the very friendly and professional staff throughout this resort.  A truly wonderful place to spend a few days or a longer holiday.  Thank you Mount Juliet - we are looking forward to our next visit.",5,2012,08,13
239,Georgian Gem,"Our family of five recently stayed in the two bedroom cottages at Mount Juliet in Thomastown.  This is not the first time we've stayed here, but the first time in the cottages which are perfect for families as they are very large with separate dining rooms, kitchens, washing machines, sitting rooms and well appointed bedrooms and bathrooms.  They are decorated in typical cozy and stylish cottage plaids with neutral walls and hardwood floors in all the rooms but the bedrooms.  Room service to the cottage is limited but the restaurants are open to having the children and are very helpful.  Breakfast is a lovely buffet in the beautiful Georgian dining room of the main house.  The equestrian centre is wonderful for children 5/6+ years old and the grounds absolutely stunning complete with walled garden and childrens' playground.  Driving through the stud farm was lovely with its abundance of young foals.  The clubhouse is casual but nice for lunch and dinner and Kendall's restaurant was delicious for dinner.  My husband looks forward to swinging a club on the course next time we are there!",5,2012,08,03
239,Not just a Golf Course!,"Do not think this is just a very pleasant golf course.  The Reception staff were excellent and this is where the quality starts.  The rooms are well appointed and everything works and the water is piping hot.  The bar staff are very convivial, the restaurant staff knowledgable and great fun and the Kendal Restaurant was excellent value for a more sophisticated menu.  Our breakfast was served in the Lady Helen room in the  main house on the last day and it was superb.  The spa is well appointed and spotlessly clean.  We didn't play golf whilst we were there, but got a great weekend deal which we can highly recommend.  It would be a wonderful place to hold a wedding reception.",5,2012,08,01
239,A truly wonderful experience,"To celebrate our first wedding anniversary we decided to treat ourselves to a night in mount Juliet and we are only sorry that we didn't book for longer.  The staff are all very welcoming especially Maurice in the dining room :).  The grounds are amazing, full of hidden treasures. I would recommend availing of the free bikes as it is a great way to take in the many acres. Dinner in st Helen's was an unforgettable experience. Real quality food,  and great service. we had a round of golf the morning of our departure and even though I'm not the best golfer I enjoyed it immensely was never made to feel like only pros could play there, it really is for everyone and the staff there made it even more enjoyable as again they were so welcoming. The course is stunning with every hole better than the last. We can't say enough about this beautiful place. We highly recommend it and will definitely be back, just for longer next time :) ",5,2012,07,26
239,Our 3 rd visit...,"We absolutely love Mt. Juliet.  Unbelievably tranquil and serene.  Stayed 7 nights and could have stayed longer!  Daily walks to see the horses and cows..
Bike rides..great dining facilities.  Oh, and the staff!  AMAZING!!!  The reception staff is so well trained and you feel immediately welcomed.  Rooms are very clean with lush bedding.  Common areas are well kept and the environment is like being in a grand old mansion.  
We will return!",5,2012,07,26
239,Toppled off its perch - attention required,"We stayed here with friends last year and whilst we could only procure rooms in the Golf Club (the main house was full then) we had a very enjoyable stay, loved the location and found the food more than acceptable. What a difference a year makes! We again booked rooms in the Golf Club on the grounds of economy whilst our more well heeled chums booked the main house. They then couldn't make it so we travelled alone.Whilst making the booking I mentioned that it was my husband's birthday and also reserved a table for six in the Lady Helen restaurant. We had friends who live locally who were to join us to celebrate my husband's birthday but I obviously had to reduce this to four when our travelling partners cancelled. Several weeks before we received a telephone call informing us there would be a concert on the second night of our stay and suggesting we might like to buy tickets which we duly did. On check in the hotel had no record of our reservation for dinner for that evening and were at best brusque in their handling of their ommission, couldn't accommodate the time we had pre booked and glaringly failed to inform us that the restaurant in the Golf Club was in effect closed. We were given the key to our room, not informed of its whereabouts and as a result carried all or luggage upstairs at the Golf Club ( no staff evident) to realise it was ground floor! Any appeal of the Golf Club location was mitigated by an enormous marquee set up for the concert and obscuring the garden and courtyard location. We subsequently met our friends at Barry's in Thomastown (pub on the bridge - a real find for both Guinness and excellent wine)
and returned to the main house about 5 minutes prior to our reservation for dinner. We were then almost frogmarched to the Dining Room until I insisted we had a drink prior, it is of course still my husband's birthday! On a positive note dinner was an extremely exceptional repast and the menu, quality and cooking were superb.
The next morning dawned and we are both wandering about the Golf Club in pursuit of breakfast which the previous year had been served in the Golf Club restaurant Kendalls. After several staff had been questioned one eventually asked if we were residents, that being established we were told we needed to walk to the main house (in the rain) for breakfast. Once there the food was once again stunning and included gluten free sausages and bread (yippee from the coeliac) On enquiring what our options for dinner were we were told that ""all the pre concert dinner reservations at Kendalls had gone and the Lady Helen restaurant was closed"" so our options were a post concert dinner at later than 10.00pm or starvation.... In the event we decided to eschew the concert and dine at Cafe Sol in Thomastown (surprisingly good) The remainder of our stay passed uneventfully now we knew to walk to the main house for breakfast. The moral of the tale is Mount Juliet is in a lovely location, food is excellent but for everything else maybe look elsewhere unless you can afford a room in the main house.",4,2012,07,25
239,Fabulous,"This is singularly the best night's sleep you will ever have. The beds are just pure comfort and luxury. Bathrooms are modern and clean. The whole hotel is spotless and the grounds are beautiful. 

There is a pool here and a kid's club. It is a really great place to take kids and there were a lot of families there when we stayed. There is a spa and 2 different restaurants, one is formal and one is a bar bistro. The food was excellent and so was the service. It has a great golf course at the hotel too. 

My only regret was that we didn't stay longer. I will definitely be back.",5,2012,07,19
239,"Wonderful staff, beautiful setting","What an amazing stay I had with my two girlfriends las week!  The staff couldn't have been more helpful, we even got up graded as they weren't too busy in the main house.  You must take a tour of the original house and grounds if you get the chance - it is free and well worth knowing a bit about the history.
The food was excellent also, and ver reasonably priced condisdering the elegant surroundings.  My girlfriends have already been twice before and will definitely be back.  Unfortunately I live in Australia, so it may be a while until I am able to return. Thank you for a really wonderful stay.",4,2012,07,15
239,Perfect Golf!,"A perfect golfcourse in excellent condition, one of the best courses we ever played. Great restaurant. Rooms could use an update.",4,2012,07,12
239,Our Engagement,"My girlfriend and I got engaged here last weekend and we had the time of our lives. The hotel is unbelievable and the staff are extremely friendly. Every member of the staff made us feel welcome and relaxed. They organised horse riding, a champagne picnic in the garden and they had flowers and roses in the bed room on our return.  The river view from the restrauant is amazing (even if it is raining). 
We have stayed in some lovely places before, but Mount Juliet surpasses them all. I would highly recommend here for a special occasion.
Thank you to Louise, Des, Ed, Evelyn and Elaine for all your help.
See you again soon.

Shirley & Glen",5,2012,07,11
239,birthday surprise!,"A trip to Mount Juliet for my friends birthday for a spa was just the beginning of a fabulous day!
Ths staff in the Spa were very accomdating and the service was second to none. We practically had the spa to ourselves and felt no pressure to buy products or leave before we were ready. Afterwards we walked the 5 minutes to the main hotel for afternoon tea. There we were greeted by very friendly staff and escorted into what can only be described as a sitting room, filled with various chairs, fantastic view of the country side and soft music playing the background.
Afternoon tea was one of the best I have ever had. The sandwiches were freshly made and the cakes were delicious. The staff regularly checked if we needed anything, without being overbearing. 
I could have quite happily stayed there all day. I am already planning my next trip.
Only downside is that is can be quite difficult to get to as the signs are few and far between but well worth it!!",5,2012,07,06
239,My First Time Sleeping in a Stable,"OK, it was a stable long ago an is now a series of very nice rooms a short walk from the main building.  This is a beautiful property and I only wish we had booked another couple of nights.  Fabulous golf course, excellent dining, great service.  Of the five places we stayed on our recent trip to Ireland, this was easily the best.",5,2012,07,03
239,"Beautiful golf resort, stud farm, and sporting estate","This was the second place we stayed on our 2 week honeymoon.  It was beautiful!  We were upgraded upon arrival to celebrate our honeymoon and offered a complimentary bottle of champagne!  The rooms are elegantly appointed with big stately curtains, heated towel racks and floors in the bathroom.  We ordered breakfast to the room which was good (though I don't know if I can get used to huge roasted tomatoes and mushrooms for breakfast ;).  We had dinner the first night at Kendals Brasserie.  The ambience was very romantic with large candles on oak stump slabs and dimmed lighting.  Our food was great!  Try the risotto, it's delicious!  The second night we ate at Lady Helen restaurant.  This is a formal restaurant.  Food was great but a little too uppity for our tastes.  We would have liked to have the option for Kendals again but still it was a good experience.  The grounds are beautiful with a stud farm that you can bicycle through (they were the only property out of the 8 places we stayed that provided complimentary use of bicycles).  They having archery, trap shooting, fly fishing.  we weren't able to enjoy any of these since we had time constraints...next time!  The golf resort is stunning with it's own helicopter pad.  They have several cozy sitting rooms and a bar to enjoy after dinner drinks winding down.  While here we saw Jerpoint Abbey, Kilkenny Castle, Kilfane Church,  Thomastown.  I would recommend all of them.  This was my favorite property out of 8 properties we stayed at on our honeymoon trip!",5,2012,07,02
239,Lovely,"My husband and I stayed at MJE for the first two nights of our visit to Ireland.  We so enjoyed our time there despite the rainy weather.  Our room was large, spacious and comfortable with a lovely sitting area.  The mattress and bedding were incredibly comfortable as well.  The level of service was excellent and the staff friendly and accommodating.  Our full breakfast was purchased in advance.  We chose to have room service and enjoyed a delicious variety of dishes in our sitting area both mornings.  The staff in the bar went above and beyond to serve us a late night cheese plate although the menu was usually not served after 5pm.  We enjoyed the expansive views of the country as we sipped wine in the bar.  The estate experience was so relaxing; we hope to visit it again.  Don't miss it if you visit Ireland.",5,2012,06,30
239,Ireland and the Irish at their very best,"Quietly understated luxury from the surroundings to the service.  The breakfast is an experience in itself sitting in the window looking out over endless green whilsts enjoying the finest food served by calm and helpful staff.  Dont think you have to be a golfer to enjoy MJ there is plenty here for families too and a spa with a decent sized swimming pool.  But the stand out for me was the relaxing atmosphere and high standard of the accommodation.  We stayed in a 2 bedroomed cottage and the decor and facilities were top class.  The wifi appeared to work everywhere and was not slow.  It wasnt all perfect, there were a few mishaps with the heating but it was put right eventually and the way our complaint was handled was a lesson in customer service.  Note to other hotel owners: If you want your staff to understand quality service send them to Mount Juliet for a few nights it doesnt come much better",5,2012,06,30
239,BIRTHDAY TREAT,"My Friends treated me to  a break in this wonderful hotel in Co Kilkenny. I must say it was a terrific experience as we went on a thursday , when the hotel had an 8 course tasting menu which was divine. I cant recommend it enough, from the moment we arrived till we left, the staff were just so friendly and helpful.A very enjoyable time was had by all.",5,2012,06,28
239,An Irish Treat,"Mount Juliet is a lovely estate.  Customer service is superb.  Accommodations are spacious.  The grounds are stunning.  Food at all restaurants is excellent.  I only rode but Mount Juliet offers several activities; I highly recommend the equestrian center which is why I chose Mount Juliet.  It did not disappoint.  The instructors provided valuable training to fine tune some troubled spots and led to a lot more confidence in jumping my horse once I returned home.  I rode only Chad, but he was a solid horse, great jumper, and fantastic on the cross country course.  I did not use the spa but spoke to someone else who did and rated it good.  I usually ran outside as the grounds were wonderful but went to the gym once.  The facility was good but not extensive.",5,2012,06,27
239,Elegant and beautiful old world getaway,"I am a frequent visitor to mount Juliet for little breaks now and again. It is a wonderful place to get away from the world and just relax. 
I generally stay in the main house which gives a feeling of stepping back in time and grandeur. This stay I tried the club house accommodation. Modern and perfectly pleasing, it is close to the leisure centre and bar but next time I will return to the main house (personal preference). 

You cannot go wrong with the lady Helen restaurant. Always outstanding and the little touches and tasters between mains is splendid! The food in the bar is also very tasty and service is fast! 

I love the equestrian centre. The girls there are wonderful at their jobs and very friendly and welcoming! 

If you like the finer things in life and enjoy a complete relaxing getaway then this is the place for you. The ghosts in the main house just make it that more special ......",5,2012,06,18
239,A great family birthday break,"I can't really add to what has already been said before about the wonderful estate and setting. It's as lovely as everyone says.  The staff are friendly, efficient and professional and there seems to be a room type for everyone: Club House for easy access to the spa, leisure centre & less formal bar & restaurant; the Rose Garden lodges for groups/families; and the House for that extra bit of luxury.

We ate in the bar one night, then out in Kilkenny the next (Campagne - excellent place!) and finally the Lady Helen restaurant on the final night.  If you'd like to read more about our experience at the Lady Helen restaurant then have a look at our review here: http://bwydbod.posterous.com",5,2012,06,07
239,Wonderful Stay,"My husband and I spent two nights here recently and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The bucolic, tranquil setting among 1500 lush green acres was everything we imagined it would be. We arrived mid week and were pleasantly surprised to receive an upgrade to a large suite in the Manor house. The house is beautifully decorated and maintained. The food is excellent I felt as if I was in a Jane Austin novel; our bedroom overlooked the river and stud farm with grazing horses and cows in the distance. The staff was welcoming and friendly. We wished that we could have stayed longer! Highly recommend.",4,2012,06,04
239,Great experience,Stayed here in April to attend a family wedding. Magnificent grounds. Very professional and friendly staff. Everything works. Food and ambience great. Staff everywhere so alert to one's needs. Irish Open golf course. A most enjoyable week-end. Looking forward to my next visit.,5,2012,06,04
239,lovely weekend,"Recently stayed for 2 nights in mount juliet, it was a truly lovely stay.We were attending a family wedding and would recommend it to anyone looking for a beautiful ,stylish, yet relaxed wedding venue. We stayed in the main house/hotel, in a superior king room overlooking main entrance garden, breakfast served in dining room was a treat, wonderful selection of cooked to order dishes,served by excellent staff.  You dont have to be a golfer to enjoy your visit here as there are plenty of other activities and interesting woodland walks.We will definately be back asap.O callaghans. .",5,2012,06,02
239,Terrific Experience,"Spent 2 nights in the Manor house and highly recommend Mount Juliet. The grounds are absolutely breathtaking. Hit the river for some fly fishing and had a great time, then Eahmon, their fishing guide, took my wife and I down to the lakes and caught one after another. Really fun. The putting course is really fun too! ... and really challenging. Food was terrific too. Rooms seemed kind of old (because they were) but fine for our needs.",5,2012,05,30
239,awful staff in the leisure centre,"I stayed in this hotel for a weekend. Everything was fabulous except the rude leisure centre staff. They ordered all children out of the pool at the set times...even though the children were in the side pool and there was no one else in the pool. This was ten minutes after buying the swimming caps and arm bands!
The leisure centre staff ruined what was a lovely weekend",4,2012,05,24
239,Excellent hotel,I stayed here with my family for a short break and get-to-together. I am used to staying in top-class hotels and this hotel rates very highly. It is situated in the beautiful Kilkenny countryside with a lovely golf course attached. The hotel itself was very high quality - we stayed in one of the houses which was excellent. The hotel staff were friendly and very accommodating. Food / rooms / grounds - all excellent. I will certainly be back for another very relaxing and enjoyable stay.,5,2012,05,23
239,Excellent place to stay!!,We stayed in Mount Juliet for 2 nights in the clubhouse. The grounds of this place are beautiful! The staff was very accomidating and very helpful when we had to change our rooms due to charge issues. The rooms are very spacious and the pool is great!! The food in the restaurant is great too!,5,2012,05,22
239,Excellent,"Went to mount juliet for a night away. Arrived on the estate and it was like stepping into another world. Grounds were immaculate, horses roaming the fields and crossing a beautiful bridge across the river. 

We got the superior room, it was massive and had it's own terrace and garden. 

Food was amazing, service was great and the spa is well worth a visit.",5,2012,05,19
239,Absolutely fantastic time,"Look, when you hear about 5 star hotels and country estates you hear about beauty and old rustic buildings. What i will say about mount juliet is that it actually exceeds these expectations to such a  degree that you are left spellbound after your visit. It appeals to all your senses and wraps you in a blanket warmth that you will not get anywhere else in Ireland. 
From the amazing charachter of the rooms to the cleanliness of the spa and lesure center everything is done to perfection. 

When we arrived we entered the estate through the Thomastown exit which is well worth it. You will get a beautiful view of the house and the river Nore when you cross that amazing bridge.

We stayed in the house and we dined in the lady Helen resteraunt which was a great experience. The staff where excellent and they really looked after us. Very clear explanation and good knowledge of the amazing fine local produce.

The food was so good and the wine and procecco to equal

We went horseriding the next day and it was absolutely amazing. The staff where so understanding as we where first-time riders. We leraned so much too.

The beds by the way are so comfortable and the breakfast was incredible.

We had the most amazing romantic weekend and myself and my girlfriend will be talking about the amazing stay we had for years to come.

I cannot recomend this place enough. Great value for what you recieve!!",5,2012,05,17
239,WOW,"Wow! Words escape me. This place is luxurious and I was a bit concerned we had navigated to the wrong location when we arrived. Everything was so truly wonderful and passed our expectations. Our room, the service, the location, the facilities, the activities, absolutely everything was amazing. A honeymoon to remember!",5,2012,05,16
239,Excellent Spot!,"My husband and I spent a few days here last week for a much needed break; it is a super haven to escape to for some peace and quiet and an easy journey to make from Dublin now with the completion of the motorway.

A super place to stay offering numerous options in terms of accommodation – the main house, clubhouse rooms, rose garden cottages etc.  We stayed in the main house which is very beautiful and while our room wasn’t ready on arrival we were treated to fresh coffee and homemade cookies while we waited.  

The main points that make this property successful are the staff and the food.  The Hunter’s Yard (informal and perfect for lunch or casual evening dining), Kendall’s Restaurant (French themed and superbly priced and offering a paired wines to match a three course dinner for an additional €15 per person) and Lady Helen Restaurant (formal, finer dining offering both an a la carte and tasting menu) serve excellent food.  In the main house a good breakfast menu is available and cooked to order boasting outstanding local produce, home make jams, breads and pastries.  We had lunch in the clubhouse after we unpacked (chicken Caesar salad for me and just two side orders for my husband – both we perfect, we couldn’t fault either).

Staff are friendly, courteous, efficient and well trained.  Nothing is a problem.  The courtesy bus service was offered to us despite the main house being no more than a 5 minute stroll from the clubhouse, we were offered cookies as we sat reading in the drawing rooms, our room was turned down without request (despite this not being a requirement in a four star hotel).  Even the other guests are so friendly!  

It’s hard to believe that this is a four star hotel when many others of the same accreditation barely meet three star hotel requirements.  I have been challenged in the past by owner/proprietors on TA for being over critical (and I am) but I would highly recommend a trip to Mount Juliet Estate.  To learn how it’s properly done other similar style properties should visit and take note.  It ticks all the boxes for me and knowing I can go somewhere where standards are maintained time again (we stayed 3 years ago and not only have standard been maintained, in many respects they have even improved).  Definitely worth a visit if not for a stay, you will enjoy a decent lunch at a fair price.",5,2012,05,15
239,Laid back luxury makes you feel like royalty,"Wonderful hotel with luxuriously understated opulance, marvelous staff, and food to die for.  Dinner is nothing short of a work of art, and it seems a shame to interfere with the fantastic presentation by actually eating it - but believe me, it is worth eating.  Although the hotel welcomes children, it is really a haven for adults who just want to chill out for a few days.  And what a way to chill out !  World class golf course, horse riding, country walks, coarse fishing, cycling, spa treatments, and more.   Staff look and act as if they really care, and they always have time to chat to guests.  This is the closest you can get to believing that you are really a guest in a magnificent home.  Attention to detail is superb, and the staff seem to be able to read guests' minds as to what they need, and when they need it.  By no means cheap, but if you pay for cheap, that's what you get.  And when you pay in Mount Juliet, what you get is worth every penny.",5,2012,05,03
239,Old World Charm,"Staying in comfort in Mt. Juliet House is like stepping back in history to a Georgian era.
Antiques, oil paintings, hand carved Italian marble Adams fireplaces and volumes of books abound. This historic setting is accompanied by every comfort for the visitor. 
It is similar to the Paradores of Spain but with friendly staff, who were wonderful.

The view from our bedroom was of a cherry tree in full blossom with a carpet of bluebells. 
Each room comes fully equipped with tea making facilities, fridge, safe, trouser press, etc.

We enjoyed breakfast at a window overlooking the Nore River with mares and foals in the fields beyond - like a scene from a Gainsborough painting.

Other accommodation is in Hunters Lodge or s/c in Rose Cottages - all to a very high spec.

Estate Activities include golf on a wonderful Jack Nicklaus course, equestrian centre, fishing, cycling, etc. all set in 1,500 acres of parkland. 

We were part of a fantastic wedding party- taking time out for a round of golf.

What a treat!",5,2012,05,01
239,Almost flawless,"I've been coming here to play golf for years, and always admired the golf course, clubhouse and restaurant, to the point where I would rave about it to anyone who'd listen, so recently, to celebrate a landmark birthday, my family arranged a small surprise party for me here. It was fantastic. The rooms were perfect, decorated just exactly how I want a luxury room decorated, and we had 4 of them and nosed around all 4. The grounds are fantastic, and we wandered for miles. The bar in the main house, which we used that night, was the perfect club-feel bar, full of quiet, cosy corners. I didnt get to see the gym, but I used the pool - might have been bigger, but very nice. If your break is based around pool/gym facilities, dont come here. The food I can describe in three parts, as we ate in 3 different places: the bar food in the clubhouse was perfect, and good value, the breakfast in the main house was as sumptuous a breakfast as I've ever encountered, but the dinner in the restaurant was only adequate, and a little pricey for the fare. The wine list was fantastic though. 

Service was exactly as I like it, quiet and efficient without ever being obseqious or fawning. 

In summary: I was afraid I might be a little let down because my expectations were so high, but the hotel does ""hotel"" as well as the golf course does golf. And that's saying something. Worth every cent. 

My thanks to all the staff for a weekend I will never forget.",5,2012,05,01
239,Enjoyable apart from Weather !,"This place certainly has the wow factor. The grounds are very nice to walk around and I am told that the golf course is challenging. We stayed here for 1 night last weekend, We really did enjoy this trip although the weather did its best to put a damper on the stay!
Found the evening meal to be very nice and worth the price. Little bit disappointed with the breakfast
Overall we would certainly come back here, hopefully in better weather!",4,2012,04,30
239,"Margaret Farrelly knows a truly beautiful,elegant,pampering stay!","I had not been to Mount Juilet for a few years until 14th April..and I can only say it has gotten better than ever!

We were there for a wedding, it was a dream from start to finish.  I loved the welcome we got, concierge on hand to help with everything.  It was a very busy check in, dealt with in the most perfect way.  Our room was such luxury, and so clean and fresh! All of our advance requests were met !

The wedding was done so beautifully, the pre dinner reception was very special and relaxing. Dinner was amazing , food excellent , and presentation really great. Kendals looked so fresh and sparkling!

Breakfast was the best I have ever had, service was perfection and we were looked after in a really warm way. The view from The Lady Helen dining room has to be one of the best in Ireland and the most tranquil.

One final thing ...we left a phone charger behind in the room...2 days later it came back to us in the post.!

Mount Juliet have that extra ingredient that makes us long to return!!",5,2012,04,27
239,A little bit of heaven in Kilkenny!,"We have just returned from an overnight stay at the Mount Juliet Estate and I would 100% recommend to anyone to stay here and escape to this haven of peace and tranquillity. The view accross the river to the fields with the little foals running beside their Mums was such a beautiful sight, especially while eating the delicious breakfast first thing in the morning. Breakfast is served till eleven, which is great because  you dont feel any pressure to be up early.

Our room was lovely, It opened out into a little garden. Its a pity the weather wasnt a bit better, as I would say that to sit out on the little patio with a glass of wine would be a lovely treat in the evening! 

We had a very enjoyable meal in Kendals. Really lovely restaurant, great staff and good food.
 We also enjoyed a really lovely afternoon tea in the sitting room beside the bar. 

This staff here also have to be praised very highly. Everyone of the them were friendly and efficient. They really make you feel at home from the minute you arrive. We will definitely return again, hopefully in the not too distant future! I would also recommend Mount Juliet for a family holiday ,as there seems to be a lot to do there for children. So, I would definitely consider here for our next family holiday in Ireland.",5,2012,04,24
239,A home away from home,"We stayed for a weekend in the Rose Cottages, which are a 3 minute walk from the main house. The hotel kindly organised for the concierge to collect us from our cottage and to bring us back at the end of the night.  We booked dinner in the Lady Helen restaurant for the first night – which is definitely a highlight and highly recommended, and finished the night with an after dinner cocktail in the bar. 
The cottages (ground floor with terrace or first floor with balcony) are spacious, modern, well equipped and very nicely decorated. Ours had two twin bedrooms, both with ensuite – one with bath/shower, the other with spacious walk in shower.  Entrance hallway, livingroom area with flat screen TV and open gas fire, a dining area, a kitchenette – making the perfect getaway for a small family or a group of people.  Might be a little big for a romantic couple for one night but if you wanted privacy and or peace and quiet, this would tick all the boxes as you still have all the benefits of the hotel.  I believe they may have been recently redecorated and the bathrooms were certainly recently upgraded. There is also a very nice children’s playground located near the cottages.
The hotel is 5 mins from Thomastown train station and a 25 minutes journey from the centre of Kilkenny. We used local a local taxi to bring us in and out of Kilkenny on the Saturday, which meant everyone could have a few drinks (large taxi for 8/9 people is around €30 each way)
We ate breakfast both mornings in Kendalls restaurant – which is located in the clubhouse, where you will also find more bedrooms, the spa and leisure facilities.  This is around a 10 minute walk from the main house, and I would imagine concerige are used to dropping and collecting guests there.  The hotel grounds are surrounded by spectacular scenery – rolling Irish hills and fields makes for a picture perfect landscape with golf course and a nearby stud adding to the bill.  A wonderful weekend away.",4,2012,04,23
239,"Stately perfection in the lush, green Irish Countryside.","Wonderful venue. Fab hotel with huge rooms. Families or groups could rent one of the houses on the estate. It has golf, kids club, spa, pool, equestrian centre, clay pigeon shooting and archery! I was on business but cannot wait to get back with my family. 
",4,2012,04,23
239,Heaven,"We stayed here for a night last month. It is such a beautiful setting I would highly recommend staying more than 1 night to take in all the sights. We stayed in the Hunters Lodge. Rooms were fab with a lovely terrace overlooking the golf course. 

Pool is adequate but no Jacuzzi only jets in a corner of the pool. The only downside to my whole stay was the Spa. Very overpriced for what we got. 

We had dinner in the Casual restaurant and it was delish. Couldn't fault the food. 

We got breakfast to the room the next morning and again zero complaints there. 

I would love to return sometime and have afternoon tea in the main house.",5,2012,04,20
239,Fantastic - cant wait to go back!!,"We recently spent a lovely night in Mount Juliet - we were 4 girls enjoying a well-deserved night away! We checked into the luxurious lodges and they were absolutely beautiful. Spacious bedrooms, the best linen and decorated to the highest possible standards! The house was immaculately clean! 
We had booked dinner in the Lady Helen restaurant and we went for the tasting menu! If you are staying in Mount Juliet i would recommend this highly and don’t forget to also go with the wines that the very capable & friendly team suggest - these compliment the dishes extremely well! 
I have to say i don’t think I have ever experienced a meal as beautiful and tasty as we had in the Lady Helen restaurant. There was long moments of silence as we savoured every course! 
So if you’re looking to get away from it all & enjoy a night or few in total relaxation then make sure you check out the good value that Mount Juliet have to offer. Don’t forget Breakfast is to die for too! Great selection of delicious food and the early morning views from the Lady Helen restaurant are quite special! you will have to see for yourself! 
The staff, the location, the surroundings and the food are first class!!! thank you to everyone we had a lovely time, only problem was that we couldn’t stay longer!",5,2012,04,19
239,"Like walking into a Jane Austen novel, only in Ireland","We stayed here recently after a day of sightseeing in nearby Killkenny. Everything about it was lovely--the grounds, the beautiful Georgian manor with firplaces blazing, elegant plaster relief dining room, names on the bedrooms (we stayed in the Lady Julia and the Master Fitzwilliam on the ground floor with private garden patios). Just really extra special & we don't even golf. The grounds were lovely for walking and as we arrived late (with kids) and didn't want a formal dinner we had a great casual bar dinner in the club house a short walk from the main guest house. It's grand and luxurious and special--can't wait to go back someday with just the hubby.",5,2012,04,16
239,This is the place to come back to...,"My wife and I we've already been at Mount Juliet three times. And we can't wait to get back. My wive is a experienced horse rider and she loves to go there. I had my fist riding lessons at the Estate. So we really appreciate the equastrian centre. But even more important to me is the food quality. We have been in some of the best restaurants in Europe and the States and as a Swiss hwo is spoilt with many great and famous restaurants in Switzerland I can really recommend the Lady Helen's Restaurant. It's really worth the money. We just spent time in a great and well-known Austrian Restaurant in Kitzbühel: It was good, but it was not the Lady Helen's Standard. The only little ""disappointment"" last time was that the kitchen wasen't flexibel enough for my wive who is a vegetarian. We will come back to Mount Juliet as soon as possible. It is our paradise...",5,2012,04,12
239,You Pay for quality!!,"Stayed here for 2 nights with my boyfriend in July.  It is definitely a luxurious experience.  The grounds are breathtakingly beautiful and the main house is stunning.  We stayed in the courtyard section which is equally impressive with views over the golf course.  Rooms are beautiful with everything you would expect from a 5 star.  The hotel offers bikes outside the main building so you can cycle around the grounds which are phenomenal.  There is also the opportunity to go horse riding.  We used the spa which was really good, however it is over priced in my opinion.  You could get the same treatments elsewhere for a lot cheaper!! But it is part of the experience, there is also complimentary access to the swimming pool on site.  We decided not to eat in lady Helen's restaurant and opted for the Kendal's restaurant instead, food was delicious and service was fantastic.  On our second night we went into Kilkenny, great traditional Irish night out, the pubs have live music playing and the craic was good. Breakfast in my opinion is a rip off at the Mount Juliet, much better to go into Thomastown and get a big Irish fry up for less than half the money!!  Overall a really beautiful hotel, with fantastic views and luxurious rooms! would highly recommend if celebrating a special occasion.",5,2012,04,02
239,Great time with the horses,"We stayed for only one night on our quick week in Ireland and had selected the Mount Juliet Estate because my daughter wanted to ride.  It turned out to be an excellent choice. 

We had reserved riding lessons at 10:30 and then a cross country ride for 2pm.  We had flown in from the States on the usual overnight flight and then drove right to the hotel so we were a bit dazed and confused when we got there at around 9 in the morning.  Very kindly the staff got us into our rooms for the earliest check-in I have ever done.  The stables were only 10 minute walk away, but the staff offered us a ride in the hotel car that happened to be available.

The lessons and ride were great and the 'girls' (sorry, but that's what they called themselves) at the stables were extremely positive, outgoing and skilled.  They did a good job of teaching me the basics and then shifting into advanced mode for my daughter (two separate lessons).

The ride through the estate served as a nice tour and a fun ride.  We didn't ride across the river to the stud farm, but walked over to it later and got a close up of the foals dancing around the mares.  Very fun to see.

I can see someone complaining that some of the hotel is dated, but we thought it was very charming and fit our imagination of an Irish estate house.  They had chunks of coal burning in the fireplace, which made for a surprising and nice aroma.  Much of the building is vintage, but in good condition.  The beds were some of the nicest we have recently slept in. The common rooms were active and well serviced late into the evening.  Our rooms had pretty views looking over the river, fields, and horses.

We did not golf or ride the free bikes left at the entrance, but those who did seem to enjoy it.  
There are some rooms not in the main house, but in newer buildings associated with the golf center.  They might be better for someone who likes newness and less good for someone who enjoys oldness.  Choose accordingly.",5,2012,03,29
239,Amazing,"Stayed here for the second time last Thursday and have to say it was even better second time round.  Stayed in one of the houses this time with a group of friends and didnt want to leave, the house was decorated & clean to a very high standard and so comfy.  We ate in Lady Helen's Restaurant in the main house and had the 8 course tasting menu, it was to die for!! Every course was served with a different wine and completmented each course perfectly.  The staff coudnt do enough for us with a brilliant, effiecent & friendly service and they even got the conceirge to drive us back to the house after dinner as it was raining. 5* service all round, will definitely save up up for another return visit soon!",5,2012,03,28
239,Not just for the Golfers...,We stayed at the end of February as part of a group from SIMI. The hotel and staff could not have looked after us better - still smiling at 3am! They even helped out at an impromptu awards dinner. The spa is lovely and the equestrian facility very well run. My husband - the golfer enjoyed his round and he didnt finish last.. Thank you all and in the words of the Terminator - I'll be back!,5,2012,03,27
239,Wonderful experience in one of Ireland's finest hotels.,"Just back from two day trip to celebrate my wife's birthday. The whole trip was fantastic. We stayed in the main house which is really lovely, ate twice in the Lady Helen restaurant where the food is genuinely michelin star quality. We played two rounds on the superb golf course which is in fantastic condition for the time of year. Staff were excellent and very friendly. This is certainly one Ireland's finest hotels.",5,2012,03,26
239,Luxury,"Amazing estate with stunning views, lots of facilities, brilliant staff and quality of food. 
Pros
We paid a bit extra to stay in the main house- well worth it
Staff excellent 
Views amazing
Lovely afternoon tea facility 
Luxury
Food amazing 
Lots of facilities ( golf, putting course, horse riding, pool &gym, play ground, clay pigeon shooting )

Cons
It is 20mins fro Kilkenny city so bear that in mind
Expensive to stay- as are most 5 star hotels of this quality
",5,2012,03,26
239,Afternoon tea.,"Was brought  for afternoon tea for ' Mothers Day' and it was a really enjoyable afternoon,  the food was lovely but I especially like the scones ..to die for. Best I have ever tasted! 
The staff were really friendly and nice. I will go back again.",4,2012,03,26
239,Fab hotel,"I recently stayed in one of the cottages in Mount Juliet with a group of girls. The hotel and grounds are fabulous, very relaxing and laid back definately the place to go to escape the hustle and bustle of life. 
The cottages where lovely, very luxurious stocked with everything you could possibly need and a lovely balcony over looking the golf course. In terms of value I can't comment as one of the others booked it as a special offer, we still paid 300 euros for one night, so I wouldn't like to find out what the regular price is, however it was money well spent. 
We cooked in our cottage, so again can't comment on the food. The leisure facilities are excellent, the staff in the leisure centre relaxed and welcoming. A nice touch is the bikes which are at guests disposal, they are literally dotted around the grounds and you can just hop on one for a spin which is always nice.
If I had any negative comments, which would be extremely hard in such a lovely hotel, it would be that check in was pretty slow and the poor girl serving behind the bar on the saturday afternoon was simply under qualified and too inexperienced to be in where she was - our group of 6 only ordered one round of drinks but she got quite flustered, had to ask for assistance and took an age to get them. It is definately not a reflection on her she was a lovely girl however she lacked confidence, we felt sorry for her having been left in a postion that she was not yet ready for. 
I would reccomend this to anyone - I would love to return in the future and take my family, there is a lovely playground on site and great walks to be had, however the price may be slightly prohibitive...but definately worth saving for.",4,2012,03,23
239,A True Irish 5 Star Hotel!,"There is no doubt that what makes a good hotel into a great hotel is it's staff. In the case of Mount Juliet, it's what turns a great hotel into an amazing hotel! 

What makes the staff here so fantastic is that they are so natural. So often in top hotels the staff have been trained to within an inch of their lives in some Swiss or French college, where they forgot to take the pokers out of their backsides after they got their degrees! Not so in here (or in the club house). It is obvious that they have been incredibly well trained. But it's also obvious that they have been taught not to be patronising or stuffy. It really was refreshing and I have to say made my stay an absolute pleasure!

Of course there is more to the hotel than just the staff. The hotel surroundings are beautiful with a sense of isolation, yet it's only 10 minutes from Kilkenny City. The rooms are very quaint and a decent size. The atmosphere in the bar is fantastic (helped on by the staff it must be said), and the food just hit the spot.

If you have read any of my other posts you will know that as well as staff, I'm also very concerned about my stomach and in particular, stuffing it full of goodies at breakfast. So it is breakfast where I have my one and only tiny negative: the porridge was just about average.",5,2012,03,20
239,Relaxation in another world,"Both Ailish & I were back down to stay in Mount Juliet again for both helping organise the Kilkenny Triathlon Club Duathlon and celebrating Ailish's Birthday.  We stayed in the same room in the Clubhouse as September '11 just beside the Leisure Centre that was as comfortable as ever.  We had lunch and dinner in the President's Bar and Kendals Restaurant, respectively.  The food was lovely and the staff were great.  It was great to relax in the swimming pool after a hectic day.  the breakfast on Sunday morning was as big as ever that filled us for the day.  The whole weekend was lovely, relaxing and great value.  Would highly recommend this establishment for anyone wanting to get away from all the busy lives to relax in the lovely quite countryside of Kilkenny.  We enjoyed it so much that we are already booking another weekend in mid-July.  Keep it up guys!! The grounds are beautiful in the lovely Spring we are having at the moment and Ailish just loves the drive I give her around the estate to see the beautiful surroundings.  There are some fantastic views of Mount Juliet House from many different parts of the estate that would take your breath away.  I would highly recommend this hotel for any couple or family just to get away from it all.  It is diffidently another world once you go inside the gates",5,2012,03,12
239,One of the very best,"Just back from another trip to Mount Juliet. We visit the hotel regularly and it has to be in the list of all the top hotels in Ireland. We stayed in the old house and ate in lady Helen's restaurant. 

The rooms are all incredible but we were lucky enough to have a suite. Easily the best hotel room, I have ever stayed in.

The food in the restaurant had even improved since the last time we were there and was as good as any restaurant around.

Staff and service are maintained at the highest level, discreet yet very attentive.

Hats off, it's a class act. Out in its own in Irish terms.",5,2012,03,11
239,You won't find better,"My girlfriend and I enjoyed the warmth and beauty of Mount Juliet at the turn of the year for three simply fantastic days.  We have been lucky enjoy to stay in some great hotels (FS New York, La Réserve de Beaulieu & Spa, The Balmoral in Edinburgh...) and I must say that Mount Juliet measures up to the true five star standard. From beginning to end we really enjoyed our stay from the beautiful grounds, the superb food, the warm friendly welcome and the efficiency of the staff.  Mount Juliet’s old world character coupled with the tranquility of the setting is special place to be lucky enough to spend some time – no stay could be too long.",5,2012,03,09
239,Something spectacular...,"To celebrate the graduation of my brother we decided to dine at Awarded Lady Helen (classified with 2 AA Rosette). The first thing that impressed me were the panoramic views it enjoys over the Mount Juliet estate and River Nore.
we chose a tasting menu, with dishes associated with different labels of wines. 
It was not a simple dinner of luxury, but a great sensory experience. The various flow rates indicate the quality of the cuisine of this restaurant, which plays a lot on the combination of meat and fish, using innovative methods of cooking and hen valuable raw materials treated with skill and presented as genuine works of culinary art.
After dinner we left the room with one and anly question: why this restaurant has not yet been awarded at least one Michelin star?",5,2012,03,08
239,Magical,"From start to finish, our family felt at home here, from the beautiful grounds to the staff and food enjoyed every minute.
Compared to many other hotels mount Juliet has character and soul something I find hard to find these days",5,2012,02,29
239,Outstanding in every way,"We spent three fantastic days in this little bit of Heaven.  From the moment we entered to check in to the time we had to leave,everything was perfect. We were given a gift from our children who were at a wedding in the hotel. We never left the Estate we walked to stud farm ,we watched people playing golf ,horse riding,running ,cycling and just relaxing . Plenty to do or do nothing just admire the beautiful Estate. We have to thank the lovely girl that checked us in and out, and the restaurant girls well led by Ann ,Fiona and Polish girl everyone was more than nice  I would say above and beyond the call of duty . We cant wait to return .                      thanks to all",5,2012,02,29
239,One hundred thousand welcomes,"My Wife and I have been coming to stay at Mount Juliet for over ten years now and have stayed twice so far this year. We have stayed in many hotels in many countries but Mount Juliet is without equal when considering comfort, quality and what I like to call “relaxed attention”. We plan to spend Christmas in Mount Juliet this year and I look forward to making that booking. From the pre-check in courtesy call through all of the treats we experience each time we are there, the Team are courteous, knowledgeable, friendly, professional, discreet, helpful and on and on and on. I can't wait to go back.",5,2012,02,28
239,Exquisite,"Perfection to the last detail. Caring and attentive staff, beautiful accomodation, delicious food and most importantly so many activities to keep one entertained on holidays. The walled garden and the bikes were a huge hit. I cant say enough about this beautiful spot and longing to return.",5,2012,02,27
239,Simply Beautiful,"Room bed and facilities on high standard , dinner in the restaurant of the club House very good quality and service.
The only little disconfort was the heat in the room was impossible to regulate in the room.
The final day we had breakfast in the main Hotel was superb .
I will go back any day in the future.",5,2012,02,20
239,Pure Class,"We're just back from a 1 night stay at Mount Juliet, this was a return visit after getting engaged here 7 years ago and i must say, pure class exudes out of every element of the place. Firstly, we were welcomed back warmly by its so-frienly staff and by the huge fires that warm your bones on a misty Irish day. The grounds are simply stunning and vast, the main house is like walking into a piece of art - and literally there are beautiful old paintings on every single wall. We stayed in the Rose Cottages which were stunning, and again cosy with your own fireplace and every amenity catered for. We ate in the Presidents bar when we arrived which was absolutely delicious (12 hour slow cooked pork shoulder sandwich with onion relish was the nicest thing i've eaten in a long time!) but getting up early and walking through the grounds before an amazing freshly cooked breakfast amungst the grandure of the Lady Helen dining room overlooking the River Nore brought all the happy memories of getting engaged here flooding back and more. We've availed of lots of 'groupon' type vouchers over the last while but you can come here and pay a little bit more (club house rooms start from €89 room only but add breakky and its still not too expensive) and have something really special and memorable. We were sad that we only had one night, so much so we're rebooked to come back for 2 nights within a month. How they can keep this place to such high standards in these recessionary times i don't know but keep it up because its appreciated!",5,2012,02,16
239,Great getaway place,"We stayed for 2 nights in the Club House.  The room was OK, though the bathroom was only average. The view over the estate was lovely though. What made up for the ordinary room though was the staff. The staff at Mount Juliet were one of the most friendly helpful group I have come across in a hotel. From John the Concierge to Pauline in Housekeeping. 
We had our first meal in the Presidents Bar, which is cosy with a log fire burning, the food was really good as well.  The second night we dined in the Kendals Restaurant. The food was also really good and the atmosphere was lovely, with lots of room between tables. 
The Spa was great we had facials and massage, the only part we didn't like was the tiny relaxation room.
The Pool was really nice and once again the staff were great and very helpful.
The grounds are very well kept and you could walk for miles in the peace and quiet, if only the weather would let you!
Great place and we would definately go again",4,2012,02,14
239,"Amazing hotel, fantastic restaurant in a beautiful setting.","Spent one night in the Mount Juliet hotel with my girlfriend recently. She paid for it as a gift so I can't really comment on the price but she said she got a great deal for the standard of service we received during our stay.

Got a back massage and facial in the spa neither of which I had experienced before. It was amazing and I definitely will try this again.

Had dinner in the Lady Helen restaurant that night and I would go as far as to say it was one of the best meals I ever had. The food was outstanding.

Finished off the wknd with a horse ride on the Sunday morning which I wasn't too keen on but it was fun to try.

All in all it was a fantastic experience and I definitely will be back!",5,2012,02,12
239,Favourite destination - a little bit special,"Super!!  We are regular visitors which says it all. Have tried all the accomodation - personal favourite main house for elegance and style. Along with the lovely rooms, variety of dining experiences, the relaxing spa it really is the staff that make the stay so relaxing. Nothing is too much trouble for them very friendly and courteous.",5,2012,02,02
239,Fabulous restaurant,I brought my husband to Lady Helens restaurant for the Tasting Menu. It couldn't have been more perfect. The staff were very attentive and friendly the food and wine was excellent and most important it was great value for money. I will definitely go back in the not too distant future. Thanks to all the staff at mount juliet.,5,2012,02,01
239,Amazing Weekend,"I was taken to Mount Juliet as a surprise last weekend and it was the most wonderful place. From the moment we pulled up outside it had captured my heart. The staff are exceptional as are the surroundings and the food. We were lucky enough to see the new born foals up in the stud followed by an Irish Coffee by the open fire to warm up afterwards. We had a delicious meal in Kendals with more excepional service. As I thought the place couldn't get any more magical we returned to our room where candles were lit, music playing, rose petals everywhere and a wonderful proposal. The staff really pulled out all the stops to make it special and their warmth made me feel as if I was announcing the news to friends! We will certainly be back.",5,2012,01,31
239,Suberb,"I spent last weekend in Mount Juliette.All I can say was my stay was amazing.There was nothing I could find fault with.From the wonderful staff, the suberb ambiance and gracious estate, and excellent dining experience, this has to be one of Ireland`s premier hotels worthy to be in league with the finest hotels of the world.Given these recessionary times I was pleased to see the hotel full.The Lady Helen restaurant, particularly the tasting menu was a Michelin star experience and so reasonably priced.I will definitely be returning.",5,2012,01,24
239,Exceptional Location,"We stayed at Mount Juliet for a wedding. The venue was exceptional. Bedroom could not be faulted, we stayed in the main house. Food was of a very high standard. The staff could not do enough. If you have time go for a stroll through the very scenic grounds.",5,2012,01,24
239,great weekend had by all,"We stayed at Mt Juliet to celebrate a family event recently. I only have positive feedback.
The hotel and lodges are fantastic, all old world feel about it, you really feel like you are away from the world and can just totally relax. Its so well hidden we found it hard to find! The staff were extremely helpful and the food and rooms were superb. everyone really enjoyed the stay. I would love to return again someday but this time for longer so that we have time to visit the spa and explore the estate, 2 days just weren't enough!",5,2012,01,23
239,Fantastic - can't wait to go back,"Stayed in Mount Juliet last night in the Rose Garden Lodges, they were fantastic, spotless, beautifully decorated, perfect for a group of 4 girls.  Estate is amazing, loads of walks, had dinner in Kendals restaurant, food was gorgeous, had duck which was delicious and very good value.  Staff everywhere were just lovely.  Breakfast was delicious, lovely buffet followed by french toast with bacon and maple syrup.  The main house is just luxurious, had coffees there.  1.5 hours from Dublin, fab location for all sorts, would go back there some time with the kids as they would love all the space on the estate, the playground etc, seems to cater for all ages.",5,2012,01,22
239,"Fabulous Hotel, lovely location, great staff....will return.","We have stayed in this hotel three times and will do so again.   We have just spent a lovely relaxing three days here at the beginning of January.  The hotel was still decorated for Christmas and the atmosphere was wonderful.   The hotel is an old Manor house and has been kept in the old style which works well.   The ambiance, location and staff really make this a wonderful hotel to visit.   The Lady Helen dining room is a wonderful experience, either for breakfast overlooking the rolling pastures leading to the woods with the river Nore flowing past, or for a leisurely sumptuous evening meal.   Some nights this dining room is closed and evening meals are available in the dining room in the Clubhouse or for a more informal snack in the President's Bar.   

The bedroom was well appointed and the bed very comfortable.   We were in a wing of the house and overlooked the main entrance.  The room was spotless and the furniture well kept.   The wallpaper was a little 'busy' but did not detract from the overall experience.

The staff were very friendly and helpful.   We walked every day in the grounds and relaxed completely while we were there.

We would recommend this hotel without hesitation",5,2012,01,14
239,Wonderful relaxing break for all three generations of family,"We stayed for several nights over the Christmas period and really enjoyed our stay, hoping to book again for the same time next year. The whole estate was beautifully decked out for Christmas. 
Fantastic leisure facilities with adults only time in middle of the day, (Those Hairdryers!!) and enjoyed my spa treatment as well, although it was heavily booked, so try to make your appointment as soon as you arrive if that's your kind of thing. Family also played several rounds of golf. A Tip for non-golfers: Ask for the map of the grounds at reception. Makes navigating your way around far easier and great for trails and long walks.

I think the restaurant Kendalls is a bit overpriced for the quality of the food it serves, but it had a lovely ambience. Breakfast every day was delicious.
A special thanks to the staff who were extremely accommodating, going out of their way for any requests we had, great in dealing with my grandfather who is senile, and allowed our party into the over 18s Spike Bar during a busy lunchtime when we had kids with us.

Rose Garden lodges were incredibly comfortable. If you are staying here, try to stop at a shop beforehand for food supplies as the kitchens are fully catered. Always nice to have something to put in the fridge to make you feel at home!",5,2012,01,13
239,One to tick all the boxes!,"Just back from a weekend stay at Mount Juliet and am already trying to rebook! The Estate is approx 15mins from the centre of Kilkenny which is a nice town with plenty of shops,restaurants,bars etc. The grounds are lovely and the children were spoilt for choice between the pool, the golf, the games room,playing tennis,horseriding, riding bikes and chasing squirrels! Staff were very friendly and were always happy to help. It's very child friendly, and even offers kids club at certain times during the year. We ate in The Conservatory and The Presidents Bar, both of which are located in the Clubhouse, which were perfect for us. I treated myself to a facial in the Spa which was just lovely.
Went to visit the Reptile Zoo in Gowran(approx15mins away) on our way home and would definately recommend this if you want to hold snakes,feed tortoises and see all sorts of other creepy crawlies!",5,2012,01,09
239,A little tired around the edges,"This was just a one night stay and I'm not a golfer but I do stay in 4 and 5 stars 100 nights plus a year.  Firstly, the positives:  Mount Juliet is a majestic estate and there is a lovely old world feel on arrival.  Staff are extremely courteous and give the impression that they really will go out of their way to help you. However, the rooms, whilst spacious and elegant befitting of a listed building, are somewhat tired around the edges with evidence of worn tiles and carpet in bathrooms and rooms (and indeed along the building's corridors) and mildew on the shower door;  in fact, the shabby look of the tiles takes away from the excellent classic fittings of the bathroom - as such, a part refurbishment would be fine but in my view, should be accomplished as a priority if Mount Juliet is to maintain a five star edge.",3,2012,01,03
239,A fabulous treat!  Stay here in this wonderful historic house,"We spent two nights at Mount Juliet shortly before Christmas.  It's a wonderful historic house where the character of by-gone days has been well preserved.  The situation is superb overlooking the golf links and stud.  We had a spacious twin room on the second floor overlooking the front of the house.  The room was toasty warm with all mod cons including a well equipped bathroom with a shower over a bath.  The staff were very friendly especially the bar and reception staff!  We would definitely recommend staying here.

There are wonderful long walks which pass by the golf course and stud which we really enjoyed.  The leisure facilities are in the golf club house which are clean though somewhat dated.  We didn't opt for any spa treatments.

Dinner choice on the Saturday night was either the full course menu or bar food at the golf club.  We had already had lunch so had decided not to opt for a full set meal. Instead we checked out the golf club menu which was a bit limited, ie fine for kids with burgers, chips etc but it didn't grab us so we headed into Thomastown to Cafe Sol.  The main dining room is not open on Sunday evenings but luckily there was a Christmas market so we purchased some excellent bits and pieces at the market for a snack dinner.  

We felt that the deal we were offered was great value and that this was a really excellent choice for two nights stay near Kilkenny.   We used this hotel as a base to visit Jerpoint Abbey, Bennetsbridge and Nicholas Mosse and Kilkenny itself.",5,2011,12,30
239,Stay Here,Stay here for good quality Irish hospitality 5 Star service Fantastic Golf Course you must stay here at least once for an experience of a life time,5,2011,12,28
239,"Excellent value for money, the staff are extremely helpful and attentive, the Santa train and Christmas market at Mount Juliet w","We booked a family trip to Mount Juliet to take in a trip on their Santa Train and also browse around their Christmas market. Their was 5 adults and 4 children in our party and it offered excellent value at €88. Each child got an excellent present from a brilliant Santa Claus, this was after having some stories read to them by an equally brilliant Mrs. Claus. There was no queuing, each family was called individually and nobody was rushed or hurried. The hotel offered an excellent rate of €139 for 2 adults and 2 children in an exquisite room, with a beautiful breakfast included. We will most definitely return to this hotel in the future and as soon as we can book for the Santa train 2012. We will be doing so. I would have no hesitation in rating the Mount Juliet hotel, Santa train and Christmas market 10 out of 10 for quality and value for money. We all really enjoyed it.",5,2011,12,15
239,Birthday celebration weekend,"The food in Kendal's restaurant was lovely and the atmosphere was very
relaxing and the service was excellent on Friday evening.
On Saturday both my wife and I enjoy the spa as the weather was
terrible and there would have been no sport playing golf in the rain.
We had a lovely lunch in the president's bar. We had our evening meal
in the lady Helen restaurant that again was fantastic, food was a
delight and service was again excellent.
Many many thanks and we both really enjoyed our weekend in Mount Juliet.
The best of luck in the future and again our thanks to all of the
Mount Juliet staff for their hard work and dedication.",5,2011,11,25
239,Romantic manor house south of Kilkenny. A trip back in time,"Lovely manor house from the Victorian era expanded by excellent modern Vila areas with nice Two bedroom suites with all the modern conveniences, including gas fireplaces. Bucolic setting on a hill overlooking a picturesque river and horse farm. Excellent restaurants, clubby bars, great golf course and elegant public rooms in the grand style.  Plenty of available outdoor activities.  Great place to spend some romantic nights.",5,2011,11,23
239,The good life....,"Stayed at Mount Juliet last weekend for my wife's birthday and the whole experience was just fantastic. It was the second time that we stayed there and it was every bit as good both times. The service and attention to detail is top class and each and every member of the staff make you feel so welcome. 
We went to the spa, which was fabulous and great value for money and ate in Kendal's Restaurant which, as the last time, was really fantastic and really good value. 
The swimming pool and leisure centre is also great but make sure if you are staying here that you make use of the wonderful grounds for a long walk because it really is stunning. Naturally if you are into golf the course is magnificent, one of the best around.
The only real negative that I'd have to point to is the size of our room in the Main House. The last time we stayed in the Golf Club and the room was huge but this time in the main house our room and double bed were both on the small size. The room was beautiful but should really be a good bit bigger for a five star. 
Anyway that to me is only a small thing in what otherwise was a wonderful stay and yes we will be back - no question about that. 
Mount Juliet really is the good life and great bang for your buck.",5,2011,11,22
239,'A little piece of heaven,"Stayed here for a one night package with friends.  We all loved the place, beautiful bedrooms, fabulous grounds, really really lovely hotel.  A little disappointed with the service, bar service not really up to standard and service with both dinner and breakfast very slow not up to 5* standards.",4,2011,11,20
239,Fabulous restaurant!,"We've eaten a few times in Mount Juliet for lunch and it never disappoints.  I'd love to stay over in Mount Juliet sometime.  The place is just stunning, the grounds are fabulous.  Service is great too - the staff are lovely.",5,2011,11,20
239,Splendid!,"Booked in for a 2 night weekend to discover Thomastown the home of John Martin. The hotel was second to none. Eamon the butler was extremely hospitable and the girls on reception warm and friendly. The room  was spacious and very comfortable, overlooking the estate. To top it all the food was fantastic, fillet steak to die for cooked to perfection. The surrounding countryside is beautiful and we even found John Martin's local in Thomastown for a pint of Guinness. This was a special weekend and will definitely be coming back",5,2011,11,17
239,Wonderful!!!,We spent two nights of our vacation in Ireland at the Mount Juliet.  I wish we had spent more.  It is a lovely hotel and people could not have been more nice.  We had a large room and were greeted with a bottle of champagne for our 25th anniversary.  We were also given a glass of champagne with our dinner.  We spent our two days horseback riding and taking long walks.  We had no desire to leave the property because it was so beautiful.  We ate a Lady Helen's and at Kendall's.  Both were fantastic.  Some of the best food we had in Ireland.  We would definitely stay here again.,5,2011,11,01
239,Lovely!,"We stayed at the Mount Juliet as part of a deal for Food Bloggers for the Savour Kilkenny food festival. This included a night's b&b and a tasting menu dinner.

The room we were given was beautiful, with lots of attention to detail. I loved how they had hidden the kettle away in an antique looking piece of furniture so that it didn't spoil the initial impact of the room. 

The meal was amazing! The chefs really worked incredibly hard to put together a varied, local menu. I was left feeling just perfectly full at the end.

The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful and I was amazed at their memory for names and faces, especially as I am terribly lacking in that ability myself! There was also an extra mistaken charge on the bill which was immediately taken off and, when I pointed out that they had missed our room service charge, it was waived. Excellent service!

Now that we know this is not just a golf hotel, we plan to return and perhaps try some of their on site activities.",5,2011,10,31
239,Wow - if only I had the money!,"Super hotel and one of the best golf courses in Ireland. Very relaxed. No need to dress up. Would go again and again and again, get the idea?
It costs a bit but then you only live once. ",5,2011,10,26
239,Loved our stay at Mount Juliet!,"What a delightful place to spend two days.  Had a beautiful room, a wonderful dinner in Lady Helen, the husbands played golf while we walked the beautiful grounds and horseback riding.  The bar was a lovely place to relax and have an after dinner drink.  Breakfast was perfect and they even packed some extra scones for the road.  Hated to leave!",5,2011,10,15
239,Absolutely Superb!!,"My boyfriend and I stayed @ Mount Juliet Estate for one night at the end of September. It was absolutely fantastic! We arrived at 3pm and relaxed with a few (rather lovely!) cocktails. 
If you're going here I would definitely recommend Kendals Restaurant the food is just fantastic, especially the chocolate melting middle dessert!
The staff were so lovely and friendly and the grounds so well-maintained. Our room had it's own private garden that we shared with 2 other rooms. 
We had such an amazing time (especially as my boyfriend proposed!) & my family & friends have now all booked a night away at this amazing estate. We cannot wait to go back.",5,2011,10,11
239,Heaven on earth,"My Husband and I had the wonderful delight of staying at Mount Juliet in Sept 2006.  We still think of it often as our place for a wonderful vacation.
He is an avid golfer and I am an avid equestrian--at Mount Juliet we could enjoy our individual passions and then meet in the pub for meals and sight seeing.

Mount Juliet offers a high bar for attention to detail and guest relations--I absolutely adore this spot in Ireland.  I cant recommend it any higher!",5,2011,10,06
239,A beautiful country getaway,"My wife and I stayed in Mt.Juliet for a couple of nights recently and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The estate is huge and long walks or bike rides (bikes freely available) can be taken throughout the grounds including the stud. The highlights were the excellent dinner in the Lady Kendall restaurant and the friendly, informal welcome that we received. The only gripe was that the room, which was located in the seperate Clubhouse complex, was not quite up to the standard of the rest of the resort but in saying that I would still rate the room as a decent 4 star standard. The resort is not cheap but in this case you definitely get what you pay for and we look forward to our next visit there. Btw we didn't play golf on this occasion but it goes without saying that the course is absolutely fantastic and formerly hosted the WGC and other significant events.",5,2011,10,05
239,Extremely peaceful and beautiful!,"I stayed at Mt. Juliet for two nights on a recent trip to Ireland.  This hotel is an old estate on many beautifully manicured acres.  The service and setting was top notch.  We stayed in the old converted stables (versus the main clubhouse) and found the room spacious and quiet.  We only ate breakfast at the hotel, but it was divine and the rooms in the main house are very regal.  Only complaint was that the equestrian center had no available horses left for riding, so book the activities early.  Looking forward to going back and staying longer.",4,2011,09,25
239,"Idyllic, luxurious and comfortable","Mt Juliet is gorgeous, but not stuffy or formal. The main house enjoys a stunning location, with beautiful public rooms and to-die-for views over a river and extensive horse pastures. Bedrooms are (mostly) very spacious with ultra-comfortable beds. Breakfast in the Lady Helen dining room is delicious - with a cold buffet and hot food ordered a la carte off an extensive menu card. Order the Oatmeal, and it'll come with a shamrock design! Service  throughout the Estate is courteous and cordial. If you meet the Estate Manager, Eamonn (or go fishing with him...), ask him about a visit to the kennels, where dozens of Irish Foxhounds will welcome you (literally) with howls of delight!  There are puppies, too!  The surrounding countryside and towns (Kilkenny, Thomastown) are lovely and appealing to visit. Plan to stay at least one more night than you'd planned . . . you won't regret it!  This is the Ireland you dream of.",5,2011,09,21
239,Luxury !,"We stayed at Mount Juliet near the end of September for one night and we both loved it.  The grounds are fabulous, both to look at from a comfortable chair with a book (me) or to jog around (my husband).  We had dinner there the evening we arrived.  It was super from start to finish.  The staff are incredibly polite and friendly and the house while enormous still has a very homely yet luxurious feel to it.  The bedroom we had was at the top of the house and was huge with a really comfortable bed and amazing view of the river and horses roaming the paddocks.  
There is a swimming pool/sauna in a building nearby.  It was fine but possibly could do with a bit of updating.  
We tried to book a horse-riding trek in Mount Juliet but they were fully booked out.  The girl in charge told us about another equestrian center nearby  called Warrington which I would highly recommend. It also worked out cheaper.
Overall it worked out quiet expensive but I think it was worth it for a special night away.",5,2011,09,17
239,A Beautiful and Relaxing Resort Hotel,"We greatly enjoyed our stay at Mount Juiet Estate. The hotel itself is wonderful. The original mansion was constructed in the 18th century and the dining room and sitting rooms all have superb moulded ceilings. The estate provides almost every conceivable means of relaxation--an excellent spa and swimming pool, a fine golf course, a skeet shooting range, and horse riding. Our guest room had a magnificent view out across the estate with grazing cows and thoroughbred horses (we were told our room was Tiger Woods's favorite!). The food in the Lady Helen Restaurant was excellent and the service impeccable. We recommend the Mount Juliet Estate strongly to those looking for a quiet period of relaxation in the country.  For anyone wishing to tour further, Kilkenny and Jerpoint Abbey are only a short distance away.",5,2011,09,14
239,Staying another World,"Last week Ailish, my fianceé, and I stayed in Mount Juliet Hotel for a night and it was wonderful. We were making this stay our last treat before we get married soon.  From the moment I made the booking with Louise in Reservations, the stay was great.  We stayed in one of the Clubhouse rooms just beside the Leisure Centre and this made it so handy for me because I swim alot and also use crutches to get around.  The room is spacious, lovely view from the window and lovely to stay in.  We had afternoon tea in Mount Juliet House and was lovely where we were treated so well by the staff.  Later that evening we had dinner in the Lady Helen Restaurant and was definitely a fine dining experience that we both enjoyed.  Between afternoon and afternoon tea, I drove Ailish around the estate in beautiful sunshine to see the beautiful scenery and the horses freely running around the fields below Mount Juliet House beside the River Nore.  The following morning both of us used the Leisure Centre for our daily keep fit routine and was ideally opened at 07:00 that suited us so well since we are early risers.  We went back to Mount Juliet House for breakfast and it was wonderful to have so much in beautiful surroundings.  Everywhere we went the staff looked after us so well and the food was enjoyed by both of us.  This was my fianceé's first time to be down there as a guest and would recommend it as something special to stay in.  Once you go inside the estate, you are entering a totally different world from the outside world, where relaxation and enjoying oneself is the most important thing.

With the opening of the M9 Motorway just a year ago and it passing very close to the venue, it makes it so much easier to travel from many locations around Ireland.  ONLY use exit 9 (Danesfort/Stoneyford) off the motorway to get to Mount Juliet and ignore other motorway signs at exit 7.",5,2011,09,13
239,Excellent 3 days in beautiful estate,"Got a deal in this hotel with ‘extend the weekend’ which was 3 nights B&B and 1 evening meal. We were upgraded to a river view room which was very spacious and well equipped with a very large bathroom with under floor heating and very nice toiletries. Super king size bed, trouser press, robes and slippers, turndown service with complimentary water.
The grounds of the estate are beautiful, championship golf course, stud farm and formal gardens. The whole estate covers 1500 acres and bicycles are supplied free of charge for those who wish to explore the estate.
Breakfast in The Lady Helen Restaurant was very good with an excellent selection of fresh squeezed juices, lovely fresh cut fruit selections, usual continental breakfast fare and a menu with freshly cooked full Irish with eggs how you wished. I have to say that the poached eggs were the nicest I and my wife have ever had. Compliments to the chef! 
We had dinner in the Lady Helen Restaurant 1 night and were very impressed with the service and quality of the food.
All in all it was a very good experience and I have no problem recommending this hotel to anyone. It rates as one of the best hotels we have stayed in Ireland.",5,2011,09,10
239,Great hotel and fabulous food,"We have returned from a 2 night stay at Mount Juliet.  We arrived at about lunchtime and unfortunately our room was not ready.  The receptionist apologised and told us she would give us a call when ready.  We took the opportunity to have a picnic lunch on the grounds surrounding the house.  A couple of hours later we returned to reception as we had not heard anything and the room was ready.  We were shown to our room by a porter who was very friendly and helpful.

The room was very spacious with a huge bed and great views over the river.  The bathroom was also large with a big bath and shower.

We dined in the Lady Helen on the first night.  The food was excellent and the service was very professional.  Breakfast also served here was fantastic with a great choice and friendly and efficient service.

We had a drink in the President's bar in Hunter's yard  each night and again the service was very good.  On the second night we ate in Kendal's restaurant.  A more relaxed dining environment than the Lady Helen but the food was also exceptional.

On this occasion we did not use the leisure or spa facilities and golf course was closed for maintenance, however, we enjoyed a lovely walk around the estate grounds.

All in all a great break in a fantastic hotel and we cant wait to go back.",5,2011,09,02
239,"Lovely hotel, not amazing value and spa needs to try harder","We stayed here for just 2 nights and thought it was quite expensive.   The 'deal' included a dinner for us both for one of the two nights and full breakfast both days but any spa treatments were extra and they were very pricey.  An hour's massage (which actually lasted 50 minutes) cost 80 Euros.   There seemed little variety of treatments available and the spa itself is separate from the pool/sauna/steam room part of the building, and neither area had a jacuzzi or any other cold/hot treatment areas.   You couldn't use the swimming pool without shelling out extra for a swimming cap (how ridiculous is that?) and there were almost no magazines or papers to read, which seems like a real missed opportunity.  The whole spa/pool place lacked atmosphere as well.

On the plus side, the room was large (though not especially well equipped - not even any biscuits in the room!) with lovely views overlooking the river and Stud farm, and the staff were generally polite and helpful, though not particularly friendly.

The food in the restaurant was the high point, especially the dinner which was truly excellent.",4,2011,09,01
239,"Superb food, excellent service, warm ambience - one for foodies!","10 minutes off the motorway the sylvan setting of Mount Juliet took our breath away as we drove up the spectacular avenue.  The horses, with their beautiful foals, the river Nore babbling along, and the grand house revealing itself from behind the deciduous forest meant our city tensions were ebbing away before we even got to the front door.

Greeted by welcoming staff, we were efficiently shown to our gorgeous room in the main house, overlooking the river.  Opening the windows we were greeted by soothing river sounds. The room was spacious, really well furnished and decorated in the plush elegant style of the house. The bed was gigantic and dressed with the best pillows and duvet all housed in very fine cotton. I felt like Alice in Wonderland. The bathroom, which also had the river view, was all spotless shiny surfaces, fluffy towels and yummy organic products.  The underfloor heating and heated towel rail added coziness to luxu 

Went to the Spa for a massage next. Lovely facility with really professional friendly staff. Had an hour long full body treatment, and although I would have preferred stronger pressure, my therapist erred correctly on the side of caution as I had told her that I had been suffering from severe back pain! It was still a very soothing and relaxing hour. Two little niggles - the treatment room was right beside reception so could hear phone ringing and chats throughout - the relaxation room is small and was very crowded on the day I visited. 
 
Cocktails on the lawn in the autumn evening sun were delicious and served to the table by the talented Matt. His raspberry mojitos were too easy to down but definitely made up some of my 5-a-day!! 

Dinner in The Lady Helen on both nights was quite simply superb fine dining in a gorgeous room with proper silver service. The food is sourced locally and seasonally, expertly handled and presented. The freshly baked breads, amuse bouches, palate cleansers and petit fours that interspersed each course were brilliant. After eating there on the first night we were struggling to believe it could be as good on night two. It was even better. The staff deserve massive praise here as the service is warm and friendly whilst also being professional and knowledgeable. This is a restaurant that takes it's food and customers seriously and will give some of the more stellar establishments in the south east a run for their money. 

Breakfast in the Lady Helen on both mornings was epic. Fresh ingredients again sourced with care, great choices, and all cooked to order. I have never tasted better marmalade!

The famed championship golf course In Mt Juliet, once the home of the Irish Open, is quite the challenge, but regardless of our skill level, the tranquil settings and top greens provided us with a thoroughly enjoyable round of golf.

Mount Juliet is a really stylish and impressive place to visit but it's essence is the relaxed and welcoming ambience. ",5,2011,08,30
239,Fantastic,"I brought a freind here for her birthday and was impressed with everything - the rooms were large, clean with really comfortable beds, the leisure centre great, the food superb, the staff really helpful and friendly. Well worth a visit.",5,2011,08,30
239,"Great Service, overall satisfactory night away","We had awaited our stay at Mount Juliet with great anticipation; it was a birthday treat to my husband (and a little treat for me too!!) Food was amazing; dinner in Kendall’s was gorgeous, along with breakfast the next morning (Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon was fabulous). Lunch of sandwiches, in the Clubhouse, was standard enough, but the service was brilliant during the day and again in the evening time, especially from Michael.  

The hotel itself is charming. The common rooms are beautiful, with great views out over the countryside. It is somewhat of a lengthy walk to the Clubhouse and the pool etc but just ask at the front door and they will drive you up! 

When allocated our room a lovely porter brought our bags and explained all the room information to us. Our room was a Riverview room and was very spacious. Even though the room was big, I didn’t get an air of luxury from it. The décor was obviously old style which I love but the room felt abit bare. The bed was very comfortable though.  The bathroom was nice, with bath and big shower.

We had an issue with our room early the following morning which was dealt with swiftly by reception, and on check out we were met by the manager who apologised for any inconvenience we were caused. I will not mention what the issue was here as I feel it would be unfair to the hotel as it really was a freak occurrence and they dealt with it well. 

Due to our room issue, we decided to check out early, so we did not use the pool facilities, which I was disappointed about. Therefore I cannot comment on them.

Overall Mount Juliet scored high for food and service. When booking the receptionist noted that it was my husband’s birthday but this was not recognized at all during our stay which I find abit of a let down for a 5 star hotel. We left on abit of a low note, but overall we had a good stay.",4,2011,08,30
239,The ultimate in decadence!,"We booked our one night stay as part of a package with Royal Irish Tours.  We had no idea we where going to be staying in a suite!.  All I can say is ""AMAZING""!!!  The location is picture perfect, the hotel help was top notch, and the food - to die for!  We would stay here again if we have the opportunity.  Only next time- stay more than one night.",5,2011,08,27
239,"A Real Treat, can't wait to get back","We recently stayed in Mount Juliet, and we were impressed, in every way, it was a real treat. The atmosphere was relaxing, there were lots of places to relax and unwind, which were quiet, and comfortabe, yet there were plenty of people around, in the bars and restaurants. While my wife made the most of the treats offered in the spa, I found a quiet corner in one of the lounges to catch up on all the newspapers. After a truly fantastic meal, we went for a stroll in the grounds, and what magnificent grounds they are, one of the most beautifully manicured spaces we have encountered. After our walk we were ready for a night cap in the bar, perfect. We needed another walk after a full irish breakfast, but we had plenty of options, and took the route by the river bank, another stunning walk. We left wondering what made our stay so pleasant, was it the service, the grounds, the house, we couldn't agree, but we both agreed we wanted to come back.",5,2011,08,22
239,Service standards slipping,"I holiday in Kilkenny every year and we always eat out once at least at Mount Juliet.

I first went about 20 years ago as the hotel opened -this was before the golf course and the Hunters Yard complex was developed.There was only the butery bar open at the time in the basement of the house itself. 

We have had great meals at the Lady Helen restaurant over the years and latterly tend to have bar meals in the Hunters Yard which are good value and a great spot for people watching.

This year I noticed that there seemed to be a lack of staff-one young flustered waitress and an overworked manager seemed to have to cope with the bar and the food service.

This was on a Tuesday evening and may have been an isolated staffing difficulty as we could not fault the service and standard of food over the years.

If you are in the area,you should stop off in the Hunters Yard-a little bit of affordable luxury with a cosmopolitan clientele",4,2011,08,22
239,loved it,"Just back from Mount Juliet and loved it. Last Time I stayed in the grounds Of Mount juliet was back in the late seventies with the scouts. So from Canvas to 5 star all the memories of those days came back as we walked around the estate and stud farm. Could not fault the staff on anything. One waiter stood out though, that was a young man in the presidents bar whose service and product knowledge was  excellent it was a text book Michel Roux Jr front off house service.",5,2011,08,18
239,Understaffed and unreliable,"I tried to book a spa weekend here yesterday and called to book. I was immediately told ""we are busy, can we ring you back?"" Half an hour later the call comes. I want to book the Presidential suite for one night as shown as available on the website. I am told it is not available. I book the Manor Superior room instead, along with dinner, breakfast and two spa treatments. The price quoted is €429. I am told dinner and spa bookings cannot be guaranteed as they are very busy. I suggest this might be an integral part of the stay and would like it confirmed that same are available. I am promised a confirmation email. The following day, still no email to confirm my booking. I call the hotel, ask for the general manager, he is not there, ask for the operations manager, he is not there. 5 hours later, I get a call from the Sales and Marketing Director. She is apologetic, promises better and states she will forward confirmation of my booking immediately. 3 hours later, still no email. Send the hotel an email. 2 hours later still no email. I call the hotel and speak to ""Keith"" the most senior manager on site. He announces himself as the food and beverage and duty manager of the evening. He too, promises to go immediately to reception, retrieve my emails and send me the confirmation I have requested. That was 3 hours ago and still no email. I have now cancelled my booking having read several similar trip advisor reviews with a similar thread to my own experience. I am sorry to post such a poor review, having not set foot inside the hotel. But, in some ways, I am glad I found out how little regard this hotel has for its customers prior to staying there. As Walt Disney once famously said, ""You can build the best palace in the world, but it's your people that make the difference"". Enough said.",1,2011,08,15
239,Lovely place to stay,"Spent 2 nights here 12 /13 August and enjoyed every aspect of the short break. Food was excellent and staff were curteous and extremely helpfull. We stayed in room 86 which had double doors opening on to a beautifully kept lawn area, Unfortunately one of the chairs in the patio was broken but it was not noticeable until you actually sat on it, a little dangerous and an accident waiting to happen. The last paint job must have been done by painters being chased by dogs as there was lots of daubes of paint left on the brass fixtures and fittings of doors, looks messy and portrays the wrong image of an otherwise excellent establishment.",4,2011,08,14
239,A night of luxury & amazing food,"we only had one night here and it left us wanting more. The first thing you notice is the lenght of the drive up to the hotel. The grounds are huge. The main house is quite small but the bedrooms are spread out in the grounds. we stayed in the hunter lodge. The room was quite small but tastefully decorated. we had a french door out to the garden.
The pool was in the same building & we were able to walk to it in our robes & slippers. 
We booked a table in the Lady Helen restaurant in the main building. We ordered the tasting menu & it was delicious. Eight courses & every one an explosion of flavour. The views from the dining room were exceptional & we sat watching the horses until it got dark.
After a few glasses of wine we did'nt feel like walking back to our room & were offered a lift back by one of the staff. Could'nt ask for better service than that.
Breakfast the next morning did'nt disappoint.. If we go back again I would like a room in the main house but thats just a personal choice as I could'nt fault the room we had.",5,2011,08,10
239,Great place!,"Beautiful place to go! Very nice, bright rooms, great service in the restaurant, and also great food! Mount Juliet is just the way it should be! Situated in the middle of Irish countryside, surrounded by parks, rivers and forest!  I highly recommend this place as a perfect option for quite weekend in Ireland. The only thing I didn't like was the pool - not the cleanest place I've seen :/",4,2011,08,09
239,"Beautiful setting, great food, we loved it","Everything about Mount Juliet is lovely; the house,gardens, dining room, staff. There are bicycles available for guests to explore the beautiful estate and visit the horses on the stud farm. Great way to work up an appetite for the best dinner I have had in a long time. Just perfect.",5,2011,08,03
239,Very disappointing afternoon tea,My family and I love afternoon tea and have had it in may different places. I booked it for my Mum's birthday and was very excitied about it. It was a huge disappointment. The fact we'd a booking was not acknowledgef at all-no table set aside. We were offered no menu though we later saw there was at least one other type of afternoon tea available. Usually also you have the option of champagne but no. The waiter was curt. When the food arrived our faces dropped-limited selection and near empty plates. Normally you are desperate to try everything but this wasn't exciting or appetising. I was embarrassed as this had been my idea. I would not go again.,3,2011,08,02
239,Stunning Estate - smallest bedroom ever!,"We just booked a one night stay to meet friends for an overnight catch-up. We stayed on the Sunday of a bank holiday weekend and the hotel was full which probably explained why we were put in the tiniest room ever!! The bed was not a double and luckily we are not large so just about managed. They had crammed everything into a tiny space and the bathroom was tiny too. Two people couldn't stay in that room for more than one night without going stir crazy!! When we checked out the receptionist said the room is usullay used for single occupancy and she commented that was why we got such a good room rate. We actually didn't get a great rate as friends of ours who were staying two nights got a much better rate than we did, so I felt that comment was a little unjustified.

That said the place is delightful. The house and grounds are truly stunning and the staff are fantastic, they are really friendly and couldn't do enough for you. We ate in Kendalls and were driven from the main house to the restaurant, we could have walked as it really is not far but we took the lift offered. The food was really good with a great choice and the service was first class. We opted to go back to the bar in the main house for after dinner drinks rather thany stay in the club house beside Kendalls and we had a lovely evening. I would love to have had more time to explore the grounds and we will definitely go back later this year but will avoid room 18!!",4,2011,08,01
239,"Top quality grounds, dinner & rooms let down a little by the service","Though I'm not connected at all to either of the two most recent reviews (27&28th July) I echo almost exactly what they've said about Mount Juliet.  The main house is a lovely building with beautiful, spacious rooms and the grounds are fantastic - we used the complimentary bikes and had peaceful walks.  The room we had (manor house superior - room number 1) was big and had access to a garden shared with just one other.  We also had a night at the Lady Helen restaurant and were very pleasantly surprised.  It appears nowhere in any guides of 'very top restaurants in Ireland' but actually we had one of the most enjoyable meals of the year there.  The pace was great, we'd a tasty, reasonably priced bottle of wine and the service was professional and very friendly.  It was romantic and cosy.  There was nothing incredibly special about the food but it was all well above average.  The setting overlooking the river was beautiful.  Service, at times, let the place down, though.  All the staff were well-meaning but on at least three occasions we'd ask for something and it was completely forgotten about - more pastries at breakfast, tea while sitting reading, and even a bill!  Breakfast service was particularly disappointing.  We did have some of the best freshly squeezed grapefruit and orange juice anywhere and the boxty potato cakes were a treat!  

We used the leisure centre facilities, too, and they're fine - not as good as some more modern ones but not shabby at all. 

We got a wonderful value deal for our three nights so really can have no complaints at all but if I was paying top price I'd hope for better service here.",4,2011,07,29
239,Lovely for a couples retreat!,"Stayed in the Presidential Suite for a romantic getaway. Fabulous rooms, and lovely food both at dinner & at breakfast. Staff were helpful & always courteous. 
Also availed of the leisure centre (very nice!) and Clay Pigeon shooting, which was great fun.",4,2011,07,29
239,"beautiful place let down by service, not 5 star","Magnificent grounds, romantic place to stay, horses across the feilds, river flowing by all good. The service was ok, not 5 star compared to some other places we have stayed in of the same class.
The gym staff did were not friendly, did not smile once. I hated going to that gym. The spa had good treatments but nothing special.Most staff seemed unsure as  if there were still being trained. Not at all what we expected. 
 The bedroom was lovely, we stayed in the rose garden area.There was black mould around the grouting in the bathroom which was a shock for a place like this. The shower curtain had not been changed when we checked in it was dirty at the bottom. Little things like this irritated us, the  staff need  to up their game to make this place truly 5 star. Even though the grounds were pretty and huge we will not be returning anytime soon.",4,2011,07,27
239,"Very pretty estate, but service not up to 5* billing","Had a nice stay with fabulous weather, slightly marred by some less-than-stellar service in the restaurants (not rude, but not 5* professional either.)  I would call it a good 4* in need of some staff training.

We arrived around 5:30 p.m. on Friday.  Main house is very pretty and our room was large and spotlessly clean.  We had reserved for dinner at the Lady Helen restaurant the next evening, so were planning to go for bar food on the Friday.  We asked at reception before going up to the room and were told we could eat at Kendalls restaurant or from the bar menu in the nearby Hunter's Lodge.  When we arrived up to the lodge at 8, we were informed they only had a 2-choice limited bar menu and that we should have reserved if we wanted to eat in Kendalls, as there were no tables available.  I don't mind if this is the case, but surprised reception hadn't mentioned it (assuming 5* service), given we specifically queried what would be our best course of action for dinner that night.

In the end, a waitress offered to let us eat in the bar area, but order from the Kendall restaurant menu, which was very accommodating.  But then she forgot about us.  Another waiter came out and took our order about 25 minutes later.  Our starter arrived in good time, but the main course took another 25 minutes to arrive thereafter.  The bar manager was very apologetic, but just seemed that there was no coordination / not enough staff on.

The next night, we had a relatively late reservation at the Lady Helen. The meal was pleasant, but our waitress never refilled our glasses from the bottle of wine we'd ordered (though she did it for other diners in the restaurant), meaning we had to get up, squeeze by another table to get our bottle from the shared ice bucket (all ice had melted, only cold water left) and pour it ourselves.  Just seemed like staff dropped the ball at the end of their shift.  This was confirmed when we overheard a one staff member say to another ""I just want to go home."" Cue awkward moment! Suffice to say, we didn't stick around long after our hastily eaten dessert.  

In all, I enjoyed exploring the estate, the spa treatments were good (apart from the weirdly claustrophoebic pre- and post-treatment room) and room was to a good standard.  But if you're billing yourself 5* and charging the prices, I'd expect the service to be more up to par.",3,2011,07,27
239,"Superb Surroundings only exceeded by the service, and the golf course","Mount Juliet is a haven so close to a main artery, close to Dublin and a couple of hours from Belfast. The room was enormous, the grounds are enormous,as was the hospitality in a very warm friendly way, which never felt intrusive.
We played golf on a championship course and used the locker room with the names  Ballesteros,Watson, Norman and Faldo on the lockers. ( past winners), the course lived up to the rest of the hospitality, quite superb.
We went on a tour of the grounds and met the Pack of Hounds, around 50 all very friendly and visited the stud farm and saw the foals and mares  We were also shown the ""tease"" and his little friend the goat, very amusing.
I sneaked off to have a go at the archery and they actually rang the instructor and got him out of bed to come and look after me, I was collected at the ""Big House"" and taken the butts, fitted out with a bow and really enjoyed myself,then I was taken back.
The food was excellent at all times during our stay.
I will return.",5,2011,07,19
239,My search for excellence is over!,"I know that perfection is just a journey but at last I have found the nearest thing to perfect! 
May I begin by saying that I have never felt compelled to write a review before now.
My wife and I spent a weekend at Mount Juilet to celebrate our 40th Wedding anniversary 
this month (July 2011). We just did'nt want to go home again. From our first glimpse of the imposing house by the river, from the driveway through the estate to the same view saying a sad goodbye, each step left such lasting happy memories that it's hard to believe we only live just over 1 hour away in Dublin. 
Let me begin with the lovely welcoming sincere smiles at check in..(great Kilkenny accents!)  Next the room...WOW a big turret style river view with horses and cows grazing in acres of green landscape. Bathroom totally modern with power shower to knock you for six!  Bed...massive king + size with the most luxurious feather and down pillows and duvet.....could'nt resist an olympic style belly flop.
OK...I'm beginning to go on a bit so I'll just mention the delicious dinner and lunch at Kendels, nature filled walks in total tranquility, golf players practising.... did I mention the elegant sitting rooms for Irish Times readers?
Finally, leave the best till last......my bill.....was there some mistake? We had an inclusive deal and all the way home I was trying to calculate how come if I had paid for our meals, I would have ended up paying nothing for our room. After the rip off treatment we all had to suffer during the celtic tiger years, this offer is nothing short of sensational! Does it get any better?   Yes it does. On our way out to the car, the General Manager appears to shake our hands and say thank you for visiting us... don't be a stranger. Try stopping us!",5,2011,07,18
239,we loved it and we will be back for sure!,"This was defintely our best 5 * holiday. since our  now 6 year old was born and is now our favourite destination. We stayed in the Rose Garden lodges.  these were clean, close to all amenities and were fully equipped with all mod cons including washing machine/dryer.  The resort's facilities are first class; the kids club is great, golf undeniably fantastic and choice of 3 restaurants but the highlight is the staff.  Without exception, they were professional and very friendly; they would do anything to make our stay memorable. One example, I called reception to say i had lost an ear-ring at the clay pigeon shooting range in the middle of the woods.  To my surpise it was returned 48 hours later. Shane (the range master) having been unable to find it the first day, had gone out a day later with a metal detector specifically to find it!  That is what I call service.",5,2011,07,17
239,Fabulous!,"Our family, including my two teens, were wowed by Mt. Juliet. It was the highlight of our week in Ireland. I had asked on TA for a ""wow"" place near Kilkenny with some historical value, and Mt. Juliet was recommended. Perfect!  Lovely estate, wonderful rooms and great dinner at Kendalls.  (We were worried because we knew Kendall's wasn't the estate's top restaurant--Lady Helen--but it was perfect.  We dressed up and the food and service matched the ""special occasion"" dining we were looking for.)  Breakfast is expensive--22 E each, but it was delicious and fit the ""splurge"" of the whole place for us.  For a kick, we even did clay pigeon shooting on Sunday morning, and Shane's tutelage ensured we all had success even though it was our first time.",5,2011,07,08
239,Carlsberg don`t do family breaks . . . .,"Where do you take 3 sons aged 19, 16 and 14 who want an action packed weeks holiday  -  Mum and Dad just want top class golf and a wee bit of luxury - Mount Juliet ticks all the boxes and was without doubt the best family holiday we have ever been on!  Where do I start - superb accommodation, excellent service, golf, tennis, fishing, shooting, cycling, walking, gym, spa, pool, driving range, go carting ( nearby ) or just simply chilling out on the balcony in one of the beautiful Rose Garden Lodges - the estate has it all!!  Worst part of our holiday - leaving.",5,2011,07,06
239,A truly wonderful experience - the perfect escape from it all,"I'm just back from Mount Juliet, having taken my good wife there for a 40th birthday treat. My expectations were high going there, but I wasnt disappointed. The experience started with the drive into the estate - magnificent landscaped grounds and woodlands. The welcome at the hotel was exceptional yet not overpowering - the staff couldnt have been more helpful in explaining to us everything the estate had to offer. The elegant old world accomodation helped make this getaway a real 'treat' for my wife - we had a 'Riverview' room and the view was breathtaking -it took all our determination to leave the room and the vista it presented and get out into the estate.
We ""grabbed"" 2 of the bikes provided to residents and took a leisurely cycle, stopping off to 'talk' to some horses and their foals of which there were many in the paddocks around the grounds - when we asked could we rent bikes, reception staff told us to just grab them from outside if no one was using them - lovely lack of formality and a great service.
A relaxing swin and sauna, set us up nicely for dinner in the Lady Helen restaurant. I thought that it might be a very stuffy affair, with jacket etc required, but the atmosphere in the beautiful dining room was very relaxed and intimate - the food was superb and the service was attentive but not overpowering - just right. 
The estate has so much to offer, we were out walking at 8am the next morning - 90 mins of wandering thru the woods and taking in the views of the river set us up nicely for breakfast - this was as enjoyable as the dinner (if that was possible) - followed by 2 hours of coffee and sunday papers - heaven.
My only negative is that I didnt have enough time to fully explore all the estate has to offer - like playing the championship golf course !!",5,2011,07,04
239,Amazing,"Wonderful hotel, beautifully appointment rooms, great service and delicious food. Could easily spend a week here.",5,2011,07,03
239,Out of this world!,"What can one say? Mount Juliet lives up to its reputation as one of Ireland's finest Hotels. From the grounds to the lobby to the corridors to the guest rooms you know you are staying somehow special. We stayed for a weekend in a double room which was exquisitely furnished, a mixture of classic and modern. The room was spotlessly clean and all of our requirements were fulfilled. The view from our room overlooking the lake was breathtaking and should one wish, the grounds are open to walk around at your leisure. We took our meals in the Lady Helen dining hall which like our own room was a sight to behold. There is a huge choice of breakfasts, substantial lunches and beautifully served dinners. We didn't spend too much time at the guest bar but it was very charming and atmospheric. We will definitely return again this year.",5,2011,07,01
239,Non existant customer service,"My financee and I had considered Mount Juliet as a wedding venue. From the get go my calls weren't recalled, emails ignored and messages apparently not passed or or just ignored.

Having finally managed to arrange a viewing (after several calls, voicemails and emails) we arrived from Dublin to be told that the wedding consultant was ill and that someone else would be showing us around. This would have been perfectly acceptable, except that the person showing us around couldn't answer the majority of our questions - not even if the hotel was available on our preferred date! She promised to have the wedding consultant call us the following week. Five months on and I'm still waiting! Given that we made a three hour round trip to view the hotel I find this appalling.

To add injury to insult, I sent a complaint email and this was also ignored.

My only positive experience was the waiter who served us tea.",1,2011,06,18
239,What a FANTASTIC place!!!!!!!,"We were in Mount Juliet last weekend for a wedding, WHAT A FANTASTIC PLACE!!! The ambience, the location, the staff, everything was 1st class. Nothing was too much trouble for the brilliant staff, the food was surperb, the rooms sheer luxery the spa out of this world!!
We will be returningas soon as possible!!!!! Cant wait!! This place deserves 10*",5,2011,06,18
239,Comfort and bliss,"My wife and I stayed here with 3 other couples. We were here to play golf, and the ladies were here to chill in the spa. On arrival we were directed towards the hotel reception. However we got way laid chatting to a barman by the name of Michael. We found him great company, although we feel he should get out to playmore golf, as he hinted to us. After checking in we enjoyed a fabulous meal in the French themed kendals. We retired to the presidents bar for the night until bed. 
The following day the ladies enjoyed the spa/pool and lunch whilst the lads took on the mammoth golf course. Much to our surprise was the oasis of the snack shop on the 10th hole. We were met by a big smile and out of this world burgers. The only complaint here was that we couldn't wash down the burgers with beers. That was ok as the food and service was first class. 
After finishing the course we went back to the club house for beers and lunch. Our stay ended the following day after another 18 holes whilst the girls went riding with a lovely lady called Jenny. Exceptionally good at her job and great fun. Thankyou so much for making our short stay an extremely enjoyable one. We are going to make this a yearly trip.",5,2011,06,10
239,"Cha Ching, but everyone should sample heaven!","Lovely manor house, fine service. Food service excellant and presented nicely, but... could improve on menu and flavour also length of time to serve. Dining room needs air conditioning.
Our room was spacious, and dated, but lovely. The bathroom one of my favourites down four stairs at end of bedroom. Room was very hot due to lack of air conditioning  and being on third floor, but windows did open partially. The rooms were clean, carpeting disgusting. 
It was an easy 15 min drive to Kilkenny and located in a more rural area. Grounds lovely, paddocks great to walk around. Fishing offered, gardens weren't up to snuff yet.
Golf course was nice, staff accommodating. Computer for internet at top of stairs free. Wifi in morning room. Staff very friendly
Main negatives for this hotel is the huge price and the lack of air conditioning. I would recommend it and would love to return for a week. I found it peaceful and relaxing.",4,2011,06,09
239,Brilliant Family Break in true five star luxury,"We recently stayed in one of the Rose Garden Cottages in the hotels grounds.  These cottages are absolutely georgeous really spacious with every amenity that a family could want.   We really felt it was like a home from home experience.   Mount Juliet is perfect for families of all ages offering a host of activities ranging from Horse Riding, Swimming,  Archery, Fishing, Golfing, Outdoor Play area, Kiddies Club and many more.  Our only critisim was that we couldn't stay longer.    I would definitely stay again and hopefully for a week the next time.",5,2011,06,09
239,Pure luxury in a heavenly setting!,"Beautiful old house set in acres of lush green landscape. Warm, natural welcome on arrival, chocolates and wine in the glorious bedroom. Our room faced out to the front of the hotel and overlooked a gently flowing river, complete with swans. Large spacious bathroom with bath and shower, huge comfy bed with fabulous linen. Dinner and breakfast in the Lady Helen dining room were scrumptious and service was excellent, friendly yet unobtrusive. Cycled around on the complinentary bikes, only sorry that we didn't have more time to explore the seemingly endless on-site activities; archery, tennis, croquet, spa, pool, golf.",5,2011,06,07
239,Nice enough wouldn't stay again!,"Was very excited to stay in Mount Juliet as I had lived in Thomastown a long time ago and looked forward to going back. First impressions were great the mares and foals in the fields on the drive up to the hotel and the grounds were lovely. Stayed for 3 nights I found the hotel staff friendly enough although Not what I would expect from 5 star! The leisure facilities were terrible I've seen better in 3 star! Went horse riding the instructor was lovely and chatted away happily the horses were more catered for beginners but maybe because that's the type of rider they mostly get  there. The spa was middle of the road and eventhough I payed for inclusive I was charged an extra 55 euro that I wasn't told about for one off the treatments. The room was only ok wallpaper held together with Sellotape is not really 5 star and nor was the cleaning of the rooms. The one MAJOR complaint I had was about one off the staff whereas overall the staff were ok one lad who works feeding the golfers in a kiosk made us wait 20 mins for a burger which he put on for me but gave to someone else and when asked about it said ""sure your not in a hurry are you"" Now that is Definatly NOT 5 star.
I won't be staying again Thank You!",3,2011,06,04
239,Stunning- Worth The Splurge,"We stayed in the lowest price room and were happy. Sure, we had to walk up 3 floors but the bed and space was great. The bathroom had a big tub and double sinks. Yummy breakfast in a beautiful room overlooking the fields. Take the time to do an activity. We did the clay shooting and had a blast! Shane was a wonderful tutor and super nice.",5,2011,05,25
239,Beautiful country house hotel,"Mount Juliet is set in a beautiful country estate, the main house overlooks the river Nore.  We stayed in the main house.  The bedroom was bright, clean, comfortable and spacious.  The bathroom was excellent, spotlessly clean.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  We ate dinner in the Lady Helen restaurant, be sure to book it in advance if you wish to eat there as it is not very big.  The food and service were excellent (as was breakfast the next morning).  All of the activities of such a sporting estate are available, we just used the swimming pool and leisure centre and it is fine.
Mount Juliet is perfect for a romantic night away.",4,2011,05,18
239,"Luxury, quiet, peaceful gem","Excellent Hotel. Staff were pleasant, very attentive, and efficient.  Some nice touches, like the roaring fires, long coated doormen, and the ambiance in the sitting room-lounge.  Food in main restaurant was just wonderful the first night, but very disappointing to see EXACTLY the same menu for the following two nights - not even a change of soup.  That's really not on and it would be enough to stop me staying more than two nights.  Golf course in excellent condition.  Spa and pool are separate from the main building, which is a bit annoying for a leisure resort hotel.  As always with the best hotels, the quality of the hotel is down to the quality of the staff, and this is where it scored a 10/10.  Expensive, definitely, but worth it for a special occasion.",5,2011,05,16
239,Heaven on earth,"My husband and I have just returned from a weekend stay at this wonderful hotel. We have stayed in Mount Juliet many times before and always love to return.  This time we stayed in the main house, whereas before we always stayed in the Rose Garden lodges.  Both are absolutely fabulous, but where the lodges are decorated in a more modern style (modernised for the 2009 season) the hotel remains very old world style, though both are absolutely luxurious.  The lodges are fully equipped with kitchen, two bedrooms and two bathrooms.  Free internet in all rooms, just ask for a cable at reception.  Everything about Mount Juliet is wonderful, the accommodation, the staff for whom nothing is too much trouble, the fabulous scenery, the food, the spa, the golf course, EVERYTHING!!!  Words just cannot describe how blissful it is to stay here.  When we drive through those gates we both instantly relax, it really is a special place.  A little bit of heaven in Co Kilkenny.  Can't wait to go back....",5,2011,04,17
239,Am-az-ing,"Just fantastic - from the moment you enter the grounds - to being greeted by all the friendly staff - the open fires, cosy rooms to sit and be served tea/drinks etc. - the wonderful dining - the lovely and varied walks in the estate .... and then the golf course - just superb 

not cheap ... but certainly 5 star - it gets into my top 3 Irish hotels - and above Adare which I thought was outstanding when I visited there in 2010 - so that is a high compliment!",5,2011,04,15
239,Just the most beautilful place!,"Had the good luck to be taken to Mount Juliet by some friends, what an amazing place this is. The house, grounds, facilities, staff and service are first class. Have to improve my golf, so will be back",5,2011,04,15
239,a little frayed around the edges but the magic is more than modern perfection,"great hotel.  found it by accident once on a drive from kilkenny.  stopped in and sat in the majors bar (I think).  Not actually a bar - kind of a salon off the bar that has a great view out over paddocks and the river.  fire place on full blast.  terrible wet day outside.  we ordered scones and tea.  well my girlfriend did.  i wasnt hungry.  it took ages for the scone and tea to arrive and i was raging and hungry at this stage as there was no service to be seen anywhere.  then service arrived with two freshly baked scones, jam and cream, a pot of tea and another pot of hot water to top it up.  Says it all!  

Have been back since for a wedding and it is a great spot for one - what a super estate!

this time stayed for a relaxing weekend and overdue break from work.  Superior room.  It had a bad smell of stale water which I am sure is not reflective of all the rooms and is hopefully something they can fix.  I didn't complain because the room was nice and bright and nicely appointed.  I love the hotel.  It is a bit frayed around the edges but the service is great, the grounds are great for walking in and cycling around, the fires are wonderful and the sitting rooms and bard are great for relaxing in.  Breakfast wasnt amazing but the ingredients were really top notch and you could taste it.  

It's not modern and perfect like the ritz carlton in powerscourt but it is so much more special and has a really nice feeling in the place.  I would definitely recommend it.  The ofood in hte restaurant is pretty good too and although the bar is expensive enough you are not too far from Kilkenny for lots of alternative!

enjoy!",4,2011,04,08
239,Still Top of the Line,We stayed at Mount Juliet eight years ago and it it is still the most elegant and amazing hotel we've ever visite - once again the highlight of the trip. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. The food in the Lady Helen restaurant is top rate. The house and grounds are beautiful beyond description. Thomastown is a little out of the way but the Mt. Juliet makes it absolutely worth it. Our next trip to Ireland will be directly to Mt. Juliet and I don't think we'll bother going anywhere else.,5,2011,04,02
239,Watch your belongings.,"Along with another family we stayed in the Rose Garden Lodges in February.  On the first night of our stay we had booked babysitters through the hotel & we went to Kendal's restaurant for dinner leaving our iPod Touch with our young children and that was the last we ever saw of it.  From first thing the next morning we searched extensively and sought the help of the hotel management both to report the loss & verify that every inch of the accommodation had been checked for it.  The duty manager was very helpful in helping us to look and record the loss. On our return we reported the loss to the local Garda to investigate.  Since then we have heard nothing from the hotel or Garda & while I appreciate a satisfactory outcome was unlikely, I am very disappointed that there was no attempt by the hotel to contact us to follow up as a courtesy under the circumstances.

This spoiled what was otherwise a very enjoyable weekend.  It would have been somewhere we would have returned to had the theft & its apparent dismissal by the management not marred the experience.",2,2011,03,31
239,Best hotel we've ever stayed at!,"Returned to Mount Juliet for a second time, couldn't believe it was possible but our stay was even better this time. Food was up to the usual really high standards, the staff were fantastic - couldnt do enough to help and the main reason we went back - the horse riding was absolutely fantastic. Excellent instruction and high quality horses to ride. We had a river view room and it was well worth it for the extra cost. The views across the estate were gorgeous! For anyone horse mad and a taste for quality will love it. For those with golfing partners - whilst we didn't play the golf course looked amazing. The spa is also well worth a visit. Can't wait for our next visit. ",5,2011,03,29
239,A favourite spot!,"I, my wife and my brother visited Mount Juliet yet again and we were very happy to do so after New Year and Christmas commitments. We were not disappointed and will  retunr again in 2011 hopefully.

Just a few points which may be worth noting for regulsr visitors and others.

The Lady Helen dining room did it for us yet again but we must say that Johnny and Olivier are greatly missed. It was the first week in charge for Aga,  the new young woman stepping up to replace Johnn,y and she did very very well. She has always been one of the best staff in the dining room. On this occasion she seemed to have little help of similar professional training. The waitresses I spoke to were possibly only students from some college or other and although they were pleasant enough they clearly lacked experience, and hence put even greater pressure on the other dining room staff that remain. And so I poured my own wine bottles each evening and put up with some basic oversights of the young waitresses. Every query about the menu choices could not be answered without running off to the kitchen and in the end I posed some simple queries that I knew could be answered just so as not to embarrass the waitress.  Aga's only obvious source of professional staff was a tall young man from Poland. He was excellent and deserves recognition.

The food itself was very good, as expected, and the menu gave wide choice. There was no a la carte option but the price was reasonable for the experience.  The menu was the same each evening however. We also agreed afterwards that there may well have been  a change of chef judging by our memories of previous meals. The dishes were good but perhaps less wow factor  than heretofore.

Breakfast was good, as always, and again Helen wasa very great host, even if under apparent pressure due to staffing level. This woman is the morning-time equivalent of Johnny in terms of professionalism and hospitality and if she were to leave then it would be disasterous for guests. For a five star offering there certainly seemed to be a lot of students bungling in front line service and one had to make allowances for little blips. for example, I asked for cocktails but the young woman said she could not make it up - fair enough - but she did not seek advice or assistance from other staff who were in the vicinity at the time. There is one very professional young man (dark hair and glasses if I recall) in the bar and lounge at times and he made up for any bad experiences with others.

Accommodation was great, as on previous stays, and the accommodation service staff are excellent. I love the ambience of this fine house and the peace and quiet are hard to match in other similar hotels. 

I was invited to a meal in Kendals Restaurant during my stay by one of my travel companions. This proved to be satisfying and a relaxed affair but it is no alternative to the Lady Helen experience or food quality. We had been guided fairly firmly at booking time to eat in Kendals on one evening but we were very glad that we had not followed the suggestions to do so.  Perhaps if you are travelling with kids then Kendals would be a good option.

I am personally of the opinion that Mount Juliet House is best enjoyed in the winter and Autumn ,months. And a long walks in the sylvian setting, a round of golf, or the fishing are good activities before returning to the wonderful log fires and relaxed public rooms for a hot port or whiskey or perhaps a generous afternoon tea with friends.

Thank you too to William Kirvy, General Manager, for welcome bottle of wine and handmade chocolates in our room on arrival. This is much appreciated and his choice of Fleurie was bang on the mark for this writer's preferences. 

This is a really good hotel and all three members of the party are looking forward to returning soon.",4,2011,03,12
239,Truly Exceptional and True Romance!!!,"My wife and I stayed in Mount Juliet on a romantic weekend away recently, and we couldnt rate it highly enough.  We loved just about everything about the weekend. We stayed in the main old house, which had been touched up and renewed since I stayed here on my only previous visit a few years ago. Despite its 5 star service (which did live up to its billing), the staff managed to not come across as stuffy (as can often be the case) and in fact were extremely friendly. By the end of the weekend we were on first name terms with virtually all of them, which made us feel very much at home.  

We chose to have dinner both nights in the Lady Helen Restaurant in the old house, the second night by a roaring fire, which with a good bottle of wine from their excellent wine list (we are both wine aficionados), was as romantic as it gets. We were especially impressed by the complimentary 2 courses we received (above and beyond what we had ordered), and the chocolates from the in-house chocolatier were to die for.  DO NOT MISS THESE IF YOU STAY HERE!! Over the course of the two days we had an opportunity to laze around in one of their several drawing rooms (all with roaring fires), and we loved having a drink in their small sopisticated bar.  Breakfast in the morning was also in the Lady Helen Restaurant, which offered a very decent menu with a variety of cooked breakfasts (amongst other things), and lunch was up in the clubhouse.  

I headed out for a round of golf on the Saturday afternoon, and would still rate it as one of the finest golf courses I have ever played on in any country, certainly the best in Ireland.  Even if you do not play golf I would strongly recommend you to check out the Mens Locker Room in the Clubhouse, which absolutely fascinated me with the names of all the golfers that have used each individual locker in the past, presumably during the 2002 or 2004 WGC American Express Championship.  I managed to use the Ernie Els locker, happy because he was the winner in 2004, found myself wondering what was going through his mind as he sat in this very spot getting ready like I was doing for my round of golf.  However, I couldnt find the 2002 winner Tiger Woods for some reason, maybe he had his own special locker room!!  Being a sheer golf enhusiast, I was also fascinated by the memorabilia in the clubhouse bar, including an old set of clubs from Jack Nicklaus.

While I was out on the course my wife went for a swim and a massage, and was very happy with that. Another highlight of our weekend was our 8 mile Sunday morning jog around the estate, which wound up and down through wooded areas, across the river and over across the stud farm (also within the estate).  

All in all, an exceptional weekend, and couldnt speak highly enough of the place or its friendly but excellent staff. True romance!!",5,2011,03,08
239,Open Log Fire Romance,"Beautiful hotel and grounds, friendly staff and superb food! The drawing room after dinner is the perfect place to relax in front of a crackling open fire. Super offers available!",5,2011,03,06
239,Not even close to Five Stars,"Hmmm, this is not a bad hotel...in fact it is quite nice. My problem, which I've noticed throughout Ireland is the grading system.  I am furious at 3/4 star hotels passing themselves off as 5 star - this is a complete misrepresentation.  We got a very good weekend deal in Mount Juliet, but I would have been looking for our money back had I paid full whack.  
Restaurant - The President - food just okay nothing special - it was a mild weekend but the room was stiflingly hot. - No Sommalier - Not a five star hotel restaurant - completely lacks atmosphere with everyone ""whispering""
Bedroom - Tatty and dusty, Shower is overhead in bath - no temperature control!! - varies from hot to lukewarm...
SPA - Excellent massage, but what is with the Ante and Post being the room - I've never ever seen that before, rediculous - they should have loungers with a view, herbal tea etc
Swimming Pool - Appalling design with harsh angles, ceiling hangings that are stained and are unsightly.  They charge guests €4 for the cheapest unbranded swimming hat I've ever seen.  That's naked gouging if ever I saw it.
Staff - mostly from overseas, all very nice but seemed ""timid"" - clearly not trained to five star standard.
What turned out to be a dissapointing weekend was topped-off by the two items we were overcharged on our bill to the tune of €100.  The receptionist seemed barely to blink and I'm not even sure she apologised.
If I'd been told beforehand this was a 3 or even 4 star hotel, I think I'd have been happy enough.  I wanted to stay at a 5 star and this was not it. Arrogant Misrepresentation and we will obviously not be back.",2,2011,02,23
239,An Amazing Experience in one of the Best Irish Hotels,"I stayed here in September on a romantic break away with my wife. I had stayed before but I found that the service and standards had been exceled if that's possible. Anyway, had a luxurious river view room, massive bathroom, and the most comfortable bed. Dinner in the lady Helen restaurant was 2 and a half hours of magic.... Starters, amuse bouche, mains, and the amaIng souffle for dessert. I just want to go back. The only thing I would say about the meal is that my beef came on a bed of horseradish mash and we got potatoes on the side which was a bit too much. 

Anyway next morning headed off for a walk around the esatate in the mist before getting lunch in the bar and heading home. 
Thanks to Johnny in the Restaurant for a wonderful meal and the hotel staff for a great stay. Will certainly return!",5,2011,02,17
239,Old world romance - all round beautifully relaxing experience,"My partner and I picked this hotel for a Valentine's weekend break and to celebrate a milestone in our relationship as we felt that it was one of the most romantic venues in Ireland - we were not disappointed.  The hotel house has several ornate reception rooms downstairs each with open fireplaces and beautiful views. We stayed in a suite which was breathtaking and extremely comfortable.  We loved the touch of Lyric fm being switched on at turndown so that when we returned from dinner we were greeted by soft lighting and gentle classical music.  While the leisure centre is located in a separate building the staff are always at the ready to provide a lift to the guests.  One night we felt like indulging a little extra before bedtime and the staff were very helpful in arranging to drive us over to Kendall's brasserie (just a moment away but it was pouring rain!) for some delicious desserts.  While we did not eat dinner at the Lady Helen restaurant or at Kendall's we could see that the atmosphere in both was very lovely and the President's bar had live music at the weekend.  Breakfast was delicious and the staff were very friendly and accommodating.  During the day we greatly enjoyed cycling around the estate (complimentary bikes), going for walks or simply unwinding in our room and found the trip on the whole thoroughly relaxing with us leaving entirely satisfied.  The only negative I can suggest is that some of the decor (e.g. paintings) was not immediately to my taste as it was highly equestrian/hunting-focused though this was due to the authenticity of the hotel.  Indeed, staying at Mount Juliet did not feel so much like staying at a hotel business as being a guest at a country house home. Between the stunning views and the ornate detail of the house it is a feast for the eyes and the soul to be recommended to anyone looking to get away from it all.",5,2011,02,13
239,Wonderful staff & grounds,"Hotel is set on lovely grounds and the staff are all very friendly.  The butler (sorry cant remember his name) and Eileen the receptionist were both exceptionally lovely.  We had a meal in the Presidents Bar which was nice.  The room was a big disappointment and definatley not 5 star - very dated and the curtains were filthy.  Bedsheets also had lots of stains on them.  Bathroom was very dated (avocado coloured tiles around the sink), very old cheap fittings.  The leisure centre was nice but gym was a bit small and pool had lots of cracked tiles.  Overall enjoyed our trip it's very close to Kilkenny.  Seems to have gotten the 5 star rating due to the golf course, in reality it's more 3 star.",3,2011,02,07
239,WORST HOTEL IN IRELAND,"This is possibly one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. We stayed here for one night and we were so excited after all it is 5 star how wrong was I. The grounds to the hotel are fabulous and on entering we were very impressed but as soon as we seen the hotel we thought this is badly in need of a refurbishment but not to put us off we had seen the pictures of the rooms and were looking forward to seeing our room. Receptionist was nice when we checked in and called the butler who led us up to the rooms we were we were staying and at one point he turned round to me and said I should carry your bag it doesn't look right otherwise. He led us to the room and on entry I was shocked the room was old fashioned lamps were dirty, curtains had stains on them, sofa was dirty and TV had wires hanging off it, toilet was not cleaned properly. From that moment we didn't even want to stay in the hotel and the next morning we had breakfast.Dining area was filthy with dust and breakfast was cold. I have stayed in many hotels 3 to 4 star and never has such a bad experience and although we got a good deal it was not worth the money.  Don't know how this hotel is 5 star badly n need of refurbishment worst ever I have seen more 1 or 2 star.   Would not recommend this hotel and will never set foot in the place again.",1,2011,01,30
239,Memorable Christmas,"A truly first class experience. We were welcomed and looked after exceptionally well when we arrived. It was good to meet the manager, William who was extremely helpful; as was Johnny, as usual. (It’s a pity he’s gone elsewhere but we wish him well with his career). The accommodation was up to the standard we expected except that for the first couple of days it was a little on the cool side. That was not your fault – it was -13 degs. outside!! Unbelieveable cold for Ireland.The service was top class and we really enjoyed the food. The music in the bar downstairs on St. Stephens night was fantastic There was a real house party atmosphere and we met a number of really nice people. For us, it was a just a great time and if we go away again at Christmas, we will definitely return – price permitting!

Thanks to all the staff for making our Christmas that little bit special.",5,2011,01,22
239,Simply the Best,"Our daughter had recommended Mount Juliet as their stay in December had been so good.
We treated our friends from The USA to a one night break as part of their visit to Ireland.The off season price was 99 euro per person Inc breakfast and dinner.  Fantastic value!
I had paid a little to upgrade and our rooms were stunning; large and beautifully furnished with one overlooking the estate and ours opening out onto a private walled garden.There was a problem with the central heating for a couple of hours.  The staff brought heaters and our friends opted to move to another room and had free coffee in the lounge while they waited.  Nothing was too much trouble.  It came on after two hours.
Our evening meal was in their main dining room, the Lady Helen and it is spectacular.  I have eaten in many one, two and three Micheline star restaurants and this meal was up there with the best.
From service to presentation, from quality to taste and overall quality this was an outstanding meal.  Afters were served in one of the many lounges as we glowed after our six course meal.
Breakfast was the usual range of fruit, cold meats, breads and cereals but the cooked range was freshly prepared and cooked to order.  Oh how I loathe bacon and eggs that have been sitting around with people picking over them and dropping who knows what onto them.
My eggs were too hard and were instantly replaced by two freshly fried over and easy.
A walk in the park on a bright sunny January day and then on to Mosse's pottery.
There is a new annex about 500 yards away along with spa, pool and top golf course.  Stay in the main house and forget those distractions. 
Truly a memorable 24hours and we will be back.",5,2011,01,15
239,Lovely hotel,"We stayed for 4 nights over the New Year.    We both wanted to ride, so the equestrian centre was what we were interested in (although the golf course seems to be a big attraction!).    From my first e-mail enquiry to checkout the service was exemplary.   Every question answered promptly;  every booking confirmed and all in order on the day.   The room was wonderful;   the food first class (the produce was obviously of the best quality) .   There are two good restaurants and a bar to eat in;  and its nice to dress up a bit for dinner on occasion.   New Years Eve Ball was simply spendid and the riding very good fun, and very safe.  There is a lovely well equiped gym (yes, I used it every day but still put on weight) and a nice pool.   Locally there is lots to do;  try the "" Circle of Friends"" cafe in Inistioge where the home made cakes are excellent (and portions enormous!) and Nicholas Mosse hand made pottery at Bennettsbridge and you can walk from the hotel to the Jerpoint Glass Studio which is brilliant.    The surroundings are lovely;  and I cannot recommend the place enough.",5,2011,01,04
239,Superb Service,"Myself & my family recently stayed in Mount Juliet to celebrate my sisters birthday. The atmosphere in the hotel was truly amazing and we all felt so relaxed from the moment we arrived. The meal in the Lady Helen restaurant on Saturday night was absolutely gorgeous. The attention to detail was really impressive. I also must compliment all the staff on being so friendly, helpful and they really went out of their way to make our stay very special.  Myself & my family are already looking forward to our next stay in Mount Juliet.",5,2010,12,23
239,Perfect location for a perfect wedding day,Myself and my husband got married in a chapel in Thomastown and went on to have our wedding reception meal in Mount Juliet. We live in Thomastown and often walk our dog around the grounds and couldn't think of anywhere nicer to spend our special day. We were delighted when 'June' the wedding coordinater arranged a perfect day for us. The day fit our individual needs to a T. The scenary around the hotel provided the perfect backdrop for our photographs. We had the meal in the main house overlooking the river (so nice!). Johnny the hotel manager was fabulous and all the waiters were very good. The house wine went down very well and the food was out of this world. The complimentary room was the lovliest hotel room I've ever stayed in and the complimentary champagne was a lovely touch. We plan to return each year for our anniversary and would highly recommend couples go for a romantic break. Plus Thomastown is the nicest and quirkiest town I know.,5,2010,12,15
239,A lovely place to visit......,"have just returned from a surprise one night stay in Mount Juliet. I was taken as a treat for my birthday and I have to say from the very moment we arrived it was a real treat..... Even before our arrival actually. (While we were en route, we received a call from the hotel to advise us that the roads were quite bad due to snowy conditions, and were advised us to take an alternate route, which worked out great) When we arrived we were given a warm greeting by the staff at the door and in the reception..... As first time guests we were shown around the house and its facilities - It was wonderful. Our room was traditional, decedent and spacious and it made my girlfriend feel like a right little princess (As a side note - The bed is the most comfortable bed I’ve EVER slept in).

We had lunch in the presidents bar (having been driven up by the driver as it was too cold to walk) That was delicious, and the service was very good! We returned to the room where we were gifted with a complimentary bottle of wine and some chocolates (Im not sure if this is standard or because we mentioned my birthday) but it was a real treat and the wine was delicious.... We went for Dinner in the lady Helen Dining Room and everything about it was fantastic..... I had venison wellington and it was amazing. 

I do however have one minor complaint - We were in room ""5"" and Im not sure what is located above our room but sometimes it was very noisy and there was a lot of movement going on in the early morning and at night. It was a small issue on an overall wonderful experience! I would recommend it to anyone for a quiet/romantic break away.",4,2010,11,30
239,Coule not have been better,"I stayed in Mount Juliet in early November for a family birthday. Food, roooms and service were superb. All of the staff who we met during the weekend were immensely helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel. To quote the Governator 'I'll be back'.",4,2010,11,11
239,Luxury and Class,"I had a work ‘away day’ during the summer and was thrilled when we were informed it was Mount Juliet for two nights!  This place oozes charm and class. Magnificent old house with beautiful rooms and marvelous food. The Lady Helen Restaurant is amazing. Our group of 12 had dinner there and it was simply divine. Drinks in the club house added some craic after a busy day of meetings. The walks around Mount Juliet are truly awesome - down by the River Nore and up towards the stables where the stallions, mares and ponies are.  We loved our away day there and have been talking about it at the office since coming back.",5,2010,11,03
239,Fantastic Set up,"Years ago I stayed in this hotel & had a wonderful time. Again this experiance was relpicated with a stay this Sept when myself & a few of our friends ventured to Thomastown for golf & a night away. A friend of hours has a house in the grounds so we didn't stay in the hotel.
 We were given a very good rate for our golf, which is always a challange on the beautiful parkland course - we were blessed with the  day which only added to our enjoyment. 
After our golf we showered & change it the very comfortable golf facilities. We then had dinner in the the the golf club which is ladened with great sporting pictures & titbits of information. Here I ate the best ""cod & chips"" I have tasted in years. The services was excellant & all staff very pleasent & helpfull. We were let sit, enjoy our meal and following that given space & comfort to chat & have a few drinks. 
Before our departure next morning, we walk arround this magnificant estate, it's beauty magnified by the autumnal colours of nature. I look forward again to visiting this wonderful place, be it for golf or a romantic weekend.",5,2010,10,31
239,Just a great experience,"I can't isolate any one element of the visit as being better than another....because everything works very well at Mount Juliet. Even with cool, rainy weather the entire experience was top class. The food was very good, both the casual dining and the more elegant offering. The golf course is great. The grounds are beautiful. The staff are courteous and efficient. Kudos to whoever manages this place for not simply relying on the setting and charm of the place to sell it (as certain other Irish venues do) , there's a lot of work has gone into delivering a world-class product.",5,2010,10,30
239,Pure Bliss,Stay in the Rose Garden Lodge for one night with friends for a spa break. The treatments were divine and girls in the spa very helpful and friendly. The Rose Garden Lodges were superb could not fault the hotel or the staff. Just wish it could of being longer than one night!,5,2010,10,26
239,Gorgeous grounds~fabulous hospitality,"Ireland has to be one  of the most beautiful places in the world.  Staying at Mount Juliet was a wonderful retreat from the big cities, and we enjoyed our 5 day stay there yet we wished we had time to extend our stay!  The rooms are spacious and airy--lovely views of the countryside--which is breathtaking.  We cycled around the property and visited the horse barns--played golf--enjoyed all of the amenities of this well-maintained estate.  We will return!",5,2010,10,22
239,elegant hotel with  wonderful grounds and friendly effecient service,"We spent  3 very enjoyable nights here last week in beautiful surroundings, enjoyed excellent food and wonderful service from the dining room staff, in particular Ann Marie.
We look forward to returning.

Clare, Dublin",5,2010,10,20
239,The perfect hotel,"we have been staying in Mount Juliet for years, mostly with our children, who are now 10 and 7.  We just love the hotel - it is so elegant and gracious, and a perfect getaway for everyone - whether families, groups or couples.  We like to stay in the main house, where the hotel always accommodates the four of us in one room.  However, the self catering lodges are also really nicely done.  The facilities are second to none - a great pool, spa/gym and of course, the golf course, an 18 hole putting green, which we all play, tennis, playground, horse-riding, snooker etc.  Plenty to keep everyone occupied for days on end!  Dinner in either the golf club or the Lady Helen is wonderful - last time we were there, the kids also ate with us in the Lady Helen, and the staff were wonderful to the kids - not at all snooty.  The service is always perfect in Mount Juliet; the staff cannot do enough for you.  We will go back again and again.",5,2010,10,07
239,"Stay away, NOT a 5 star, 2 at best - better hotels in Kilkenny","We stayed in Mount Juliet for 3 nights in September.  Granted first impressions of drive up to the main house is impressive, golf course, lovely grounds etc etc, however, this alone does warrant the 5 star rating nor does it make up for a terrible customer service and low standards.  Mount Juliet is like staying in an old haunted mansion.  There is never any staff around when you need them, empty rooms, empty bar, empty reception!  When we booked we were not advised that Lady Helen (main restaurant) would be closed for 2 out of 3 nights. We couldn't book a table and the staff didn't care nor did they try to fit us in.  So much for a warm Irish welcome - the staff were extremely rude all with the exception of Jacob (porter) and Shane (instructor for archery).  The girls at reception were rude and spoke over us as they continued with their own personal conversation & laughed in our faces.  The serving staff at breakfast were friendly would a shower would be preferrable - greasy hair, unkept appearance, dirty uniform and filthy nails, oh and the moudly stale toast didn't help breakfast go down easily.  Don't use the thermal suites which offers a TINY sauna & steam room - it has been a while since they have been cleaned and there were more hairs in the steam room than you would find on a hairdresser floor.  If you wanted to use the gym, swimming pool, spa, thermal suits, club house, club house bar, pro shop you had to walk from main house to another area in the grounds.  The ""courtsey cars"" were never available.  Rooms were nice with an old fashioned decor however the shower was filthy, the room itself and furntiure was extremely dusty and the bathroom was filled with flies (we were asked not to open the windows!).  The hotel has lots of history and good ghost stories however it I don't think that threadbare carpets and dirty old chairs add in any way to old historic charm.  I cant comment on the food served in the main restaurant (as the staff were not bothered about fitting us in) however the food in the club house was below standard with a very strong horrible smell of salmon when you walk in, ugh.  I would suggest that you visit Mount J for a cup of tea / coffee to enjoy the views but don't stay over night.  Good hotel in theory however it does not translate into a good experience. I will defintely NEVER return.",1,2010,09,29
239,Hands down best hotel I have ever stayed at!,"This hotel is right out of a Jane Austen book. They have the best guest service, everyone is friendly and willing to help you. The hotel is very clean and quiet and beautifully decorated.  The grounds are breath-taking and great if you are looking to relax. There is plenty of activities; we went fishing and clay pigeon shooting for the first time - what a blast! We also went on a bike ride around the estate.   I've never written a review before, but felt so strongly about the quality of my stay, I have to recommend this hotel. I can't wait to go back, only for a much longer stay this time!",5,2010,09,22
239,Always loved it .... but standard of service has deteriorated!,"At least once a year as a treat, myself and my husband book into Mt Juliet - we just love everything about the place.  Unfortunately we were very disappointed this summer.  We booked a two night trip with golf - weather was great, golf was great and all the staff on the course and in the pro shop were without fault.  The grounds and main house were as usual just beautiful, but the front of house staff and restaurant staff were a disaster - in fact one lady was quite rude when we were arranging our booking, we were really shocked by her attitude, but wanted to believe that once we got there it would be great.  We weren't warned by front house staff and It's quite confusing that ONLY every other night you can eat in the Lady Helen - and you better book a table early otherwise you will be very hungry in Mt Juliet!  If there are no reservations left for the restaurants you will find that the bar menu is extremely limited.  In fact all the menus need to be reviewed - there wasn't really a great choice, either for the mains and definitely not for the desserts (my personal favourite course!).  And if you are arriving to play golf after 10 a.m. be warned there is NO food available, not even a sandwich in the clubhouse! 
Do stay in the main house - the rooms in the hunter's yard are small, in desperate need of refurbishment (I would dream of sitting on those sofas) and quite simply bad value for money.",3,2010,09,20
239,Simply a wonderful experience.,"The drive into Mount Juliet alone is stunning, beautiful grounds and a stunning building, the hotel, sitting on a hill above the river. We had dinner in the main restaurant which was excellent and then played golf the following morning. The course itself was an absolute gem, a real thrill to play where some of the greats of the game have played. Only negative, a minor one, was that we had to pay to get some practice balls whereas at other similar levels of course you are provided with a free pyramid of balls to get you in the groove. Overall the course was beautiful to play on and I enjoyed a great hotdog at the 10th hole food stop. Room at the hotel was spacious & faultless. Overall, superb and I've raved to friends about the experience. Would liked to have checked out a pub or two in Thomastown mind you!!",5,2010,09,17
239,A little piece of Heaven....,"I recently stayed in Mount Juliet with my parents for a small getaway trip and could not choose a better place to spoil them.  What a treat!  We all absolutely loved the whole experience.  We stayed in the main house in two beaufitully appointed spacious rooms with antique furniture and large comfortable beds with crispy white soft bed linen.  The views from our rooms were amazing.  The house is situated on a large estate which offers a great variety of activities from golf, horseriding, archery and claypigeon shooting.  It's also perfect for walking or running.  The hotel guests can use the swimming pool, gym, steam room and sauna complimentary.  Breakfast and dining were excellent, with a lot of healty choices and delicious fresh food from local ingredients.  No request was too small for the courteous, friendly and helpful staff.  Mount Juliet is a wonderful place for a relaxing break away from the hustle and bustle of a big city.  An ideal spot for a couple on a romantic break.  Plenty of activities and facilities for kids on site so a family with kids will definitelly enjoy it here!

I hope to have the pleasure of returning back again.",5,2010,09,13
239,A little piece of heaven,"I've kept a keen eye on prices in this hotel and it's usually a bit pricey but we got a great special rate for a Sunday night here which included breakfast. We arrived early had a delicious steak sandwich in the club house bar and used the pool and saunas. Our room was in Hunters Yard which was nice but nothing near as special as the ones in the main house and its probably worth splashing out on the upgrade if you can. Staff offered to drive us around the estate but as it was such a nice day we borrowed some of the guest bikes and went for a cycle tour of the estate instead which was great fun. Dinner in Kendals was delicious and the services staff were really friendly. Breakfast the next morning was in the Main house and as we sat munching our fry at 7am, looking out over the fabulous grounds my partner summed it up perfectly when he said ""this is how Monday mornings should always start"".",5,2010,09,09
239,Lovely but appalling service,"Went to Mount Juliet for a friend's daughters wedding - booked in for 2 nights. My wife had a recent accident and is not mobile. We received a call from Reservations a few days beforehand and we requested ground floor accommodation to allow for wheelchair access. No problem we were told. Arrived at the hotel on a beautiful summer's day which showed the grounds off at their very best. At check in we were told that all rooms had been allocated at we would have to stay in a first floor room. We were not to happy having being told that we would be accommodated on the ground floor. Spoke to a very pleasant duty manager who was very helpful and understanding. I asked to see the room to ensure that I could get my wife out in the event of an emergency (fire etc.) as there is no ""evacuation chair"" available. I was accompanied by one of the porters, John who was extremely pleasant and helpful. 
The wedding celebrations  in Kendals were excellent and staff were very good. Returned to our room at 2.30 am to find it infested with flies!!. Walls, ceilings, bed and bathroom covered in flies. There was a bed side lamp which could not be seen because of the flies!. Rang straight away for room service and a very nice porter, Seamus, arrived. He was quite shocked at the state of the room and offered to clean it straight away. A night manager arrived and was very apologetic, she tried her best and said that a room had become available in the main hotel - funny it was not available when we booked in?  The night porter, Seamus, attempted to clean the room with a brush and hoover! Good try but totally in vain. My wife was very upset and did not want to stay. We left the hotel at approximately 4.00 a.m to drive 2.5 hours home! We were promised that the General Manager would call us on Thursday which did not happen. We rang the hotel on Thursday and Mr. Kirby returned our call. He was apologetic and said that he wouldn't like us to have a bad impression of the hotel. He offered that  when we stayed again we would be taken care of with an upgrade. - a paraphrase of his offer.
Mount Juliet is a beautiful attraction with excellent staff but what a disappointing weekend. I was looking forward to a game of golf on the Saturday - no, Barbecue afterwards with our friends  - no, rest and relaxation- no, few quiet beers to wind off a lovely celebration- no. What I got was an upset wife, exhaustion from the night time drive, stress with the whole situation and a dismissive offer of an upgrade. There are the facts - make up your own mind.",1,2010,09,01
239,Luxery,"Lovely stay here at the weekend.  This place is really fabulous - and a lot smaller than I thought.  The bar in the hotel was somewhat small & deserted - we eventually got sat down and ordered a club sandwich and a glass of wine.  If we had known about the clubhouse serving food just down the road we'd have gone there.  We were booked in for a spa treatment in the afternoon and got a lift down in one of the estate cars.  The spa was grand, nice and relaxing - however there wasn't a thermal suite, which was a bit disappointing!   After our spa visit we went to the clubhouse and sat on the veranda having a lovely glass of rose and enjoying the views and the evening sunshine.  Our room was lovely - the bathroom was huge!  It was decorated lovely, and so comfortable.  Dinner was served in the Lady Helen restaurant and it certainly was an experience - very formal, but nice!  The food was excellent.  Breakfast was served the following day in the same room.  There was a cold buffet available, and we ordered a cooked breakfast.  To be honest, I didn’t find the cooked breakfast very good, it was standard fare that you'd expect in any hotel/b&b.  On the whole however, we did have a lovely trip and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a bit of luxury!",4,2010,08,31
239,My favourite hotel in the whole of Ireland,"I went with my wife and two small children to stay at this glorious, genuine Irish country house, set in an almost idylic setting like something out of a film - when you drive up the long impressive main entrance you know that you have arrived in a very special place . It was so satisfying to finally stay in a hotel in the Uk / Ireland that delivered everything we were looking for . Initally we were worried that the former owner Conrad hotels would have tried to turn it into a Conrad but were relieved to see that the current owners have very much kept the place as it was always intended to be - full of character, with amazing setting out in the Irish countryside.
The staff were friendly and  down to earth, the room we had was very elegant it was a bit like staying in a friend's large country house! There was plenty for the children to do and we would be very keen to go back especially on one of their child activity weeks. 
I would recommend you pay the difference and stay in the main house or the rose garde cottages the lead in room in the Hunters yard dont have as much flavour and in my opinion miss the feeling the other rooms can create.",5,2010,08,25
239,FANTASTIC  HOLIDAY DESTINATION FOR A FAMILY,"We had a week long stay in the Rose Garden Lodges with our two young girls, sheer bliss, top class accomodation.  We could not find any fault with the holiday and the services provided.  The food in the presidents bar was topclass and the  excellent service and friendly staff made it a very pleasurable experience.  Thanks for a wonderful stay in beautiful surroundings, we will definitely be  back.

239,"Loved this for the family, great grounds, activities and kids club","We had a family stay here recently with our two young children and had a great stay. 

The Rose garden lodges were really well fitted out and had everything we would need  including three plasma screens which is more than enough for one family. The hotel were welcoming and while the kids club was just open our children enjoyed the activites while we took the opportunity to paly some golf on thier stunning course. Swimming, horse riding and walks each day kept us all out of trouble and meant we were barely abel to drag ourselves away from the estate. The bar in the clubhouse with the games room upstairs which entertained the children was popular with us all. Breakfast in the Lady Helen restaurant was a treat and had everyting we would want.",5,2010,08,10
239,"Period country house hotel, set in 1500 acres of the best land in Ireland - Golfing paradise","Visited Mount Juliet in July of this year.   It is a place that my wife and I return to reguarly, the restaurants are great (esp. the Lady Helen).  We visited on this occasion for the first time with our infant son (8months) and we not dissapointed.  the hotel did its level best to facilitate us.

Golf, as ever was fantastic.  Must be in the top one or two parkland courses in Ireland.

Service is excellent in the Lady Helen!

will be back",5,2010,08,05
239,Perfect for families,"We spent 3 nights at Mount  Juliet from the 11th July in the Rose Garden Lodges.  These 2- bedroom apartments are ideal for families and are comfortably furnished with a complete kitchen and living and dining spaces.  We could easily have spent a week and indeed our children did not want to leave.  Mount Juliet is a very beautiful estate with a wide range of activities for all ages.  We took advantage of Clay Pidgeon shooting, archery, pony riding, and the kids club.  There is also a children's outdoor play area.  The staff were all friendly and helpful and the breakfasts were delicious.  We also enjoyed the best roast beef and Yorkshire pudding meal I've ever tasted, at the President's Club one Sunday.  Kudos to Fiona, Pieter, Jakob and Shane for all of their assistance during our stay.   We spent our last 3 nights of vacation at Dromoland Castle which is also a lovely property.  However, I would say that between the two, Mount Juliet offers more for options for  families with young  children.  My only suggestion would be for Management to consider a self-service laundry facility on the property for those opting for longer stays.  Otherwise, Mount Juliet is pretty much perfect for a family vacation.  We hope to return soon.",5,2010,07,28
239,Beautiful location but pricey,"We spent one night at Mount Juliet midweek to get a break away from work.  The location is beautiful and service was great, however we felt the hotel was overpriced.  We did not play golf as it was raining the next day.  The restaurant menu looked great and some of the dishes were tasty, but also felt they were trying to hard to make each dish over the top that the sauces and all the little bits added to each dish was just too much.  The breakfast on the other hand was very good.  We should have had breakfast twice!  We had drinks in the President Bar which was nice, but we didn't try the food there.  We were very relaxed once leaving, which is why we came in the first place.",3,2010,07,21
239,It was an amazing winter break. Simply perfect,"There is very little I can say that I haven;t said in the title. Georgeous rustic style, romantic fireplaces, nice food, relaxing spa, amazing surroundings... It was just what I needed!",4,2010,07,19
239,A fantastic experience at Mount Juliet...,"A fantastic experience at Mount Juliet. This hotel is not like standard hotels in that it is more like a luxury 5 star mansion. Amazing value for what you get. Was very happy and so wad my partner. I enjoyed some golf, horse riding and 2 excellent meals in the Lady Helen restaurant. 

Overall a brilliant stay.",5,2010,07,11
239,A divine location which happens to have a grand hotel on it.,"We visited for a wedding and were regally received. We had spent 6 nights traveling in Ireland prior to arriving at Mt Juliet and everyone we mentioned it to reacted with the same 'oh how lucky!' response. Well, they were all right. The hotel is grand; the service is terrific and the food ain't bad either. We ate in the Main house and also at Kendalls (I prefer Kendalls for breakfast actually but the other was so convenient since we stayed in the Main House) and couldn't fault either for food, style or service. The wedding reception was an absolute treat. The Chef outdid himself and the staff served with the highest quality silver service. The room we stayed in was large and lovely. The bathroom needs updating and the furniture in the old part of the house is tired and bland. The newer Rose Cottages are certainly more up to date and the 'fittings' are certainly more in keeping with what you would expect from a 5star experience. But the staff went out of their way to make us happy. They even changed the light bulbs so we could actually see to read in the evenings in bed. The tour was a delight with Eaomann and we cannot fault the entire experience. It was a wonderful 5 days. And yes, we'd go back. The OAPs from Surrey.",5,2010,07,02
239,We felt like royalty,"The red carpet wasn't rolled out, but it certainly felt that way! Even the drive up to the house simply takes your breath away. We were spoiled, the breakfast in bed was a highlight, and our only complaint was that we stayed just one night.",5,2010,07,02
239,Great for horse riding and relaxing in the spa,"We specifically went to Mount Juliet because there was horse riding for my daughter and spa facilities for me. If you can afford a river view room, then do.  The views from our room window were like something out of Black Beauty, with mares and foals always up to something. Eamonn, the estate manager, was very welcoming and gave us a super tour round the estate and the Ballylinch Stud. The food was superb and we particularly liked having lunch outside on the terrace of the President's Bar. Both the Lady Helen and Kendall's restaurants are fairly pricey but don't miss the souffle of the day. The horses at the Equestrian centre are of exceptional quality. Horseback is the best way to see the full extent of the estate.",5,2010,07,01
239,"Luxurious, relaxing, breath taking!","If you are looking to get away from city life to relax and re-charge in luxurious surroundings this is the place to go.  From the moment you drive into the grounds of Mount Juliet you will know that you have arrived somewhere special.  Make sure to book into Mount Juliet House for that extra bit of indulgence.  Nothing is too much for the friendly staff throughout the Estate.  Be sure to take an Estate Tour provided by the Concierge who is informative and entertaining.  Go for walks around the Estate, early morning, mid day, evening - no matter what time of the day the serenity will take your breath away.  No need to bring your ipod you are surrounded by the sounds of nature and it will capture you and have you thinking ""this is the life"".  Whether you are staying with your family, a partner, a friend or even if you want some time out on your own you will find what you are looking for at Mount Juliet.  The grounds are safe and inviting and for the time you spend their at least your troubles will be far away.  Enjoy every minute of your stay because when its time to go home you will not want to leave.  You MUST take some treatments in the Spa, you wont regret it.  Everyone should stay in Mount Juliet at least once in a lifetime.",5,2010,06,30
239,"Amazing, spectacular, wonderful","This hotel exceeded my wildest expectations.  Everything about Mount Juliet was wonderful - the people are amazing, the facilities are lovely, and I was really thrilled with the equestrian center and golf course.  I just can't say enough good things about our experience there, and I would go back in a heartbeat.",5,2010,06,29
239,Perfectly Peaceful,"What a beautiful place. Everywhere on the estate is so well manicured. The golf course was in spectacular condition and was a great test. Our room looked out over the fields of the stud farm and was very comfortable.

The best bit - The staff. So friendly and welcoming. Nothing was too much trouble.",5,2010,06,29
239,A little bit of paradise - where you can relax and unwind in beautiful surroundings and just feel special.,"While the hotel offers lots of activities - golf, horse riding, clay pigeon shooting,archery, spa, the walks in the actual estate grounds and along the river are just beautiful and relaxing.  Bikes are also available to cycle around the estate which is probably a quicker way of seeing the vast 1500 acre estate. If you have an interest in either golf or horses this is definitely the place for you to stay.

When booking a room ask for a room with a river view as these rooms over look the picturesque river Nore and the surrounding fields which have lots of horses grazing.  The rooms are spacious and luxurious and decorated in an 'old world' type style.  

During your stay make sure you talk to the very interesting concierge Eamonn, who  brings a few guests at a time on a guided tour of the estate (by car) which lasted about one hour;  he has a wealth of knowledge of the history of the estate and delivers it with great ease and  humour and nothing seems to be too much trouble for him.

I found all the staff attentive and helpful and they always greeted me with a smile on their face which is so often not the case in many Irish hotels.
I had two spa treatments during my stay, which were wonderful and again the staff at the spa were extremely helpful. 

I will definitely return to stay at this hotel when I'm in need of a relaxing break.",5,2010,06,28
239,The perfect place for a special weekend,"We just returned from a weekend in Mount Juliet to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary, and it was fabulous! A stunning setting, excellent accommodation, helpful and friendly staff and perfect weather! My husband wasn't allowed to play golf this weekend!! but we had so much to do and see on the estate, the beautiful gardens and walks, and we tried the clay pigeon shooting and the putting course, which were great fun. The complimentary wine and chocolates in our room and glass of champagne with our superb  dinner made us feel thoroughly spoiled, just hope it won't be another 10 years before we return.",5,2010,06,21
239,Heaven,"We stayed here just for one night to celebrate our 5th Wedding Anniversary, and didnt want to go home....
Everything from the Hotels point of view was executed meticulously.
Courtesy call two days before we arrived to see if there we had any special requirements. We had a beautiful room (#16 Lady Boyle Room), overlooking the front of the Mount Juliet house. Staff were so friendly, and were always willing to help in any way they could.
My wife had a spa treatment which she thoroughly enjoyed, and i took advantage of the free bikes to explore the estate. Dinner in the Lady Helen restaurant was exquisite.
We ordered breakfast in bed and it was delivered within 30secs of the requested time. Impressive !!
Lunch in the Presidents bar was equally nice, and not at all overly priced as you might expect from such a venue.
Overall a wonderful retreat if you just want a quiet get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. It is obviously more expensive than your run of the mill hotel, but it is well worth it for that special treat.
A special word of thanks to the staff who were so friendly and helpful throughout the stay. We will be back!!",5,2010,06,21
239,The Best!!,"Fabulous Grounds,excellent Value for accommodation and meal special for one night.
room was spacious with a lovely garden view.excellent dining room with attentative staff.
will be back anytime",5,2010,06,15
239,Leave everyday life at the gate - this is heaven,"Stayed for 3 nights and wanted to stay longer.  Having stayed in most of the luxury Estates/Castles/Resorts around Ireland, this is one that has managed to retain the original sense of being a walled ""estate"".  Unlike other resorts, Mt Juliet has retained lots of woodland and river walkways and bridlepaths and this made a vast difference to the experience.  

The Estate is magnificent with superb vistas in all directions.  The house is stately but not stuffy.  A stay here can be as formal/informal as your tastes and the staff adapt accordingly.  The variety of dining and accommodation means that there is something for everybody.  There is a true sense of history about the place as it was a private home up until 1987 and the ambience has been retained.  The staff are excellent.  Special mention to Eamon, part of the fabric of the place, Michael at the Courtyard Bar and Emma at the Equestrian Centre, all terrific hosts.  We were delighted to meet Paddy the Head Gardener with 42 years service on the Estate, as his Father had before him.  Paddy is a font of knowledge regarding the history of the Estate.  A few pints and a chat with him are part of the experience.

This is a terrific place set in beautiful rolling coutryside.  We are considering returning for one week in the Summer to try out the kids clubs and have Eamon teach the children to fish.  Heaven.",5,2010,06,02
239,Pure Luxury!,A romantic break a million miles form the stresses of everyday. I couldn't recommend it enough.,5,2010,05,20
239,"Mount Juliet, where time slips gently by!",I stayed at Mount Juliet last weekend with my wife.  I have stayed there previously on both golf and business trips.  It's class!  The estate is stunningly beautiful and there's a huge sense of history in this part of Ireland.  Mount Juliet house is old so expect a little quirkiness here and there with the odd creaking floorboard or drafty window but all that only adds to the whole character of the place.  My wife had a Spa treatment which at €150 was pricey though she enjoyed it.  You could say Mount Juliet is pricey but they are trying with specials and even early bird menus.  I have always loved this place and my trip last week has only enhanced it's reputation in my eyes.,5,2010,05,19
239,wonderful venue for our anniversary celebration!,"having had our first wedding anniversary plans to Spain cancelled due to the volcanic ash we wanted a romantic place to spend the evening. We were not disappointed! Because of our celebration, our room was upgraded. Complimentary chocolates and wine in our room and champagne with dinner, we indeed spoiled. The room was lovely and the dinner was absolutley delicious. The grounds of the hotel are perfect for a sunset stroll together. We could not say enough positive things about this hotel. Thanks to all the staff for making our stay wonderful.",5,2010,05,11
239,Mount Juliet House - a fairytale wedding venue!,"After a lengthy search for the perfect place for our wedding celebration we, and a party of fifty or so, were very, very well rewarded with our choice of Mount Juliet. The hotel management and staff made it a wonderful occasion throughout  the weekend and nothing seemed impossible. The guest experience was superb, as confirmed by comments from some very seasoned world travellers amongst us. The Lady Helen is a wonderfully atmospheric room for a wedding feast. The food was truly fine dining and the service was unsurpassable . We have never had a poor experience during any of our visits before or since the wedding last  Autumn. 

To mention but a few individual stars that make this place stand out from all the other similar premium quality hotel resorts in Ireland, and further afield, we must mention Margaret, Johnny, Olivier, Aga, Eamon, Ken, Jakob, Seamus and  the blonde woman who serves breakfast like nobody else can. Mr Kirby has built a team par excellence!!
We will return soon.",5,2010,05,05
239,"A superb venue, excellent food, super service....thoroughly enjoyable trip.","Hotel was gorgeous. Lots of different areas to sit and chat. Warm and friendly. The rooms were spacious and if you can go the extra, choose a room overlooking the river. The food in the restaurant was excellent and the portions were perfectly sized. Variation on the menu to suit all tastes. The staff couldn't have done more...they were superb.
There are wonderful walks around the grounds and my only regret was that we didn't arrive earlier and leave later so we could avail of the walks. Next time we will organise our time better.
I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2010,05,05
239,Great Family holiday!!,"This Easter we stayed in the Rose Garden lodges for a week . The lodges were redecorated last year and look great. The service has improved alot since we were last there a few years ago.
Our kids had a ball-the youngest went into the kids camp which he really enjoyed.
I thought we might get bored staying a week but we didn't -there's plenty to do!",5,2010,05,05
239,Amazing,"Tis place is ridiculously fabulous, everyone should stay here once.",5,2010,05,05
239,My heaven on earth,"We stayed for 10 nights in the Lady Mary room - this was our second visit the one the yer prior was in the Lady Margaret room- both rooms were fabulous! This place is so full of history, haunted with good reason why ever would anyone wish to leave it? We ate almost all of our meals in the bar area of the golf clubhouse- good quality food. Superb breakfasts each morning. The main reason for my trip was to ride throughout the estate grounds and the experience was wonderfull. The staff and horses we now consider our dearest friends- they all took such good care of us. I stayed as hilton honors- I will miss the fact they are no longer Hilton but will return just as soon as possible- loved it that much!",5,2010,05,02
239,Olh historic House on Beautiful Grounds - Treat Yourself!,"We stayed in the Main House in a riverview room which was superb.
We really treated ourselves as it was my boyfriends birthday so we splashed out.
On arrival it was just like I expected, we were welcomed by the lovely Margaret at front desk, very friendly professional Lady.
Our room was gorgeous overlooking the beautiful scenery,river & horses in the back but which originally was the front of the hotel.
We really enjoyed our stay, the wonderful Eamonn brought us on a tour of the grounds in the hotel car, down to the stud farm, over to see the hounds etc; what a lovely Man!
People like this really are an asset to a hotel.
We will definetly be back but hope they keep the fire going in the manor room (was out by 11pm both nights we stayed), candles are always a nice touch and a little back ground music would be welcomed as silence does not relax people, well not us anyway you feel you & others have no privacy as every word is heard!
Little things like this can make a big difference.
Breakfast was lovely served in a beautiful dining room with those views to die for.
The gardens especially the walled gardens were fantastic, I have never seen anything like the abundance of flowers everywhere really spectacular.
We went horse riding too which was brilliant expensive but worth it.
Did not eat in the hotel at night, really too expensive or so we thought but maybe next time!
Do come here you wont be disappointed just bring plenty of cash!!",5,2010,04,28

On our first night we had a light meal in the Presidents Bar and on our second evening we had a lovely meal in the Lady Helen restaurant - the scallop appetiser and the seabass were both exquisite!!! thank you chef!!! Olivier the restaurant manager was extremely attentive and provided  excellent service. Seamus looked after us in the bar - where we stayed up way too late :). The grounds are absolutely  beautiful and  we were lucky enough to have Eammon give us a tour!!!  Magaret at reception provided the warm welcome and was so engaging -  she was so helpful and a definite star!!!!!The team were magnificent, the hotel superb and we will definitely be back!!! and we will highly recommend to all who would like to experience something special.

239,"Brilliant experience, family oriented, although still quiet & peaceful","We stayed with our two children in the presidential suite.  We had a fabulous time, great entertainment for children, which surprised me!  Would consider going on one of their family weeks in years to come.  Couldn't say enough about the food & the restaurant staff.  Front office staff were the only real let down, not bothered, energy-less & judgmental.  Other than that a wonderful experience!!  Well worth a visit.",5,2010,04,10
239,"Fantastic hotel  but avoid room "" Duke of York"" no. 11 - beside noisy plant room!!!","We visited MJHotel during the Easter break and found the hotel to be elegant,  luxurious and impressive. However we were very disappointed with the room that was allocated to us as it was directly beside  the extremely noisy heating plant room for the entire hotel.When I called recepion to enquire about the noise, I was informed that the unit would be turned off at 11pm. I was not however alerted to the fact that the unit would resume action at 6am and so my husband and I were rudely awoken early the next morning. This is a wonderful hotel with superb food, services and staff but aviod room11 , better still  insist on a room in the west wing",4,2010,04,08
239,very good - excellent,"we are from germany and played  the excellent golf course at mount juliet!  we booked a ""clubhouse room"" and had a free upgrade to the manor hotel. the room was clean and had plenty of space. the staff were friendly and helpfull. the breakfast was excellent;  we had no better breakfast before in ireland and we are travelling since  years all around ireland!!",5,2010,04,08

239,"Step back In Time,  in a Good Way. Yes Stay Here","My wife and I love this place.  We stayed 3 nights in September 2009.  The main house has only 31 rooms. Our room was ""The Black Earl"" Room"" , not sure of the number. It was located right at the top of the Grand Stairway, dead center of the House. The big windows over looked the stream , with horses grazing in the fields. It is as nice as the pictures indicate. Better.  As you drive onto the property , ignore the signs directing you to the golf resort. Go straight and enter through the horse farm gate.  The view as you approach from the bottom of the hill, lets you know this place is special. Try hard to stay in the main house.  There are other  modern rooms about a quarter mile up the lane toward the golf club, but spend a few nights living like Royalty in the main house.  Food excellent. Staff excellent.  We must go back.",5,2010,03,10
239,"Heaven, perfect for a romantic getaway","We stayed here for two nights in March 2010 for our first wedding anniversary. We were very lucky as the weather was fantastic and we got to spend loads of time out walking & cycling around the estate. We stayed in the House (room with river view) part of the hotel, the room was amazing and the views of the estate breathtaking. We ate both nights in Kendals, the food & service was excellent. I would recommend going to Kendals for the early bird from 6-7, it was great value at €25 per head. The breakfast in the Lady Helen room was very very good. We had a few drinks each night in the Presidents Bar and the House Bar (cant remember the name), altough both were very quiet they were nice to have a relaxing few drinks in. Overall I cant find any fault in this hotel, everything about it is perfect.",5,2010,03,08
239,A real pleasure,"My wife and I recently stayed in Mount Juliet for two nights for a weekend break in January 2010. I cannot praise the hotel enough. It was a really enjoyable, relaxing break and a perfect place to recharge the batteries a little. There were no rooms left in the main hotel when we arrived on Friday evening so we ended up staying in the Club House, which was absolutely fine. When we arrived at the hotel to check in the classically dressed porter (John) introduced himself and showed us around the entire hotel and then escorted us up to our Club House rooms - a really nice personal touch. We ate in the restaurant in the Club House on  Friday night and the food was absolutely excellent. We're quite picky about our food, but I have to say it was really top notch. We ended up going for dinner in Thomastown on the Saturday night, which was okay, but we regretted not having dinner in the main restaurant in the hotel instead afterward. We did however go back to the main hotel and sit in front of the big open fire sipping good wine and whiskey til the small hours of the morning. The staff were so friendly and personal. I don't think I ever stayed somewhere before where the genuine pride the staff held for their hotel was so obvious. All in all a really enjoyable, relaxing weekend. If your looking for a hectic party location this isn't it - if you are looking for pure relaxation with great service in a luxury hotel then this a perfect choice.",5,2010,02,16
239,Relaxed elegance in a beautiful country setting,"We arrived at Mount Juliet on the first day of what would turn out to be one of the worst storms Ireland has had in hundreds of years. Stepping into the beautiful main house to be greeted by a warm fire after a day of wet, soggy sight seeing was an especially warm welcome.  After a quick and efficient check in we were led to an absolutely gorgeous room in a wing that was undergoing some renovations.  There was a Toyota company retreat going on during our visit but everyone from that group must have been in the other wing because we never saw another soul down that hallway.  

In addition to the beauty of the room, I was especially pleased by the size - nearly as big as my first apartment in San Francisco 7 years ago! We had a king size bed and sitting are, plus a wall of windows that opened onto a courtyard with cute little seating area.  Obviously because of the downpour we weren't able to make use of the table & chairs outside, but it was lovely to look upon.  Our room didn't have a fireplace or tub like some of the rooms on the website but we were okay with that as we booked at an incredibly low rate - the value was outstanding!

Because we'd been driving all day and we found the weather a bit difficult to deal with while also learning to drive on a different side of the road (and car!) we had dinner in the bar with the room all to ourselves which was quite relaxing and cozy, especially with the fireplace going. Oh, and did I mention the free WiFi in the sitting room downstairs? Especially lovely for a Facebook/Twitter addict such as myself. 

We did have some problems with the heat in our room, but the staff was very much committed to seeing to our comfort.  When the radiator couldn't be fixed they brought us space heaters and extra blankets to keep us warm, which was fine.  We're not fussy - as long as we were warm.  We knew the house was well over a hundred years old and living in our own antique of a house, you know that sometimes (especially during major storms), systems fail.  

Breakfast the next day was our first introduction to a full Irish breakfast and it was heavenly! The view from the dining room over the (unfortunately flooded) horse fields was a wonderful, relaxing site.  Alas, we had to leave soon after breakfast but I would have loved to linger at Mount Juliet for a couple more days as it was one of the nicest experiences we had at any of the hotels during our trip.",5,2010,02,10
239,This is the hotel stay you always promised yourself!,"We passed through the gates of the estate and into another world. Having driven through lovely parkland and paddocks we were welcomed by friendly staff at the main house. This welcome and helpfulness endured throughout our stay. The house has retained many original features combined with modern luxury; it's warmth and comfort embraced us.

Our beautiful room overlooked the River Nore with Ballylinch Stud beyond. Lovely comfy beds were turned down each evening. We dined in the Lady Helen restaurant on our first night - the most delicious food and wine ever. Lovely breakfasts too, freshly cooked to order. On our second night we dined in Kendals in the clubhouse - surely this could not be as good - oh yes it was! 

There is an activity  (or inactivity!) for everyone - horseriding, golf, pool, gym, archery and clay shooting, bicycles and walking, spa treatments, or simply sit in front of one of the lovely big open fires. 

Our only regret was that we couldn't stay longer, it was a wonderful weekend and we departed content and relaxed. Many thanks to the lovely staff.",5,2010,02,10
239,Beautiful grounds,"Stayed in garden cottage room. Not good. Mildew, burnt out light fixtures etc. Hotel maintenance staff non existent. Furniture dated and well worn. Main bldg. lovely. Grounds beautiful.  Hotel check in / check  out personel - pitiful . Living off past glory with a bit of an attitude. Do not know if I would stay again.",3,2010,01,12
239,Wonderful log fires and twinkling Christmas trees but stay in the main house.,"Really enchanting at Christmastime. The beautiful Christmas trees and log fires are very atmospheric.  On a dreary winters day, it is a haven.  However I would definitely think you should stay in the main house. The Club house room we stayed in was pretty average, stained curtains, some hairs on the bathroom floor and cigarette butts in the ashtray on the private terrace was rather disappointing.",4,2009,12,02
239,Amazing- Nearest to a 5star in Ireland,"My husband and I had our wedding reception here and it was everything we could have wished for. The service, the food, the location, the rooms, the facilities....everything was perfect. 
The only problem we had was with some confusion when our guests were confirming their room bookings which we had pre reserved at a discounted rate. However this was fixed and we were recompensed for the trouble.
This hotel, unlike many undeserving Irish hotels does not call itself five star. However, this is the one Irish hotel I have been to that I believe is nigh on five star. It does not quite have the level of  service one gets in other countries for 5stars but it is the nearest to it in Ireland.",4,2009,11,03
239,the best hotel ever!,"very nice staff, beautiful hotel, rooms, wonderful golf courts and landscapes!!! amazing hotel...",5,2009,10,15
239,Fabulous destination for active vacation,"Our two night stay was at the end of our 14 day jaunt to Ireland and the highlight of  our trip.  Mount Juliet is serene and peaceful, yet offers plenty of active alternatives.  I am a lifelong equestrian and my ride at Mount Juliet was the fulfillment of a lifelong dream to ride a well-trained, well-bred horse over cross country jumps in the Irish countryside.  My husband enjoyed trying his hand at fly fishing, and we both delighted in leisurely walks around the estate.  It looked like heaven for golfers, as well.

Service, from reservations to check out was absolutely top notch.  Room expansive, well appointed and great bed/pillows.  Breakfast (which was included with our room rate) was fabulous.  Mount Juliet lives up to the praise it receives from multiple travel magazines.",5,2009,09,20
239,The best hotel we've ever stayed in!,"We were in Ireland for a wedding and decided to make a trip of it.  We found Mount Juliet on LastMinute.com and wanted to book a riverview room in the main house.  By the time we got round to it, it was gone, so we went directly to Conrad's site and booked a presidential suite as it was only €30 - 40 extra.  We also booked it with dinner at Kendals and breakfast the next day.  We only stayed 1 night, but WOW!  Our suite was bigger than our flat in England and had great views from the bedroom over the river and the stud farm beyond.  The staff were very helpful and offered to book any of the activities for us from reception.  I went for a walk around the grounds and found the walled garden, which was lovely.

I had read a review on here before from someone complaining how far Kendals was from the main house.  Yes, it was a short walk (maybe 10 minutes in my heels), but when we went to go up there for dinner, the conceriege offered to drive us.  Dinner was lovely and the quiet stroll back was pleasant.

I had wanted to use the spa the next morning, but it was fully booked.  My partner wanted to go clay target shooting, so I went and tried my hand at that with him.  It was very enjoyable and the guide was the perfect instructor.

We didn't get a chance to try the other activities, but want to go back for a long weekend to give them a try at some point.  There's plenty to do for those not interested in Golf, like us, and it would be a dream for any golfer.",5,2009,09,01
239,Beautiful hotel,"Stayed here for two nights with my boyfriend in he Rose Garden suites. We were absolutely amazed with it! it was like a holiday home, everything you'd need.

the staff went out of their way to be polite and hepful -we were really impressed. The property is fantastic too. We went horse-riding, swimming and to the spa what a weekend, exactly what we needed.

Would reccommend to everyone that this is someplace you really need to go to !",5,2009,09,01
239,Splendid,This place is absolutely lovely. Hands down the best hotel experience I have ever had. Its definately a place to go - golfer or no golfer. The grounds are huge - great for cycling around. We stayed in a presidental suite which was huge and we got a 2 for 1 offer which made it all the more sweet! The food in Kendalls restaurant was fabulous - highly recommended and absolutely faultless. We ate in the Lady Helen on our second evening but I have to say I preferred Kendalls for quantity and taste - Lady Helen was a bit too refined for our taste and not hearty enough. The ambience in the hotel was great.,5,2009,08,27
239,poor value,The room was just average up a winding staircase. There was no air conditioning in the room and the beds were lumpy and uncomfortable. The room was in the house but the restaurant was in the clubhouse necessitating a walk outside in high heels and designer clothes. the dress code was positively casual with jeans the order of the day. The breakfast was average no offers of extra coffee or toast and watch out for the leaking teapots.Overall too expensive for whats on offer.,3,2009,08,21
239,Simply wonderful,"We stayed in a garden cottage and it was beautiful. The entire estate is stunning. The staff could not be more helpful. The cottage had everything you could possibly need, was very spacious and newly redecorated. There is so much to do at Mount Juliet, you need about 4 or 5 days here. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2009,08,15
239,GREAT PLACE TO DO AS YOU PLEASE - BUT!,"Stayed here with my wife for four nights as part of the Hilton Summer Special. A\rrived Sunday 9 August. Bit challenging to find estate for the first time but once inside the black and gold gates, a whole new world opens as you drive past the paddocks and fields. Really is breath-taking. Checked in at the main house/hotel but were surprised we had to drive to Hunter's Yard - expected it to be at the back of the main house. 
Staying in Hunter's Yard is like staying a self-contained golf and leisure club and it lacks the richness and splendour of the hotel. The rooms are a reasonable size, more rustic in feeling, great beds, kept very clean and overall, certainly adequate but nothing grand. The President's Bar, Spike's Bar and Kendall's Restaurant  are part of the building and our breakfast was served in Kendall's - do not know if we could have gone down to main house. Found staff, especially Sarah, more than helpful and pleasant.
We came here to relax and it certainly caters for this just as much as for the sporting activities. At night, we went down to the Major's Room in the house for a long read and a good drink. Must say that walking back up the hill in the dark was a bit nervy - although there is 24hr security on the site.
Overall, this was good value for our money. We did not pay the standard rate and although we would have liked the grandeur of staying in the house itself, what we got was more than acceptable. Prices in the bars and restaurants are not cheap but you get what you pay for! Would we go back - in the morning!",5,2009,08,14
239,"Equisite surroundings, comfortable and welcoming.","We took advantage of a special offer and were never treated like the 'poor relatives'. From the moment we arrived, the staff were welcoming and efficient, without being overly so. Our room, in Hunter's Yard, was spacious, clean and all you expect of a top class hotel. my only regret is that we hadn't booked a room in the beautiful old house that has been respectfully converted to a hotel. Many original features remain and it is still an equisite country mansion. The grounds are beautifully maintained and there to explore. The leisure facilities are excellent and we had the pool to ourselves both nights (children aren't allowed after 6pm). All in all I would highly recommend this hotel if you want a romantic break, an action packed adventure or a family break. It is can accomodate all quite happily as the grounds are extensive and offer a wide variety of activities.",5,2009,08,14
239,Pinch Us--Are We Dreaming?,"If you would like to see life as it should be, be sure to come to this resort, which is as charming as anyone should expect.  From entering the front gates through the pastures with grazing horses and cows over the bridge and up the road to the mansio house, it is all out of a movie set.  There are spectacular views, spectacular gardens, and an array of activities, including golf, tennis, indoor pool, and even an 18-hole putting green course.  The staff are completely accommodating and do everything they can to help you enjoy your stay.  In addition, the location outside Thomastownis near many fun places, including Kilkenny and Inistioge.  Do yourself a favor and stay here if you can.",5,2009,08,10
239,Nice hotel in lovely location,"We booked a dinner, bad and breakfast package in Mount Juliet House.  The grounds are very nice and the drive in was impressive despite the driving rain.  We arrived at approx. 2:30pm hoping to be able to check in at that time (had advised check in time of 2pm when booking online) but had to wait till 4pm for the room to be ready.  This is however the stated check in time on their website.  

Our package included dinner in Kendal's restaurant but when we arrived we were told it was booked out that night.  Instead we were offered dinner in the Lady Helen restaurant, which is more formal and more expensive.  The supplement was wavied though which we appreciated.  Dinner was lovely and the service was very good.  Drinks in the bar are quite expensive but there is a nice view out over the grounds.

The room was very nice and again had a lovely view.  
Overall, it's a very nice hotel.  It isn't exceptional but I would be happy to stay again.",4,2009,07,29
239,LOVELY,Our family just returned from a week in Ireland and spent the first three nights at Mount Juliet. What a beautiful property.  We staying in the Rose Cottages and they are wonderful.  The perfect size for a family of four.  There was something for everyone in our family here.  My husband and son played golf and my daughter rode horses twice at the equestrian center. I was able to take long walks and take beautiful pictures all over the grounds. The rose garden is so peaceful and pretty.  The food was good in all the restaurants.  The pitch and putt coarse is fun but when we tried to play tennis the balls they gave us were beyond dead.  Be sure to ask for new balls when you go to the concierge.  All in all a wonderful stay.  We would have been happy stay longer!!,5,2009,07,17
239,Perfect weekend break. Exceptional service.,"We had a recent weekend break to celebrate our anniversary and I am so glad we picked Mount Juliet to do so. From the moment we arrived until departure, we were treated in the most friendly, courteous and welcoming way, without any of that over-the-top attention some other establishments appear to favour.
Our room in the old house was fantastic - full of character, loads of space, great views - tea and coffee (Ritz Carlton, take note) everything we needed, plus some lovely truffles, wine and a card for our special occasion. 
We chose to eat dinner in Kendals, and were not disappointed. Food and wine were excellent, and the service was again exemplary without ever trying too hard. A special thank you to Xavier and Max for looking after us so well.
Based on our experience, I cannot recommend this hotel enough - it far surpassed a recent stay in the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt for service and overall enjoyment.",5,2009,06,26
239,Charming Hotel in Beautifully Converted Country House,"Marvellous setting in grand landscape park (converted for golf with some sensitivity for the historic setting - rare indeed in Ireland).  Lots of splendid eighteenth-century rooms to poke around in, small but comfortable bedroom, indeed without air-con, but how do you put that into an eighteenth-century country house without wrecking it, and how often do you need it in ireland?  Friendly and helpful staff, food and drink expensive but not ludicrous.  Calm and peaceful location in magnificent countryside.  Recommended.",4,2009,06,22
239,Excellent and Comfortable,"I stayed here in October 2008 and really enjoyed my stay. very friendly and efficient checkin. Rooms were massive with a very large bathroom. Everything was in order and very warm and had a charm of old world character while still being modern. The hotel is AA 4 red star rated however the The Hunters Yard rooms are different - these do not claim to be anything close to the Mount Juliet house rooms (you will find reviews on this site criticising Hunters Yard but really these should be listed & considered separately).
The rooms had everything I needed and the bed was comfortable and encouraged a cozy sleep.
Dinner was amazing, with veal and salmon on the menu.
Breakfast next morning was out of this world, great choices and lovely coffee.
I Will certainly return!",5,2009,06,19
239,over-rated,"WE stayed at the Conrad Mt. Juliet while In Ireland on vacation and used our Hilton Honors.We had 2 rooms in the Hunter's Yard area with king-sized beds in the rooms. The beds were fine , the room however was very small and we were too hot to sleep well because there is no AC and no fan. We were also disappointed in the cost of food in the resturaunt-food was not that great for price. Roomservice was also very expensive. The grounds were beautiful but the overall feeling is stuffy!! Coming from the states we were surprised that children are restricted in the hours they are allowed to swim and must purchase swim caps for 4E each!! Stay in the main house if you can and not really a place for kids! Had to go to certain area for WI-FI- not in room!",3,2009,06,14
239,Wonderful Estate!,"Stayed for 7 nights using HH points.  This is a 1500 acre estate with beautiful grounds.  We were upgraded to a 2-bedroom cottage which was a very pleasant surprise and nice to have the extra room for 7 nights.  The service was outstanding and staff went out of their way to be helpful.  Breakfast in the dining room was great with good food choices and relaxing, scenic views of the estate from the tables near the windows.  We were impressed with the accommodations and service throughout the entire week and would happily stay at the Mount Juliet in the future!",5,2009,06,09
239,wonderful place - keeps authentic feel while being top notch,"Stayed here last night and as always had a great time. For relaxation, sitting in front of the Main House having a perfectly cooked fillet steak sandwich in the sunshine really can't be beaten (except perhaps by sitting in the evening overlooking the river whilst playing draughts and sipping Guinness in the lovely drawing room). The rooms inthe main house are bright and spacious. Lovely pieces of furniture and very comfortable beds coupled with beautiful bathroom(great shower and toiletries) and stunning view make this place magical.

extremely friendly and knowledegable staff did everything to make our stay comfortable. The combination of fine rooms and dining with more relaxed lesiure Hunters Yard gives a choice for everyone.

My only quibble would be that the food in Kendalls is not worth the money, in fact it is closed for the moment and they are serving a couple of different menus in the bar including a Kendalls one which are priced in different ways but aren't that different when you add it all up. The burger is confused, it doesn't know if its a burger or a meatloaf in a bun and so isn't great as either.

The free bicycles are a great idea. they have suspension and gears and suit everyone. They are used a lot ,unsurprisingly , and so don't appear brand new but instead as very good quality used bikes.

Great place to visit - beautiful old estate veryclose to Kilkenny and gorgeous Thomastown village which you can walk/cycle or get a free lift to nearby. Thankfully not so completely modernised to cover every creaky floorboard or beautiful sashed windows so it still feels like you are staying in a wonderful country mansion - which you are!!",4,2009,05,25
239,Heaven on earth,"I loved everything about it - so much so that I have booked my wedding there later this year!
From the moment you walk through the door, you feel at home.  The staff are so welcoming and helpful.  The rooms are clean, well equipped and so pretty - and then you look out the window....wow!  Fantastic views, so pituresque and all in all - an AMAZING place!!  Go and see for yourself - you'll love it!! :o)",5,2009,05,13
239,Exceptional hotel,"We recently visited Mount Juliet for a weekend break and were so impressed. Everything about this hotel is class. We stayed in the main house so can only comment about the rooms there, not sure about The Hunters Yard or other accommodation.
The bedroom was beautiful - spacious, had a huge bathroom, lovely touches like turn down every evening and when you returned to your room Lyric FM was playing on the radio! A couple of maintenence issues but that's to be expected in such an old building. Staff was unbelievably friendly and efficient, from the receptionists, to breakfast staff, to concierge. The breakfast is honestly the best breakfast I have ever had  - just out of this world. Wonderful setting in the Lady Helen dining room overlooking the estate. Bikes are provided free of charge to take a ride around the grounds, really lovely. Dined in the more casual Kendels for dinner - overall quite good, although slightly disappointing. 
Location good for ""getting away from it all"" - it's a good 15-20 minute drive outside Kilkenny city. I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely try to get back soon - a true 5 star experience.",5,2009,05,04
239,A little haven...!,"We have stayed at Mount Juliet three times, the first time was for one night and our two other stays were both for 2 nights. On each occasion, we had a lovely room in Hunters Yard as my partner was golfing and I was using the Spa and leisure centre. I have to say the spa is beautiful with exceptional staff. My massage and facials were of a very high standard. We enjoy the casual atmosphere in the Golf club so mainly ate there, we ate in Kendalls restaurant twice but found it to be overpriced and the menu is not varied for people with different tastes. 

I found on each occasion we have stayed that the room has been spotless and bright and airy with a lovely little balcony. I have only ever had two issues, once our tv was faulty which was replaced immediately. On another occasion we had some noisy guests outside below our balcony at around 2 in the morning but we asked them to be quiet and they moved inside. We ordered our breakfast to our room on a few occasions and the effort the kitchen staff put into this is phenomenal, I have never seen anything like it. It really was beautiful.

I will definitely stay in Mount Juliet again and probably sooner rather than later.",5,2009,04,29
239,"Lovely Setting but does not live up to the ""hype""","I was told that this was going to be super so I cancelled my booking for another hotel in Dublin wehere we stayed and booked a room at the Conrad Mount Juliet. The location is lovely set in rolling countryside with some splendid views and the hotel itself from the outside looks very impressive - I was struck buy the quiet and beautiful views - the main house is very grand - the Hunters Lodge not so more like a country club.
We had dinner booked for us on arrival in Lady Helens - although when looking at the menu the staff seeing us to the room seemed to suggest fine dining was not for me dont know if it was my atire or something else to have upset him.

Our room in Hunters Lodge was fairly basic by comparision to what I would expect for a 5* hotel - the shower / bath needed a good clean

The Leisure club was ok - good sized pool and sports equiment - but showers again needed a real good clean and were rather in need of a refurb.

Pre dinner drinks with lovel views and plenty of choice - nice warm fire and views over the river - and on to our fine dining experience the Lady Helen room - very pleasant room with lots of features - but as my meal progressed - it really became apparaent that this room was in need of a really good spring clean - the wine chosen was not available so chose again and they did me a favour and gave me for the same price. Fine dining is not helped with mobile phones going off !

Beds were comfortable but would rate the room we had as an average 3* and certainly not worth the money charged. Coupled with the breakfast which was average - certainly not the best I have had and definately not worth the charge of £25 I would have to have paid had it not been included due to my HH status.

Rather a disappointment really - understand this is to stop being a Conrad at the end of the year - perhpas that is why it is being run down as they dont perhaps want to spend or invest ?",1,2009,04,26
239,Amazing service in a beautiful location,"We stayed at Mount Juliet last week on the occasion of my wife's birthday with our two children 6 and 9.  The staff could not have been more attentive and helpful and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  We did not hear the word no from the moment we arrived to when we left.  Staying in the house was perfect and our suite was very luxurious and comfortable with a great view.

The varied facilities on the estate from the equestrian centre to the spa and the leisure centre were well run and of an excellent standard.  We enjoyed two excellent dinners in the Lady Helen restaurant.  Breakfasts were a little slow but very good.  The bar food was great for a casual lunch. 

Overall I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for families and couples looking for a luxury break with excellent service.",5,2009,03,22
239,SAVING TO GO BACK THERE ALREADY - 5 stars for everything,"We loved loved loved this grand,  stately home hotel. The place oozed timeless glamour and elegance and the staff make you feel valued as a customer.
We had the pleasure in staying in one of the two suites in Mount Juliet House (room 17) and it was the place dreams are made of. The suite was huge with a very large bedroom , lounge and  separate bathroom. The bedroom had a huge four poster bed which was so comfortable and looked out of three large Georgian windows over the vast estate that belongs to Mount Juliet. It was quiet, peaceful, tranquil and stately. There was a small seating area in the bedroom which allowed us to take in the best views of the estate and the antiques that filled the bedroom were very much in keeping with the whole room. There was a TV and mini disc/cd player in this room too.
In the lounge there was a dining table that seated four people and two sofas with a coffee table. There is also a TV in this room too and a quaint window seat with views over the front of the estate. The bathroom was large and airy with a large Georgian window dominating the room. There was a roll-top bath, separate shower, toilet and his and hers sinks with complimentary toiletries.
I just can't say enough how wonderful the stay was. The staff were so friendly whenever we happened to see one another and they could not do enough to help and make the stay as pleasant as possible.
The breakfast in the Lady Helen restaurant was a real winner. The room is beautiful and full of original features with fantastic views over the estate. The food was fantastic and the waiting staff so attentive and polite.
The lounge areas in the main part of the house were well staffed who regularly enquired as to whether we needed more drinks etc. There was complimentary use of the internet set on the glorious Georgian landing. The house is full of antiques and is sympathetically decorated. One cannot fail to be impressed by the sheer grandeur of the house. The estate has a fantastic range of facilities, golf, archery, shooting, horse riding, gym, swimming pool, spa. There was just so much for a person to do and all of the facilities were very well maintained and current.
Presidents bar situated at Hunter's yard - primarily where the golf facilities are - was a great place to go for informal dining, snacks and laid back views over the lawns. Staff there were again attentive, polite and friendly and the food delicious.
We were blown away by the overall experience in this hotel - the room, the views, the staff, the food, the facilities - all were so fine that it would be hard to find fault with this hotel.
Our only concern now is making sure we can return to the house and stay in the same room as we just weren't there long enough it seemed.
If you are looking for exacting, high standards, history, opulence, luxury and extravagance then this is the place - just bring lots of money!!!",5,2009,03,13
239,"Elegant, Beautiful, and Amazing","I loved Mount Juliet Conrad.  The building is amazing and all the vines and flowers surrounding it make it even more beautiful.  My room was huge with the most comfortable bed! There was a large sitting area near the windows.  The bathroom was very very large with a claw foot tub, shower, toilet, two sinks, and plenty of counter space for my toiletry bag. I got a wonderful massage at the Spa and took a lovely walk down to the Stud Farm to see all the adorable new colts and fillies. The food was tasty and fabulous at every meal. Overall, I loved every minute of it!",5,2009,01,24
239,Jane Austen flashback,"I stayed here with a friend while we were touring around Ireland. I have to admit that we stayed for free since I was using hotel points so my review might be slightly biased since I didn't pay 5 star room rate. 

We stayed in the main house on the top floor in large room with two beds. The view out the window was lovely-- lush green grass with a small creek and horses grazing in a pasture on the other side of the water. 

We arrived in the late afternoon and after checking in, we took a stroll of the walled garden, around the grounds and across the creek to the horse farm on the other side. 

We were only there one night but enjoyed our stay and the peaceful retreat. I probably wouldn't want to stay more than a few nights since I don't golf or ride and would feel isolated so far out into the countryside. But for a weekend it would be a nice retreat.",4,2008,12,19
239,Classy with character,"We stayed here for one night as a couple - we left our two small children behind with their grandparents so it was a short romantic getaway...

The grounds and setting gives this place it's charm - that said the service is very friendly and courteous and not fussy -  we were given a tour on our arrival by one of the porters. You are made feel at home straight away.  We ate in the Kendals restaurant where again the service was faultless. Prices here are reasonable for what you get.  After we came back  from our meal we were greeted with Lyric FM playing on the radio... also the next morning we got a complementary newspaper at our door (unlike another well known Irish hotel who charges for this - after asking if you want one when you check-in)

We are planning our next trip - this time with the kids and we will probably stay in one of the self catering lodges on the estate. Overall it is not cheap to stay there but we have stayed in many places where we paid a lot more but received a lot less...",5,2008,11,02
239,Terrific Manor Stay - for Hilton members,"This was the end of a great Ireland trip and just when we thought we had seen the best accomodations in Ireland, we checked into the Mt. Juliet Conrad.  I used points so didn't expect much, but I am a Diamond Hilton member, so was given the Presidential Suite in the main house!  The view was amazing (see picture)!  Wine and truffles were waiting for us too!  

The hotel was able to round up a fly-fishing guide within an hour of checking in and my husband really enjoyed fishing there (although he didn't catch anything - water was too high from all the rains this summer).  I wandered the beautiful grounds and strolled through the walled garden - beautiful!

We ate at Kendel's (I heard it was better than the nicer restaurant) and it was good.  Not stellar, but very satisfying and the decor was very nice.  Breakfast was especially lovely and we had to pry ourselves out of the room when it was time to leave!  

What  a great place to use your Hilton points!",5,2008,09,17
239,fab place to get away from it all.....,"Just stayed one night but it was excellent...just driving in to the estate alone gives you this 'special place' feeling....
  Glad to have read the tips on trip advisor, so understood that while we were staying in hunters yard, you had to check in in the main house...so this made it very easy...and also it takes a bit to get your bearings when you drive in....
  also the restuarants...'kendals' in hunters yard...and also 'presidents bar food - (excellent bar food) .in hunters yard  ...the two of these are more casual..and lady helen in the main house....more up market, and much more expensive...
(theres about 300m between the main house and hunters yard...so its only a small walk)
   rooms lovely...clean...mini bar well stocked!!.
played golf on the fab course....didnt break the course record but really enjoyed...
All in all cant wait to go back!!",5,2008,08,28
239,"Didn't hate it, but didn't love it","Our first room was really dirty and the walkway leading up to the room was really muddy so we asked to switch rooms.  Our second room, which we stayed in for 3 nights, was cleaner but not by much.  The second room was a larger 2 story town house far from the main house so every time we needed something we had to get in the car and drive there.  All of the staff was friendly but the bartender didn't seem to speak much english and when i ordered 2 diet cokes to go he opened both of the glass bottles and when i said that I had asked for them closed he took them back and never brought me the new sodas.  I don't blame him for not understanding me but it was frustrating and took a long time just to get 2 bottles of coke.  They will lend you bicycles to ride around the property.  The bikes are in pretty bad shape but its worth using them just to ride around the river and the fields full of beautiful horses.  It is a nice place to stay to relax if you aren't looking for much else to do and you need to have a car to go anywhere because Kilkenny is about 20 mins away and the hotel is in the middle of nowhere.  Waterford is not very far so it is easy to make a day trip to several other towns.  Overall it is quiet and not very exciting, the food is terrible but I found that most of the food I ate in Ireland wasn't very good, gorgeous property but not very clean rooms.",3,2008,08,19
239,Disappointing,We made the mistake of staying in the Rose Garden 2 Bedroom Cottages with no AC in the middle of July! It was inconvieniently located away from every possible thing. The pool was lovely as was the spa. Great horse riding facilities and golf course. The restaurants (both) were awful food and service. Would never go there again,2,2008,07,31
239,"excellent, relaxing stay","My husband and I stayed here four nights in mid June of 2008.  This resort was just what the doctor ordered-we were in much need for some R&R and wanted to tour around the Irish country side a bit.  It exceeded all our expectations. We flew into Shannon and drove here and stopped along the way at The Rock of Cashel (highly recommend).  Driving through the grounds for the first time (and every time) was just magical. I don't think anyone can dispute how lovely the whole place is.  Our room was in the Hunters Lodge section and we had a little terrace with a fantastic view. The bed was divine, bathroom nice and very clean. We were able to stay here using Hilton Honors points. We ordered room service for a couple of meals. Menu is very limited, but everything we had was excellent. Room service arrived in a very timly manner.  Breakfast every morning was at  Kendals (included in our stay, we are Hilton Diamond members)  where the staff was extremly friendly and efficient. All staff members we encountered were great; however, numerous calls to the stables for horseback riding were ignored. No worries, we just did other things. Golf one day was superb, and a facial and message at the Spa were heavenly. This is a real Irish country side experience and we felt we were in the middle of nowhere, but at the same time, we enjoyed some beautiful short day trips-Jerpoint Abbey is nearby. Get the guided tour, very interesting. We went into Thomastown to a restaurant the hotel recommended-The Chart House. Great meal, and traditional Irish music next door afterwards. Thomastown is a little blue collar, but we were the only Americans there, and enjoyed the craic by the locals. Kilkenny is also about 20 minutes away. Great shops and pubs. Very charming town. We also drove to the Dunbrody (not to be missed)and had lunch in the nearby town and did some shopping. Again, no tourist in sight. Inistioge is nearby and we spent some time here(the film Circle of Friends was filmed there) simply gorgeous.  We really enjoyed our stay at Mount Juliet and our time in this part of Ireland",4,2008,07,29
239,Fading glory,"Having had a really lovely stay previously at Mount Juliet a few years ago my husband and I were very excited about returning for a short stay. I'm not sure whether the manager and chef were away for the weekend or were caught up with the wedding that was being held in Kendals that night, but most of the staff seemed at odds with what they were doing and most disappointingly the quality of food at dinner in the Lady Helen has really dipped since our last visit 2 years ago. Everything we had was over cooked and probably reheated. We were even served reheated potatoe wedges! In Ireland when our lovely new season spuds are in season. 
Something has gone badly wrong at Mount Juliet.",3,2008,07,07
239,Magical place,"We stayed at this hotel in early May 2008.  Contrary to the poor review below, it is not a five star property but a four star, but that's not the point.   The main rooms are in the main house, Hunters Yard, while undoubtedly high-end, are less expensive.  They are perhaps  more suited to a group of golfers focussed on the course itself or for a family get together trip with children than a 5 star break destination for a couple.   The grounds are simply amazing, if you like horses, there is horseriding as well as the usual golf.  

The spa is extremely good value for a hotel spa and the staff (many are local) are friendly and warm without being cloying.  The food in the Lady Helen is really excellent-really excellent and the food in the cheaper clubhouse setting is reasonably priced.  The house itself is beautiful and yes it has the problem of an older building (bathrooms are good without being stellar) but the rooms are truly magnificent, have stayed in a few, all are good.  The music in the Lady Helen is a little strange, but thats a minor quibble, the room is one of the most beautiful you will ever see let alone dine in. 

On checking out, somewhat laden with bags, one of the doormen dashed to grab my bags and get my car for me and bring it around despite the rain and did so with a friendly wish for a safe drive home.  From the person who greeted us on check in to that moment we did not encounter even one instance of bad or surly service.  Perhaps the staff realise they work in a lovely setting and this is reflected in how they treat guests.   Or they are really well paid, either way the result is the same, happy guests being made to feel welcome.

We stay over 70 nights a year in hotels and can be very moany when things go wrong, but nothing did here and we cant wait to go back.   Sure there are some slight flaws, but its not a 5 star and when you wake to that view of rolling pasture, well tended but not too manicured ""wildflower"" garden and watch people trot by you on clearly lovingly cared for horses, I cant think of anywhere one would rather be, despite the rain!

I have never posted on tripadvisor before but I felt I had to reading the negative post below (I myself always write off the best and worst posts on this site to end up with a ""fair"" middle ground view).  Mount Juliet defies that attempt, its simply magical and if you dont like old properties, then Kilkenny has plenty of new ones (many cheaper) for you to enjoy instead.",5,2008,05,12
239,Splendid!,"Mount Juliet is a splendid property set in one of the most enchanting rural locations in Ireland. The golf course is superb, and there are several other sporting opportunities in the sprawling estate. Rooms in the main house are outstanding, though ours in Hunters Yard, not as luxurious, were well appointed and faced the exquisite grounds. Dinner in the two main restaurants were well prepared and service was first class. A limited selection of courses suggests that repeating dinners will get a bit boring, unless you are eager for duck and venison.  Everyone in the staff was quite friendly and eager to please. Check-in was not the smoothest as the clerk did not seem to be very familiar with booking mechanics. Otherwise, staff rushed to fix minor difficulties with room TV and heating controls. All told, we were most pleased with Mount Juliet and would enthusiastically recommend it.",5,2008,03,28
239,Very relaxing,"We stayed in Mount Juliet the beginning of February 2008 for two nights. Our room was in the main house which is stunning. Our room was very spacious however abit tired looking in the decor. The bed wasn't too comfortable either although not too bad - just that you would expect extreme comfort from a 5 star. Our adjoining ensuite was very spacious with plenty of hot water however the ensuite itself was constantly cold. It did have a devi mat but it never worked. The staff didn't seem to know how to fix the heating problem in the ensuite. Anyway we got over this but sometimes you had to brace yourself going in there!! 

Breakfast was fabulous with great choice and great staff. All the staff we met during our stay were so friendly and helpful. The view overlooking the grounds was breathtaking from the dining room. 

I had booked some treatments in the spa which was a really relaxing experience and lovely and quiet. Later I met my husband at the pool for a swim. The changing room facilities a little tired, although clean. There were only two showers. The pool was warm and we enjoyed the swim. But I thought the pool area was also a little dated and not what you would expect from a five star. 

We ate lunch in the Hunters Lodge where they do great toasted sandwiches, soup etc. Be warned the helpings are very large!! But you can always go for a long walk around the grounds! 

Later that night we ate at the gourmet restaurant at the Hunters Lodge. It was excellant and had a great atmosphere. 

Overall we enjoyed our stay at Mount Juliet and will return but they probably need to upgrade some of the rooms and the leisure centre. We returned home totally relaxed! Worth a stay if you get the chance.",4,2008,03,28
239,Do not stay here!,"I had booked my Wife and I into what I thought would be 5 star luxury and couldn't wait to try the leisure centre. We are still shocked at how poor and run down the Hotel was. We Nearly!! stayed in the Hunters Yard. When we were shown in if you could have seen my face, the room was a stable originally but it looked like they forgot to convert it! We were in the last room on the corridor and the outside door was constantly left open as people came through like staying in a train station.
We were then told the swimming pool was closed which booking had failed to mention. We decided to have a look around the rest of the leisure centre and when we did we asked to see the Manager as everything was so run down we felt the only option was to leave.
The manager was very nice, offered us a free meal but we refused as we couldn't wait to leave. He organised another hotel 4 star which turned out to be fabulous.
We are still furious to think the hotel retains a 5 star status as it is in need of major refurbishment. Remember you have been warned.",1,2008,03,02
239,Worth every penny,"This is a lovely Conrad hotel in the middle of the rolling Kilkenny countryside. It's got a golf course - but if you don't play, don't let that put you off (we don't). The rooms are very spacious, beautifully appointed and come with all the mod cons the 21st century traveller expects. Beautiful views over the river come as standard. The staff are friendly and welcoming, and very helpful. The food in the Lady Helen dining room is to a very high standard, and the service is immaculate. Breakfast on Sunday morning was smashing, spoilt only by some bloomin' awful chill out 'Buddah Bar' music on a loop. It really doesn't need this kind of musical accompaniment - a bit of Chopin would be much better. Overall, we had a lovely stay and would not hesitate it to anyone - golfers or not.",5,2008,02,19
239,Amazing Property,"Ireland is so beautiful! Mt. Juliet is a really neat place to stay and if you like golf or like to ride horses you will be in heaven. The golf course is really awesome. I walked half the course with my husband one day because it was so beautiful outside and the course is really nice. I grew up riding horses and it had been a dream of my dad's to take me horseback riding in Ireland, which we did... 3 times!! The riding trails around Mt. Juliet are awesome, keep in mind there are 1500 acres. The staff is very friendly, service is very good and food is great. There are lots of things to do on and around the property, so you don't really have to leave. I had a massage and pedicure at their spa and they were both fabulous. The pedicure, where they lay you down, wrap you all up nice and toasty, is so good! I caught myself falling asleep 2 times, I was so relaxed. My husband went shooting while there and really enjoyed it a lot.

Some other things to mention... our room was very small, but my dad paid for it so I was just happy to be there. My dad and step-mom were in the main house which is about 100 yards away which was a bit of a bummer because I like to hang out with them. Things are very expensive, but it is Europe, I guess I had a hard time getting used to that. You can take bikes out for free and ride around the property, which we did and loved visiting the horses. :)",5,2008,02,06
239,hotel of the year ... I dont think so!!,"We stayed at Mount Juliet for one night, dinner bed and breakfast. I was aware that the room we were staying in was not located n the main house and I was prepared for this . However. I was not prepared for the very strong smell of smoke that greeted us on entering the room. Having asked specifically for a non smoking room ,I immediately asked for the room to be changed. It took the staff over an hour to do this. The member of staff that we dealt with was so nice and extremely helpful but there was not a manager in sight. 
We had dinner that evening in Kendals restaurant, Due to the fact that we did not get a room until 5pm I requested a table for 8pm but was told that we could only have one at 6.30 or 7pm. The restaurant was by no means full at any time during our meal. The meal ws nice but very over priced for what it was. I also felt as if we were being rushed.
Breakfast the following morning was just lovely and the staff were very pleasant . The grounds are spectacular and the views are amazing .However I think some things need to be reviewed.",2,2008,01,28
239,Absolutely lovley!,"My husband and I have just come back from a weekend in this beautiful hotel. Unfortunately on our 1st night we stayed in the Rose Cottages (which were lovely and big) as our room in the main house had a leak, then we stayed the 2nd night in a beautiful room at the top of the house. Staff were really apologetic and we had some champagne as an apology which was a lovely touch. We ate in Kendals the 1st night and the The Lady Helen on the 2nd night, food and service were excellent on both nights. The really nice thing about this hotel is has a homely feel to it, even though it's such an exclusive hotel. My only fault with it was a rather dingey leisure centre and the fact that I couldn't get a spa treatment on the sat or sunday (I had been trying from the wednesday before), but this seems to be  a common problem in a lot of hotels, why I don't know... they should maybe bring in more staff to accommodate the interest instead of having a waiting list?? Anyhow I couldn't recommend it enough as a really romantic place to stay.",5,2008,01,15
239,Beautiful grounds and hotel,"Mount Juliet is gorgeous! I was disappointed that we only stayed one night because we really didn't have time to take advantage of the grounds, or horseback riding, or golf. The place is not cheap, but it's completely worth the money you pay. We closed down the bar watching American football with a group of people from Florida and Dublin. Definitely worth a stay. We stayed in the Hunters Yard and it was gorgeous.",4,2007,12,16
239,"Grounds and Room were Lovely, but the Dining Room needs to Improve","As soon as we arrived at Mount Juliet we felt compelled to leave our expertly appointed room and explore the grounds. The short walk down the steep path to the horse paddocks was worth every step. There were four foals and their mothers in one of the paddocks – Breathtaking. Not only were their horses in the field, there were also some of the largest cattle I have ever seen in my life that grunted, moo’d and snorted as we approached the fence, but they did not move. 

Next to the paddocks is a stream.  If you look very closely, you can see the fish swimming. But we still have not gotten to the best part – the golf course – what lovely greens – spring, deep and almost black – green. 

Our room was huge, the largest we had in Ireland with a down sofa and an overstuffed chair. It opened into a grassy courtyard where we enjoyed a sip of wine. The bathroom was enormous as well, encased in marble. The walk-in shower was delightful with enough room for more than one person. 

The beds had puffy down comforters, just like my favorite spots in Switzerland. 

The only part that was disappointing was the dining room. Although the servers smiled and tried very hard, they were not well trained. They were not familiar with the menu and were extremely unknowledgeable about the wine. Although we were there at the end of the season, we were expecting a lot more. The food was fresh, but uninspired. 

Also, if you stop for a drink in the bar, make sure to check your end hotel bill closely. Our bartender added a little extra to our already generous tip. 

So when planning your trip, enjoy the sights of Mount Juliet and reign in your expectations for the dinning room.",4,2007,10,23
239,Amazing Country Estate,"I absolutely LOVED this hotel.  Thomastown is a bit off the beaten track (but you HAVE to go there anyway to see the wonderful Jerpoint Abbey). This hotel is set out in the country next to a stud farm. The Irish countryside is beautiful and this gem of a hotel fits right in.

Good points:
The room was very large with a great view of the river and fields beyond.
The service was very friendly and helpful.
Bars were never crowded and very relaxing after a day of touring or golf.
Very quiet (both rooms and public areas)

Bad Points:
No elevator. I didn't mind the stairs (it added to the historic nature of the house), but definately need the porter to help with bags.
Pricey
Should provide more information about river walking trail. We got lost and ran across another guest on the trek who was also lost.
You are way outside of any city center, so a bit trapped at the hotel for meals.  (we spoiled ourselves with room service, it was very good)

This is almost a destination hotel for me. I would go a bit out of my way just to stay here.  Waking up in the morning with the windows open, the cool breezes blowing, the fog lifting from the river. A flock of ducks landing the horses stirring in the background.  I'm so ready to go back!",5,2007,10,03
239,Golf or Horse-back riding or Driving to the neighbourhood,"Truly beautiful estate.  Rather inconvenient access from Dublin (2.5hrs drive) but it is worth a visit.  Not a place for young couples but rather for enthusiastic golfer, fishing fans, hikers and Equestrians.
It would be able to better cater to people who simply want to relax if they improve the Spa facility which is not bad, however, has too few therapist and too easily booked up for weekends.

I myself is an equestrian thus had a wonderful stay.  They have good options for riding courses and instructors are well trained and friendly.  Horses are farily relaxed, which made the riding even better.

Only downside is the restaurants.  You have an option to visit nearby villages to enjoy the local establishments, however, in case you decide not to drive out and stay in the estate, there is not much choice.  Main dining (Lady Helen)was rather disappointing (considering the high price) and the other option which is more casual (Kendal restaurant) was much better value and has a creativity in menu, with good ingredients.  I prefered the latter much better.",4,2007,09,30
239,2007 Hotel of the year - I don't think so,"I looked forward to staying in this hotel as it was reported as being a quality hotel, was part of the Conrad group, and was one of 20 hotels I had booked on a 65 day world holiday. 
What a shame it was so bad. 
Everything from the indifferent attitude of the check in receptionist, to painted vanity top in the bathroom, dirty and old floor tiles in the bathroom, to the flaking varnish on the 80's coffee table and furniture, suggested a tired hotel that was long overdue for a refurb. I acknowledge that our rooms were not in the main section of the hotel, being in the ""Hunter Yard"" section of the associated golf course facilities, it still came at 210 Euro without breakfast. I would liken the accommodation quality at Days Inn or Motel 6 in the US, at roughly three times the price.
Suggest Conrad need to do a lot of work on their meet & greet process, as this hotel generally seems indifferent to guests.
If this hotel won any prizes, it can't be from the room I was given, or the staff I met.
Do yourself a favour, keep driving.

239,Does not live up to potential,"We stayed at this beautiful property in May, 2007.   We were two couples traveling together and stayed in Garden Cottage.  Lovely accommodation--perfect for two couples but could use some refurbishing.   Staff beautifully trained to be very friendly and courteous.  Unfortunately not trained to do their jobs and many have problems with English.  Example--it was very warm in one of the bedrooms when we arrived.  Discovered heat was on and we could not get it to turn off.  Called maintenance.  A very friendly, smiling gentleman with little English arrived promptly.  Soon the heat was off --next morning no hot water--seems the friendly gentleman just turned off the entire system (heat was hot water circulating system).  Again someone came and promptly fixed it.  

The riverside grounds are beautiful and extensive--several buildings and several different restaurants.  Very confusing with inadequate map of grounds furnished.  Food was good--service in restaurants very disorganized and slow but friendly.  This could be a wonderful hotel but needs management attention.

Area is not the most interesting part of Ireland but Jerpoint Abbey is fascinating and tour and history great..
",3,2007,07,30
239,not a five star experience,"Disappointing room in hunter yard.  Needs some housekeeping and maintenence attention.  

Restaurant excellent and beautiful golf course

Poor customer relations in getting back to customers
",2,2007,07,24
239,"very, very nice","We spent four nights at Conrad Mount Juliet and it was a very pleasurable experience.  Staff in all areas, especially restaurants were very accomodating and went out of their way to please.  We stayed in the Hunters Yard rooms were nicely and comfortably appointed, not lacking for ammenities. AM and PM maid and towel service was appreciated and a real plus.  My husband golfed and I went riding all four days.  Equestrian facilty was well run, I greeted my tacked and groomed steed every morning at 10  for three hours of guided estate riding--which was very pleasant and well paced, many good oppotunities for cantering and galloping and long trots on estate paths.  

The property is beautiful and well maintained, very quiet and serene.  

Service and staff at the President's Bar were good, food was prompt and quite good, dinner in Kendals was great service and food was very good.  Lady Helen Dining room in main house was a little overrated, but not terrible.  I don't really enjoy that level of pretense when dining, so if we were to go back I would probably skip Lady Helen dining room, and opt for the more casual Kendals.  

Mount Juliet estate is a lovely place to spend a few days.
",5,2007,07,18
239,Relaxing evening,"My boyfriend and I just returned from our Ireland trip where we spent our first night at the Mount Juliet Conrad. We wanted to stay there to overcome the jetlag and see the countryside. 
We arrived around 3:00 and our room wasn't ready yet so we were sent to the bar for afternoon tea that we were told was complimentary, however, there was a new server and he wasn't aware...we paid...no big deal. 

One of the staff members came and brought us our key when our room was ready and we drove up to the Golf house  where our room was. The room was small but nice and there was a great view.

We had dinner in the Saddle Room and the meal and service were great. After dinner we walked around the grounds to the stud farm and along the golf course. Everything was very well kept. 

Heated mirrors in the bathroom were the best part... no fogging up during showers. My boyfriend took the first shower and it worked for him and then broke so I had to take a bath. We called before we left for dinner and upon return to our room it had been fixed. 

The night was very peaceful and quiet. We toured the grounds a bit more the next morning and then headed off to Dublin. This hotel is perfect for golfers, older couples, or people just looking to relax. There's also an equestrian center, tennis courts, and other recreational activities that we didn't use.
",4,2007,07,08
239,So not impressed,"I recently stayed in Mount Juliet as I was attending a wedding which took place there.  The wedding rate was by no means cheap and I was very much looking forward to it, but truthfully I came away feeling disappointed and looking forward to going home.

Mount Juliet lacks atmosphere and is badly in need of a refurbishment in parts.  The reception/sitting rooms are gone beyond shabby chic and the furniture is very much like a mixture of a bit of this and that.

Upon arrival, the reception area is a little room into the right of the entrance hall and I was left to my own devices to find where my bedroom is (just follow the corridor, the receptionist told me) and no one offered to assist with my bag and suit carrier.  
Following a late night I missed breakfast so decided to order sandwiches and tea at around midday along with other wedding guests who missed breakfast too.  I decided to pay my bill and pack the car beforehand and discovered that I had been charged for breakfast!    Before departing, I finished my sandwiches and tea along with other guests, however we had to ask for the table to be cleared after 30 mins of finishing as others joined us and were about to order.  

A word of warning to others, take your euros elsewhere as there are so many beautiful new and existing Hotels around Ireland that can offer so much in terms of service and facilities than Mount Juliet can.

I certainly wont be going back .
",1,2007,07,05
239,Probably The Best Hotel In Ireland,"I have just spent a weekend at Mount Juliet and can't wait to return. We were attending a wedding at the hotel. We stayed in a ground floor room in the main house. The bed was huge, large fluffy pillows, none of the usual woolly blankets. The room and large bathroom were spotlessly clean. The minibar was very well stocked (probably too well stocked)!!
The breakfast experience was superb. The choice of fresh juices changes daily, the pastries tasted as if they had just come out of the oven. The cooked breakfast was the best I have ever tasted.
Even though the hotel was full, it was very quiet and at times we felt as if we were the only residents. 
Each member of staff we met was extremely helpful and courteous. I would have no hesitation in recommending this property, but try and stay in the main house. 
I have stayed in a number of five star hotels in Ireland and I think this is my favourite.
",5,2007,07,01
239,A lovely place,"We visited  Mount Juliet for 2 nights in May and it was just as beautiful as described.From the moment we got out of the car to the moment we left, the service was flawless.It so so beautiful, relaxing and gorgeous countryside. The hotel offers such activities like fishing, horse -riding golf. So we went horse-riding, walking, ate, drank, relaxed and then did it all some more in the most beautiful away from it all place I have been so far in the whole of Ireland.
",5,2007,05,22
239,Magical stay at Mt. Juliet,"Located two hours from Dublin, this 1500-acre estate property is breathtakingly beautiful. The staff is warm and friendly, and the main house is elegant. There are numerous activities available, including clay shooting, archery, tennis, golf and indoor swimming.  But the best part is the setting - gardens, stone walls, streams, etc. They provide bikes (free of charge) for roaming the property. The food is excellent as well.  Wish we could have stayed longer, but rushed back to Dublin to stay at The Fitzwilliam Hotel, which was a big disappointment.  Can't wait to return to Mt. Juliet.
",5,2007,04,16
239,"Warm, friendly and a real treat","My sister and I spent took a mini break to Mount Juliet and I couldn't fault the experience. We arrived around 12 and as our room was not ready we had coffee and fresh scones in one of the many drawing rooms in front of a roaring fire. Our room was ready within a half hour and our bags were delivered promptly by the bell staff. I had 2 treatments at the nearby spa which were wonderful and much appreciated as I am 8 months pregnant! I would advise if you intend to have some treatments at the spa that you book them well in advance. We had dinner in the evening in the Lady Helen restaurant and it was lovely, particularly as we had a table by the window and could look out across the sweeping countryside. Our room was very comfotable and the big fluffy feather pillows and duvets were a welcome relief from the usual sheets and blankets encountered at most hotels. Breakfast was delicious with a great choice, with lots of fresh fruits, breads, danish pastries as well as a choice of hot dishes. All of the staff we met were pleasant and courteous and went out of their way to make our stay as pleasent as possible. I am looking forward to a trip back soon!
",5,2007,03,30
239,"Really disappointing, completely overrated.","This place was a complete maze, we arrived on a very stormy december night and the hotel was really well signposted until we entered the grounds and then we hadnt a clue where we were supposed to go.  we were staying in the newer part of hotel but had to go to the old house to check in, no reception, just a room to side (like doctors reception) with no signposts anywhere, my hubbie was typical man, wouldnt ask for directions and by time we actually got to room we were barely talking.  Any way we traveled with a party of 8 people, all four couples arrived at different times each couple managed to get lost so it wasnt just us.  When we checked out we were charged extra for breakfast even though our booking stated clearly that it was included.  My credit card was also charged with charity donation without my permission (what charity does this go to???).  We got bar food which was lovely but 4 hours later we were still in bar and plates had not been cleared from table, and then they had nerve to charge us a service charge.  What service I hear you scream!!!!  Take my advice and spend your money elsewhere.
",2,2007,03,23
239,Arrogant service & no hot water or heating,"Stayed in a Rose Cottage.  There was no heating and a leaking radiator which made the carpet wet.  Some plug in heaters were provided.  There was also no hot water and this was not resolved for our one night stay.   
The staff in the Lady Helen Restaurant were arrogant, rude and argumentative, the menu was over priced and lacked choice.   We finally walked out and went to the Golf Club restaurant where for both dinner and breakfast the service and food were outstanding.  
The manager was accommodating when we met him in the morning and reduced out bill but we would rather had paid the full amount and received the luxury accommodation we were expecting from this brand as Hilton Diamond Club members
",1,2007,02,14
239,more than disappointed,"stayed in one of the better rooms in the old house, a some what cluttered room.house was cosy enough but in dire need of a good deep clean from top to bottom.
food was good and bar staff did their best to understand english.
manager was very good, perhaps swiss?
weather was excellent which made up for a lot.walk around the stud was good,(you're not allowed around the golf course bizarrely).
can agree with the comments about staff at the golf shop.
mount juliet is supposed to be a premier golf course, on a sunny summer weekend the course was empty nearly all the time.
will not return, and could not possibly recommend it to anyone.

239,Do not stay here. You WILL be dissapointed if you are used to service,"We were at the hotel for a family occasion end Dec 2006.

On arrival at 17.00 our room was not ready. At 18.30 it was after being promised it would only take 5 mins. We were offered coffee numerous times that never arrived.

The room was damp, tiny and with no attention to detail. It was impossible to lock and one of the chambermaids said it was like that for a while. 

Food was OK at best – still hungry after starter and main course - but restaurant was cold and draughty. I had my jacket over my knees. 

The junior staff were OK, but the arrogant management really lacked. 

E.g. a full staff in the breakfast room but still I heard one guy say he had waited 45 mins for a pot of ?????? tea. Another lady at another table said IF her breakfast arrived it could be sent to her room as she had to prepare for a meeting. 

A total overpriced joke. Do not go here. You will be disappointed if you are at all used to even reasonable 3 or 4 star service.

239,Wonderful Irish Manor House,"We enjoyed a lovely weekend this June.The room was quite nice, the grounds and gardens are beautiful and worth exploring.We played golf, the course was well groomed and challenging, but pricey.
",5,2006,06,25
239,Way too expensive,"Stayed here for 2 nites in a 2 bedroom rose garden suite. Had to wait 2 hours longer upon arrival while the suite was ""cleaned"", only to find a dirty bathroom. No hot water either. Poor service in bar. Had to ask several times for service. Save your money & stay at the Dolman in Carlow.

239,"What a peaceful, luxurious haven!!","We spend a long weekend every year with our good friends - normally on the continent.  However, this year we opted for Mount Juliet.  What a fantastic treat.  The weather helped as we had 29/30 degree heat for our stay.  The setting is absolutley beautiful.  We could indulge in high tea while watching the horses and their foals from the stud farm galloping about and the cows lying in the shade. 
The service from all the staff was very high.  My husband and friend asked directions to the pool room.  Before they had got there the table had been set up, lights on, cues cueed and drinks waiting.! The boys played a round of golf on Saturday afternoon and loved it, they raved about the course - equivalent to St Andrews in Scotland they thought. We ate in Hunters Yard the first night and the House the following night.  Both meals were of a very high standard but the meal in Mount Juliet House was exceptionally good.  I have to admit that we did a lot of sitting around in the lovely comfortable lounges and the front lawn drinking wine and lager, but we also did archery, clay pigeon shooting and croquet.  Our ""outdoor pursuits"" guide was great and let the girls have a few goes clay pigeon shooting even though it was only the boys partaking.
It was the Irish bank holiday weekend while we were at Mount Juliet and I was quite surprised at how few guests were around - we used the swimming pool with only 1 other family there - so when I asked at reception about their occupancy, I was shocked to learn that they were absolutley full for the whole weekend.  It is only places with such high standards that can make their guests believe they have the run of the house even while being full !
I cannot rate Mount Juliet high enough.  It was so very relaxing, pampering and beautiful. It fully deserves its reputation.

239,Night stay in a fabulous location,"Sunday 6th May 2006
My wife and I attended a wedding in Mount Juliet Estate last saturday. The Hotel is an old stately home converted into a Hotel, the rooms are amazing, big, well decorated and beds to die for. 
The Hotel is situated in the middle of a world famous golf course, and fabulous country side, great for going for romantic walks. 
The service in the Hotel was excellent, we attended a drinks reception and wedding meal, food and service was 5 star.
My only negative comment about the hotel is how breakfast was served the next morning, instead of being served breakfast as expected, it was a buffet style self service. 
I would recommend Mount Juliet for anyone looking for a restfull break.

239,"Peaceful, expensive Mount Juliet","March 14th is not the ideal time to see Ireland at its greenest, which is likely why we received a reasonable rate for our room at Mount Juliet. They upgraded us as well, and my friend and I LOVED our room, our view, the sounds of birds, the smell of fresh air, the foals with their mothers and the sheep in the fields outside our window.  The babbling river added to the beauty, and there were daffodils everywhere.  In fact, 2 days was not nearly enough and we felt cheated when we had to leave.  All that said, this is by no means a perfect destination, but much can be forgiven.  

The staff were friendly enough, friendlier if they happened to be groundskeepers, bellhops or chambermaids. (These people were locals and very nice indeed). Dining was quite pretentious, with mediocre food, very high prices, and reasonably good service by the French or Belge wait staff.  (No one informed us about the other restaurant on the property that might have been more to our liking and less pricey). Our first morning we ate breakfast, which was really not good. We were informed that it came with our room.  The 2nd day, we decided to eat there, only because it was included, and of course, we were now told it wasn't included. It was very expensive and possibly the worst breakfast we ate in Ireland. 

That being said, it still did not dim the pleasure of staying at such a grand estate. We wanted to tour around, and we investigated possibilities on our own.  We chose Metaphorplus1@eircom.net
and the owner spent 12 hours showing us the very best of Ireland. He was so kind, entertaining and very reasonably priced.This was certainly the high point of this overall good experience. My friend and I would be happy to return another time.

",4,2006,04,19
239,Golf at Mount Juliet?? No thanks!,"This hotel is five star in name only. I have visited twice, both for golf outings and found the service overall to be dismal. The pro shop staff were extremely unfriendly and were actually bordering on ignorant. The caddy shack manager was possibly one of the most ignorant men I've ever dealt with, I'd have been annoyed if I had to deal with his type of attitude at a pitch & putt club. The ultimate insult was the unavailability of food after a four hour round of golf. We finished our round at about 9:30pm on a beautiful summers evening and when we went into the bar for a snack we were told that the kitchen had closed. The most annoying part was that people were still eating in the bar so the kitchen could only have been closed a few minutes. Now it doesn't take much effort to throw a ham sandwich together but the barman made absolutely no effort to see if he could arrange something for us. You sometimes have to put up with that type of attitude if you've paid €20 for a round of golf in a small local club but in a ""5 star"" establishment charging €150 for a round of golf this is completely unacceptable. We won't be back and I suggest to anyone reading this to try other fine golfing destinations such as Faithlegg in Waterford, Gowran Park in Kilkenny, Rathsallagh in Wicklow or the Heritage in Laois. All will be much cheaper than Mount Juliet but the welcome will be far greater and you'll be able to get a sandwich if you finish your round later on the evening.

239,I'll be back....,"A wonderful fully equipped resort.  It is similar to Gleneagles in Scotland.  Enough things to do to stay for days without having to leave the property.  

We stayed in a Rose Garden suite and it was magnificent. summed up as extraordinarily spacious and properly equipped.  2 full sized bedrooms with separate baths, living room, dining area, kitchen and amenities like a drying room in the hall for wet belongings.  Lovely paned windows looking out on the 18 hole putting course from every room.  A large closet in the entry way for golf clubs and shoes and even CCTV upstairs to see who is ringing at the door.

Service was very good except in the bar in Hunters Lodge. Looked like not enough help after 10:00 PM. 

Golf course is first rate. Played the American Express World Championship there.  The staff was always helpful and courteous.  They even drove us from place to place when asked.  I couldn't have been more pleased with my choice.
",5,2005,09,29
239,Filthy Abomination,"Firstly, let me explain that one star represents terrible. It is not possible to give any hotel no stars on this rating system. If it was, I'd give it no stars. 
Mount Juliet changed ownership in the past few years and is now operated by Conrad. Perhaps the deterioration in standards is as a result of this changeover. I don't know. I do know that it was a magnificent facility at one time. This is no longer the case. 
The place is woefully understaffed. Staff in Mr Jinks bar and the dining room are pleasant and well intentioned but largely incompetent. The hotel is not clean. In some areas, it is actually filthy. Our room in the main house had a sour odour throughout. When you order food, be it in the dining room or room service or in the bar, the staff are incapable of taking down an order correctly and supplying the right food. They cannot even supply cutlery that is not encrusted with dirt. 
What else? As bad as Mount Juliet House has become, Hunter's Yard is infinitely worse. What a kip!! Bad food, bad accommodation. Bad service. 
The spa is very dated and the spa facilities are entirely inadequate. They need a major overhaul to compete with the spas on offer at other properties. 
We checked out a day early. They tried to charge us for breakfast. We didn't have breakfast because the staff couldn't find a seat for us. They asked us to wait for five mins in the bar and we would be called. Half an hour later, we appeared and they acted as though they'd never seen us before. Still no table. They asked if we wanted to share a table with another couple. We didn't. We decided to depart without breakfast. Still and all, we had to have a ten minute debate with the check-out staff to have the breakfast charge removed from our bill. It wasn't the only incorrect item we were charged for. 
Mount Juliet is a disgrace. I highly recommend that you book somewhere else. There are so many other fab hotels in Ireland at half the price. 
Check out Castle Durrow for a great break.
",1,2005,08,02
239,Beautiful Setting,"The hotel and the grounds were beautiful, although it was rather difficult finding the main hotel for check-in.  Our room was at  the Hunter's Yard.  The room was nice and clean.  Only by accident did we find that there was small refrigerator hidden under the desk although there was no mini bar and the refrigerator was not turned on.  The room had bottled water and apples upon our arrival (after seeeing some of the other charges we did not know if there was a charge for these items).  We just felt for a five star hotel that they nickled and dimed you.  The pool and workout room was very close to our room which was nice.   It was somewhat of a walk if you stay in the main house.  To use the pool everyone (men and women) have to use a bathing cap.  Not many people travel with a bathing cap, so they charged your room to use the bathing cap.  Upon check in they asked if we would like a daily paper and if so, would we prefer a US paper.  We specified the US paper and upon check out found out that there was a $3.00 per day charge for the paper.  They certainly did not make that known.  If you plan on playing golf, make sure you make a reservation before arrival.
",4,2005,04,25
239,Outstanding in every way,"This hotel is wonderful, the facility spectacular. However, what really makes this hotel my favorite place on earth is the staff.
We kept wondering if there was nothing these people would not do for us.  I had my eight year old daughter with us, and the staff made her feel like a little princess.  She was spoiled rotten.  I cannot tell you how difficult it was to leave.  
We had a great time, were waited on hand and foot and made some wonderful friends.  It just could not have a better experience.  We are already planning our return trip..
",5,2004,12,02
239,"Ghosts or not, Mt Juliet thrills!","The physical setting of Mount Juliet (a Conrad Hote, thus a Hilton Honors property) is enough to take your breath away.  Perched on a hill, nestled among galloping purebred horses and happy sheep, it is a feast for the eyes.  Inside, it's everything you'd expect an old estate to have--antiques, paintings, fresh flowers, beautiful views from every window. Roaring fire, leather club chairs in the bar, more than you could wish for. Plus a  top rated golf course, once frequented by Tiger Woods, is also an asset.

What keeps me from giving this hotel an ""Excellent"" rating is the terribly dusty room (cobwebs all over the drapes), unvacuumed floor, broken bath fixtures and some ameneties that are listed but just aren't in the room, like the coffee service.  We made 4 telephone calls to housekeeping for a non feathered duvet and foam pillows. Pretty easy request, and in a hotel that is off season, we were willing to get them ourselves. In fact, my husband scoured the hall's linen closed to find two foam pillows.  We gave up calling.  What's funny is that one of the hotel's amenities are the 6 different choices of pillows, including buckwheat.  I have no idea where they came up with this marketing tool in a hotel in the middle of rural Ireland (of course, most of Ireland is rural).

But the strangest thing of all, is that we had a ghost of some sort in our room during the night and also the following morning.  My husband was really freaked out.  Other than that, we enjoyed our stay.  And for those that think I am making this up, it was confirmed by the restaurant staff that the third floor does have a spirit of some sort.  Yes, we were staying on the third floor.  Enjoy!

239,Mount Juliet was nice,"Seven adults traveled in June, 2004.  We used Mount Juliet as a base for exploring the surrounding area, but wish we'd had more time just to spend at Mount Juliet.  The countryside was gorgeous, the golf was great, but the service overall was just above average.  The staff were enthusiastic for the most part, and seemed to want to do a good job; they just didn't have the experience level to know what a good job really entailed.  This is a fault of the ownership (Conrad Hilton Hotels) more than anything, I suspect.  The food was above average, but not great.  I admit that I am a spoiled traveler, and have very high expectations.  I would definitely go back for more golf, but I would also take advantage of the equestrian facilities and explore the grounds more.

239,Hunter's Yard Room was a big disappointment!!,"We recently stayed at the Conrad Mount Juliet for two nights during a ten-day romantic trip throughout Ireland. We were placed in one of their Hunter's Yard accommodations, which seemed to be mainly for the golfing crowd (we were not there on a golfing vacation) and the room was awful!  It needed a good cleaning (carpet, bathroom),  had a strange smell, and was generally noisy and not very well maintained -- definitely not like accommodations in the other hotels we experienced throughout Ireland (Dromoland Castle was superb!). On the night we arrived at the Mount Juliet, there was a loud party in an adjacent restaurant which went on until after 1:00 a.m.  Then, closer to dawn, there was a noisy truck delivery (with lots of yelling) at a nearby service entrance.   All in all, it was a very disappointing experience and we couldn't wait to leave!
",1,2004,07,29
239,The BEST place in Ireland,"This was the BEST hotel in a twelve day tour of Ireland with first class-deluxe CIE Tours -  Irish ""Supreme"" May 28 - June 12 (Even better than the castles!)  The ground are beautiful, with walled-gardens and rose gardens.  The river is wonderful; look across and see horses in pastures and cows in meadows.  The dining was superb!  Great service.  The bar is intimate and the rest of the ""house"" is great to explore.  We loved the library.  Our room was unbelievable; so large, step up to the room, vaulted ceilings, multiple window seats.  Walk a bit to the golf course ""clubhouse"" and have a drink or dinner and look at originals of Tiger Woods, Nick Faldo, or Jack ""the bear"" Nickalaus.  Need to stay here more than two days.

239,Breathtaking experience at Mount Juliet,"We just had the most breathtaking memorable experience at Mount Juliet.  Our room was enormous and decorated with  most beautiful antiques and wall paper.  The room was so large that most American hotels would consider this a double suite.  The wall murals, bar, dining room and library were so elaborate, that I took many pictures of  the inside of this hotel.  The grounds were also breathtaking.   The river behind the hotel had people fishing for trout, and the golf course was manicured to a tee.  The grounds also had state of the art stables and beautiful thoroughbred horses.  There were trails one could ride if he preferred.  The service and food was exceptional, and I am a finicky eater.  I had left a denim skirt, and I called after returning to the States.  Ken, contacted housekeeping immediately and called me  the same day.  I have not had any hotel be this prompt.  I would advise anyone traveling in Ireland to stay at the Mount Juliet House, but I would recommend at least a two day stay so you could horseback ride or golf.  I will never forget the great experience that I had at the Mount Juliet House.

Thanks,

Stacey Jones/ Hot Springs, Arkansas

239,We loved this hotel!,We stayed at the 5 star Conrad Mount Juliet April 9/04 and had a wonderful time. Although this property was hard to find (it was hidden behind the golf club) it was well worth locating! A beautiful old mansion that had been refitted as a hotel back in the early 1900's. It is well taken care of and is very clean! As with most old properties in Ireland there was NO air conditioning...which would be a problem in the summer months. Food in the dining room was excellent and the service impecable. The golf course was beautiful and looked like it would provide a challenge to the experienced golfer! We would have liked to have stayed for a few more days and relax...,5,2004,04,18

239,Resort da sogno in un'oasi di tranquillita',"Mont Juliet è un'oasi di pace situata a breve distanza dall'areoporto di Dublino, un resort che si estende sulle verdi colline di Thomastown. Se cercate un posticino in cui rilassarvi e ""staccare la spina"" non posso che consigliarvi vivamente questa struttura: Manor Hause è un antico casale padronale che vi riporta indietro nel tempo con bellissimi arredi, tessuti e quadri d'epoca, stile old English dei sanitari e i confortevoli pavimenti riscaldati. I maxischermi nelle camere, dotati di satellitari, sono di utilizzo facile ed intuitivo. Piu' giovanile e trendy  la proposta del secondo albergo, l' Hunters Yard Hotel. Diverse le attivita' ludiche proposte, dai famosi campi da golf tenuti con grande cura alla piscina con sauna, palestra e Spa, dal tiro con l'arco alla falconeria, dalla pesca alla semplice scorrazzata in bicicletta per l'immensa tenuta alla scoperta di questa natura incontaminata. Abbiamo cenato al ristorante Hound, dalla cucina tipica e ricercata, deliziosa la colazione nell'elegante  saletta Lady Helen e l'afternoon tea in giardino! 😋
Doveroso fare una menzione speciale alle gentilissime ragazze della reception, ai volenterosi autisti che ci accompagnano nei vari punti della struttura, ai giovani baristi ed ai camerieri dell' Hunters...
Un grazie speciale a Miriana, Laura, Jacopo, David, Desmond e Garry!  Due giorni da star 😄",5,2021,09,29
239,So und so,"Wir waren für 2 Nächte da, hatten  ein wunderschönes und ruhiges Zimmer in Hunters Yard. Es ist mehr für Golfspieler gedacht, aber man muss nicht unbedingt Golf spielen. Das Gebiet ist einfach herrlich, sehr gepflegt, einfach herrlich. Und die alten Bäume sind beeindruckend. Es ist extrem ruhig und man hat das Gefühl, dass die Natur da auch richtig geschützt ist. Das Personal war klasse, bis zum Rezeption. Da sitzen einigen arroganten Leute. Wir fanden es sehr witzig, haben wir auch nicht persönlich genommen. Es war nur ungewöhnlich...aber man muss vielleicht einmal im Leben so eine Erfahrung haben 😉....noch eine Sache, zum Frühstücken war keine Käse, seltsam und unerwartet für ein 5☆Hotel. ",4,2019,07,01

239,Tolles Landhotel,"Im Rahmen einer 14-tägigen Irland-Rundreise haben wir zwei Tage im wunderschönen Mount Juliet verbracht. Es gibt hier zahlreiche Rezensionen, die den Service und allgemein das Hotelmanagement kritisieren. Da diese einige Monate zurückliegen muss sich in der Zwischenzeit viel getan haben. 
Wir haben einen tollen Service genossen. Das Landhotel mit riesigen Park- und Golfanlagen hat viel rustikalen und mondänen Charme und bietet weite Blicke über schöne Landschaften. 
Wir hatten gerade das Gepäck aus dem Kofferraum geholt, da kam schon ein netter Page, um uns das Gepäck direkt auf das Zimmer zu tragen.
Das Frühstücksbüffet ist ausgezeichnet und wird im Restaurant eingenommen. Aufgrund der abgelegenen Lage empfiehlt es sich vor Ort zu essen.  Das Restaurant im Haupthaus namens Lady Hellen hat einen Michellin-Stern und ist entsprechend teuer. Etwas günstiger kann man ein paar Meter weiter im Kendal's Restaurant bzw im dazugehörigen Pub essen.

239,molta é l'attenzione,"che occorre fare nel prenotare una camera. Noi abbiamo riservato ad aprile per agosto e siamo stati sistemati nella ""Club House"". Due camere abbastanza disastro come pulizia e arredamento ( a parte l'enorme schermo televisivo alla parete). Albergo strapieno per una convention e per un gruppo di turisti. Nessuna possibilità di cenare ai ristoranti,ma solo in tavolini bassi e scomodi ( ovviamente senza tovaglia) e nell'ambiente, almeno quella sera,piuttosto puzzolente del bar della Club House. Il cui ingresso aveva mobilio accatastato, come in un magazzino di mobili usati.Non possiamo esprimere valutazioni sulla cucina del  ristorante in quanto ci siamo guardati bene dal restare.Abbiamo fatto presente la sera stessa la nostra profonda delusione e ,la mattina successiva,con l'aiuto della gentilissima addetta alle relazioni, abbiamo scoperto l'altra faccia della medaglia ossia gli ambienti davvero molto,molto  belli della ""casa"" principale ( off limits la sera precedente ) e alla quale,con tutta evidenza, si riferiscono molti commenti in tal caso giustamente entusiasti. Due mondi completamente diversi,come tutto. Nulla escluso. In estrema sintesi :""parenti poveri e parenti ricchi"". Il breakfast, al mattino, ovviamente in Club House, in perfetto clima da ""day after"", visto che sino a notte aveva ospitato la manifestazione. Quindi non possiamo che suggerire  di porre la massima attenzione nella soluzione scelta o appioppata: la denominazione dell'hotel  é la medesima, ma le categorie sono completamente diverse. E come sempre,basta saperlo. Se ne avremo  l'occasione,forse ,riproveremo l'esperienza,ma solo se alloggiati al Mount Juliet e non alla Dépendance, pomposamente chiamata Club House. La valutazione data é quindi della sistemazione ricevuta in concreto ed é forse anche generosa grazie alla gentilezza della PR. Impeccabile, invece, il green.",3,2015,09,07

La cosa che ci ha colpito di più (oltre alla cena da guida Michelin) il cameriere simpaticissimo del bar che ci ha introdotti alla degustazione di Whiskey Irllandesi 👍, fortuna che dormiamo qui, bere e guida a sinistra non vanno d'accordo 😃",5,2015,06,03
239,Gemischte Gefühle...,"Das Mount Juliet Hotel gehört von der Anlage her mit Sicherheit zu den schönsten Schlosshotels Irlands. Oder besser gesagt: Es hat einmal dazu gehört. Das Hotel hat eine Jahrzehntelange Tradition als Golf-Hotel für den gehobenen Anspruch, scheint aber insgesamt in die Jahre gekommen zu sein. Ein Bild, dass uns während unseres gesamten Aufenthalts nicht verlassen hat,  ist das einer Jungfrau die zu lange auf ihren Prinzen gewartet hat und nun ein wenig alt und grau geworden ist. Man pflegt sich nicht mehr so sorgfältig und manches hat Staub angesetzt. Im Fall des Mount Juliet ist ein neuer Investor der Prinz, auf den man sichtlich wartet. Noch während unseres Aufenthaltes waren Meldungen über den im Juni erfolgten Verkauf der Anlage in den Medien.
Das an sich beeindruckende Gebäude bedarf dringend eines neuen Anstrichs. Das blasse steingrau mag im Sommer noch erträglich sein, im Herbst wirkt alles trist und abweisend. Leider lässt die momentan noch wirkende Leitung des Hauses jeglichen Sinn für Dekoration vermissen. Blumen o.ä., die für ein bisschen Farbe sorgen könnten, sucht man beispielsweise im ganzen Hotel vergeblich. Wieso eine Hotelanlage, die über ein riesiges Areal mit Stallungen, einem kompletten Gestüt, einem Golfplatz nebst mehrerer Seen und diversen anderen Anlagen verfügt, kein Treibhaus hat, ist mir ein Rätsel. An Gärtnern mangelt es offensichtlich nicht, die trifft man ansonsten auf Schritt und Tritt und auch ihre sehr gute Arbeit, insbesondere im hoteleigenen Park. 
Wir hatten ein Zimmer im Haupthaus gebucht und hatten das Glück den „Black Earls-Room“ zu ergattern. Dies ist der zentrale, in der Mitte des Gebäudes liegende Raum in der 1. Etage. Dieser Raum verfügt, neben den beiden Suiten, über die schönste Fensterfront des gesamten Hotels und wir hatten einen absolut spektakulären Blick auf den Fluss und die dahinter liegenden Weiden, auf denen sich Pferde und Rinder tummelten. Der Raum selbst ist sehr großzügig, über eine Stufe geht es in das ebenfalls großzügige Badezimmer. Der Schrank war etwas knapp bemessen, dafür standen allerdings zwei Kommoden zur Verfügung. Die Matratzen waren leider etwas durchgelegen und müssten dringend erneuert werden. Da wir die Befürchtung hatten, bei einer Reklamation das Zimmer wechseln zu müssen, haben wir die Betten ertragen und uns über die Aussicht u.a. gefreut. 
Etwas nervend war die verschachtelte Elektrifizierung des Zimmers. Überall im Zimmer waren Schalter verstreut und man musste immer wieder unterschiedliche Kombinationen ausprobieren, um einzelne Lampen zum leuchten zu bringen. Das WLAN dagegen funktionierte tadellos, die Einwahl könnte nicht einfacher sein. 
Das Frühstück nimmt man in den Räumen ein, in denen auch das Lady Helen-Restaurant seinen Sitz hat. Von den Tischen an den Fenstern hat man einen wunderbaren Blick auf Fluss und Weiden. Beim Frühstück hat der Gast die Wahl zwischen verschiedenen Varianten irischen Frühstücks, die allesamt frisch zubereitet und serviert werden oder der eher lieblosen „kontinentalen“ Variante, die bei aller Liebe keine vier Sterne verdient hat. Auch hier macht sich der Umstand bemerkbar, dass der weit überwiegende Teil der Gäste Iren sind, gefolgt von einer kleinen Gruppe Briten und verschwindend wenigen Europäern. Ich habe durchgehend „irisch“ und wie ein König gefrühstückt, meine Frau hat mehrheitlich kontinental und eher bescheiden gefrühstückt. Da man im Mount Juliet das Frühstück immer getrennt zum Zimmer hinzu buchen muss, stehen hier die verlangten € 15 pro Person deutlich vor Augen. Man muss es so sagen: für die kontinentale Variante ist das hemmungslos überteuert. 
Die beiden großen irischen Zeitungen stehen reichhaltig kostenfrei zur Verfügung, wenigstens eine andere Alternative, z.B. eine britische Zeitung, sucht man vergeblich. 
Die Rezeption des Mount Juliet ist in einem kleinen, unscheinbaren Raum am Haupteingang untergebracht, der eher wie ein „Not-Büro“ wirkt. Hier sitzen in der Regel zwei Mitarbeiter hinter normalen Büroschreibtischen. Man mag das überzogen finden, aber für ein Hotel mit diesem Anspruch empfinde ich es als unpassend, wenn neue Gäste vor so einem Schreibtisch herumstehen, während die Hotelangestellten sitzen (und sich auch nicht zur Begrüßung erheben). Die Begrüßung fiel, wie jeder Kontakt zur Rezeption unterkühlt aus. Ein herzliches Willkommen sieht anders aus und nur der sehr freundliche Zimmerservice hat uns den ersten Eindruck gerettet. Auch hier spürt man in jedem Moment die abwartende Haltung der überwiegenden Zahl der Mitarbeiter die nicht wissen, was auf die zukommt mit dem neuen Besitzer. Man kann dem Hotel nur wünschen, dass der neue Besitzer - ein 35-jähriger Unternehmer, der seine Millionen mit einer Kette von Zahnkosmetik-Studios gemacht hat - mit ruhiger Hand und mit Rücksicht auf die lange Tradition des Anwesens modernisiert. 
Mir ist nicht bekannt, ob die bisherige Besitzerfamilie sich nur in den letzten Monaten zurückgezogen hat oder auch früher schon keine Präsenz gezeigt hat. Im Moment wirkt das gesamte Hotel jedoch führerlos und treibt, wie ein Luxusschiff ohne Kapitän, durch die See. Alle Mitarbeiter wissen irgendwie, was sie zu tun haben, eine wirklich ordnende, führende Hand, die dem Ganzen Ziel und Intensität gibt, fehlt schmerzlich. So schwer es mir fällt, würde ich derzeit einen Aufenthalt nicht empfehlen.",3,2014,11,01
239,Residenza da sogno,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo magnifico castello la notte del 10 agosto, una delle notti più belle del nostro viaggio di nozze.Questa dimora rimane al centro di un enorme parco.Stanze bellissime e dotate di tutti i confort.Hotel e stanze pulite,cena al ""Kendals"" e colazione favolose.",5,2014,09,01
239,Excelente lugar para vacaciones familiares,"Nuestra llegada fue accidentada el 23 de agosto al estar todos los hoteles completos en Waterford. Anne de recepción nos solucionó el problema. Calida bienvenida, calidad precio inmejorable. Incluso nos prepararon unos sandwiches que nos trajeron a la casa a las 11 de la noche, pues llegamos sin cenar.
Fue una suerte encontrar alojamiento en Mount Juliet. La casa/apartamento donde nos alojaron estaba impecable, con una decoración exquisita y todas las comodidades. Por la mañana desayunamos, paseamos, montamos en bicicleta, nos bañamos en la piscina, etc. En definitiva, fueron 24 horas muy bien aprovechadas. Sin duda, si volvemos a Irlanda volveremos a Mount Juliet.",5,2014,08,31
239,Magnifica residenza,"Ho soggiornato una notte in questa residenza in stile. Stanze molto grandi  e pulite, con wifi e bollitore con te e caffè, asse e ferro da stiro. Alla reception non molto gentili, un po' snob direi, invece gentilissimo il signore che chi ha scompagnato alle stanze. Il ristorante era chiuso per un evento privato, così abbiamo cenato al bar, molto bene, anche se caro. Colazione superlativa. Il posto è magnifico, con bellissimo campo da golf.",4,2014,07,15
239,Traumhaftes Haus mit einige Mängeln,"Ich war im Juni für eine Nacht Gast in diesem Haus. Das Haus und die Anlage sind traumhaft schön gelegen und sehr beeindruckend. Den Empfang fand ich persönlich nicht so freundlich wie in anderen Hotels in Irland. Mein Zimmer war sehr groß und auch wirklich wunderschön eingerichtet, aber leider sehr renovierungsbedürftig. Ebenfalls war die Terrasse an meinem Zimmer sehr verschmutz. Schlafen konnte ich nur ganz schlecht und sehr spät, da die Lüftung der Küche an meinem Zimmer war. Es war wirklich sehr laut und unangenehm. Schade! Das Restaurant Lady Helen kann ich nur jedem Empfehlen. Das Esse war ausgezeichnet und der Service perfekt. Zwar sehr Teuer, aber es lohnt sich. Auch das Frühstück war sehr gut ebenfalls der Service. Mein Fazit, ich würde einen Aufenthalt nicht wiederholen, aber das ist meine persönliche Ansicht.",3,2014,07,03
239,L'Irlanda dei sogni,"Dimora storica che incarna l'immagine classica dell'Irlanda: edera rampicante e boschi e prati verde smeraldo a non finire tutto intorno.
Le nostre camere si trovavano nella dimora storica centrale, credo vi siano poi alloggi sparsi un po' per tutta la proprietà. Camere di buona qualità, mobili che richiamano lo stile storico delle zone comuni, bagni non eccezionali ma comunque di buona qualità.
A circondare l'hotel campi da golf e la possibilità di cavalcare in mezzo al verde; a disposizione anche biciclette per esplorare la tenuta (che è davvero immensa). 
Colazione di buon livello, con discreta varietà.
Personale efficiente anche se un po' freddo.",4,2014,06,28
239,Questo posto resta impresso nel cuore...,"Il Mount Juliet Estate è stato la seconda tappa del nostro viaggio di nozze e ci ha incantanto!!!! Sono stati cortesi e gentilissimi, molto pazienti anche con noi che non conoscevamo benissimo la lingua, ci hanno risolto qualsiasi problema (addirittura un problema che avevamo con il gps della nostra automobile). La camera che avevamo scelto era la riverview, semicircolare con vetrate e vista sul fiume, sala da bagno grande e ben accessoriata, letto enorme, all'interno della camera abbiamo trovato anche il kit per preparare la ciocccolata calda oltre che il thé, i biscotti, una bottiglia di vino e la lettera di congratulazioni della direzione. Un posto magnifico che resta impresso nel cuore. Grazie ancora a tutto lo staff per il soggiorno squisito!!! Ovviamente colazione ottima!!!",5,2014,03,05
239,La luna di miele prosegue,"La seconda tappa della nostra luna di miele ha visto lo scenario del Mount Juliet come cornice. Alla tenuta ci aspettavano e qui sapevano che eravamo in viaggio di nozze. In camera abbiamo trovato vino rosso e una lettera di congratulazioni del direttore. Molto cordiali e disponibili anche con noi che non masticavamo bene l'inglese. Il parco è immenso, la natura la fa da padrona. La villa è ben tenuta anche se gli arredi sono sicuramente datati (ma puliti). La camera enorme con due finestroni luminosi al piano terra. Il bagno con doccia e vasca separati, tutto nuovo. Il posto si trova a circa 20 minuti di macchina da Kilkenny e 40 da Waterford.Maneggio e clubhouse con ristorante casual. LCD, phon in camera, Free wifi in tutto l'albergo, ombrelli a disposizione.",4,2013,10,19
239,"Super schönes Hotel, tolle Lage","Das Hotel liegt beim Golfplatz, was aber für Nichtgolfer nicht störend ist. Sehr schöne Lage an einem idyllischen See, gelegenheit zum Spazieren. Der Empfang und die Zimmer sehr schön und gross. Man sollte ein Zimmer im Haupthaus nehmen, da grösser. Auch das Abendessen sehr gut. Alle sind sehr nett und unkompliziert, kein Problem auch beim Essen auf der ganzen Irlandreise wenn sie Vegetarierin sind wie ich.",5,2012,04,15
239,Tolles Anwesen mit Schwächen,"Das Hotel liegt in traumhafter Landschaft. Für Golfer, Reiter und Sportler ein toller Ort. Zimmer sehr gross, aber leider nicht mehr dem heutigen Standard entsprechend. Zwei sehr gute Restaurants, super service, Wellnessbereich vorhanden aber grauslich.
Wer auf das Zimmer und Welness nicht viel Wert legt sollte unbedingt kommen.",4,2011,09,23
239,location incantevole ma alcune pecche...,"Il posto e' surreale sembra di essere fuori dal mondo. L'hotel si trova in una tenuta immensa meravigliosa, il campo da golf e' fantastico per non dire unico, insomma un vero paradiso.
Per quanto riguarda l'hotel esternamente ti toglie il fiato dalla bellezza,  ma dentro sinceramente,  pur rispettando lo stile e la sua storia , direi che i divani e le poltrone ,sia della camera (superior) sia dei vari salottini dei bar, andrebbero cambiati. Sono decisamente vecchi e trascurati.
La camera era molto spaziosa ma l'arredamento non era quello della foto sul sito quando ho prenotato. Ho visitato un appartamento con due camere 2 bagni salottino e cucina , destinato prevalentemente alle famiglie. Questi sono tutti nuovi arredati con gusto.
La colazione supera ogni aspettativa, sicuramente di qualita', personale gentile e cordiale.
Devo invece esprimere un giudizio negativo sulla reception.
Sapevamo che la camera come in tutti gli hotel e' garantita dalle 3pm e noi siamo arrivati alle 12, il problema nasce pero' se al momento dell'arrivo ti fanno credere che in poco tempo la camera e' disponibile e dopo 2 ore sei ancora seduto all'ingresso dell'hotel.
Le due impiegate della reception in queste 2 ore non si sono minimamente preoccupate di alzarsi dalla sedia dove erano comodamente sedute per darci un feed back sulla camera o offrirci un bicchiere d'acqua .....!! Alla fine credo il manager o manager on duty, ci ha chiesto se era tutto ok, abbiamo spiegato , e' andato ad informarsi e tempo 2 minuti e' arrivato con le chiavi della nostra camera.
Se la camera era pronta possibile che le impiegate della reception non sono venute a dircelo..???? Inoltre avevo scritto sempre alla reception una mail il giorno prima del nostro arrivo  chiedendo se nel pacchetto da me prenotato 199 euro B&B per una notte potevano aggiungere il golf.   Ho ricevuto una mail 2 giorni dopo la nostra partenza scusandosi per avere letto tardi la nostra mail. Sinceramente la reception non mi e' sembrata cosi affollata da non potere leggere una mail, anzi ogni volta che sono passata davanti ,erano tranquillamente sedute  a chiacchierare......Trovo tutto questo una grave mancanza nei confronti del cliente . Consiglierei di dare piu' importanza alle public relation con gli ospiti.
Concordo con altri viaggiatori che la struttura non e' un 5 stelle , ma tornerei sicuramente con la famiglia in uno degli appartamenti, che come ho detto prima sono arredati bene.",4,2011,08,29
239,"Bellissimo, da tornare","Hotel incantevole in una tenuta di 14.500 acri con golf, cavalli, e tanto meraviglioso e curatissimo verde. Stanze in stile belle e confortevoli; servizio impeccabile. Per gli amanti del golf un campo scenografico e non troppo complicato;  noleggio sacche con ferri nuovissimi. In alternativa equitazione in percorsi boschvi, tiro con l'arco e falconeria.",5,2011,06,07
239,ho visto di meglio,"Un hotel senza dubbio adatto a tutti ma con pecche intollerabili visto il costo del pernottamento. Durante il soggiorno ho alloggiato nella clubhouse ma non è stato assolutaente piacevole visto che erano appena stati riverniciati gli infissi e l'odore di vernice e impregnante era insopportabile. Le camere non sono particolarmente spaziose: se ci si ferma più di due notti conviene prendere una villetta. La connessione internet non è disponibile nelle stanze ma solo nelle aree comuni. Il buffet della colazione è povero ed, eventualmente, bisogna ordinare i piatti caldi. Per chi gioca a golf, però, il campo è interessante e piacevole (lo shop invece è un po' misero). il grandissimo parco lo rende adatto anche alle famiglie con bambini. Il ristorante è eccellente",3,2011,04,11
239,wow!!!,"Un posto molto lussuoso, in mezzo ad uno splendido campo da golf. Un po' fuori Kilkenny, ma abbastanza ben segnalato.
Il personale è molto gentile, cordiale ed alla mano.
Stanza ampia e confortevole, pulitissima.
Colazione da re, adatta al luogo e, se non ci si preoccupa troppo del colesterolo, un'ottima cucina in Irlanda.",5,2010,09,08
