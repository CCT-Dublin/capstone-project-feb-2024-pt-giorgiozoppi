224,Average,"Hotel it was OK for a night or two. The room was quiet and clean and the beds comfortable. Staff was great. The room was not very well equipped, no ice bucket no refrigerator, freeze dried coffee that’s not very good. The big issue was the shower. The water pressure was really weak and the temperature lukewarm. 
With many choices in Dublin I would probably not stay here again.",3,2024,10,19
224,Great hotel and great breakfast,"The room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable.
Breakfast was fantastic. A shout out to Carmel from the restaurant who looked after us every morning. She was outstanding in her service. It made our stay even more memorable. 
The hotel is about a 20 minute walk to Stephens Green and another 5 mins to Grafton street. Great hotel.",5,2024,10,09
224,Stressful stay made pleasant,"We stayed at the Clayton between 23 and 29 SEP 2024. Our trip to Dublin was stressful as Aer Lingus lost our luggage and we were without the necessities till 28th. Every day we would ring the Aer Lingus Call Centre and the Clayton reception staff was most helpful and understanding. Gonzalo and Dino were especially helpful and kind and reassuring. This removed some of the stress and we are grateful to the Reception staff for all the help they provided.

Thank you.

224,Would come back again!,"The personel of the hotel was really nice and helpful.  Hotel and Rooms were very clean. Breakfast and meals were amazing and not that expensive at all!

Petru, cian and the other servers were also very friendly and nice, always asking if thing we're fine, to our liking and that kinda stuff. Also having good and interesting conversation with them about Ireland, Dublin, football and other stuff was real fun.

I would definitely go back heren when I would travel to Dublin again.",5,2024,10,06
224,We loved staying here!!,"We have experienced such a lovely time staying here for 3 nights! There has been 7 of us and the staff have always managed to fit us in for food and drink!! The staff have been nothing but lovely, we told one of the staff members (cian)  it was my dad’s birthday trip and they gave him a free drink and a happy birthday note on his pudding!! I asked one of the bartenders called Peteu if he could make me a pornstar martini because it wasn’t on the menu and he went out of his way to make it for me! 10/10 by the way!!!!",5,2024,10,06
224,"Great service, comfortable and clean rooms and a very tasty pub menu.","First and foremost, the service in the restaurant/pub (lockside) was phenomenal!  I was particularly impressed with Cian and Petru who were incredibly helpful and friendly.  I somehow managed to spill a bottle of sparkling water which broke on the floor, and these two quickly cleaned up the spill and refreshed my glass.  The room was clean and comfortable with a newly remodeled bathroom.  They do a daily refresh which is a nice surprise in the post COVID world.  The gym had everything I needed and was empty on a Sunday morning, which may or not always be the case.  The food was excellent...I had a ceasar salad for lunch and chicken curry for dinner which both exceeded my expectations.  They have a great bar, but it is a little clumsily set up, with not much room to walk behind the bar stools and not enough of them.
I would return for another business trip.  The location along the canal is very pleasant.",5,2024,10,06
224,Amazing,"Dear Clayton, hotel and staff were Amazing especially , Nargiz, I was very happy to have her support with our meetings! 
Petro is so special!  Petro's service is the BEST.  When I travel  it is good to know I have someone who really cares for his guests.
Ciao

224,Tired room did not spoil overall experience at hotel,"Stayed at this hotel for three nights with my wife and two other couples.  Found the price point for the location to be fair and competitive. My experience was good. Room was clean and tidy but lost minor marks for the shower having low water pressure and the window fittings being broken which was noticed when opening window to freshen room, (security clip was broken off, window was wobbly when open). 

However the positives defiantly outweigh these pedantic remarks. staff were welcoming, friendly and efficient. Checking in was easy and fuss free, house keeping staff were friendly and helpful, and banqueting staff in morning were friendly and efficient. When checking out, hotel front desk tagged our luggage and securely stored our luggage allowing us a final day exploring Dublin before flying home in the evening.  I only ate breakfast in this hotel and found selection to be good, of good quality and personal requests ie poached eggs were handled efficiently with minimum wait times. I was using this hotel as a base to enjoy Dublin with friends. The fact that all had great time in Dublin indicates that this hotel carried out its function well. I would have no issue using this hotel again and probably will next time I return to Dublin.",4,2024,10,05
224,Extremely professional and helpful staff !,"The best part about Clayton Charlemont are the staff. My family's experience was made really positive by Shreya Malik, Imran (front desk) and another new front desk staff member who was very helpful.  The only drawback I would say was the breakfast for people who don't eat pork or beef. But the staff were accomodating and gave us few alternates. 

We were helped for booking our bus tickets, cancel and get refund, recommendations of what to see, change to a bigger room, luggage storage and breakfast to carry for the airport. Great experience!",5,2024,09,30
224,Great hotel in a good quiet location,"The hotel is very modern, up to date and extremely well looked after. It is  opposite the canal on one side and a busy street the other but it’s set back from this street.  The fixtures and fittings are very new as the hotel was only built in 2018 and possibly wasn’t used for 12 months due to the covid pandemic in 2020.
Everything is well cared for, the bedroom furniture and fittings, the restaurant and the reception area and lounges. 
The staff are very accommodating and friendly. They can’t do enough for you and are there to serve and look after you on every occasion.  The one at breakfast time called Carmel was so friendly and helpful and gave good advice on what to visit. 
Breakfasts are plentiful and varied, hot, cold, fruit, yoghurts, porridge, cereals,  full Irish breakfast too. You help yourself to whatever you wish.  Teas  herbal and black and green teas, coffees on the machine which were lovely. Everything very well presented too.
I stayed in for evening meal as I was on my own and the food although a limited menu was extremely well cooked and tender. Presented in a very nice manner too. The only thing I would say was everything seemed to be overly salted and for one who doesn’t use much salt it made me very thirsty. Maybe the chef could use less salt as there is salt on the tables. 
I would certainly stay here again and would also recruit to anyone who asks me.",5,2024,09,26
224,Excellent service.,The staff were excellent especially Gonzalo.  Breakfast was wonderful. Very comfortable bed.  My only complaint is that the the use of the key card to access the lift and room lights needed to be explained at check in and the sink drain valve is hidden behind the tap,4,2024,09,24
224,Great time with staff! A plus recommendation,"Ciara, Petru and Grace were great! They were so helpful during our stay and will recommend them to all traveling to Dublin. Their hospitality was amazing. They helped us with our car, as well as food orders late into the night. Definitely will be coming back.",5,2024,09,22
224,Lovely,"I stayed here for work but met a friend for dinner in the evening at the bar. They were very attentive and friendly. We had a lovely evening. Cian and Petru really looked after us. The only thing I will say is the shower wasn’t great in the bedroom, but the beds are very comfy. I will definitely stay here next time I’m in town again.",4,2024,09,20
224,Excellent hotel and staff,"I was on a business trip from Manchester to Dublin, and I have to say as far as hotels go, this is an extremely phenomenal.

Petru & Cian was incredibly warm and welcoming and the other bar staff were also amazing. 

The food here is extremely good and i would strongly recommend anyone to travel here for either business of leisure",5,2024,09,19
224,Great for family,"Very accommodating for our family.  Comfortable, roomy, and very clean rooms. A block from the tram which was so easy to take to the park with playground, museums, and area with many restaurants.  Food was available at hotel and walkable, as well. Recommend.",5,2024,09,19
224,really good care even after leaving,"Very good stay as usual, rooms and service perfect, went for food at the start with pints and it was savage
 , however this time i forgot my charger in the room, and Evangelina who works there was such a great help in returning it to me, really went above and beyond. Thanks a million",5,2024,09,17
224,"Server at the bar, Petru","Bar experience and cocktails were fantastic! Our server was Petru, who made some standard, but also signature cocktails. In the meantime during the preparation he explain every step, using his own made sirup. I have to mention taste of Old fashioned, was perfect.",5,2024,09,15
224,Clayton ask for petro for good cocktails,"Petro is the best bar man in Dublin excellent service. very extensive knowledge on cocktails good man. Good laugh and good recommendations to restaurants and bars, very welcoming thank you for your service! Lovely clean comfortable hotel and try sleep cocktail",5,2024,09,14
224,Thank you Petro!,"Lovely hotel very comfortable and staff are absolutely lovely. Petro makes amazing cocktails and is very attentive and great at recommendations he makes the hotel a welcoming place. Cocktails much better than Scotland, I would recommend this hotel and the lovely staff to anyone wanting to travel to Dublin",5,2024,09,14
224,Nice boutique hotel,"Room was ready before 3:00pm which was so nice considering we flew in from Colorado USA and already had a long day. Check in was quick & professional. Our room is compact, but enough for us. After 1/2 hr walk, we went to the bar for a drink. Pretty extensive selection considering the size. Agustin was fairly new, but we didn’t know that until halfway through the evening. He was so friendly and knowledgeable.  After serving us at the bar we moved to the restaurant when it opened at 5:00. Agustin was also our waiter. Food came out quickly and was great. Shoutout to Agustin for great service. We would never guess he had only been there 4 weeks.",5,2024,09,13
224,"Lovely hotel,  employee added that special touch to make it even more memorable.","My friend and I booked here for our last night in Dublin before departing for home in the US.  Very clean and friendly staff.  We were very blessed with the front desk and especially enjoyed the bar where we were able to grab a delicious meal without the need of exiting the building after a day of travel from Cork.  We had the most delightful waiter, James, who surpassed all our needs and we thoroughly enjoyed his wit and personality.  Thanks for making our experience most memorable.",4,2024,09,12
224,Very nice hotel and well located,"Very nice hotel in a quiet area, close to public transport (Green tram Charlemont stop is 3 mns walk 
).
The bedroom was spacious and our bed very comfortable.
We had breakfast elsewhere though,  so cannot comment on its quality.
We wil definitely choose to stay at the Clayton Charlemont for our next stay this autumn.",5,2024,09,07
224,Great stay at Clayton Charlemont,"A wonderful overnight stay. Very comfortable room, spotlessly clean. We ate in the bar and enjoyed a super meal and warm welcome from Frank. Great to be so closento the luas and walking sistance from both the city centre and Ranelagh with its neighbourhood bars and restaurants. We will be back again.",5,2024,09,02
224,"Dublin Trip, Excellent Hotel!","Stayed here for a visit to Dublin for our wedding anniversary. 
The hotel has a great location, far enough away from the city centre with canal facing rooms for a quiet night’s sleep. But well within walking distance to the city centre (and with excellent public transport), Uber rides don’t cost very much either from the centre.  Really nice bar in the hotel, and loads of great bars, restaurants and live music in the local area. 
Beds incredibly comfortable, very clean room and public areas, and really friendly and helpful staff throughout the hotel. All in all, a really pleasant stay. 
Only feedback - The hotel  encourages online check in and check out. I did this around 9am that morning.  Online check in does not allow any arrival time before 3pm to be noted - which is to be expected in line with most hotel policies. So I advised I would arrive c.3pm - and arrived at 3.45pm. The room key process then became messy because I had not been sent a QR code, via email, and when asking at reception I was  told it was because I had come too early, they’d have sent me a QR once they were ready for me - and to wait in the lobby. When I wasn’t accepting of this service, another member of staff on reception was able to manually fix this and book me into another, ready room - a frustrating interaction I expect I could have avoided if I just walked up and checked in ‘old school’ at the reception desk.  There is no doubt advantages to the online check in and check out process the hotel has (check out was fairly slick), but then makes for an awkward human interaction as it doesn’t seem to prioritise room allocation based on customer arrival times. If I were to stay at a Clayton again, I’d probably just use the reception desk without online check in based on this experience.",4,2024,08,30
224,Nice stay at Clayton Charlemont,Stayed 5 nights at Clayton Charlemont.  Great front desk staff…very friendly and helpful.  Awesome breakfast.  Reservation staff was quite helpful making arrangements.  Loved the area near the hotel and the canal.  Nice being near tram stop.  Great pub next door.,5,2024,08,28
224,Great stay,"Stayed for 4 nights, staff was welcoming, helpful, friendly and went above and beyond. Especially Gloria, she made me a great Irish coffee and was helpful to our every need. I would recommend this hotel. Hotel is in great walking distance to all the fun things to do in Dublin.",4,2024,08,27
224,Family Vacation,This place was really nice. It is outside the city but not by much and the train is not more that a 5 minute walk. Within a 10 minute ride to Grafton Street and Temple bar area. The beds were so comfortable. Room was a nice size. Best of all it has air conditioning LOL. I can’t say enough about the staff especially Gloria. She is a sever there and always greeted us with a smile.,5,2024,08,25
224,Excellent Hotel!,"Stayed last nite with my sister-in-law who was celebrating a belated birthday. I requested a nice room through the lovely Patryk in reservations & we arrived into our beautifully clean, well appointed room on the 1st floor with complimentary macaroons, a lovely & much appreciated gesture. The beds were so comfy with excellent pillows. Our dinner in the Bar was delicious where the staff ie Razvam, Petro & Frank could not have been more attentive or helpful. Breakfast this morning while buffet style(my pet hate! ) was surprisingly of a high quality again overseen by excellent staff.",4,2024,08,22
224,Great birthday experience,"Went to celebrate my birthday and had a fantastic evening 
Razvan & Petru made it a very special evening with a surprise dessert and cocktail 
Would highly recommend 👌🏻 
Will be back again as the service is 10/10

224,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel. There was enough space and storage in the room. Bathroom was lovely with walk in shower. Room was very clean and refreshed daily. There was tea and coffee making facilities, iron and ironing board in the room. We didn't eat in the restaurant but we had several drinks in the bar and the staff were so friendly, nothing was too much trouble for them. Good location. Close to tram and bus stops. Would definitely recommend.",5,2024,08,14
224,Service with a Smile!,"We want to thank Frank, Petra, Alberto, Oliver and Ciara for outstanding service to our party.  Despite a very large and chaotic breakfast crowd, they quickly fulfilled our requests with a pleasant smile!  It is unusual to experience great service and wonderful personalities in our hectic world.",4,2024,08,11
224,Lovely location and beautiful hotel,"A beautiful hotel in a great location, situated right on Dublin’s Grand Canal within easy walking distance from museums, shops and restaurants in central Dublin.

224,"Excellent location, friendly staff and lovely rooms.","Highly recommend this hotel, would love to stay again. Spacious room for three people, very comfy beds, all amenities provided in room that would be needed. Room was refreshed nicely after first night, water bottles provided along with fresh towels. Breakfast had great selection, very helpful staff. It was extremely busy and buffet area is small so it was a bit chaotic but staff managed very well and ensured items were fresh and topped up well.",5,2024,08,09
224,Highly Reccomend,"Lovely hotel. Great location, great food and friendly staff. Very modern, will definitely come back.

Breakfast food was very nice, but extremely busy always. Always a que for food and the coffee machine, perhaps the coffee machine could be relocated. Staff very friendly.",5,2024,08,09
224,Pleasant,"Everything was great! The rooms were clean and the staff were attentive. Breakfast here was also great, both the buffet and the menu. Gloria was very helpful! Always around if we needed anything. And Cristina and Aroldo from the Lobby helped us with every little detail that we needed. Everyone was very friendly and helpful.  I’m glad I stayed here with my family. And will always return to this place.  Thank you guys.",5,2024,08,07
224,Great stay at the Clayton Charlemont Hotel!,"Quirky room, all the key amenities! Lovely front desk staff, very happy and helpful :) Arnaldo was particularly great!

It was such a delight and breath of fresh-air, to experience hospitality at its most unique level.
Ms Gloria who had served me at the Breakfast Restaurant, was quite extraordinary, she was attentive, kind and glad to serve. 

The staff in general were a rare breed team, of courteous and energetic people. I would return to the Hotel and highly recommend the property, to other friends and family.

Wishing your Organisation Continued Success and Blessings.

Thank you

224,Fantastic birthday stay,"To celebrate my husband's 40th birthday, we went to Dublin.
We had the opportunity to sleep in this beautiful hotel. The room was very spacious with a large bed.
 The breakfasts were fantastic, a very large selection, everyone will find something for themselves.

224,Superb service by hotel managers Art and Ron,"superb and excellent service, special mention to the hotel managers: Art and Ron thanks for your kindness. Breakfast buffet was nice, highly recommended. The hotel has a nearby convenience store and pubs, rooms are neat and spacious, hotel bar was soo nice",5,2024,07,31
224,"Cost effective for location, good family hotel.","Nice hotel, not too far from the centre (about 15 - 20 minute walk).   I stayed with my kids and the room was big enough for us all. The hotel is clean, modern and deceptively large (looks like a guest house externally).  We only ate breakfast here but seemed to have landed on a football final weekend and one of the busiest hotel breakfasts I’ve experienced.  I noted the name of the breakfast host (Bismark) because he managed everyone calmly, seemed to be finding solutions to police the breakfast traffic effectively and treating everyone pleasantly despite all the chaos.  However, one young blonde girl coming back and forth from the kitchen with a face like thunder barked at him several times to clean tables etc.  If better service was what she was after, she was the only one souring the atmosphere - she should be reprimanded for speaking to colleagues like that and put on a course to help her navigate a customer facing environment/find a new job. Well done Bismark for dealing with her attitude with grace and putting the guests first.",4,2024,07,30
224,Comfortable and Convenient,"This is a great hotel, conveniently located near the Luas along a canal. A 3 minute walk. The room is comfortable and the bed was great. There is no refrigerator in the room, however, we did have a teapot and coffee available in the room. The breakfast selection was excellent. So was dinner the night we dined in. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2024,07,20
224,Accommodating bar staff,"The staff was friendly, and the rooms were clean and lovely. We were especially impressed with Cian, Alberto, and  Frank who went to great lengths to get us  food after a long day! They were amazing! It was after 11, and they ensured that we had hot food. Great location. Highly recommend!",5,2024,07,18
224,"Excelente hotel en un buen emplazamiento, cerca del centro y de zona de pubs y restaurantes.","One year after (we stay in this hotel in July 2024 and July 2023).

Very convenient.

2024: We booked a bigger room. Very nice and quite big. Bathroom was excellent, hot tube, amenities, etc.
2023: Size of the room (Standart): recently renovated and acceptable for a couple. The bathroom, quite new, was good. No hot tube, just a big-tray shower.
There was no mini fridge in the room. 2024: there was mini fridge with a couple of complimentary water bottles.
2023: The wheel desk chair was broken or damaged as the gas elevation system did not work and the chair was always at the lower position (impossible to work or to type in a computer). 2024: Same issue with the same model chair. I think the chair model has a problem, and the hotel must ask the seller to replace them.
Wardrove was just fine for a few days. Neither drawers inside nor in the rest of the room. Just a little extra space with just one storage self in the space where the mini fridge should be.
Breakfast ok, closing at 10.00 except Saturdays and Sundays 11:00. At the latest minutes it run off of pastries and bread but the waiters took care of it. It is possible to order different kinds of eggs and freshly prepared porridge. 2024: same, some issues with our order were solved by Gloria.
Bar: expensive for the quantity poured into the glass I am afraid this is commonplace in Ireland. Some of the stools were dirty. We put them aside and told about that the waiters but they didn't pay much attention, nor did they clean them or move them from the place where we put them aside. 2024: better cleanliness. We saw the match Spain-England and ordered food. It was delicious.
In general, is a good place to stay for a long weekend. Well communicated by bus or LUAS (tram) at just 4 stops of the commercial heart of the city. It is close to some of the universities' halls of residence around. 2024: very convenient.
Taxi: 40€/45€ euros from/to the airport. Be aware that some drivers used to drive you around to increase de bill. This is very annoying when you are worrying when you are on a tight schedule. Use Freenow with a fixed rate. Ask for a direct drive through the Bridge or the Tunnel (extra toll fee of 3-5 euros). You can use the bus (#17) from the Airport (#16 from Candem Street to the Airport). Buy the Leap Card in the airport (Spar in T2, charging 1 additional euro this year 2024), or Wrights Airport Convenience Store, or WH Smith (T1 Arrivals)
(T1 Arrivals).
Some nice good restaurants and pubs (serving good food) around in Candem Street.
Very recomendable.",4,2024,07,18
224,Good place to stay and enjoy Dublin,"It was a good experience in Clayton hotel, with a confortable room. All services were really good but the breakfast was a really nice and great service, not only the food and coffee bu also the team. I would like to emphasie the help from Gloria, Gregorio and Alba during my stay",5,2024,07,16
224,"Great Hotel in Dublin, Ireland","Wonderful hotel with great service!  Ioana, Gloria and Gregorio went to special lengths at breakfast to make sure everyone was well served.
The rooms are comfortable and the wifi easy to use.  Shower was good water pressure with hot water and there is an ice machine on the 2nd and 4th floor.",5,2024,07,14
224,Amazing,"The staff were very friendly and helpful for all our needs. The food and drinks were well presented and tasted wonderful. Would definitely recommend to a friend. The hotel itself was in pristine condition and was spotless, Location of it was amazing not far from the Lucas line and just a short trip to the city centre",5,2024,07,10
224,Excellent Bar Food & Service,Both the bar food and staff were excellent. Highly recommend eating at the bar. They also had a lovely cocktail and mocktail menu which was very much enjoyed. They hotel is so central in dublin city as it is a less than a minute walk away from the luas line that brings you straight into the city. Ideal for a city break.,5,2024,07,09
224,Worthy of the 4 star rating!!,"We picked this hotel based on location.  It was a little pricey compared to other places we stayed on this trip but that is compared to Airbnbs so maybe not a fair comparison.  Generally we have found that hotels in cities with a lot of tourists, don't provide  a good value for the money but the Clayton Hotel was not the case.

The staff was all very professional and friendly.  The hotel is very clean and in great shape.  It clearly is very well taken care of.  The rooms are very nice with very comfortable beds, great lighting and a really nice bathroom.

The Charlemont location is extremely convenient to the green tram line which takes you right to the heart of Dublin's tourist center.  We did get a couple of cabs and they pick you up right at the hotel.

We wound up eating dinner on our last night in Ireland after spending a week of travel.  We ate at a lot of pubs.  We didn't expect the hotel's food to compare but it actually did.  It was very good and much better than expected.

I wouldn't hesitate to stay at this hotel again.",5,2024,07,08
224,Dreadful service,"Lovely hotel, however dreadful service.  We felt like an absolute inconvenience and the customer certainly is not king here.  Seems to be just profit driven (€350 per night for 1 star service).  Bar closed early, extremely limited parking which must be pre-booked at charged at €28 per night, closed off the buffet area while we were having breakfast so we couldn't access the coffee and buffet food sitting there...  This level of service would be ok in a 2 star hotel but at €350 per night, it feels like a rip off.  As for the night receptionist, he was so rude to everyone it was unbelievable.",2,2024,07,02
224,Nice hotel but the guest is only to be tolerated,"Having spent 8 nights here recently it was very clear that there is no hospitality here with guests being treated as an absolute inconvenience. From the bar being closed   prior to legal closing time, the inner doors to the coffee and buffet station being closed at 10.15am to guests already having breakfast, being asked to leave the breakfast room at 10.45am as they ""needed"" the restaurant yet hadn't even cleared our plates, and the ignorant gent on reception at night who grunted at you if you were lucky or swore at you when asking to have our car parked (pre-booked which seemed to really annoy him for some unknown reason). Paying well in excess of €300 per night to be treated with utter contempt should not be acceptable. The management (and indeed their owners/employers) should reflect on the contempt that they treat their ""guests"" with.  A very nice hotel, destroyed by terrible customer service.  The low level of customer service seems to be systemic and they certainly sucked any shred of hospitality out of this hotel.  Should the management be ""surprised"" by this review they are either oblivious or nurturing this contemptuous culture.",2,2024,07,02
224,Far enough from the crowds but close enough to walk to attractions,"Nice new hotel with comparable prices to older remodeled hotels. Helpful staff provides baggage storage, helpful directions, and dining suggestions. Right on the canal and near a pub with live music. Clean, well kept rooms as well as an excellent bar and restaurant. Excellent bakery nearby and ten to fifteen minute walk to downtown and some excellent wool shops.",4,2024,06,25
224,Disappointed,"The room was very stuffy and hot. The windows inside were very dirty, shower pole was broken and the shower head wouldn't stay in place. Sink was making strange noises snd the telephone didnt work properly so we were unable to phone reception or room service.

We came down to breakfast and were told as we haven't prebooked breakfast it would be 19 euro a head even though we were residents in the hotel. We then said we would leave it so the hotel missed out on us paying 30 euro for breakfast just because we hadn't prebooked. 

Overall, disappointed with our stay for the money it cost for 1 night ..",3,2024,06,23
224,Excellent Experiences,"We had a very nice Holiday here. The Kitchen is delicious. And Petru was mixing me the best Negronis. 🥹

224,Dublin. A wonderful city.,"Dublin. A wonderful city.
Dublin is much more than Temple Bar Street. There are many tourist atractions to visit: Castles,citadels,museums,Trinity College and Guinness Storehouse.

But I fell in love with houses and streets.
The town has elegant, neat houses,with beauftiful colored doors and nice decorated stairs.
Leged says that painting doors was done so that the men who came back at night from nearby bars could easily find their house.
Despite the cloudy weather,the city is cheerful and lively. Streets are clean and the means of transport are impeccable.
Also the ' irish temperament "" is universally acknowledged, people are calm and kind.

I stayed at Clayton Hotel on Charlemont Street.The four-star hotel is located in the heart of the city. You can walk to Trinity College or Temple Bar or cu can take a tram for 2-3 tram stops.
The hotel has a modern and stylish interior and generous spaces.It was recently renovated and has a pleasant fresh smell.
Rooms and bathrooms have generous dimensions; furniture is confortable and decorations are nice.
Hotel servs a good english breakfast. But what i really apreciated was that breakfast was served in the hotel restaurant and not in a closed room, without windows.
The restaurant has a glass wall toward the street and the Canal.It is a pleasure to drink cofee and look at the passers-by.
The hotel bar was well matched. The staff was very kind and helpful.
Tired of "" fish and chips"" we served a dinner at the hotel restaurant.
I especially want to thank mr. Petru,Antonio for his service and for his help and kindness. 

Dublin is a city worth visiting.
Thanks Dublin !
Thank you Clayton Hotel !",5,2024,06,05

224,Nice hotel in a sad city,"Very nice hotel near the Porto bello section of Dublin.
Hotel is clean, great service, and helpful with all accommodations.
I liked Dublin as a city but won’t return because they are anti semitic and make Jewish people feel unsafe for no reason. No one knows my political or religious views but for some reason you mention the word Jew and it’s like the third Reich all over again. Still don’t understand the issue in the city. History repeats itself I guess.",5,2024,04,22

224,Simply great,"Stayed for five nights. The room (double & single) looked lovely and was kept clean and tidy.

The staff were friendly and useful.

The breakfast selection was fantastic with loads to eat even for vegetarians like us. And we also tried the dinner on two occasions and it didn’t disappoint.

Location wise, there are more central places alright but Clayton Charlemont is only 10 minutes walk or so from Stephen’s Green (or you can take the luas, ie the tram for two stops) and it situated near Ranelagh, which is a quiet and lovely place on its own.

All in all, an excellent choice of it’s within your budget.",5,2024,04,07

224,"The Clayton Hotel in Charlemont, Dublin.","Cannot fault the service at the Clayton - it was outstanding. The food was fresh and delicious but it was the particular attention to detail that was displayed by the Bar and Restaurant Manager Razvan Grigoras that elevated our stay to exemplary. The barman Petru had a particular gift for cocktail making (see the image of the Charlemont Sour) and on the menu are his own original creations. Shout out to Cian, whose friendly manner and own skill with making a Classic Whiskey Sour will be remembered. 
Oh and the rooms themselves were spacious and comfy and the hotel is located very close to the tram that takes you on a 5 minute journey into town.",5,2024,03,29

Fantastic location just up the road from the tram. THE place to stay in Dublin.",5,2023,12,29
224,Best service ever!! ," My boyfriend and I stayed at your hotel over the weekend, and decided to dine with yourselves on our stay. The food was deliciously tasty.. and can’t forget how nice the cocktails were too! After our food we were asked if we’d like dessert and personally I’m a sucker for sticky toffee pudding, which I was saddened to hear wasn’t on the menu until… our server Razvan came out and told me the chef was going to make me up one special! I’ve never had service like it! I 100% will be staying again! Everything was perfect… so Thankyou kindly",5,2023,12,18

224,"2nd stay, Clean, Modern, Classy.","Our 2nd stay whilst visiting friends / Family in Dublin. Hotel is very beautiful from the outside and local to everywhere you may need to go. Only a 15min walk to the city centre & also a Luas( Tram stop) across the road means access anywhere in Dublin is on your doorstep. 

Hotel staff are very welcoming and attentive , always greeted with a smile which is nice, it creates a nice atmosphere.  Reception / dining area are spotless and very well kept. Food in the Restaurant is of a good standard, always enjoyable and hot. 
Drinks are very well priced and they have a great selection of cocktails / beers etc.

We had a room overlooking the canal, which was modern, spacious and generous in size. Beds were very comfortable and no outside noise, which was great. Shower was also hot and powerful enough, unlike most showers in hotels. All in all a great relaxing stay again and I’m sure we will be back soon when visiting.",5,2023,11,27

224,A Warm Welcome!,"I've been a regular business visitor to the Clayton Hotel Charlemont since its opening. As I move close to retirement, I wish to not alone acknowledge the consistency of the excellent facilities and service that the hotel has provided over the years, but to particularly thank the kind people who have always warmly welcomed me over the years and have provided a beautiful home away from home experience in a wonderful central location of Dublin with beautiful rooms, a superb breakfast  buffet, lunch and dinner overlooking a wonderful view of the Grand Canal. The Charlemont is in an ideal location which offers a reasonable walking distance to the City Centre and a LUAS (Tram) stop a step away for trips further a field. To top it off, the Clayton Charlemont Hotel is also surrounded by many old Dublin pubs, trendy restaurants and cafe's serving excellent teas and coffees, too numerous to mention. 
To conclude, may I sincerely thank Carl, Eduardo, Nikola and Phamella for the many warm welcomes at Reception, to Ioana and to Carmel who in particular has always looked after me like a big sister at Breakfast and to Razvan, Cian, Frank and Petru who have always greeted me with a smile along kind words while dining in the evening.

We were celebrating birthdays and found lovely card and chocolates waiting. The room was comfortable and clean with a tv that can connect to your own netflix which is nice if you’re getting ready ect. The bar… absolutely amazing, Petru is probably THE single best bar man i have ever seen. Cocktails were incredible and catered for our needs. Petru was so helpful with recommendations for places to eat and drink and all round one of the best additions to the hotel, he went above and beyond just the ‘bar man’ and really was just amazing and his skill set was spectacular, he really is an artist. Superb service provided 24/7. Thank you for our stay, you made Dublin even more enjoyable! x",5,2023,11,11

224,"Overpriced ""luxury"" hotel","Rooms are overpriced for what it is (comfy but bed smaller than 180 which is standard for luxuous hotels), good location though 10 min walk from St Stephen's Green. Book your parking place in advance if you're going by car as those are very limited. Difficult to reach rooms if you're disabled, lots of stairs. Not worth the price. The stars are for the location ",3,2023,11,01
224,"Comfortable, great staff","Our 5-night stay at Clayton Hotel Charlemont was an excellent base for our first visit to Dublin.  The hotel is located within easy walking - or Luas tram - distance of Stephen’s Green and the main shopping district and Dublin landmarks south of the River Liffey.  There were also interesting cafes, restaurants and pubs in the surrounding streets and neighbourhood.

The hotel is very comfortable with a restaurant and bar.  We ate at the restaurant twice and thought that both meals were some of the best food we’d eaten in Dublin.  There’s a lovely bar too and if you’re lucky Oliver will mix your cocktail!  Thanks too to Frank and Petru for their professional, friendly service.

Check-in and check-out were easy and quick.  We had a number of small requests during our stay (power adapters, additional milk and tea) which were fulfilled quickly and efficiently.  Thanks to Arnaldo and the team at reception.

Our room was very comfortable and it was a bonus to be able to open a window.  The black out drapes were very effective, the bed and pillows excellent and the bathroom towels and toiletries of good quality.  

The only disappointment with our stay relates to housekeeping.  On two mornings we left the hotel very early (before 9am) leaving the ‘please make up our room’ sign out.  When we returned, ready to rest from long days out, it was disappointing to find that our room had not been serviced.  On both occasions the room wasn’t done until late in the afternoon after we’d made a request.  On these occasions the service felt slapdash with towels - left in the bathtub - not replaced and supplies not replenished.",4,2023,11,01
224,I Recommend Clayton Hotel,"I stayed in the Clayton hotel for the Dublin marathon and it was a good place to go back to after the long run! It wasn't my plan originally but I'm glad I ended up there. We arrived at a really busy time but Christina at reception was friendly and helpful despite that, she was considerate with our requests and answered all our questions with courtesy and patience. The breakfast staff were also friendly and the food was nice. The hotel itself is just a standard hotel, nothing remarkable, it is close enough to the city and the area is quiet. I recommend going here.",4,2023,10,31
224,Nice stay,"Actually, 4 1/2  stars, just a couple quibbles. 

The good: 
Real nice spacious rooms, fabulous breakfast buffet, and the dinner menu’s  good too. 
Where did all these lovely people come from? They’re just doing the job, but these are genuinely friendly people. Reception ( Alonzo/Adolpho?), the older petite blonde server at breakfast,  the young bartender, Frank the night waiter - would have loved to just sit and chat with any of these people for a couple hours! 

The not so much:
1) horrible pillows. Same thing at the Airport Clayton. Neck aches the next morning. 
2) what’s with the “music” in the dining room? Much too classy a hotel for these techno-synth-digital-AI robot sounds. Absolutely awful stuff. Can’t hear it too much at breakfast (patrons talking) but one dinner was too much for us. How about some mellow Irish music/classical strings/quiet jazz?

224,Pleasant overnight stay,"I spent one night at the Clayton Charlemont - it was very nice. My room was in the older (front) part of the hotel, which was nicely fitted, overlooked the street so something to watch. I didn't notice any noise pollution overnight so slept like a baby.
Staff were really helpful and friendly. Unfortunately I couldn't stay for breakfast so I really appreciated the 'go' bags and coffee cups to go which I grabbed before leaving. Overall, really pleasant stay. I would definitely stay again.",5,2023,10,12
224,Average at best ,"The hotel is very aesthetically pleasing, the room was spacious and comfortable. The service however, was very poor.

We left a review with the hotel directly and then received an email from the assistant general manager asking for more details. 

-----------------------------

Dear XXXXX,

Thank you for getting back to us following our stay and our feedback.

Ultimately, we were disappointed. For the cost of the hotel, and for a hotel of Clayton's standing within the industry, we expected better.

The initial booking process was difficult - your website, which I appreciate may be outside of your control, would not accept our booking. We then called and whomever we spoke to on the phone was also unable to process our booking, with little to no explanation. We persisted online and were able to finally book.

The room itself was spacious, and comfortable, but the fact that there were two us staying in the room and yet on each day there was only one coffee cup is a small attention to detail that shouldn't have to be raised.

The room is cleaned every day and re-stocked with basic amenities, and the fact that we had to ask (more than once) for toilet paper to be re-stocked is another attention to detail that one does not expect to have to raise when staying at a Hotel of Clayton's calibre.

Granted the towels we were given were clearly fresh and laundered, but the stains were glaringly obvious and not hidden in the folds. Which staff member thought it would be acceptable to put that in a guest's room? Again, something we had to raise with your front desk staff.

Not being told there are further options at breakfast, again is a small detail but your staff escorted us to a table each morning, and this would have been a prime opportunity to simply say, these are the options and please ask if you need any further information. We felt more like a burden than guests.

This stay was a part of our honeymoon, and we didn't expect any special treatment, but everything I have listed above I believe to be basic and not issues one should have to raise. 

It is not for me to tell you how to run your hotel, but it is also clear to me as a customer that your staff need be brought to attention on certain matters. While my wife and I have raised these concerns, one could consider that other guests may have had a similar experience but would stay quiet, so as not to rattle any cages.

For me, it is the small details that make the most difference and that would encourage me to stay at a Clayton hotel again. I travel a lot for work and the opportunity to use Clayton's facilities across the UK is one I would hesitate to consider given our experience in Dublin.

Kind regards

-----------------------------

The response we received was underwhelming at best.

Suffice to say, we wouldn't choose to stay here again and can only hope that other Clayton Hotels offer a better experience.",2,2023,10,12
224,Beautiful hotel,"We only stayed one night here on a short trip to Dublin but we really enjoyed this hotel. It’s very modern and the atmosphere and the staff in the bar area were really nice. The room was great, not massive, but all you would want and quite luxurious. It’s near the a tram stop for transport to Grafton Street and only a short walk from nice restaurants.",5,2023,10,08
224,A pleasant place to stay ,"We have just had two nights here and we’re looked after well.
Room was very spacious with an extra single bed, great wifi and bathroom.
Great towels and water pressure was good in the shower which is not always the case 
Breakfasts and dinner was enjoyable with good choice.
Plenty of different areas to seat downstairs which is good for catching up with other guests.
All in all we have enjoyed our stay .",4,2023,09,29
224,Overall very good week long stay,"The staff at this location worked hard to make things nice. Our bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. Everyone was very friendly and helpful, especially in the restaurant and bar area. We had exceptional and friendly service at breakfast every day and dinner on the nights we ate at the hotel. A special shout out and thank you to Cian, Eduardo, Oliver, Frank, Yasmin and Pet",5,2023,09,26
224,Bar tenders,"The bar tenders Oliver and Cian were fantastic. They were super nice, polite and accommodating making cocktails that they were not familiar with. So nice to meet people from a different country that are so friendly.",5,2023,09,17
224,Excellent stay in Dublin,"Reception, bar, restaurant , land maintenance staff made our Notre Dame/Navy football stay enjoyable and worry free. After arriving from our flight, I realized my suitcase was locked/jammed from a TSA check in NY and left me with no option to open my new suitcase without destroying the zipper. I spoke with the front desk and they called up super star Lee, who works in maintenance, and he was able to pop it open without destroying the suitcase in minutes! This put my trip back on track after a long travel day. Also, special shout out to the bar/lounge staff who were more than accommodating and made our 3 night stay fun and enjoyable. Hotel is well located to all the main sites in Dublin and staff could not have been nicer.",5,2023,09,07
224,Good choice away from the noise.,"Great neighbourhood on the canal but only a few minutes walk to all the main sights. Helpful and friendly staff, and good buffet breakfast plus eggs and porridge to order. Clean and comfortable room, although the ventilation was a bit weak.",5,2023,09,04
224,Good place to stay in Dublin ,"The hotel's location is great, right beside the cannel, walking distance to all the major attractions, especially 5 min walking to Camden street which full of restaurants and cafes. The room was clean, little tight for 3 of us but manageable. We had to pay for the breakfast, however with a discount, but was super good. We didn't need meals until dinner with all day walking around. The staff was friendly and efficient. When we asked for extra towels, they sent to our room within 5 minutes.",4,2023,09,03
224,Attentive bar staff!,"The bar staff is simply the best! Eduardo was fantastic, welcoming and friendly.
They've made my experience at the hotel truly enjoyable. I'll be looking forward to visiting again soon. Many thanks!!!",5,2023,08,31
224,Comfort and Amazing Service - Yasmin was the absolute best!,"I had the best experience at the Clayton Charlemont. I really liked the staff, especially Yasmin. It's always daunting traveling solo but when you meet someone like Yasmin who comes across like a real friend, it's easy to feel at home. She was attentive, gave honest recommendations and so much fun in general.
The hotel offered the amenities and perks of the big hotels but the comfort and attention of your local mom and pop. I can honestly say that the staff at Clayton charlemont made me fall in love with Dublin.",5,2023,08,29
224,Clayton Charlemont is small but comfortable!,"Overall the hotel was good but small rooms.  However,  breakfast was sub-par.  The only complaint is that they don’t provide extra towels, even when we asked for them.  It was convenient to St. Stephen’s if you want to walk as well as Grafton Street.",4,2023,08,28
224,Wonderful Stay!,"My family stayed in this lovely, well-located hotel for two nights at the beginning of our Ireland trip. Upon entering, were immediately welcomed by Saulo at the front desk who, though we were quite early for our check-in, graciously made our rooms available to us. Our rooms were spacious and clean, with complimentary WB Yeats Irish water. After getting settled, we enjoyed coffee in the well-appointed lobby (which also has a well-stocked bar) before heading out for the day. The hotel is on the quiet Grand Canal, a short walk from many popular attractions such as St. Stephen’s Green Park, Trinity College, Dublin Castle, Grafton Street (great shopping) and Temple Bar. Breakfast, served in the attractive lobby restaurant, boasts an impressive buffet of traditional hot dishes, pastries, cereals, fruit, juices, and has a large Franke machine that serves every coffee drink you can imagine. On our last day, the wonderful Saulo came to our rescue and stored our luggage for a few hours before we departed. We loved our time at this property and will be back!",5,2023,08,24
224,Thank you Petru,"I had dinner here with my aunts, because they were staying here as guests. The waiters were so lovely and professional, the service was really impeccable. Petru in particular was so amazing, very attentive and polite. I couldnt speak more highly about the staff working at the bar/restaurant here.",5,2023,08,23
224,Don't hesitate,Fantastic hotel. Amazing location on the canal. Close to shopping. Quiet. Excellent lobby with a bar that serves wonderful drinks. Good breakfast. Clean and great air conditioning in rooms. Don't hesitate to book. ,5,2023,08,18
224,Best service & cocktails!,"After a long trip in from the USA, we went out sightseeing during the day & wanted to get back to the hotel to relax. We went to the bar where we were waited on @ the Lockside bar by the lovely and funny Petru & Cian. Best service & cocktails our entire time in Ireland! Flamingo cocktail crafted by Petru is amazing! Thank you! We should have bought you both flowers ;)",5,2023,08,13
224,Great stay at Clayton Charlemont,"Well appointed hotel next to the canal and also a nice pub!
Breakfast was brilliant here- very good and lots of options.
Wanted to especially recognize Laura (Cordero?) at the reception-  Laura went out of her way to ensure my reservation, room, and breakfast were all in order.",5,2023,08,13
224,confining rooms in business like hotel,"Check-in waiting time was long, since short staffed. Meanwhile, the phone rang at the reception desk, never answered by the attending staff.
Rooms were extremely confining, with no space to place clothing. Also since the premise was covered by carpet, made it challenging to deal with allergies, given dust, etc,
Likely touted for business people, but would not recommend to the average tourist.
Location, not too far from dining and shopping areas, 
Breakfast was not too bad, but I would be biased to comment since tired of the same kind of food! Definitely, Ireland is not the ideal place for foodies!",3,2023,08,10
224,Great service and experience,"Great hotel and excellent service. My brother and sister in law stayed at Clayton some weeks ago, and because of their newborn baby, we choose to have lunch at the hotel. Besides the great food, Eduardo, our waiter, was very polite and helpful through the whole time we had been there.",5,2023,08,07
224,Great hotel for a few days in the city!,"We had a short stay in the Clayton but it was a very lovely stay. The reception staff were friendly and accommodating, the room was as described and had plenty of room for the two of us. Great location to the city centre with a short tram journey away and has lots of convenience stores nearby. The only con we have, is that when we first entered the room, the bathroom had a very strong cigarette smell as if someone was trying not to set off any smoke alarms😂 this didn’t bother us too much as we opened all the windows. Would definitely stay here again! Thank you",4,2023,08,04
224,Reception,"Very desappointed how the receptionnist RIcardo talk to us, its not à way to talk to the guests. I will not recommand this hôtel for anyone, select an other there is many on this town. Also choose an other place to park",1,2023,07,31
224,Great hotel,"Nice hotel. Great quiet location right across the channel with lovely hiking trail. Check-in was fast no issues. Room was decent size, clean and modern. Bedding, pillows was top notch. Lobby is lovely very warm and welcoming. The only bad thing was that 1. We didn't have espresso machine in our room so we had to run to reception, service staff etc. and beg for it. (It appears that only some rooms have them and others that are not that lucky don't). There was a kettle in the room (which is great!) but only instant coffee which is totally gross in Ireland's 4 star hotel. And we didn't have any tea !!! This if bad please fix this hotel people !!! 
Breakfast is really amazing ! Great selection of food , nice coffee maker and very nice atmosphere.  We have this hotel 5 star hoping they will fix in-room coffee and tea issues. Thanks.",5,2023,07,24
224,Super helpful reception!,We had an amazing experience at the hotel. It started with Saulo who greated us with a smile. He made us feel at home and was super helpful. We are coming back in 4 days for another 3-night stay and cannot wait.,5,2023,07,24
224,Good spot,"A reasonably priced hotel for Dublin, not too far from the heart of the city. Hotel is quiet and don't love the steps up to reception, there is a wheelchair lift though if you are brave enough to use. 
Rooms are very clean and tidy. I found the bed comfortable. The staff on reception are very helpful. Breakfast is okay, decent selection. Already booked my next stay",4,2023,07,21
224,Poorest reception experience ever,"Consistently poor and inflexible reception experience during the whole stay. Staff has an attitude of simply not caring about their job at all and seems to would prefer not to having to serve people. 

When adressed to them - one service-oriented employee overheard and tried to help. 

Not recommended for business travellers who value modern checking in/out experience.

Not recommend to travellers who care about design - nothing will appeal to you here.",2,2023,07,19
224,Cozy Hotel,"We liked this hotel very much. The rooms were comfortable and had air conditioning. We were in the heart of Dublin, a great location for many things. We stayed there twice: at the beginning of our trip and at the end of our trip.The staff was very friendly and helpful. They had a wonderful breakfast selection.",5,2023,07,19
224,Great Hotel! Highly Recommended.,"The staff at this hotel is extremely helpful and accommodating. Their service level was at the top. Arnaldo checked us in and provided good and specific assistance. I can't more highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good place to stay in Dublin. The room was comfortable, the service level was exemplary, and housekeeping was on point.",5,2023,07,18
224,Very helpful staff and good location,"My husband,daughter, and I stayed at the Clayton Charlemont for 2 nights.  We were greated by the nicest young man, Armando (?) who helped us get settled with our luggage. He was so pleasant and helpful.
Our room was good sized for the three us. Beds were comfy and the room looked out on a beautiful canal. It was located within walking distance of almost all of the sights of Dublin. The bonus for me and my daughter was delicious coffee and bar. We were able to relax in the morning with coffee and at night with a cocktail.
Kudos to the front desk for checking to see if my lost phone was in the room. He called my daughter right back and said that he couldn't find it (it's still in Dublin!).",5,2023,07,13
224,Wonderful hotel in the heart of the city,Excellent stay..so close to the city..staff & food were wonderful. The bedrooms are modern and spacious with great views for a city centre hotel. Gaudens restaurant has a beautiful view of the canal and is right in the heart of the city…5 mins walk to the lively Camden Street…could not recommend enough.,5,2023,07,12
224,"Excellent Staff , the way a hotel should be run","From check in to night staff to the most loveliest staff at breakfast service , I  had a really enjoyable stay at this hotel. Only a 5 min walk to the Luas line or a 10-15 min walk to  St Stephen’s Green, it is located very well to the city Centre .We had booked it  for a concert in  Iveagh Gardens but I would  def return to this hotel for future visits to Dublin . Breakfast was first class, such lovely , friendly staff who have a bit of a chat with you and that is so missing from some hotels . Room spotless . A very pleasant  stay and good value for money . ",5,2023,07,10
224,Very clean and cosy. Highly recommend this hotel to anyone,"I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is particular about cleanliness. My hotel room was spotless and very comfortable . When me and my husband arrived we were greeted with a warm and welcoming member of staff called Arnaldo. He was very helpful and even managed to get us an early check in! In fact, all the staff were helpful and kind. If we are ever in Dublin again we would stay no where else other than here.",5,2023,07,09
224,Clayton Hotel Charlemont,"Well appointed hotel, with really helpful and friendly staff, the meals - particularly the buffet breakfast are outstanding. Only a 15-20 minute walk to the centre of Dublin City. Convenient little grocery store and laundromat just across the street with a very nice Irish pub next door that also offers exceptional pub meals with a great friendly atmosphere. A special mention to Lidi, on the Reception desk, who went our of his way to make us feel personally welcomed and cared for as if we were long lost friends!! Also staff member Conor who served at the bar, was not only friendly and welcoming but has the skill of a master barista, if possible ask for him personally to make you the best coffee you could ever hope to enjoy!",5,2023,07,08
224,Flamingo signature cocktail,"Highlight of our trip were the cocktails and mocktails from bar overlooking the canal.  Loved the signature cocktails created by the charming Petru, especially the Flamingo.  Both cocktails and mocktails were beautifully presented; what a treat.  This cocktail bar is a hidden gem which made our weekend extra special.",5,2023,07,06
224,"We had a fantastic stay with friendly staff,","Friends had suggested many other hotels that were in the “perfect location” of the city. However, for our trip this was the best place. It was only a few minutes walk away from all the attractions we wanted to see, a two minute walk to the Luas, had good restaurants nearby, was on the grand canal, and had Tesco Express two minutes away (which proved to be a life-saver on many occasions). 

After a long day of running around the city, it was nice to come back home to a quieter part of the city and grab a pint at The Barge next door. 

The front desk and staff were also extremely kind and accommodating. We had such an amazing and relaxing stay here — we would return in a heartbeat.",5,2023,07,04
224,Wonderful stay!,"We loved our stay at the Clayton Hotel in Charlemont. The attendant, Glen, was so sweet and looked after my family very well. He was also very friendly, approachable, and knowledgeable. Every morning we were greeted by Glen, and he ensured we received the best service. The hotel is a very busy hotel, but despite this, the hardworking attendant made sure to look after us while also keeping the wide variety of selections on the breakfast buffet fresh and presentable. We asked the attendants to share our compliments on Glen with his manager, and we would appreciate it if you could ensure his manager received our compliments. The family will miss Glen very much💔, and we wish him well in his career. Hopefully we will see him our next trip to Ireland🇮🇪☘️.

Evelyn and Family.",5,2023,07,02
224,Fabulous  cocktails,Bartenders were fantastic and drinks were amazing! Lovely experience! Would recommend solero and espresso martini! The bar decor is relaxing and is such a great place for a pre evening cocktail! Very chill vibes,5,2023,06,30
224,"Brilliant professional, at Clayton Hotel Charlemont.","My name is Leonardo.
My husband and I stayed at the Clayton Hotel Charlemont/Dublin in June/2023. The hotel is very good, but I would like to highlight the service provided by the employee ""Helen"", who works at breakfast. Every time we were there, she served us very well, always very agile, with a beautiful smile and always available to help all customers.
Thank you Helen, your service made the difference in our mornings.",5,2023,06,28
224,Bar Petru,"Had the best espresso martini I’ve ever had. Razvan is an exceptional bartending, making classics to perfection. Just a few steps away from your room, must come to get a craft cocktail or a fine Guinness pour! ",5,2023,06,16
224,Lovely hotel in Dublin,"Fantstic Hotel in a the very convenint loction, Walking dstance to most places, and public trasport in also available.
I had great experience. Service was friendly , rooms has everything i needed, food delicsious, and contails are just fenomenal. I ould highly recomend thiss hotel in Dublin.",5,2023,06,14
224,Rude and condescending staff - extremely disapointed,"The staff was condescendent and rude. Whenever we asked a question at the front desk, we got half answers with an attitude. Like we are bothering them. One front desk gentleman from the evening/ night shift was especially rude.

1- We were travelling with a 2 year old (which was stated in the reservation) and got a room without a bath. Only a big shower. I asked if we could switch rooms and the answer was always no. The sink was too shallow to bathe the toddler so we had to wash our daughter with a washcloth for 4 days...

2- Having an early flight back to Canada, the night before our departure, I asked for a wake up call. The next morning, the phone never rang. Thankfully, I had set my alarm just in case. I went downstairs to get a coffee, ask for a taxi and inquire about the wake up call. The front desk employee very very rudely replied: yeah we called.. then muttered something. I asked him if he could repeat it. He yelled something back (still couldn't understand) so I replied there was no need to be rude nor upset. I should be the one upset. He them walked away and closed the door (back office behind the front desk)

3- Since he walked away, I couldn't ask for a taxi so I went back to my room. Reluctantly, I called the front desk and asked for a taxi as soon as possible. They said ok. With no time to waste, we went downstairs and waited. After 10 minutes, I enquired about the taxi and the clerk said they didn't call. So we had to wait another 10 minutes after he actually called the taxi company..

My stay in Ireland was incredibly delightful except from the Clayton Hotel Charlemont experience. I strongly advise against staying at this hotel.

224,Great stay,"Really lovely stay in this hotel, we had an executive room and it was very nice with a huge bathroom and great shower. The breakfast was delicious, love that there was a selection of porridge and you could get omelettes etc made to order. Chia pudding was very nice too. Staff very friendly and hotel itself is very nice. We would stay again",5,2023,05,25
224,Frank review,This is a review for Frank - he has been amazing throughout the stay. Service is great and very friendly. Above and beyond to ask us direct how our food was and enquire about our travel plans. All of this done in the best and most welcoming way possible. Frank is great!,5,2023,05,20
224,"Excellent, pleasant and relaxing hotel",Excellent hotel in every way - friendly pleasant staff; large relaxing lounge/reception area with a nice ambience; good rooms with comfortable beds; excellent breakfast buffet; convenient nearby transport links (Luas) into city centre which is also walkable in about 15-20 minutes. I can highly recommend this hotel for any Dublin visit.,5,2023,05,19
224,Great Location and Bar!,"Great hotel! Fun and friendly bar! Great location in Dublin. We had dinner one night and the food was very good. We had too-notch service from Petru, the bartender! He makes an awesome Manhattan and had great suggestions for other cocktails to try. It was a wonderful stay and we will come back!",5,2023,05,13
224,A perfect stay,Stayed for 5 nights. Hotel is very nice and rooms clean and modern. Restarant serves great food and the breakfast is extensive and very very nice. The bar serves some of the best cocktails and the staff is so friendly and helpfull. Location is 15 min. Walk from st. Stephens Green but also offers a nice walk along the canal.,5,2023,05,10
224,"Come for the food, stay for the staff ",Lovely food in the restaurant and great bar staff. Myself and my girlfriend have frequently come in the hotel for some pints or to enjoy their food. It's all great quality and the staff really make you feel like they want to help.,5,2023,04,19
224,Friendly Staff ,I had a Fantastic experience at the hotel visiting dublin for a gig. The management and staff really made my stay with excellent service and accommodation - the hotel is ideally located 😀 The rooms are a decent size and the hotel in general is kept very neat and tidy. ,5,2023,04,18
224,Best Breakfast,"I recently stayed here with my daughter's while visiting family who live in Dublin. My daughter had stayed here before & highly recommended it. A lovely stylish & relaxing hotel.  A fantastic buffet breakfast with all you could wish for. A lovely lady who was clearing the breakfast buffet after we had finished breakfast couldn't have been more friendly & helpful, many thanks. 
Sadly we found the reception staff not so welcoming. A friendly 'hello' would have been nice sometimes during our stay!",4,2023,04,16
224,Fantastic Breakfast ,Glen at the breakfast was fantastic. As soon as we needed something we had it!  Very knowledgeable and was very helpful with our dietary requirements. Varied options at breakfast buffet exactly what you need to start the day! Great attention to detail.,4,2023,04,09
224,The Most Expensive Tastless Food in Dublin,"Don't expect good food here 
Really bad menu selection
Expensive cheap to produce rip off
3 burgers and a few chips (no side salad - plate half empty) €66
3 Small slices of cheese cake €28.50
Add 3 coke - Total €102
On the plus side the staff were polite and friendly
",1,2023,04,07
224,"Good location, nice place to stay","Pleasant location along canal and a 15 min walk to Grafton St shopping or St Stevens Green park. Lovely, clean well serviced room except that it had no bathroom toiletries except shower gel: no shampoo, conditioner body cream. For a modern hotel, I found this odd. Despite that minor matter, I enjoyed my stay.  Very helpful, friendly staff, nice places to sit in lobby with a good coffee bar and a pretty good restaurant
 ",4,2023,04,01
224,Highly recommend,"Definitely try the breakfast, plenty choice and lovely service from Javier and Ana. Rooms are always clean and modern. Location of the hotel is perfect to walk to the city centre and reception staff also very helpful, especially Oriol who gave me plenty tips of places to go to visit and how to get to them",5,2023,03,28
224,Beautiful hotel!,"My boyfriend and I booked a two-night stay at this stunning hotel for my birthday, which was made even more memorable by the incredibly friendly staff. The overall experience was nothing short of amazing & we would definitely return in the future.

While waiting for our room to be prepared, we grabbed ourselves to some delicious drinks at the bar which is located in the lobby. It was a fantastic way to relax after travelling and passed the time quickly! 

Upon arrival at our room, we were delighted to find it not only spotlessly clean, but also incredibly spacious. The bed was especially comfortable which was much needed after a busy day of sightseeing & travelling! The room had an amazing air con system which was easily controlled & something I find important when staying at a hotel. There was also plenty of plug sockets dotted around the room. We both looked forward to returning to the hotel each day which is always a bonus. This was definitely one of the best rooms I’ve stayed in:)

We went down for breakfast each morning which cost us €18 each, it was definitely worth it! There was a good selection of food, which was of great quality. The restaurant was also very clean & pleasant!

When checking out, the lady behind reception kindly booked us a taxi & let us know once it had arrived. A little touch but it was greatly appreciated!

Overall a lovely stay here, cannot fault the place. I would highly recommend & would definitely stay here again when in Dublin!!",5,2023,03,28
224,Great experience ,"Great location near many public transport routes, The hotel is very modern and clean and the restaurant had a great atmosphere as it was very busy. Glen and Javier from the restaurant and Ana from reception were very helpful. ",5,2023,03,20
224,Weekend away with friends ,"My husband and I had the absolute pleasure of spending last Friday and Saturday night at this hotel. We were joined by two other couples on Saturday night.

From the moment we arrived, check-in, valet parking, room, bar service, restaurant food and service to our check-out; everything was fabulous.

The friendliness, helpfulness and professionalism shown to us by your staff was second to none. As people who regularly use hotels for work & pleasure, we had noticed that the ""attention to detail"", doesn't seem to be a priority any more.

At Clayton Charlemont, attention to detail and customer service seemed to be the PRIMARY focus. Thank you for a beautiful stay and we will definitely return.
",4,2023,03,14
224,Great place and great People!,"We were there for a friend's weekend and was great!
The hotel is really confy and the stuff amazing. Special mention to the lovely spanish team overthere: Javier for breakfast, Ana, Miguel at the recepción... You are doing well! 😄
I will back to Clayton Charlemont if I stay in Dublin one again for sure!",5,2023,03,13
224,Fantastic Breakfast,"Glen and Carmel were lovely at the breakfast and really went above and beyond. Made our group feel very welcome, which was really appreciated. The food was also fantastic! 

Hopefully we will be back soon!",5,2023,03,11
224,Dublin trip,"Firstly, the location of the hotel is great, only a short walk away to the tram and into the city centre. 

The room was clean and a good size, with the most comfortable beds! Slightly surprised to see our room wasn’t serviced when we came back by 3pm (even though we requested it). The housekeeping manager was great getting us extra things we needed.

We were let down by the receptionists. When we arrived to check-in there were five receptionists available and not one greeted us, not the best first impression. Everything else was great with the hotel.",4,2023,03,06
224,Clean and comfortable,Lovely stay at the Clayton. I have visited Dublin before and wanted to try staying in a different area this time and the reviews here encouraged me to try the Clayton Charlemont. My husband and i had a lovely stay in a large king room. Compared to other hotels we were looking at between the Clayton and others the Clayton had large rooms and they certainly were when we saw them in person.  Also large separate bath tub! My husband and i spent a few nights downstairs in the lobby enjoying a cocktail before dinner or a cappuccino after dinner and Everyone we interacted with was very pleasant. Only downfall was the walk to all the main areas was about 20 minutes each way (walking). I wanted to be outside the hustle and bustle which was nice but it was a bit far. Overall nice stay. Clean and comfortable what more could you ask for.,4,2023,03,02
224,Exceptional,I could not speak more highly about this hotel! My fiance and I stayed here for 2 nights and were greeted with some of the best customer service. Everything was outstanding. Hotel is very clean as well as rooms and restaurant.,5,2023,03,01
224,"Amazing Birthday trip, I wouldn't change a thing!","I had an absolutely amazing stay at this hotel which was unmatched in terms of convenience and comfort in the heart of Dublin. Conor Staines, the beverage manager was lovely enough to make the room birthday ready for me and I was greeted by a wonderful macaron spread and some prosecco (both seriously delicious and a great surprise to come into)! The staff were so kind and friendly, but I have to sing some praises for Petru, who made me one of the best cocktails I've ever had. The room was beautiful, and I couldn't ask for a better place to stay during my first visit to Dublin. Thank you so much for making it such a memorable experience!",5,2023,03,01
224,Lovely hotel & food. Convenient to city centre. Definitely worth a visit!,Beautiful hotel. Spotlessly clean. Luas stop directly across the road so very convenient for city centre access! Restaurant was super. Food was delicious and the service was excellent. Very well looked after. We were celebrating my mothers 70th & she thoroughly enjoyed! Highly recommend the cocktails 😉,5,2023,02,06
224,Great hotel and staff,Fantastic stay here for a weekend break with friends. Staff were very friendly.. especially Petru and Amy who made us feel very welcome. Cocktails at the hotel bar were excellent.. the Old Fashioned and Cosmo were the best we've had. Great location for getting about Dublin. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to all.,5,2023,02,05
224,people make places great.,"Great restaurant experience. Staff are friendly, attentive and so professional and most of all very human and so interactive with the children (8 the boss) 9 and 10, they love this hotel.( you cannot fool kids:)
All the above and great food and value for your spend, the chef knows how to prepare and present food to a very good standard and you really enjoy eating it.
Kids menu is great value and the portions satisfy them, so happy days for all.
Razvan and his team are fantastically nice people, every one of them,
It was our 3rd visit and the same consistency every time.   If only everything operated as well as the team at Clayton Charlemont .",5,2023,01,30

224,Wonderful staff and great breakfast! ,"This is a long overdue review.   We stayed 3 nights at this hotel and had a very enjoyable stay.  The front desk staff were friendly and helpful.  We were fortunate to get an early check in as we arrived in Dublin in the early morning.  The lobby was well appointed with comfortable seating.  Our room was good size and the beds very comfortable.  Great shower.  I have to say that the breakfast buffet was elaborate and sumptuous.  There were so many choices from hot items to delicious pastry. The staff in the dining room worked very hard constantly making sure everything was full, clearing tables, and seating people.  The location was great.  It was a good walk to the center of town or you could take a short walk to the tram/train.  I would highly recommend and would stay there again should my travels bring me to Dublin.  ",5,2023,01,23

224,Unwelcoming and Rude Bar Staff including Duty Manager,"The staff members particularly the Bar Manager Razvan and the Duty Manager Dino are unwelcoming and arrogant towards the customers. We were here for a long stay and the staff members lacked basic courtesy and were uncooperative for most of the times. We had to cancel the bookings midway and move to another hotel. It’s a new hotel and hopefully if the staff members do not improve their behaviour soon, clients will keep this as their last choice. The management needs to look at erring staff members who need to be trained and groomed better.",1,2022,12,11
224,Breakfast,"Google Review:

224,"Fantastic service, great stay.","Carl - big shout out for exemplifying luxury hospitality and great customer service.

Not only did he take great of me but as I was working in the hotel lobby for much of the day I also observed that I wasn’t just lucky to get special treatment - he delivered special treatment to every individual, that is to say a top-notch experience.

The 4th floor room with view over the canal towards the rolling countryside definitely a great way to wake-up.

Breakfast was well stocked with option for freshly made, on request, porridge and variety of egg options (if you didn’t want scrambled).

If you want a quick bite to eat, great Asian fusion eatery next door (Asahi Asian Street Food).",5,2022,11,25

224,Brilliant venue,"My girlfriend and I recently stayed here for a weekend get away. The staff were extremely friendly and couldn’t have done more to help us. 
In particular the bar and waiting staff, their standard of service was exceptional. As someone who worked in the industry for 8 years it’s always been a pet peeve of mine when the level of service isn’t up to par.  I couldn’t find any fault during our stay. I couldn’t recommend it highly enough!",5,2022,11,03
224,Great location and friendly staff!,"I recently stayed at the Clayton Charlemont for a few days during a short stay in Dublin. I can't fault the hotel.

I'd stay there again in a heartbeat.",5,2022,11,03
224,Quiet hotel,"Stayed there last night in Ireland 
Very quiet neighborhood

224,Fantastic Bar for Travelers and Locals,"Amazing Service and a great atmosphere.  A better selection than other Dublin bars for beers and good craft cocktails.

I had an excellent craft old fashioned cocktail and exceeded all expectations.  Even with the usual ingredients the bar added flavor with a  additional spray foam.  The staff is considerate of individual tastes and makes good recommendations on drinks.  14ish different beers on tap, and open late.

All of my Dublin-local colleagues are impressed with the beers and bartenders.",5,2022,10,19

I would highly recommend this place.",5,2022,10,02
224,Friendly staff and amazing atmosphere!,"Our stay was extremely pleasant mostly because of Nargiz who is just exceptional at making sure her guests are looked after :) She was very friendly and helpful for small needs throughout the days.

Looking forward to come back!",5,2022,09,28
224,Recommended hotel,"Stayed here earlier this year and had no issues. Excellent management and guest support coupled with clean room, great location and local amenities. Will definitely recommend to other travellers whether it is for business or touristic purposes.",5,2022,09,26
224,Irish mini break,"In between travel and spent a few days here in Dublin. This hotel has a nice quiet locale away from the fray  2 minutes to LUAS tram which we used alot with elevator  access. Right on the Canal with swans and locals walking their dogs. It's more a neighborhood  feel. The hotel staff were very kind and helpful  with anything  you need. Our room was clean and had coffee, tea facilities  with fresh water replaced daily. We did miss having a mini fridge !!! The double bed was a bit cramped for two of us. I would need to book bigger next time.
 Handicap bath was super! Well equipped  with making life easy .  Restaurant was yummy, especially  the breakfast.  Very kind staff.  Qe felt extremely  welcome.We had to pay separately  and only wish it was included  in our package like the competitors.   Overall, a comfortable  stay and would  recommend.  We like Clayton hotels and stayed in others in Dublin.",5,2022,09,19
224,Mr,"Nice hotel, clean, not noisy, central location.  TERRIBLE WIFI, the worst I've encountered anywhere in my 12 weeks in Ireland.
Drops in & out with great frequency.
Impossible to do any business here using this non wifi.",3,2022,09,15
224,Work and personal trip at Clayton Charlesmont,"I arrived at the Clayton very late in the afternoon after a very tiring 16 hour flight. I just wanted a meal and shower. Firstly I was shown to a room on the lower level (3601-3603). The room is down a passage which leads to door which leads to another passage. It is pitch dark. No window or light shining through. The passage lights up when the door is opened. It was absolutely creepy. 
Because the room is on the lower ground floor levels the windows weren’t easy to open and I couldn’t manage to. As you enter the room you are hit with musty damp stuffy smell. The bathroom is worse. Ventilation is needed. After settling in, I called for room service. It took 8 tries to get through. At this stage I was so exhausted and frustrated. The food arrived and the waiter was very friendly. Menu is very basic and pricey. On weekdays or after work opt to go out as you will find better options down the road. On the other 2 occasions I ordered room service, those calls never go through on the first try either. At least 3 attempts needed.
On Day 4 strangely there was no hot water in the shower. Lukewarm water but not hot despite moving the tap settings to the extreme. 
Throughout my 8 night stay, the tv chromecast setting did not work and despite calling the manager who tried and promised to resolve it the next day it never happened through my stay. This means you are stuck with very limited channels. Housekeeping is also very slow. I left at 10am on my free days and arrived at 2-3pm only to find my room not cleaned. I had to wait on two occasions in reception whilst it was getting cleaned. 
Overall there is no sense of urgency. Housekeeping staff, room service waiter are friendly and get things done but the managers and reception teams are slow. They don’t even greet you when walking past you. For work and personal travel I would opt in future for another hotel. I have advised colleagues to do the same. I travel for long periods and comfort is important. I question the 4 star rating honestly. Conrad, the Marlin and Hilton are good alternatives. If I stay at the Clayton again, I will definitely ask for a different room at a bare minimum. Hope they improve as there is a lot of opportunity for them with the tourism and businesses in the area.",2,2022,09,10
224,"Paid a lot for the room , but the hotel isn't worth it","Considering the cost per night, I expected more. Housekeeping didn't clean or make up our room the first day , and we had to ask for someone to come-- at 7pm. The next day, a similar experience. They came in the evening. They leave the dirty towels and trash in the hall. The more deluxe rooms require walking up several steps in an older part of the hotel (no elevator). It was odd. 
The reception staff was fine. The location is ok if you don't mind a 10-15 walk to the center/ Stephens Green.",3,2022,09,05
224,5 star Quiet hotel by the Canal,"We had a fabulous stay at this hotel. The rooms were spotlessly clean, the breakfast was amazing including a great selection of gluten free breakfast items and the staff were extremely helpful especially when we had an emergency and an ambulance had to be called. The staff even checked in with us the day after to check everything was ok. We will definitely use this hotel again.",5,2022,08,29
224,Pleasant stay at the Clayton,"Staff were extremely friendly and helpful.
The hotel was extra clean,well serviced,nice bar and restaurant with great food, the hotel has all amenities.

Location was great and close to the center, there are many pub’s and restaurants within walking distance.

224,Corporate Group,"For 2 weeks in a row we had 2 large group bookings at the Clayton Hotel Charlemont, the reservations team were excellent in helping with the preparations and very accommodating to all the changes we needed to make along the way.

224,Perfect City Break Stay,"Beautifully kept, modern, clean hotel. Extremely spacious rooms & lobby area. Pleasant staff, enjoyable breakfast. Good location, far enough away from the hustle & bustle of tourist hotspots but close enough to walk/enjoy the tram in. We’ll certainly be returning!",5,2022,08,20
224,A definite place to stay!,"After staying in very small rooms in London and Paris, we were delighted to walk into our room at the Clayton and find in comparable to hotel rooms in the US. Very clean and professional, and always ready to assist with questions and travel suggestions. Nargiz, who was one of the front desk attendants,  went out of her way to see that we knew where we were going, how to get there, and any and all other questions that we had. She was like our personal tour guide who made us feel very comfortable in Dublin. The hotel itself is about a mile from Grafton Street/O'Connell Street, but if you don't mind walking, its a fine place to stay.",5,2022,08,19
224,"The BEST cocktail experience in Dublin, hands down","I had cocktails here and there was no request Petru couldn’t fulfil, Erica, Simone, Caoimhe and Frank provided the best services, hands down, Dublin’s hidden gem, would highly recommend to anyone visiting the city, best cocktails I’ve had in a long, long, time, maybe ever!!",5,2022,08,17
224,Deluxe Double and Single Room,"The hotel has a good location, close to the center. The staffs are very kind! The reservation staff was enthusiastic to help us solve problems before coming to check in. There is only one small problem with breakfast and they are not varied.",5,2022,08,12
224,"Modern hotel, perfect for business trips...not so good food","I stayed here for 3-4 days on a very warm visit to Dublin. I was impressed with the facilities at the hotel and the location is great. The staff is really pleasant and knowledgeable but the lunch left. a lot to be desired. 

Conveniently located next to WeWork, a pub, and the canal. There are also quite a few good restaurants in close proximity.

One complaint...housekeeping too all day to do their job and clean the room.",4,2022,08,12
224,Holiday trip,"Initially stayed 8 days then returned for 2 nights . I was warmly welcomed back by Edwardo and Narqiuz. Apart from these two, all the staff were fantastic, and extremly helpful. Thank you.
I would recommend more drawer space in the rooms. Rooms were clean. The location of the hotel was perfect",5,2022,08,09
224,Great place to stay,The staff go just that little bit extra including settings nice note with a bottle of wine upon our arrival just to make her feel at home.  Meals are great and the location is in the centre of everything.  Nothing is too difficult and there is always a yes we can do that attitude.,5,2022,08,05
224,Fantastic,"We stayed for 2 nights during 6 Nations and thought this hotel was good value for money given how crazy prices get when there is a game on!  The location is excellent and rooms are well laid out, well equipped and quiet.  Will definitely stay again when we return to Dublin.",5,2022,07,31
224,"Great Hotel, Location and Super Staff Team","Modern Chic and beautifully located beside Dublins leafy Grand Canal Really offers a relaxing weekend stay, The fact that the hotel is on the edge of Dublins town centre means that you can get away from the hustle and bustle with a Walk along the Canal to any number of restaurants.

The Staff really make it personal.",5,2022,07,26
224,Nice hotel with poor services,"The Hotel is quite nice and the restaurant as well but unfortunately what a bad service!! The first day I discovered that even if we were 3 in the room, we had only 2 towel sets and I needed to ask for additional one. Moreover, behind a towel there was a leftover from a previous guest!! The second day I got the room cleaned at 4 pm. The third day they came to clean the room at 5 pm and when I asked the cleaning guy to come back in 15 min, he first told it was ok but then after 2 hours I've discovered that he marked that I've asked him not to have the room cleaned for the day !! And when I've asked an expiation to Jelena, the person in charge of room service, she told me I needed to understand that it was a busy day.... Anyway, after that I've asked 2 different receptionists an advise on where to have dinner nearby the hotel and none of them was able to advise on a name!!! Finally, I've asked to checkout the evening as the following morning  I had to leave early in the morning and the reception told me it was not possible . After an hour I've asked the same thing  to a different reception and it was perfectly fine!
Honestly, not the kind of service and attention to guests that you are expecting from a 4 star hotel",3,2022,07,26
224,Staff A+,"This is a very nice hotel that gets 5 stars because of the staff. So helpful and so professional- from the breakfast staff to the maintenance people. The reception crew is top notch. 

Beds are comfortable and rooms are nice and modern.  

Location is ideal. Away from the hustle of Grafton but a short tram away. 
A couple of nearby pubs too for some variation. 

The restaurant food is also good - pay for the breakfast - it’s worth it. 

Look forward to returning.",5,2022,07,25

224,Best Hotel and Staff!,"Lovely hotel.  Very  clean and comfortable. Anything you could ask for at breakfast and more!  The bar manager,  Razman was  great.  Made an awesom margarita!  His staff (esp. Giam)  was super and  fun .  The front desk suggested a visit to the Epic museum.  Best 4 hours ever spent in a museum.  Brilliant and moving presentation of Irish emigration.   As for bilingual staff, we only speak English, but we are sure that many of their staff  (being from non-English speaking countries) were able to assist guests from other countries.   We could have stayed longer, but the tour was moving on....",5,2022,07,16
224,All in all 5,"Clean hotel in walking distance to city center - outstanding friendly and service oriented staff. Very rich breakfast with wide range varieties. The only downfall was that our room No. 148 the bathroom is too small for 2 people to move in any way - should not sell as double room. 

Anyhow very pleasant stay in Dublin with high recommendation.",5,2022,07,16
224,Best Hotel,"The hotel reservation team went out of their way to accommodate our motorcycles! The staff where extremely helpful with everything. Special thanks to Petru from the bar who is very interesting to talk to and also went out of his way to make our stay memorable.

It’s slightly out of the city centre but only a very short walk to nearby shops and bars, so don’t be dissuaded by the location at all.

Breakfast was superb, great selection of hot and cold foods.
Overall a brilliant hotel, thank you for our lovely stay!",5,2022,07,09

224,Good Hotel...a few things to improve on,"This hotel was our 8th in our European tour through many cities from Prague, Warsaw, Berlin, Paris, Madrid, Amsterdam, London & Dublin. Dublin Airport T1 was the filthiest terminal during my tour. Th queues were horrendous having to queue for 2 hours with an infant. 

Thia hotel when compared to the rest I could have easily given a 5 star, but some simple things make it only a 4 star. I paid 600 euros for 3 nights and we stayed in room 335.

Pros 
- Good breakfast with tasty selection of food. The breakfast area is tastefully decorated.
- Extremely comfy beds with super soft pillows
- Grohe bathware has extremely good quality shower heads

Cons
- No toiletries. No shampoo, hair conditioner or body lotion - none of that.
- One day it was raining and I asked for an umbrella to go to their sister hotel 10 minutes away, and they refused to give one. How hard is it to keep some spare umbrellas?
- There is no fridge in the room to even keep a beer cold Argh!
- In our room 335 and the gap between bed and table is only 2ft wide. If I was seated working, my wife cannot get through the gap, it's so narrow.

I would probably come back to Ireland, but not through T1",4,2022,06,30
224,Excellent Accommodation,"Had an amazing stay at the Clayton Charlemont. Breakfast had a fantastic selection and the bedroom was lovely, with such comfortable beds. A very special thank you to the bartender Petru- of all of the places we have ever been to, we've never had such an amazing cocktail- pictures don't do it justice! It was one of our highlights from our time spent in Dublin, thank you!",5,2022,06,29
224,Beware -  you need to book your car in for parking before you arrive,"Disappointed when we arrived to find out the hotel car park was full and we had to leave our bags and drive to a car park at St Stephens Green. Bit of a pain, so ensure you book your car parking at hotel before you arrive. Location was good and so was the room with very comfy bed. Breakfast was ok, the staff tried hard to keep the food replenished but as it was very busy they ran out of some items sometimes. Also, the space where the food is served was not big enough.! Our evening meal was good.",3,2022,06,26
224,Thanks to Carmel,"We want to thank CARMEL so much for her perfect service during our stay in the hotel. The friendly willingness to help of all
employees is especially noteworthy. 
The location is near to downtown, but good quiet during the night. We can recommend this hotel really.",5,2022,06,21
224,Great stay and staff,Excellent and helpful staff. A very enjoyable stay. Nice restaurant area about 15 minutes walk away and fun restaurant and pub next door. Nice room amenities including a safe. Restaurant and bar on site. Very nice breakfast buffet lots of selection s. ,5,2022,06,19
224,Good experience ,"The hotel has the feel of classic but it’s actually modern and beautiful inside. 
The room given was lovely and immaculately serviced. Very helpful staff, especially Rita who has perfectly planned the full stay since we booked until we checked out. 
We highly recommend this hotel!!",5,2022,06,18
224,Amazing hotel and amazing hospitality with Rita!,"Amazing hotel and amazing hospitality with Rita! 

Rita was amazing in accomodating my requests. So professional and willing to help, she helped me having an amazing time in this hotel while working. 

Hotels should hire more people like Rita! 

Hotel is perfect for business trips",5,2022,06,17
224,"Excellent services, room, bar and food",We were in Dublin at the tail end of our travels and ended up at the Clayton. Cozy hotel close to everything and very walkable to top tourist sites. The breakfast was included with our booking and Kitti made the morning experience memorable. Dublin is an amazing destination and the Clayton Charlemont is a nice base for exploring it.,5,2022,06,15
224,Excellent service and accomodations,My family and I had a wonderful experience at this hotel especially with the affordable breakfast buffet. The waiting staff and services were phenomenal and a special shout out to Kitti for her kindness and hard-working demeanor.,5,2022,06,14
224,Lovely hotel. Best bartender in Dublin,Great hotel and lovely staff. Our best experience at the hotel was certainly Petru the bartender. He is a master craftsman. Watching him make and serve drinks to us and others was the highlight of our stay. He even made us an off the menu specialty drink of his own. Outstanding.,5,2022,06,13
224,Central convenient lovely hotel which is made better by the staff!!!,"I have stayed in this hotel twice now and it was been wonderful both times.  The hotel itself is a new building that wraps around some old Georgian houses. There a lots of places around the lobby to find a quiet place to read, charge your phone or tablet or take a work meeting. The bar is nice and the restaurant is nice too. The quality of the breakfast is wonderful. 

The staff in the bar and reception were great. The reception staff did a great job too. House keeping were great too. 

If I had to say one thing it would be that the hours of food served in the bar was hit and miss. We tried 3 times  to order food in the bar one time the kitchen was closed at 21:45, the next time it was just closed at 21:40 and the next time it was closed at 21:15. I did mention we were residents of the hotel but it made no difference. So one night I ordered Uber eats the next time I ordered a sandwich with fries (which it said it offered) and it came with crisps. It was disappointing as I hadn’t eaten all day due to being in a family emergency at a hospital. Veggie and vegan options on room
Service menu were limited. 

In terms of position of hotel it is a 15 minute walk to the top of grafton street. If you wish to use an e bike they are available across the road, the luas stop is 30 meters away. The beautiful grand canal is lovely to walk along. 

I had a good sleep in a superb bed so  all in all a good stay. Just offer your guests the option of a decent food service and you have it sorted.",5,2022,06,08
224,Great and friendly staff,"Great hotel with nice atmosphere and lovely, helpful staff members (Petru, Frank and others), who always greet you with a smile and a friendly chat. Really enjoyed my stay and cocktails in the lobby :)",5,2022,06,08
224,Regular guest,Arrived late on Saturday to meet family when I came they had been looked after like royalty by bar manager razvan and Erica and all the staff at bar and restaurant  and later on reception moved car from parking area visitors very impressed by service from staff they said I was spoiled rotten many thanks to all the staff  Jim,5,2022,06,06
224,"Lovely experience, very nice place","With my family passed a couple of night at the Clayton's Hotel Charlemont.
The building is in a strategic area to visit Dublin.
In a very good status of upkeep, well organized, well furnished and very clean too.
The rooms are very comfortable and the ambient is so quiet.
Very good the quality of the food & drink.
The staff is very friendly and focused to support the needs of the customers.
They are all very kind, prompt and professional; they make you feel even welcome.
Hope to have the opportunity to stay there for our next visit in Dublin.",5,2022,06,05
224,One very good hotel,"This hotel is really good. Is a very well designed hotel, staff are friendly (no bad experiences with any) and is in a good area of Dublin. There is good restaurants next to the hotel (including a very fancy gastro restaurant), next to the canals where you can have a nice walk and next to LUAS tram station Charlemont.
Only thing that I would change would be breakfast. Maybe offer your clients that book via Booking.com rates including breakfast. It is a bit expensive for what is offered.

Apart from that recommend it!:)",5,2022,05,29
224,An excellent stay for a special occasion,"We had a lovely stay for a special occaision that was amazingly facilitated by the hotel staff, especially Kate at reception who minded us and gave us a wonderful stay. Also Frank who made us feel very comfortable and made our stay all that more special. Cannot reccomend to stay more if you are visiting the city or just passing through. ",5,2022,05,29
224,Amazing front desk service,"I live in the city and needed to print something, so jumped into the hotel to ask for help as it's so hard to find printing service nearby. Kate was lovely and helped me out with it without hesitating. I'll definitely be coming back for breakfast one of those days :)",5,2022,05,28
224,Nice central location. Friendly staff but not as coeliac friendly as they assured me,"Good location for any business in South City centre. On the luas line which is convenient. Good staff very helpful. A very nice Asian restaurant for take away right outside as well as a convenience store which is handy.  My only issue is I contacted the hotel to notify them of coeliac disease and the availability of a gluten free cooked breakfast as I had a busy 2 day conference. I was assured of a gluten free cooked breakfast. When I arrived at 7 am I notified the lady in charge at breakfast. A very nice and helpful lady, but she proceeded to show me through breakfast telling me what I couldn't have! That was the extent of a gluten free breakfast! Bacon and beans and then charged 17 euro for the pleasure!!  Mmm.......",3,2022,05,28
224,Feces in Toilet at check in...,"Zero stars if I could. No joke there was feces in the toilet when I checked in I was HORRIFIED, and all the front desk said was ""oh I'll have someone clean it."" THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE BEFORE I CHECKED IN. I'm honestly afraid to touch anything in this hotel now. After spending €800 here I would definitely expected better. MASSIVE disappointment.",1,2022,05,27
224,A consistently high standard every time,"Stayed one night in the Clayton Charlemont for work purposes. Have stayed here numerous times before and always return due to the location, staff and excellent breakfast. Checked in by Kate who was pleasant, helpful and very knowledgeable about the local area. Arrived late just as food service was ending, and would've been without but for Christian at the bar who was able to get us sorted! Had a drink in the foyer and a chat with Frank, a gentleman. Bedroom was spotless and comfortable, quiet overnight ensuring a good night's rest. Breakfast in the morning was wonderful as always. I will look forward to returning again the next time I'm in Dublin.",5,2022,05,22
224,Many thanks to Ravzan & Petru,"I’ve stayed many hotels around loads of countries but I haven’t seen so approachable and thoughtful staff in my previous experience before. I occasionally come to this hotel always encounter same lovely aproach from people expecially Razvan and Petru. They re so friendly and making me feel at home. On the top of that Petru has such a great deal of experience about making cocktails. If u like to try anything U should definitely ask him personally. Many thanks all of them, we will see each other again.",5,2022,05,19
224,Great Stay. Lovely location. Friendly staff.,"Just had a 2 night perfect stay at The Clayton Charlemont.
Location is great. Luas just a 2 minute walk away.
Take  you anywhere in the City.
The food is first class. Had breakfast and dinner in the restaurant great selection 😋 
Staff go above and beyond to look after it's guests 
Well worth a visit if your going to Dublin. 
Big thank you to everyone 
Look forward to returning.",5,2022,05,19
224,my name is Martha this hotel  its excelent all the staff are very helpfull if you plan your party food are so tasty,"this place is great to do parties and to stay also staff are very friendly and help you what you need food are tasty and the best service. 
I am saying this because i book a room for my daughters communion and the service are briliant and very friendly",5,2022,05,18
224,Best Surprise in Dublin,Stayed on a business trip and joined by the family.  We came in after a late dinner and stayed at the bar.  We met Petru at the bar right before closing.  My wife and daughter were floored by the cocktails they received.  I had a wonderful whiskey with a classic ice cube which made it taste even better!  Classy cocktails and gracious service by a professional bartender.  Came back the next night with a bigger crowd and were impressed again.  I’ll stay at the charlemont because of the bar.  Thank you Petru!,5,2022,05,16
224,Great hotel with friendly staff,"I stayed here for 4 nights with my family, and had the best time. From breakfast in the morning to late night drinks, we were always impressed. The bartender, Petru, made the most exceptional drinks. We ended up spending a few of the nights at the hotel bar because they were THAT good. I highly recommend this hotel for its all around great service.",5,2022,05,14
224,Act of kindness,"This review is not about a stay  but says much about the integrity of the staff working there on Sat night/Sun morn, April 9th/10th. I left my phone in a taxi and a resident of the hotel  handed it to reception. The effort they went to for me to get it back was unreal!! I cannot thank them enough. It left me thinking if they looked after a non paying stranger so kindly, how well must they look after their guests. Thank you very much! It’s never a good time to lose a phone but this would have been a particularly difficult time for me! Thanks again & I will be actively singing the hotels praises and recommending anytime I can. Thanks.",5,2022,04,11
224,Fantastic friendly hotel.,"We had a wonderful stay enjoying the warm hospitality of this comfortable well situated hotel.
The Clayton Charlemont enjoys a canal side location with excellent public transport links a short walk from the city centre.
We stayed as a family group before our daughters graduation. Kate and Leanne at reception left no stone unturned in ensuring we had everything we needed.The friendly staff are definitely a huge asset in this establishment. 
We will definitely be back!",5,2022,04,05
224,Exceptional staff made my visit,"While the room and location was great, what made my stay at the Clayton Hotel Charlemont was the bar! The bartender Petru was exceptional in everything he did, even customizing drinks for my friend and I. We stayed over St.Patricks day when other bars and clubs were super crowded, so often we found ourselves at the hotel bar which did not disappoint. The kindness from Petru and the amazing drinks he made us truly made Dublin - not sure I could say this about any other hotel bar!",5,2022,03,29
224,Mixed feelings,"Just returned from a four night stay from 23rd to 27th March.  On arrival at 3.30pm the receptionist was friendly but check in wasn’t possible as room wasn’t ready.  The receptionist was unable to provide a receipt of payment until the check in process was completed but later forgot.  She was not forthcoming with any information about the hotel but answered questions politely.  

The room on the third floor was comfortable and modern with tea and coffee, safe and complimentary water which was replenished on a daily basis.  The large television had good receptions on all channels and the WIFi was fast.  The room was very quiet at night with a view of the river.  The bathroom was very small with two refillable dispensers for soap & shower gel.  I wouldn’t describe these as “signature luxury toiletries” as advertised on the website.  The shower was a good size and looked new.  Apart from finding two pencils on the floor from another guest the housekeeper was very good.  

The breakfast was good but the service needed improvement.  On the first morning breakfast was busy with lots of guests walking around with no masks, touching shared utensil and sitting close together.  The staff did there best to please everyone but they needed additional help as there were too many guests and not enough staff.  On the second morning the waitress brought the incorrect hot drinks to the table on two occasions. She was pleasant but young and inexperienced, she didn’t understand basic requests.  The third morning breakfast was satisfactory with no issues.  On the last morning the waitress was disinterested with no service at all.  I had to a leave my seat to request toast as she had no intention of coming to the table.  

The hotel has an all day bar menu in addition to an A la Carte option.  The food was always delicious and the service was very good.  Special thanks to Frank who went out of his way to please guests and have a chat.  I think he should train the breakfast staff and show them how it’s done!  The coffee was very good but it was a little cold at times.  

The hotel is located on the south side of the river, it’s approximately 1km to St Stephen’s Green.  Pearse train station for day trips out of the city (e.g Howth and Malahide) is over 2km away and takes approximately thirty minutes to walk.  The hotel is close to the Luas tram line for transport into the city.  Despite some issues with the staff and service I enjoyed my stay.",3,2022,03,28
224,Nice hotel but disaster staff,"Two rooms on same booking. One for three girls Friday night and second room for two of us Saturday night to join the others. First room on Friday they gave the room to someone else and then only had a twin room instead of a triple left which had been booked. Saturday checked in for the twin room on booking and they told us it had been cancelled but it hadn’t! Had to find us another room. Then none of the keys would work or would work once and then stop working so had to keep going down to reception. Asked reception to order us a maxi taxi - they ordered us a regular taxi - no apology, the man just said ‘oh ok’ and walked off when we said it was the wrong one. Had to go hail one down on the street. Food was lovely for breakfast but then a waitress came over and tried to charge us for it when we had already paid for breakfast as it was included with our stay. Overall hotel was lovely but the staff seemed to have no idea what they were doing, no apology when things went wrong and weren’t very helpful.",2,2022,03,27
224,Exceptional Stay,"The Clayton Hotel Charlemont is one of the best Clayton Hotels I have stayed at. The Hotel was spotless. Breakfast in particular was incredible we had breakfast here on Saturday and Sunday and the view of the Grand Canal was breathtaking. We were greeted by Glen on arrival to the Breakfast both days. He was extremely helpful and ready to help us with anything we needed. He even cleaned a table by the window for us all! The Breakfast selection is very good with a wide variety of foods available.The customer service was absolutely outstanding throughout the Hotel during our stay. 

The hotel is located close to the LUAS stop and is within walking distance from the city center.

We will most definitely be back!",5,2022,03,20
224,Excellent service,"After a long day touting Ireland, the bartender, Petry, was excellent.  Customizing the ordered cocktails to each member of our party.  He was engaging and was able to make the single best gin martini I ever had.  Gunpowder Irish gin; vermouth; and 3 splashes of grapefruit bitters.   Spectacular.",5,2022,03,15
224,Friendly staff ,"On check in we were greeted with 2 very friendly guys who were very welcoming and down to earth. Ricky and Carl. 

We have a fabulous 3 course meal food was amazing 👏 and our waiter fir the evening was Frank again very welcoming and friendly. Good to see good down to earth and friendly staff.

Thanks all for a wonderful stay ",5,2022,03,14
224,Excellent hotel with excellent staff,"Stayed here in March 2022. Just one night but it was faultless. Lovely spacious room, delicious breakfast and a good rate. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Great location. I regularly need a Dublin hotel and see this becoming my regular choice.",5,2022,03,12
224,Best Dublin Hotel,"Luxury is everywhere at this hotel. The layout, the rooms, the feeling you walk in: you feel like you are staying at the nicest hotel.

The location is pretty awesome also, right along the canal and there is large Swans that just hang out on the path. Don’t worry! They are friendly.

But the stars of the show is the staff. I’ve never seen a staff go to the lengths they did to make a guest feel special. We celebrated our engagement and my fiancé couldn’t have been happier.

The front desk, housekeeping and even security (there was a small fire alarm malfunction one of the nights) were all so wonderful. 

The breakfast was also great, Mariel was perhaps the most lovely server we ever had. And the breakfast was OUTSTANDING 

Thank you so much for a wonderful stay!",5,2022,03,08
224,Romantic quick getaway,"Romantic quick getaway 

Me and my bf came to Dublin for the weekend. The hotel is exceptionally located in the heart of Dublin. Just about 10 minute walk to all the shops and restaurants. We had a very smooth and professional check in.
The room was lovely, very comfortable bed and spacious shower.
The only complaint is that I had an omelette for breakfast and I asked to have ham put in but I didn't get it. However the coffee was delicious and all staff were professional. Weather was perfect too.
Another thing is, the fire alarm came on twice on Saturday night and we didn't get a call or anything from reception to tell us it was a false alarm. It was about 1am.
Apart from that, everything was perfect for us !",5,2022,03,07
224,Petru the bartender of every girls dream,"We visited the Charlemont for my best friends birthday, the hotel was lovely, room was beautiful but the icing on the cake was our man Petru who was nothing but a gentleman, a cocktail master and just the highlight to our trip!  Please give this man a pay rise, he put a smile
on these Essex girls faces.",5,2022,03,06
224,Breakfast fantastic service,"Together with a group of friend we had breakfast at Clayton Hotel in Charlemont st. Had a great experience and food was amazinig. 

Extra kudos for Amandine who looked after us very well, and made our morning very pleasant!",5,2022,03,05
224,Bar,"The hotel is beautiful with great and professional treat! 
I had a bartender named Petru - a professional and a very good and pleasant man.
Any time I wanted something he was the one to help.
I recommend the hotel!",5,2022,02,22
224,Birthday Weekend,"This was our first trip to Dublin and the hotel was a great base for us to relax in after busy days exploring the city! Located a 10/15 walk from the centre but for us it was nice to be in a quieter area yet still within reach of everything (shops, restaurants etc.). We added breakfast one day which was superb, such a wide choice and all very fresh! The room was a good size, very clean and had a fantastic shower and comfy bed which you don’t always find! All the staff were very friendly and always someone around to answer questions. Would definitely return to this hotel if we visit Dublin again.",5,2022,02,21
224,Excellent service,Hotel is central to all attractions. The food of a high standard with one of the best breakfast choices I have experienced . Staff are very friendly and their service is excellent . A particular mention to Amandine and Carmel in the restaurant .,5,2022,02,20
224,Lovely hotel,"It was my second time staying in this hotel. It was as expected. Amazing great quality of food in the restaurant, pleasant and attentive service. Room is superb and the mattress is so comfortable. Check in was pleasant seamless as i was recognised as returning customer. I look forward staying  here again. Overall great friendly service and very comfortable facilities.",5,2022,02,20
224,Valentines,"I stayed here valentines with my boyfriend the man on reception at the night time was very hard to communicate with!
But it was all made up with Jordan the receptionist that was there in the morning couldn’t be more helpful & such a lovely girl done everything to make us comfortable so thank you very much , food & drinks wore lovely especially the cocktails , would come back only fault was the man at the night time felt like he had a problem and just didn’t want us there when we just came for a nice night away!",4,2022,02,16
224,Valentine’s Day stay,"Receptionist Jordan was really freindly and helpful and the hotle was lovely from room to food it was all 100% 
could not recommend this hotle enough 10/10 stay it’s also a one minute walk to the luas  stop where you can go straight to Dublin City centre witch isn2 stops away from the hotle on the luas or an 10 minute drive",5,2022,02,15
224,Valentine’s Day stay,"Amazing from check in to check out, fab breakfast included in price too and hotel was stunning room was clean and bed was sooo comfy, definitely a 10/10 experience would 100% come back. Receptionist Jordan was so lovely and very accommodating.",5,2022,02,15
224,Great Hotel,Very comfortable hotel and only within walking distance of the city.Staff where very friendly Frank in the bar was very helpful and Petrci was great with making the cocktails . Valet parking for 25 euros was good as street parking would cost you that . Breakfast was excellent so was the bar food would stay again when in Dublin,5,2022,02,14
224,Comfort & luxury,"I've stayed here a couple of times before, but visit the bar regularly as I live locally. The service is top notch, the staff are very courteous and Petrci makes the most amazing innovative cocktails! Simone is the most generous and gracious host. I keep coming back for more! Thanks to the wonderful staff for making this place an accommodating welcoming spot to come visit time and time again.",5,2022,02,04
224,"Most welcoming, comfortable hotel in Dublin","I live in Dublin and I can safely say I will come to this hotel just to spend the night. It is by far one of my favorite hotels in the city and I have stayed in most other hotels in Dublin. It located beside the canal south of the city centre which is fab for morning fresh walks. And every single time I visit here, the receptionists are so friendly and hospitable for everything you need. Not only that but I notice the tiniest details when I first walk into a hotel room in terms of cleanliness- but the cleaning team in the Clayton charlemont are absolutely amazing the rooms are always immaculate and i have never had any complaints, I can imagine they work very hard to reach that standard. The lounge is also very cosy and relaxing. I was here for drinks in town with my friend and they conveniently had ice machines in the hallway for our pre- night out gin. I have stayed in other Clayton hotels too which are lovely but this is just my personal fave! I am posting this review because I am actually just grateful to have such a comfortable, cosy, warm and gorgeous hotel like this in Dublin and I thoroughly enjoy spending time here and would recommend anyone travelling to Dublin to stay here.",5,2022,01,28
224,Tacky television mars experience,"I’ve stayed in other Claytons in Dublin, and I often work or study in their lounges. As in all the others, the staff at Charlemont are great, friendly and efficient, and the space is pleasant. However, for some reason management keep a large screen TV on all day in the lounge, which is distracting and tacky. A member of staff is usually kind enough to turn it off for me, but then another one wanders in and turns it on again. It’s an off- putting lack of attention to detail.",3,2022,01,27
224,Friendly staff,"Very nice hotel with very friendly staff. Room was small for 3 adults but was sufficient. Toiletries are minimal in the bathroom. Bar was nice and good selection of drinks and food. Location is not ideal for town with a good walk into Grafton Street and would recommend getting taxis but for us as a group of girls for a night out, it was perfect. Price was very reasonable. Valet parking for only €25. A night was a nice, welcome surprise.",4,2022,01,24
224,A great stay at a great hotel.,"My wife and I recently spent a week in Dublin at the Clayton Hotel at Charlemont. The hotel, physically, was very pleasant and comforting. The staff was more than that. They were friendly, gracious, sociable, and accommodating. At every turn, the staff, especially Georgie and Jordyn, were warm, helpful, and informative every time. We highly recommend the Clayton at Charlemont if you are looking for an outstanding and convenient home base for a visit to Dublin.",5,2022,01,01
224,Xmas day review,"Stayed in the Clayton Charlemont on Christmas day. The cost was €225 nice large room with a double & a single bed & bath which I requested. The room looked out on the canal was great I could see the rain bouncing off the swans.
The hotel its self seems very large I think about 400 rooms I stayed in number 337. The staff were very helpful no complaints a few Names Isabella was very nice are provided good customer experience Same with Georgie who booked me in all the staff were in fact very pleasant.

Room as I said was large with nice décor throughout.
I had my Xmas dinner here extra cost on top of the room cost about €42 paid €50 it’s Christmas
Starter soup (NICE)
Main Turkey & ham (Bland)
Dessert Cheesecake (Pleasant)

So here is what I have to say & I must take into account the times that are in it & decide do I wish to deduct marks.
Music was way too loud in the restaurant I wear aids & had to remove them. In all honesty the main was bland I had to request cranberry sauce to try spice it up so to speak this was provided to me very fast. No roasted potatoes, lack of gravy etc Look it was okay felt a bit rushed.

As I said it is what it is but a few little touches would not have gone astray in the name of CX.
Headed back to my room & noticed I had no sparkling water as I had drunk the smaller bottle of Complimentary Sparkling River rock which was provided along with a bottle of still. They had a few sweets which I tucked into on my arrival also complimentary (very nice) Anyhow headed down to the bar got a 750 ml bottle of River rock for €5.80. That on its own is deserving of a  reduction in review marks.

Bar was open I understand until 11.30 pm (Did not bother)
All Covid safety checks were carried out by the staff which of course is a good thing & if you did not have a cert or what not you had to have your food in your room.
All in all, good hotel friendly hardworking staff. I would have to recommend. Location of course spot on.
If I may include one last thing no dogs allowed. What have I to say about that? Well come on guys we are in 2021 & a prominent city in Europe please get with the times on that.
Not allowing my dog added an extra €50 in taxi fares checking on her.
Let’s give this hotel a 8.5 out of ten.
Thank you",5,2021,12,27
224,My morning coffee,I have not stayed in the hotel but I pop in every morning on my way to work to grab my coffee. I am served every morning by Eva at the coffee counter who is very friendly and always has a nice word to say. My experience is limited to coffee but Eva does it very well!,4,2021,12,10
224,Upscale quite hotel in a great location,"The Clayton Charlemont is well worth the stay. The central, but quieter location offers a great balance of easy access to attractions and a restful stay. The hotel staff is very accommodating and friendly. The lobby and rooms are nicely decorated.

The bed is quite firm, which is great for some and seems to be relatively common in Ireland hotels. Breakfast is great if you are in a hurry, but if your plans allow, there are likely better options nearby.",5,2021,12,06
224,Gorgeous Breakfast!,Had a gorgeous breakfast in the hotel this morning.  Amandine was very friendly and helpful and Eva made me a beautiful coffee to start the day.  Eva is always friendly and helpful when I drop in for a take-away coffee.  ,5,2021,11,19
224,Good hotel at a great location,"The hotel is clean and quiet for the rest. Staff at the bar / kitchen makes the stay a very cozy experience! The food is also very good (and I have higher threshold for that)
Big thanks to Eva, Dia, Andrea, Amy and Jessica!",4,2021,11,16
224,Andrea and the team showing how hospitality is done!,"Visited for breakfast and stayed for the hospitality! A high standard of consistent, prompt and welcoming customer service across the team.  The food was delicious and cooked to perfection. 
Visible attention paid to cleanliness, hygiene and customer care without imposing on guests and diners which is a feat at the moment. 
If you are looking for a place to dine along the canal, with a relaxed atmosphere, and a  view of the canal wildlife, I highly recommend visiting here. Andrea and her team will make your dining experience a memorable one!",5,2021,11,14
224,Eva is best Barrista in Town,"I go regularly into Clayton for take out coffee
Always served by Eva who is extremely professional and courteous and makes great coffee. Thoroughly recommend it. Combination of decoration and layout incorporating the old listed building is superb. A must to see",5,2021,11,09
224,Take out Coffee - a must if in the area !,Dropped into the Clayton - Charlemont for a coffee.  The internal decor is fab.  Brilliant ground level dual story layout.  One part has an externaf facade but its inside!  Worth just visiting.  Eva was the Barista and make a great coffee and of course includes the biscotti.  Well done to all.   Returning !,5,2021,10,29
224,City Break,"The hotel is in a great location,beautiful decor in foyer, food was delicious, staff very friendly and attentive.. the reason I didn’t give 5 stars was the room we were allocated 3608 is small and furniture configuration was strange, this is located in the original Georgian building. Although room has been well renovated and is quite modern and very clean… I have never stayed in a hotel that the double bed is pushed up against the wall having no locker or light on that side! Also the TV  is positioned to the left of the bed meaning you can’t watch TV comfortably while in bed unless you lie width ways across it.. which we did. I think that room is more suitable to a single person and was disappointed it was allocated to us as a couple. Having said all that I would definitely stay in this hotel again but would request another room.. as the photos I have seen look nothing like this particular one.",3,2021,10,28
224,A good hotel that serves as a reference,"Situated at the canal around the South of Dublin, it is a bit of a walk to the town centre. However, there is a LUAS stop Charlemont on the green line that is just 5 min. away. Rooms are clean and spacious enough with double and single bed. Hardly any outside noise noticeable. Due to Covid-19, they are cleaned and towls are changed upon request if you stay more than 1 day. Also breakfast is not in buffet form. You order your food and drinks from a list at your table. Food quality is more than ok, although somewhat pricy. Service is excellent. It was a pleasure staying there. The staff is helpful in any possible way. Check-in and -out can be handled electronically. Elevator for wheelchairs available.",4,2021,10,22
224,Delicious Coffee,Always a wonderful experience at the Clayton. It has a lovely atmosphere and the staff cannot do enough to make your stay comfortable. Thanks to Ava for great service and delicious coffee this morning. I can’t recommend it more and definitely will be back !,5,2021,10,15
224,A great place to stay.,"My friend and I visited Dublin to visit a mutual friend at the Embassy for four days. We found the Clayton Hotel Charlemont online, and we were only greeted with smiling faces and excellent service. 

We would especially like to highlight the exceptionally friendly receptionist, Lucio, who throughout our entire stay was happy, understanding, and up for a quick conversation. He was the only one of the staff who consistently demonstrated ""warmth of heart"". Just to mention one out of several specific examples: When we told him that we thought the tap water tasted a bit like chlorine, and we therefore questioned whether the water was drinkable, he did not exhort us about how the water in fact is drinkable (which sometimes is a problem when travelling). We were not compelled to have that discussion. He could immediately tell that we are used to drinking some cleaner water, so with a smile on his face, he quickly brought us two large jugs of, in our perspective, drinkable water with ice cubes. 
We hope Lucio gets this well-deserved praise presented to him.

Overall, the staff was terrific, and the breakfast was great too. We will recommend the Clayton Hotel Charlemont to friends, and we will choose this hotel again next time we go to Dublin. Thank you very much for being so kind, and a special thanks to Lucio for truly being a gentleman and a scholar!",5,2021,10,11
224,Top -Notch!,"I had stayed in Clayton Charlemont couple of weeks back.I am very impressed with the customer service they have. Every single staff i dealt with was very helpful. I was inquiring about a direction to the town and receptionist was very keen to explain me everything in detail,even more than what i was expecting.Everything seems to be very close to the hotel. (I even came to know the maps they use are designed by one of their staffs,legend!).The rooms were very clean and the beds very comfy.The food was very tasty and have to say bar/restaurant service was excellent.The one amazing thing i see in this hotel is everyone seems to relaxed,no panic or rushing to things and enjoying what they do.Bravo!!!",5,2021,10,05
224,Weekend break.,Very clean and comfortable throughout . Excellent covid measures . Breakfast was table service and all the staff were very pleasant and attentive. Our room was  comfortable and quiet . Reception staff were helpful and efficient . A very pleasant stay and very convenient for the city centre and airport bus .,5,2021,10,02
224,Great Hotel,"Stayed at the hotel for a few days in September of 2021. Fantastic service. Close to everything. You can drive, or just take off down the street. Very clean rooms. Great restaurant downstairs! I would recommend seeing the Book of Kells, fantastic library. Looks like something straight out of a Harry Potter film. In fact, they may have filmed there. Also, take a trip down to Howth Harbor, pronounced Hote, and take the ferry located at the end of the harbor out to the island. Cost 20 pounds round trip. Well worth it. All in all, this hotel is a great place to headquarter while your visiting. I had breakfast every morning I was there in the restaurant. Staff stands out in plain view by the wall in case you need something. Great service. Check it out. Don’t think you’ll be disappointed.",5,2021,09,23
224,Inability to Communicate,"Arrived one hour late due to hotel postcode wrong, We had checked it twice in the ferryport but got nowhere. On arrival despite filling in the ""check in "" online as requested 24hr previously, we had to check in again. reception staff could barely understand us and we him. Even the Duty Manager, D/M, found it hard to understand our request to ring the restaurant to explian we would be late for our booking. what a stressed and rushed arrival. I asked to see a D/M the next day and for them to have my complaints. In our room, the lights would not work and eventually blew a socket. the toilet did not work on flush fully with one chair for two people? and this was a supposedly an upgrdae room. Next day saw D/M Sheeka he had no idea of any problems. we agreed to meet 16.00 on that day, i requested the room. we were back for 16.00 no D/M Sheeka, just more D/M's all milling around wanting to help but eah one wanting a full explanation, this after a great but tiring day looking around Dublin. Back in our room it had not been cleaned or restocked. 
we were offered yet another room, but after un packing again, (due to covid you had to pack all your possesions in the wardrobe, all of them.! for the room to be cleaned) we were exhausted.
D/M's are supposed to be able to make decisions, show empathy and reduce Guests anxiety and stress, not increase it, to utter frustartion. None we met were capable of this D/M Sheeka being the worst of the hapless D/M's. I would suggest if anyone stayed there, if a problem go straight to the General Mannger. I wish i had.
Despite this appalling service and lack of communication, I still paid my service charge to show how you can be proffesional regardless of service.
This put a dampner on a great weekend, of charm,  great welcome and excellent service in all the other venues we tried.",2,2021,09,23
224,Absolutely Fabulous,10 out of 10 for this Hotel. Cleanliness food staff bedding pillow and decor. Absolutely fabulous. Can't wait to go back. Have it booked again already. Great pub The Barge right beside the hotel is a great pub too,5,2021,09,12
224,Wheelchair accessibility is excellent,"This 4 star only hotel is in a great location overlooking the Grand Canal and within walking/wheeling distance of Grafton Street and St Stephen’s Green.  The Luas (tram) stop is approximately 3 minutes away from the hotel. There are 9 wheelchair accessible rooms in the hotel.  The hotel has been beautifully renovated including the part that is a listed building
We were celebrating a birthday and were greeted with a lovely handwritten card in our room on arrival and delicious macaroons.  This lovely touch was a wonderful way to start our first hotel stay in 16 months.
Service was excellent from initial reservation, to check in and check out.  The reservations team were very responsive to my queries regarding wheelchair accessibility although most of these are to be found on the accessibility information on the hotel’s website which is a very welcome development (it’s a pity that all hotels do not provide similar online information) The hotel was very clean.  The hotel has free wi-fi internet access for guests.  I was very happy with the Covid protocols
All the areas around the hotel are wheelchair friendly.  There are two elevators on the ground floor of the hotel all of which are wide and have good turning space.  The elevator call buttons were reasonably easy to reach.  Entry from the canal side is easier for wheelchair users as entry from Charlemont Street requires the use of a platform lift to reach reception
My wheelchair accessible room Deluxe Double Room was spotlessly clean with a seal on the door to confirm cleaning had taken place.  The room was large and had good turning space.  The light switches were easy to reach.   The room door was not too heavy and I could enter and leave the room independently.  There are several power points in the room and some were within reach.  The bed was 55cm in height from the floor and there was room underneath for a hoist.  I thought the mattress was soft rather than firm.  
The bathroom was spacious with very good turning space.  The walk-in shower had a wall mounted seat (with arm rests).  The shower hose was detachable and the water pressure and temperature was adjustable.  There were grab rails in the shower.  The toilet was 48cm in height and had a wall mounted pull down grab rail on one side of the toilet and a fixed grab rail affixed to the wall.  If a guest needed to do a side transfer from their wheelchair, this would be possible. There are two hand basins (one beside the toilet that was small and narrow and another that was wide and deep.  There was sufficient surrounding space for personal toiletries and make up bags beside the wider handbasin.  The toiletries provided by the hotel were lovely.  
Food in the restaurant for the evening meal was breakfast was delicious and very well presented.  A la carte for all meals suits me as I find navigating a buffet in a wheelchair challenging.  
The staff were very incredibly helpful, friendly and efficient.  
As we were waiting for our taxi home, the General Manager Callum approached us to ask about our stay and I can confidently state that we had a wonderful positive experience.  I would recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again.",5,2021,09,09
224,Nice well located hotel,"It’s really well located overlooking the canal. Rooms are spotless and as we are here in the middle of Covid it’s a bit restricted but not in a bad way

Reception staff and restaurant staff are all friendly and efficient. At checkin we were told what to do if we wanted the rooms cleaned or new towels etc

The pub next door (The Barge) is friendly and speedy with an excellent pint of Guinness",4,2021,09,09
224,Fantastic location beautiful hotel excellent food,I had the pleasure of staying in this hotel recently with friends we all had a great time. The hotel is so lovely with a fantastic canal side location and the Dublin Tram which is only two stops from the most upmarket shopping district in Dublin. The hotel is fresh and new with beautiful decor and a fantastic restoration of a previously listed building. The lobby is bright and inviting. The hotel is gleaming and spotless. The Wifi is fantastic and the food was excellent as it is in the other Clayton hotels I have stayed in both the breakfast and the restaurant and the bar food were excellent. The staff are friendly and very welcoming and helpful it makes all the difference. I loved my bedroom it was again warm and spotless. This hotel is a must stay if in Dublin there are also some excellent bars and restaurants nearby that are very popular with locals. You are also just a short stroll away from Ranelagh neighborhood which is very popular with Dublin’s foodie folks with tons of great restaurants to choose from. You can also stroll along the canal path and look at the swans and water hens. Excellent hotel 5* review from me.,5,2021,08,31
224,Fantastic!,"We had a three day stay in the Charlemont Hotel. It really is an excellent hotel.  The staff deserve special praise, all were extremely helpful and friendly. The location is perfect, overlooking the canal, near the Luas stop and close enough to walk to the city centre. The restaurant was really good and our room was comfortable and  had all the amenities you could need including very comfy beds. We would stay here again without hesitation.",5,2021,08,30
224,Great stay,"I have absolutely no faults in this beautiful hotel,  the room was spacious and clean.

224,As I'd expect with a Clayton hotel!,"I travel home to Ireland a lot from the US to see family and Friends. About 5 years ago I stayed in Clayton Ballbridge, then the Burlington and now Charlemont. The staff make these places special. Thank you Tomas, Frank, Cian, Leanne and Sasha, I will definitely be coming back to Clayton Charlemont.",5,2021,08,26
224,Always an enjoyable stay,"I’ve stayed in this hotel over 25times with my previous company, and this was my first trip back post-Covid! 
It’s great to see how Clayton and Dalata have implemented great safety procedures.
One thing I was a bit nervous about what the fact that none of the female receptionists wore face masks. There was plastic guards in-front of guests and staff but the staff are still mingling behind the desk, surely this is a Failte Ireland safety concern? 
Check-in was late for me at 11:05pm and was told the bar was closed, which again is fine but it was to take to my room so no rules of 11:30 bar cleared would have been affected! Thanks to the tall gentleman who has been in the hotel since the opening (I believe he’s a manager/supervisor) but helped me get a drink.
Always enjoy staying here because of its close location to town, and very comfortable beds.",4,2021,08,26
224,Great Hotel in Dublin,Stayed in this hotel during my visit in Dublin. I must say it is worthy of a good review. From the moment i have arrived Everything was great. Reception staff could not have been more accommodating and informative. I had a dinner in the restaurant and it was great. Food delicious and service was pleasant. Its more like 4 star hotel with 5 star service. My room was also very clean which is so important to me. Nothing in this hotel i could fault which is rear in all my traveling. Highly recommended and will definitely stay there again when in Dublin,5,2021,08,26
224,Fantastic stay in central location =],"Stayed in the Clayton for my husband's birthday a few weekends ago and we were beyond delighted with our stay from ease of check-in with valet parking at arrival, most friendly and helpful staff, our room was amazing, modern, all mod cons and  immaculately clean not forgetting the wrap around views - the city on one side and mountains on the other. We were greeted with a lovely handwritten card in our room on arrival, a bottle of red (that went down a treat!) and macaroons - beautiful touch & a fab way to start off our weekend. We have to commend the staff on abiding by all COVID regulations we felt so safe despite us being fully vaxxed we have to say they were a credit to themselves. After a weekend of eating out and meeting old friends we retreated to the hotel for a night cap and the atmosphere in the foyer was lively albeit super save and everyone was well spaced out - finally back to some normality!! This hotel is ideally located, the popular Barge pub across the road, St. Stephens Green in short walking distance, and if you want to pop down Dublin south the Luas is literally 2 minutes from the hotel! Thanks to General Manager Callum and Team for such an enjoyable experience - will be back for sure!",5,2021,08,25

224,Derek & Danielle Geraghty,"Just had our wedding here this month, this hotel is fantastic, modern and the rooms are well equipped. The food that we received on the day was absolutely top quality and with two chefs in our wedding party that raved about the food, that’s all you need to know, the staff were very helpfully in facilitating our vision for the day and couldn’t do enough for us, in particular our events manager Ciara was very helpful and communicated with us constantly on the lead up to the day and on the day, they made it feel very personal and special for us even the general manger Callum came to talk with us and to make sure we had everything we needed, I could not recommend this hotel enough for a small intimate wedding. Thank you all so much and I look forward to coming back next year for our anniversary",5,2021,07,20

Many thanks to everybody that looked after us during our stay, You were not aware but during these hard times my husband and I lost 3 siblings and to be honest.. we needed the break!  Everybody at the Clayton in Charlemont made us feel special and we were able to relax and rest for a little while.

It was nice to talk to the General Manager, Callum who had a wee casual chat with us just before we left.. what a great guy!!  Ok ladies.. this guy knows we need extra plugs for straighteners etc.. I promise, the Clayton Hotel in Charlemont is not short on plugs 😉
All in all..beautiful hotel in a great location with such lovely stafff.. definitely, we will be back 😘",5,2021,07,07

224,Need for better room revenue management,"The hotel is and will always be beautiful. The staff and amenities are all strictly adhering to covid regulations which was good to see. Everything is clean and tidy. However, despite I am sure a lower demand than usual so more space in the hotel, we were put right next to two rooms with Bachelorette parties…. Who partied into the early morning. Didn’t get a minute of sleep before our alarm went off at 5 am. I would expect better planning in this regard, especially nowadays.",3,2021,07,03

224,Lovely Hotel and fabulous staff,"I stayed for one night on the bank holiday Sunday, and I couldn't wait to get out of the house to be looked after and this hotel didn't disappoint.  We booked into the hotel using the online check in which was seem less and collected our key cards at reception from the very friendly receptionist who double checked we were booked in for dinner and breakfast which we had done prior to our arrival.  Our room was just so comfortable with a gorgeous bath and shower and had air conditioning which was needed as it was very warm out.   We came down to the bar and ordered drinks and again greeted with friendly staff and then headed to the restaurant for dinner.   The menu had all the favourites and when the food arrived it was delicious.  We had ordered the salt and pepper cauliflower which I hadn't seen before and was surprised on how fab they were,  I will be going back for these alone.  We then had fish and chips and the chicken curry which were both delicious  .  We headed back to bar for more drinks and ordered some superb cocktails.  The next morning after a great nights sleep on the most luxurious mattress we headed back to the restaurant for breakfast.  The hotel still have restrictions in place as per govt guidelines but it doesn't effect the relaxing atmosphere of the hotel.  The breakfast was served to the table and the service was very quick and food hot and delicious.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a fab break to switch off and within walking distance of St. Stephens' green and the city centre if you wanted to get out and about.  I can't wait to return here as I was looked after so well.",5,2021,06,14

224,Wonderful weekend for my son's 21st,The hotel couldn't have been more appealing for a family break to celebrate my son's 21st birthday. From the valet service to take our car on arrival to the lovely desk clerk who checked us in. There was a lovely card and a hand-made bar of chocolate awaiting my son when he arrived at his room and my wife was presented with a bottle of prosecco. Location was perfect with an amazing view of the canal from our room. The regulations for Covid were really well handled by the hotel staff and it was just wonderful to be able to have a pint and a lovely meal now that we have moved out of lockdown in Ireland. I have stayed here before with friends and knew that my family would love it. Breakfast was excellent and the barista at the coffee bar served fabulous coffee (see picture). Thanks again. Will definitely return.,5,2020,12,07

We booked through a third party company who were absolutly awfull and no help, so I decided to contact the hotel directly to see if they would help in anyway. The customer service I recieved was absolutly fantastic on every single call and email! So polite and helpful. Rebecca really went the extra mile to help me and I am so so grateful for her help, she managed to get me a refund which I know I I wouldent have gor if the company. I highly reccomend to stay here with the fantastic customer service, when covid has gone I will 100% be coming to stay.
I really appreciate all the help you gave me, you went above and beyond.
Thank you!

224,Lovely weekend break,"Stayed in the absolutely lovely Clayton Charlemont on Saturday. Stay on check in was very welcoming. Rooms are lovely and brand new. Staff in the restaurant were nice and food was lovely. Such a great location as well as its very close to Camden street. Would definitely look to come back and support the hotel.

224,Great Stay,"Quite a new hotel and in a very convenient location - walking distance to St Stephen's Green and less than 100m from the Luas tram line.     Hotel was spotlessly clean, staff were friendly and very professional in the current COVID climate.    Breakfast was excellent and served to us at the table - all freshly cooked.   I will definitely return.   (Be aware that on-site car parking is limited.)",5,2020,09,19
224,Anniversary weekend,"We were so disappointed with the whole experience, Sasha and Gloria were fabulous at reception but that's where it ended, Bar staff extremely rude, outrageous prices for smaller than normal cocktails. We were told about a click and collect service where you'd pay by card and collect, when we approached a male at reception he said it finished at 11 that the kitchen was closed, when we checked in that wasn't what was explained to us. We had dinner booked in the hotel but decided to go out instead as no atmosphere, I can understand Co-Vid regulations and requirements and we were extra safe. It was our Anniversary so was very disappointing we won't be returning, but thank you to the amazing girls on reception you were all exceptional",3,2020,09,12
224,Amazing staff!,"I ordered a delivery to the hotel and had issues with it, long story short Michael and Leo at the reception jumped to help me out , they were making calls on my behalf and when the order finally arrived, Michael went up and delivered it by himself to my room instead of calling me to come down. I travel alot because of my work and i can honestly and truly say that the staff in this hotel is one of the best if not the best staff i ever had the honor to deal with! Thank you all and special thanks to Michael and leo ! 🙏🏼",5,2020,09,08
224,Lovely stay,"My partner treated me to a night at the hotel. The room was lovely,bed very comfortable & the bathroom was great too. My only suggestion is to have chromecast on the TV.

The restaurant was beautiful and the food delicious. I had steak.
Breakfast the next morning was nice too. You could choose your choice of egg. Pastries & fruit came included with an full Irish Breakfast.",5,2020,08,23
224,Great Hotel!,"Had a Lovely stay at this hotel, room was nice and clean. Amazing location, situated right on the canal. Ruslan and the rest of the staff were great to deal with and very welcoming upon arrival. Would reccomend and will stay again!",5,2020,08,20
224,Exceptional Clayton charlemont hotel Dublin!🌷,"We stayed at the hotel for 2 nites and had a lovely breakfast which was served by Andrea,this girl was very nice and  she knew how to treat the quests ! Top marks all the way!  I was very happy with the service second to none ,I would highly recommend as everything in the hotel was immaculate,from the food and the reception staff greet you with a big smile! The guy that showed us to our breakfast table,just lovely!  Now the room was beautiful and spotless ,amazing beds ,I just couldn’t believe how perfect  everything was even the lifts were great,the whole hotel is so professional and new hotel and the staff wow! I felt like a queen the whole time,a massive big shout out to you all,thankyou for all your kindness ,I will be back soon!",5,2020,08,17
224,Disorganised Mess,"Staff were friendly however, there was multiple incidences we experienced of mismanagement which ended up impacting our trip greatly.  

Firstly when I arrived I was checking in for two rooms which had been booked by my parents. I paid for the rooms then and there but only received one room key. When I went down later to get the second room key I was told that another person in our party needed to pick it up and fill out a form. I then sent my brother to do this, and no form needed to be signed. 

Secondly as a surprise my parents had added two bottles of champagne to be in the rooms. These were never put in the rooms and as we didn't know about them, we didn't know to ask for them. After leaving the hotel our parents asked about the champagne so we rang the hotel for a refund. On the phone we were told that the front desk manager wasn't there, but to come into the hotel tomorrow and our refund would be issued. The next day I went to the hotel and spoke to the same girl whilst she was standing by the manager. She said that the refund would take 20 days to be processed (this is a ridiculous amount of time to wait for money that is mine). She also said that she had never said on the phone to come in. I left quite angry, it was late in the day at that stage and she could've called at any time to tell me that the refund would take 20 days, I don't understand why she didn't call back once she had asked the manager about the refund policy.  

Lastly, my brother had left his passport in his hotel room. However, we had no idea it had been left there. He missed his flight and had to reschedule. If the hotel was organised properly they could've let us know that the passport was there either the day we called, or when I went in to supposedly get my refund. 

Overall I think the staff may have looked down at us because we are young (age 20-25) and they could get away with not looking after us properly. Had my parents not asked about the champagne which totalled to  ‎€70, I feel that the Clayton would not have gotten in contact with us to give us back the money we were owed. 

Overall I think the staff are untrained and unable to communicate with each other. This points to an issue with management.",1,2020,08,13
224,Group of 6 ,"Stayed here for two nights. Staff polite and professional in particular Dylan and Tomas from the bar. 
Hotel very clean and comfortable. 
Good location and would highly recommend this hotel. All six of our party were very impressed.  ",5,2020,08,09
224,"Amazing, top class! ","Me and my boyfriend booked here for 2 nights for our anniversary last minute after a bad experience with another hotel and we are SO glad we did! Amazing location, amazing service and amazing food :))",5,2020,08,04
224,Best Hotel In Dublin!,"I've been coming to Ireland umpteen times throughout my life, visiting family and sightseeing. On this occasion, my dad and I decided to treat ourselves and stay a couple of nights in Dublin. This was the perfect hotel. It's near the canal (perfect for jogging and walking) and its also near the best pubs/grubs around town. 

The staff were second to none and were very hospitable. Thank you to Gloria and the exceptional staff for making our stay comfortable, safe, and accommodating during Covid-19. You guys were stellar and provide us with the best service. 

The part of the hotel is that it has a fantastic restaurant and bar. Please order the chicken curry, its amazing! And you definitely don't want to miss out on the coffee! The latte art is on point! We valet our car for only $25 a night. With everything being so close, we walked everywhere. 

I was able to use the fitness center and work out by myself. You can book the fitness center for up to an hour. Everything was super clean and accessible. 

If you don't want to overpay for a comfortable night stay in city center and for excellent service, look no further and book here.",5,2020,07,31
224,Fantastic,"Stayed for one night - Two rooms - What a fantastic hotel -Central location,  Valet parking, easy check-in. Super friendly & helpful staff - Rooms were immaculate & there was a great feeling of safety in these strange times we find ourselves. After check-out they stored our luggage & kept our car parked till we left  @ 3.30pm. 
Mark, very attentively , served us what I can only describe as the best breakfast I've ever had in a hotel or restaurant - I will definitely be back & will also recommend to everyone - Bravo Clayton - You never missed a beat !",5,2020,07,23
224,"Super friendly and helpful staff, great location and fab decor","My husband, daughter and I stayed for one night in the hotel.  The hotel itself is very new, nice decor and has a really nice spacious, airy lobby area.  However the most impressive part of our stay was the staff, every staff member we encountered were super friendly and helpful.  The chef even cooked pancakes specially for my daughter despite them not being on the menu.  We were super impressed with both the hotel and fantastic staff.  I would highly recommend the hotel.",5,2020,07,15
224,Daily coffee trips,"I come here with my mum at the weekends for yum coffees and occasional lunches.
Mum comes every day for her sit down morning coffee on her own. She loves the atmosphere, delicious coffee, spotless hotel!
But mainly she loves the staff::: so friendly and helpful, especially Andrea!! 
Andrea also gave me a free coffee as  frontline worker. Thanks Andrea",5,2020,07,11
224,Post COVID experience,"It would do your heart good to experience the care and attention to detail that is the Clayton Hotel Charlemont post COVID. Rooms are steamed after guest departure then regular thoroughly cleaned then steamed again and the door is sealed! Every effort is made to make you feel safe. Gloria on reception was patience incarnate, the lovely barman from Galway equally so and the dinner is timed to ensure as few people as possible at once in the very spacious dining room. Due to current restrictions of course there is no buffet breakfast but this did not diminish the very high standards of the scrumptious food provided which was piping hot and very varied. Overall I would not miss a heartbeat in recommending the Clayton Hotel to any one in need of tlc . Well done guys I will be back",5,2020,07,06
224,Amazing Breakfast,"I have visited the hotel earlier this month. The location is very convenient and the breakfast is one of the best. Very friendly staff especially Amanda at the buffet breakfast, very professional and friendly.",5,2020,04,02
224,Great hotel ,"Can’t fault this hotel, extremely reasonably priced for 2 nights and 5 of us it was around £460!! Fifteen mins taxi from temple bar and some clubs and pubs around the area if you don’t want to venture out. 
Bed was lovely and comfy, food spacious, really good shower! 
Only complaint would be there were 3 of us staying in the room and we only had 1 towel and 2 tea cups - little more attention to detail.
I would definitely return.",5,2020,03,02
224,"Great hotel, friendly staff",Booked accomodation for two nights in the Clayton for a group of 15. Rebecca in reservations and Ciara were very accomodation when booking and the staff were all great during the stay. Let us check in early as the rooms were ready. Thank you! ,5,2020,03,01
224,A Great Stay at The Clayton!,"Had a great time at the Clayton! The staff were lovely and very helpful, food was great and I have to mention the valet driver, Damir Nemet was extremely friendly and had a great sense of humour! Overall our stay at the hotel was uplifting and we lived in comfort through out our stay!",5,2020,02,23
224,Excellent,We came for a birthday night treat in Dublin. The staff we very friendly and professional. I had requested a canal facing room which they gave no problem. And left a birthday cake and card for my husband which was such a lovely touch. Would highly recommended. For a good sized hotel in the city it has a lovely calm atmosphere.,5,2020,02,20
224,Enjoyable stay,"I stayed with my husband & young son last Saturday night as a little mini break/Valentine getaway. I was very impressed with how helpful & attentive the staff were, check in was quick and we got a warm welcome. 
The public areas were pleasant to sit in & very clean. Our room had a lovely view over the canal & the little in-room treats were a lovely surprise. 
We ate in the restaurant & chose from the Valentines set menu, we were very happy with the offering as it included some of our favourites! I picked the cod which was delicious and paired lovely with orzo pasta. Our breakfast was very enjoyable and there was alot of variety on offer... a smoothie and mini muffin made our son very happy. A very enjoyable stay!",5,2020,02,18
224,Recent visit,We recently stayed here my husband is in a wheelchair I can honestly say from his perspective it was the best hotel he has stayed in . The disabled rooms are of a very high standard and the staff were more than accommodating I would highly recommend.  We will be back.,5,2020,02,17
224,Lovely stay and a real treat,"My husband planned the stay as a surprise for my birthday and it was a real treat! The room overlooking the canal was great and the Rituals toiletries were much appreciated. The food was very good and the hotel had a great vibe. I found the waiter in the restaurant a vit over fussy. He was amittedly,trying to help in view of my fish allergy but he started to give me inaccurate advice about the wine.  The hotel obviously takes allergies seriously and the menu has things clearly marked, so it was a surprise they couldn't advice which vegetarian wine they served. 
This wouldnt put me off going back howevwr and given the good location we would definitely recommend it.",4,2020,02,17
224,"Nice hotel, but be careful in room choice","Stayed at this hotel on valentines night.  Executive King room advertised with free 'treats', a bath, bottle of prosecco on arrival and, above all, corner windows with a spacious room overlooking the canal (well, at least that's what the blurb and pictures of the room tell you from their adverts).

No treats (not much of a concern).

No bath (slight concern).

Prosecco yes, but initially we were charged 40 euro extra for it before politely pointing out to the receptionist that it was to be included in the price.  No big deal, but honestly, how difficult was it to get it correct!

Apparently an Executive King room (major concern).  After questioning at reception whether we had been give the wrong room, apparently we were indeed in an Executive King room.  Wasn't anything like the pictures on their website (or, indeed, any independent booking site).  Room was very small.  No canal view and certainly no corner windows with a bright airy feel.  In fact, it looked onto the corridors of the other part of the hotel.  Bathroom was tiny.  One wonders how many other people have expected their room to be that which is advertised.

We booked this hotel for the room only.  Lots of other choices, but we chose it as we wanted our trip to Ireland to be special and so paid extra for what we thought would be an excellent room.  We left disappointed and slightly underwhelmed.",3,2020,02,17
224,Great Hotel,"what a fantastic hotel. just 5 mins walk from the bus stop for the 757 airport service and also handy for the tram.
we arrived at 11.00 even though checkin wasn't until 15.00 and were going to ask if we could leave our cases there while we went to get some brunch. When we asked at the reception we were told our room was ready  which was a bonus. The reception staff were great very friendly and knowledgeable giving great advice regarding places  to eat etc.
The room we were allocated was superb and had every thing you could ask for.
The food in the restaurant was  also outstanding we ate in their for our first night which was a Valentines day special. great food and great service.
all in all we cant fault this hotel and would defiantly stay again and would highly recommend to anybody else.
Thanks to all the staff at the Charlemont for making our stay even more enjoyable. ",5,2020,02,17
224,Valentines weekend,"Beautiful hotel, very clean, rooms spacious. Staff very helpful and friendly, bar/ restaurant staff very attentive.
We stayed in the hotel for 3 course dinner with a complimentary glass of prosseco and I have to say that the food was amazing. Real fine dining. Beautiful. We will be back even though its not really central location, tram stop just around the corner and will bring you to city centre in few minutes. Highly recommend.",5,2020,02,16
224,Really nice place,Lovely hotel with great friendly helpful staff.  Spacious rooms with very comfortable beds and slept well as it very quiet.  Good food and nice location.  Would definitely recommend it for a stay in Dublin.,4,2020,02,12
224,Miss,"I've had many overnight stays here for business purposes.. and I can truthfully say Demir nemet is the most professional, attentive manager with excellent interpersonal/hospitality skills which really makes the Clayton an absolute pressure, and comfortable and stress free experience overall. I highly recommend this Hotel in the heart of Dublin city, five stars xxRegards. Heidi & Alison",5,2020,02,11
224,A weekend of Rugby,"Thank you Joscelyn, 
General feedback  is as per our normal report, 
Rooms were lovely, clean, spacious and warm, 
Breakfast was great and bar food was unusual but very delectable and nice. 
Staff were very nice, helpful, and polite with some great personalities. 
Generally everybody thought the place was great, and were all asking about next year already.
So yes these guys done good as usual, well done and thanks a million to all involved for making our stay a great occasion .",5,2020,02,11
224,Excellent,"Stayed here on the 8th of February for going to riverdance with my family. We stayed in two rooms, so clean, spacious! Ela in the bar/lounge/restaurant was so attentive. She was so professional, helpful and wanted to help us in any way she could. Nothing was an issue with her and she was so efficient, so thank you ela. She is a great asset to this hotel. Also, a man in reception possibly originated from India? Went above and beyond for us when he went outside onto the road to flag down a taxi for us, we did not expect him to do this and were shocked when he did this, talk about going the extra mile! I’m a fellow hotelier so when I experience this, it makes me so happy. So thank you to that man and I am so sorry I didn’t catch your name!!!! All staff overall were wonderful. Thank you. We will be back next time we have an event in Dublin!",5,2020,02,10
224,Beautiful hotel in great location ,"Great stay.
Helpful, attentive staff.
Room was spacious with amazing views over the canal. 
Quick walk to restaurants and bars (grove road cafe on the far corner is amazing for breakfast) 
So clean and really nicely finished
Didn’t eat so not sure of the food.
Would stay again in a heartbeat",5,2020,02,08
224,Great staff Clayton Charlemont,Great Hotel with a wonderful staff! On the reception Leo and Graziella on the public area both very kind and great attention!!! Everything was very clean . Have no words to everyone. Congratulations!!,5,2020,02,02
224,Perfect hotel for a short trip in Dublin,"The hotel is very clean and modern, the staff is friendly. The rooms are spacious and beautiful just like the rest of the interiors. 5 minutes to the city center with the bus or the train, but you can also walk if you want and grab a delicious coffee or a sandwich in one of the many cute cafès on the way :)",5,2020,02,01
224,Amazing stay!!,"I cannot put into words how great this hotel is!! Me and a good friend of mine were staying in the hotel for our staff party!! Upon arrived we were welcomed by Gloria, the lovely receptionist was so polite and helped us immensely!! Towards the end of the night me and my friend had to get a taxi, Sasha, the reception surpervisor was also kind and informed us of all the bus routes we could get instead!! 

We returned to the hotel quite early in the morning around 4am, but regardless of the time we were once again welcomed to the hotel by Leo and Dariush!! We were shocked of how polite and nice the two gentlemen were!! We also had some help from one member of their accommodation team (Grazielle) lovely young lady!! 

We then had an amazing breakfast, with so much variety or food and drinks!! Cristiane was looking after us, she provided us with hot coffee and a lovely stories about Dublin!! The restaurant manager, Alfredo also gave us some recommendations where we should go for lunch around the area!! 

The hotel is absolutely amazing and the all the members of staff are extremely helpful and kind!! Another aspect that also shocked us was how fast the check out process was, we simply gave, Jordan, the morning receptionist, our keys and that was it, Jordan even went the extra mile and recommended some sites we should visit while in Dublin!!

I have absolutely nothing bad to say about the hotel, the location is perfect, there’s busses and the LUAS just around the corner, a massive variety of restaurants and bars just behind the hotel, and honesty the list will keep going on and on!!! 

Well done Clayton Hotel Charlemont, I would definitely be returning very soon!!
",5,2020,01,27
224,fantastic hotel,"We had a great stay at this hotel! The staff was very nice and welcomed us very friendly, so we immediately felt very welcome. The hotel and the room were very quiet, we slept great, the bed was very comfortable. The hotel was very clean and well maintained and the facilities are also great. You walk a bit into the city (about 20min), but the way there is very nice and you can already see a lot of the city on the way, so it doesn't matter. The airport bus stops 8 min from the hotel. We felt very comfortable here from the first second and would definitely book the hotel again immediately. (We hadn't booked breakfast, so we can't say anything about it). A huge thank you to the staff for the great work they are doing! :-)",5,2020,01,27
224,Night away,My self and my husband stayed here for 1 night 25th Jan 2020...  I can honestly say from the moment we walked in we were greeted with a smile and a hello from the gorgeous Girl on the front desk Jordan was her name  she was exceptional!! Professional friendly and very helpful. Our Room was just beautiful located in there georgion area of the hotel. The personal touch made it very special.The bedroom was very spacious and the super king sized bed was super comfortable. We ordered room service twice a nice treat on a night away.... food was delious on both occasions and I would highly recommend there truffle fries and and there in house cocktails too!! I would highly recommend the hotel for anyone who wants the city vibe without all the house...I would rate everything 10/10!!,5,2020,01,26
224,Very Nice Hotel,"Stayed here on a Saturday night with my partner, we travelled to Dublin to meet up with some friends! Hotel was beautiful, very luxurious feel, quiet and check-in was excellent! We arrived early and they gave us an available room which was great! Breakfast was very good, tasty and wide variety! Location was good... 15/20 mins walk from hustle /shops areas! We appreciate being that little bit off the centre for a quieter stay! Pretty good value for money! 

Only issues we had: 
- the room had an adjoining door which meant we could hear our loud neighbours early in the morning, actually woke us up! 
- one female staff member at breakfast who seated us was very rude and unpleasant, she displayed a ‘couldn’t be bothered’ attitude and made us feel quite uncomfortable that we would dare ask her for help! The rest of the staff were very friendly and happy to serve us! In my opinion, she let the hotel and the rest of the staff down as they were all making a great impression! 
",4,2020,01,26
224,Reccomend,"Absolutely great. Very friendly staff, specially Cristina. We were suppose to move to Hilton next door after 2 days of stay. Due Cristina's hospitality we decided extend our stay. Definitely reccomend to stay here.

224,Great hotel,"The hotel was clean and comfortable, the amenities were good with a large tv with Chromecast to watch Netflix, YouTube. It is located in a quiet area that is close to a Luas line taking you into Dublin centre, dundrum etc. My stay included breakfast with a variety of options to suit everybody. I would definitely stay again",4,2020,01,03
224,Choose another place ,"We do not enjoy our stay here.  This hotel is Not In a Central location.  The rooms are tiny. The hotel is clean, but not much to it.  Very basic we had to upgrade because the rooms are tiny.  Also, this is our Honeymoon and we received a nice note, but nothing more.  Very disappointed don’t come here for a special occasion they won’t upgrade you or even leave a Bottle of wine complimentary.  Spend your money elsewhere this place is terrible.",2,2020,01,02
224,Great location — shame about the parking!,"I like Clayton hotels and have stayed in most of the Dublin properties but up to recently, I had never stayed at the Charlemont location as it is one of the newer ones. The location is great on the canal and it is walking distance to Stephens Green but not the best choice if you're driving as they offer only valet parking and the rates are not cheap.",4,2019,12,30
224,A+ Highly recommended,Lovely stay friendly staff. Great Manhattan in the lobby bar and breakfast (included with room)  the following morning was absolutely delicious. The staff seem happy in this place which is a good sign.,5,2019,12,30
224,"Lovely stay, delicious breakfast!","Lovely hotel, we was upgraded on arrival! Room was very spacious, loved the extra touches (bath robes and slippers). We booked breakfast when we arrived, it’s cheaper to buy it the night before than on the day. Breakfast spread was delicious, lots of choice, including cooked Irish breakfast, pastries, cereals etc. Location is great not too far away from anything, would recommend The Barge which is literally a minute walk away for dinner.",5,2019,12,15
224,Great Coffee and Staff,"This has become a part of my daily routine, to take a coffee here and walk along the Canal to a bus stop. Thank you Eva, my regular barista, for boosting my mornings with wonderful flat whites :) The staff here does know how to make a coffee.",5,2019,12,12

Highly recommended. The coffee is good too!!",5,2019,12,11
224,Birthday Weekend Trip to Dublin,"Liked  · Hotel is brand new, lovely entrance and lobby area. Bar area really nice too. Room and bathroom really modern also.
Disliked  · We booked the best room in the hotel and payed a premium price for it. We arrived home after wandering around Dublin for the day and at 6.30pm we found the maid only just cleaning our room. We had to ask her to leave as we had a reservation to get ready for and was left with no towels to shower, duvets on floor, cleaning equipment on the bed. When we asked the front desk why this was left so late we were told that they had Emirates staff in the hotel that day and they were priority. We were also asked if we a do not disturb sign on our door, yet we hadn’t been in the room from 11am! The staff were not one bit apologetic and tried to tell us there was no manager in for us to complain to. Yet there was a manager in, he came over as we was complaining and tried to resolve the issue with a complimentary breakfast. We was then charged for this ‘complimentary’ breakfast of which we didn’t even attend the following morning! Again by rude front of house staff - who would not take the breakfast off of our bill before confirming with management.  Overall a really nice new hotel on appearance yet clearly do not have experienced staff who understand any level of customer service. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a pleasant Dublin experience.",2,2019,12,09
224,Nice New Shiny Hotel,"Good location for transport links, easy access to the city and very clean.

Easy check in, pleasant staff, nice bar area (very expensive drinks), well appointed  room (save the bath and poor shower), reasonable internet and a wide and varied selection for breakfast.

One complaint - the breakfast sausages, please get better quality ones and please put on some mushrooms.

Other than that, a great place to stop.",4,2019,12,06
224,Comfortable Hotel and Nice Staff,"Our daughter booked us a room in the Clayton Charlemont on the day we arrived in Dublin.  We were able to get the Executive Room with a king sized bed, knowing that we'd be spending the next two nights in a double bed.

The room was comfortable but we had to keep the window open to cool the room down.  We smelled smoke all night, likely from something in the neighborhood.  We ordered room service because we were exhausted.  Food was good. 

The staff was friendly and helpful.",4,2019,12,05
224,"Friendly Staff, Good Location.","Stayed for four nights and was very happy with the location and service. Professional staff on reception and the bar. The room was a little small but clean and adequate for my stay.

Checkout fast and no hassle.",4,2019,11,29
224,Good value accommodation ,"Stayed two midweek nights b/b.
Check in efficient and helpful. Good sized and comfortable room. 
This is a quite stylish and modern hotel and for anyone requiring to be near city centre, it’s ideal.
Breakfast is buffet and similar to many others in the area.
Recommended as good value for location and quality",4,2019,11,28

224,Beautiful  Hotel & Lovely staff,"Recently stayed at the Clayton Hotel- Charlemont and we had a amazing stay. There was 5 of us in our party, From the time we walked into the hotel the feeling of welcome and the ambiance of the hotel was amazing. The staff was so friendly and extremely helpful. On check-in they were so efficient explaining things to you and all the time making your feel welcome and greeting  all  the guest with a smile on there face. The girl that checked us in was called Jordan and she was just  brilliant and even on our check-out she was fantastic arranging  taxis and helping us with our travel plans.  The food and rooms were outstanding and the staff could really not have done enough. They were also celebrating there 1st birthday so they have offered some chocolate and Prosecco  for guest which was a really nice touch.  Really lovely hotel and great location for city center will definitely be returning,",5,2019,11,25
224,Great night in Charlemont,"We were lucky enough to win a voucher for a night in the Clayton Charlemont. We had a brilliant time. The hotel is impressive to behold with a large lobby that incorporates old architecture and new, we were greeted by very friendly staff who looked after us, our room was excellent. A nice spacious room with a large bathroom and comfortable bed. And the robes to boot. The hotel is quite central, and we found some nice pubs and restaurants nearby which were very easy to access. The only is only a 10minute walk from Camden Street. The breakfast is probably the highly of the trip. A brilliant spread, very attractively presented, no better way to spend a Sunday morning.

224,Coffees,"I love coming here for daily my caffeine fix, Giovanni and Eva make me smile every time! Bestest coffee in town served by the even better baristas thanks Govanni and Eva 💓 you never fail to make my day that little bit better xx",5,2019,11,18
224,Comfortable stay,"I stayed here for work for 2 nights. Was given a deluxe twin room initially which had a double bed and a single making the room very small, however as Id booked an executive double the staff on reception quickly changed my room to a double in the executive floor. However don’t be fooled by the photos on the website of the executive rooms. The one I got was the same as the deluxe but with the addition of a coffee maker, nicer toiletries and bathrobes. From the photo it made me think I was getting a much larger room. Apart from that the hotel is great. Comfy beds, good space in the lobby to relax and a great restaurant. A 10 minute walk to St Stephens Green so very central. Rooms were very quiet. ",5,2019,11,12
224,Top Class from beginning to end ,"Drop the car outside the main door, handover the keys at check-in and it's there minutes after you request it back.. just a small sample of the wonderful experience that is the Clayton, Charlemont. The friendliness of the staff puts you at ease and they all go the extra mile and seem so happy to do so... most genuine. We did'nt have an evening meal, due to other commitments,  but had breakfast on both mornings and it was superb and what a wonderful setting looking out on the canal .. it's difficult to come up with an improvisation on breakfast but the scrambled eggs were truely sensational as was the choice of fresh fruits, porridge, cold meat and cheeses, pastries and breads. Anyone travelling from the West, definitely look into this location on the Canal as Luas close-by and taxis to city centre less than 12 euro for 3 passengers. Looking forward to being back next weekend!!",5,2019,11,10
224,Great welcome at 23H00!,"We travelled from South Africa leaving at 06H30 and arriving at London and onwards to Dublin arriving at 21H45
When we got to the Charlemont we were greeted by the duty manager and given a comfortable quiet room for two nights The breakfast was delicious and the service good We recommend this s Hotel because of the personal and attentive service we received",5,2019,10,30
224,Fantastic hotel and service,"We spent 5 nights at the Clayton Hotel Charlemont and enjoyed the experience tremendously.
On our arrival we were enthusiastically greeted by Damir, the Guest Relations guru. After settling in our room, Damir knocked on our door and cheerfully gave us a little milk cup for our coffee/tea and Cadbury chocolates.
The room was large and immaculate, the bathroom clean and modern. Two robes, the softest we ever touched were provided for our use, as were coffee, tea, bottled water, and cookies on daily basis.
Every staff member we came in contact with, was courteous, friendly, and helpful.
The hotel was quiet and comfortable. We couldn’t have asked for more!",5,2019,10,28
224,MR. P.Lee,"Stayed here for 1 night for Dublin Marathon 2019, While the hotel & rooms are nice & clean, was disappointed with service when asked if we could get a shower after Marathon, answer was you'd need to pay additional late check out fee €25, how long was that for? 1hr after 12.00, would struggle to get back to Hotel for 1pm. Breakfast another €17.50 for Tea & bowl of porridge, couldn't really  have a full Irish & then run 26.2 miles. Suffice to say won't stay here again, certainly would not recommend to anyone running Marathon next year.",3,2019,10,27
224,Nice & New,We enjoyed our stay at The Charlemont. It is brand new and has a wonderful lobby area that you can visit or eat in. The rooms are very nicely decorated and the bathroom is bright and clean. The location is is good but everything is a walk or a short taxi ride. The service we received was excellent from all the employees that we encountered throughout our stay and the drinks/food were very good as well. We would definitely stay again.,5,2019,10,20
224,Wonderful stay,"The staff are first class. Customer friendly, helpful and pleasant. Special thanks to Georgi for going the extra mile helping us. Cristina, Danna, and Gloria were very helpful and generous with their time. The Hotel was clean, service was great. We also appreciated the location. Close to the city center, and far enough from the crowd.",5,2019,10,15
224,Very nice hotel! ,"We stayed here for 2 nights while on a tour. Very nice, clean, modern hotel. Staff was very friendly and efficient. The only complaint I have is the location. Was really a ways away from the downtown area.",5,2019,10,06
224,Modern clean spacious 4 star,"Well located in south city centre near tram stop but easily walkable to Stephens Green. Clean, modern hotel with a spacious lobby area good sized well equipped standard room - ours overlooked canal - very quiet, air con, ceiling to floor window, comfy beds and good bathroom. Lobby had nice areas to lounge in and also good work stations and excellent coffee was available. WiFi was simple to access and fast, USB ports everywhere. Staff were pleasant and efficient. Highly recommend for business or leisure. ",4,2019,10,02
224,Exceptional Experience,"My partner and I had a two night stay in a modern and spacious deluxe room at this centrally located Dublin hotel as part of a Britain and Ireland tour. From check in to check out we were very impressed with the courteousness and can do attitude of all of the hotel staff that we interacted with during our short stay with a special mention to Frank Hafner who when we had a problem with our hot water service on the 11th July, our first night, arranged for and assisted us in moving to a new room all in under an hour, thankyou once again Frank. We could not fault the hotel's dining options, in the mornings we took advantage of the hotel's ""Vitality Breakfast""  which offered a wide variety of options including cereals, fresh fruit and juice, cold meats and cooked meals, in the evenings we ordered hamburgers, sandwiches and salads from the Lockside Bar menu and thoroughly enjoyed each meal. We would gladly recommend this hotel to anyone considering visiting Dublin in the future.",5,2019,09,26
224,"Lovely hotel, central location!","We found the hotel to be lovely, it was in a nice location along the canal and only about a 15 minute walk to the city centre. The rooms were clean and stylish and the staff were friendly. 

We managed to get on street parking that was free overnight on the weekend but check the signs to make sure it is free when you stay.

Overall good value and would recommend.

Overall ",4,2019,09,25
224,Very good customer service ,"I was very impressed by the hospitality of the hotel staff specially during breakfast. I would like to highlight the great service of Cristiane from Brazil who assisted me and my friend during the buffet and very politely recommended some places to go in the city when asked. Good job! 👏🏼👏🏼
I'm looking forward to coming back to the beautiful city.",4,2019,09,22
224,New and Old Mixed,"It is a quality place for business travekers, lots of places to sit and have an informal meeting as well as formal meetings.   A portion of the hotel is an old Victorian historic home that has been converted. The the other portion of the hotel is all brand new. It has a large lobby, restaurant, bar and workout facility. I am a fan of hotels that have quality gyms. This hotel has a good quality gym for a traveler hotel. It also sits close to the canal and green trails. Lots of places to walk and run outside. Within one minute there's a pub next door and within 5 minutes you can be to another dozen pubs and restaurants. Convenient location and close to Trinity college and other sites. I appreciate this hotel and the staff is very friendly. I've found the bulk of the Irish to be kind and friendly.  ",4,2019,09,19
224,Clayton hotel stay,"We stayed here for three nights at the start of our tour. This is a new hotel (1-2 years old) and it shows.  Everything is clean , shiny and not worn out.  Staff was great.   Helpful and accommodating.  Morning paper was available.  Our package included breakfast which was filling.  A plus is the pub/restaurant next door.  A convenience store was across the street.  It is an easy walk to St Stephens Green and the National Museum....also shopping, eating and more drinking.
The room was clean and comfortable.  The bed was between a king and queen.  Multiple USB outlets are available.",5,2019,09,18
224,A big disappointment ,"In the beginning there was the “deluxe double”. The room was a little pricey but the hotel is brand new so we decided to give it a try. Checked in for three nights to a room that was tiny. So much for deluxe. We called the desk and asked for a larger room. The next one we were shown wasn’t enough of a change so we decided to stay where we were. Our room was on the ground floor and the windows faced a concrete wall not the Grand Canal. Later we were sitting in the bar and saw an ad for an executive double for €40 more. We checked it out but it wasn’t much bigger. 

Then we went to the bar where we got really bad service. The waitress was not doing anything but was always looking the other way. During the next two days we were in the bar area and consistently had terrible service. One day at 5pm a cleaner comes through hoovering! The wait staff doesn’t make eye contact so I would hold my arm in the air to get attention. 

Then to bed. My wife pulled down the duvet and found a dark hair twice as long as hers in the middle of the sheet…YECH!

Clearly a management problem. We won’t stay there again. ",2,2019,09,15
224,"Lovely hotel, great location.","The location of this hotel is perfect, away from the hustle and bustle of the city but close enough to local transportation to get around Dublin.  Staff were really friendly and the hotel and our room was spotless.  Breakfast was perfect, my only suggestion is that they need another coffee machine in the dining room for breakfast as it was very busy and often a queue.

We had our evening meals at One Bistro at the top of the road which was approximately a five minute walk from the hotel.  Would definitely recommend this hotel and we would choose it again when we return to Dublin.",5,2019,09,13
224,New and Clean,"Stayed 2 nights through booking.com and hotel was new and clean- front desk is not warm and fuzzy! Weird that they have a double and a twin vs a queen or king g room! Bathroom was new with a high bathtub/shower combo and a little completed to operate. The free WiFi was great and there is a tea kettle in room for tea or instant coffee and 2 water Bottles  are provided daily!   
The hotel has a restaurant, bar and nice lobby! It is convenient walk to St. Stephens Park and restaurants and shops are about 15-20 min walk. Only disappointment was that room was not cleaned by 4:30 pm when we returned from a day of sightseeing and wanted to relax. Breakfast was not included and cost 23 euros per day!",4,2019,09,09
224,Excellent,"Wow ! This hotel is just fabulous,yes it’s fairly new and so it should but the it’s just great ! The staff are so friendly & helpful,the place is spotlessly clean,the rooms are spacious,the bed is unbelievably comfortable,the breakfast was lovely etc etc 
It’ so quiet but the city is only a 15 minute walk away so ideal in my opinion.
We were celebrating my birthday so a lovely touch by the hotel was some cake in the room on our arrival-(see photo) 
Would not hesitate to stay here again but thank you Clayton for your contribution to our wonderful long weekend away in Dublin",5,2019,09,09
224,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed in this Hotel recently, it's a lovely place to stay staff were brilliant, rooms spotless, bed comfortable but  while the continental breakfast look very nice the cooked breakfast was a big let down, over cooked bacon, sausages looked to be boiled not fried not to my taste Irish people like their sausages grilled or fried I requested poached eggs my breakfast was finished before they arrived, maybe it just was a bad day for the kitchen staff. They charge for parking €25.",4,2019,09,07
224,First Class,"Wonderful Staff first and foremost.10/10
 Great Service. Beautiful rooms spotlessly clean. Really great breakfast. Great location. Management presence very positive.Great value for money

224,Amazing breakfast experience ,"I stayed only 24h in Clayton Hotel but it was amazing. It’s very comfortable and the breakfast was amazing. The staff are all very kind but specially Cristiane, who took care of me, she was very sweet and caring! I highly recommend the hotel ",5,2019,09,02
224,Quiet stay.,Spent 2 days here recovering from jet lag. Very quiet room with excellent bed. Clean. Situated walking distance from cafes  pubs and shopping area of Temple Bar without the noise.  Staff very helpful with all features of hotel. Breakfast excellent.  Will definitely stay again. ,5,2019,09,01
224,Home from Home ,"I have stayed here several times over the last few months and consider this place a home from home. The staff are fantastic and can't do enough for you. Eva on the morning coffee bar knows my order and always has time to pass the time of day with a smile, she knows my order and makes the best flat white. The reception team are quick and efficient and Simon on the bar in the evening. The food is lovely small tasty plates available. ",5,2019,08,28
224,Second Stay,"This was my second stay at the Clayton Charlemont because the location is great, close to the tram station, clean, modern hotel with exceptional service.  Thank you Georgi for all of your assistance.  I highly recommend this property.",5,2019,08,27
224,Great time in Dublin,"Hotel is in easy reach of lots of the main attractions. Our room was spacious and the bed was really comfy. Breakfast was excellent. The hotel is really new with character and friendly, welcoming staff. Would recommend if your budget allows.",5,2019,08,27
224,Hot Chocolate and Pastry,"I'm here very often to grab a hot chocolate with some pastry for take away for a €5, it's a really good deal for me. I've also received a loyality card points from Eve a stuff member. Highly recommended !",5,2019,08,26
224,Great Coffee made by Eva!,"Quality coffee made by quality people.
Always friendly, better experience than standard coffee shops + no queueing. 
Thank you Eva for helping me start the day everyday on the right foot! 
Best Macchiato in town!
Thank you!",5,2019,08,26
224,Clayton Charlemont St,Just had a really nice stay in this hotel. The staff are so friendly throughout the whole hotel. Valet parking was perfect and my car waiting as promised the next morning. Beds are super comfy and decor is lovely. Had some food in the bar and it was very tasty. If you’re looking for somewhere within price range and close to the centre then this is the place.,5,2019,08,22
224,Lovely hotel but very overpriced,"Rooms are clean and bed was very comfortable, staff seemed friendly also. The location is great and some nice bars and restaurants in the area. The car park is very expensive and the room service is a Rob! Also for over €200 a night you would think breakfast would be included",3,2019,08,22
224,"Awesome Location, Lovely Staff, Great Coffee","Beautiful hotel newly renovated in an awesome location!
Small but good gym in the hotel, but right on the canal so great for running and cycling.
Eva the barista is awesome, her coffee & humour is a great way to start the morning.
Will be staying here again soon.",5,2019,08,21
224,"Large, modern, comfortable hotel","This hotel is not quaint and has no character, however it has a spacious, welcoming lobby and the staff behind the desk were helpful, maybe not Irish, perhaps from Eastern Europe as most hotel staff seem to be in Dublin. Michael, the Concierge, however, is Irish and was very helpful about travelling in Ireland. The room was very comfortable and quiet. Walking distance to Camden street and St Stephen’s Green and Grafton street. Pub on the corner, The Barge, is excellent for breakfast and meals in general.",5,2019,08,19
224,Great value stay,"Managed to get a great room at a great price for two of us. The room had a double bed and a single bed and was well equipped and well presented.
I’ve stayed in hotels in Dublin that are more central, and they’ve charged hideous prices for tiny rooms, so getting this room at the low price I did was a very welcome bonus. Plus, The Clayton Charlemont isn’t even that far away from the city centre. It’s a 10 to 15 minute walk from St Stephens Green and Grafton Street, and a two minute walk to a LUAS stop (trams). For me, perfectly situated for the trip.",5,2019,08,18
224,Luxury hotel at mid-range price!,"What a gem of a hotel. A 10-15 minute walk into the heart of Dublin City Centre and steps from the charming village of Ranelagh. One of the most immaculate hotels I've ever stayed in. Incredibly friendly staff, especially Eva, who served deliciously brewed coffee every morning. Nicely appointed rooms, very comfortable bed and modern bathroom. Beautiful lounge and sitting areas to enjoy drinks and light bar food. This is a GREAT value and highly recommend and would stay there again in a heartbeat.",5,2019,08,08
224,Hotel and Bar,"We went to Dublin for a few days as couple, choosing the Clayton Hotel Charlemont as our location to stay and sleep. It was a very good descision!!! Eva on the bar made us happy with her excellent coffee creation. But also the other collegues, for example Leo in the restaurant, do a very good job, looking forward to make everyone happy. We would go there again. Thank you for these days 😊",5,2019,08,07
224,Lovley staff,"Great hotel look very nice inside and lovley staff. Spent a great time there. Blond lady Ewa welcome as with big smile, she was very nice and polite and also she made a very tasty cappucino. Will come back again :):):):):)",5,2019,08,06
224,Great coffee and service,"I was in the Clayton hotel in charlemont today with work and was served by Eva, I got great coffee and the service was excellent. The coffee dock was busy but Eva looked after everyone very well and was very nice. I will be coming back again.",5,2019,08,06
224,Amazing Ice Latte,"I’m in this place few times per month, always getting coffee on my way to work from an amazing Ewa and last time she made for me Ice Latte which was one of the best I’ve ever drank. I do really recommend this place!",5,2019,08,05
224,Weekend away,"Excellent facilities and not too far away from the centre of Dublin, about a 10 minute brisk walk. Rooms were excellent and we would definitely return here. Breakfast was also excellent with a huge amount of choice. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly.
",5,2019,08,04
224,A very welcoming hotel!,"Our family of 12 stayed at the Charlemont for 4 days at our start of our tour of Ireland. Excellent hotel with very nice rooms, a friendly informative staff, excellent breakfast and a convenient location to both the city center and public transportation. Lot's of great restaurants near there as well.",5,2019,08,02
224,Amazing coffee with the best service.,"I have popped in here for a coffee on my way to work, essential with a 7.30am start. The staff on the coffee dock are always very friendly and make super coffee. Today Eva made me a latte with a shot of syrup - perfect thank you. I also had a croissant which they sell as part of a deal for €5. If you have time relax in the comfortable chairs. I miss my regular barista Lucia who is always super helpful and goes the extra mile to make sure the customers have a good start to their day. Keep up the good work.",4,2019,08,01
224,Great Hotel with Excellent Service!,"My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay at the Clayton Hotel Charlemont while visiting Dublin last week.  We were greeted at the desk by Christina who was very helpful and gave us a great recommendation for a quaint and authentic Italian restaurant nearby, I Monelli.  We visited the restaurant on our second night in Dublin and it did not disappoint.  The food was amazing!  Christina was also very knowledgeable about the area and gave us tips for getting around and assisted us with our request for extra towels, pillows, etc.  I would highly recommend this hotel when staying in Dublin!",5,2019,07,31
224,Great new hotel,"I spent 1 week at Clayton Hotel Charlemont with my partner and we were totally satisfied with the hotel. Nice, big, comfortable bed, clean rooms and solution oriented, kind and helpful staff at breakfast time (especially Ms Andrea Nemeth). Coffee could be better quality (100% arabica), but it was our only problem :-)",5,2019,07,30
224,Great coffee!,We're local so never need to stay in the hotel.  However we regularly drop in for coffee and the foyer/reception/bar  areas are always very well maintained & spotless. They do an excellent coffee here and the barista James is very pleasant and professional even though we only ever buy coffee from him. All in all a very pleasant experience.,4,2019,07,28
224,Great stay at Clayton Hotel Charlemont. Ottimo,"We spent 2 nights at CHC and we experienced a great stay. Good location to city centre (just on the nice Canal) and high quality of hotel services.
The hotel is new and you benefit of this.
Assistants are nice and professional and a special mention goes to Cristina (grazie per la simpatia e la gentilezza).
Ottima scelta per coppie e per famiglie.

",5,2019,07,28
224,Perfect stay,We booked two rooms to share for our family of 5.  I did not expect to get inter-connecting rooms but we did which was so nice!  The front desk check in was smooth as well as friendly.  We found the hotel to be in top notch condition.  Very very clean and well run.  I would highly recommend this hotel if you are visiting Dublin.  We walked back to the hotel one evening from St. Stephens Green and found it to be about a 20 minute walk but easy.  We also took advantage of the Luas tram which was across the street and for a few coins we were able to travel into town even quicker!  Great hotel.,5,2019,07,23
224,Pleasant Stay!,"Our first time to stay at Clayton Hotel Charlemont. It was overall a wonderful experience. Very clean, modern looking hotel. Staff are all very friendly. I would stay here again when we come back to Dublin. ",5,2019,07,22
224,Dublin trip,"This was in my opinion a 5* stay in  4* hotel.  The staff at the reception were very friendly and extremely professional.  The dining team of Ms Nemeth, Christine, Grace and their colleagues were on hand at all times to ensure the dining experience was an exceptional one.  The room and bathroom was spotless and well maintained during our stay.  Dublin was a great city to visit made very special by our experiences at The Clayton.  Thank you to all the team for making my Birthday trip one I will always remember for the right reasons.",5,2019,07,21
224,A really nice stay,This newly opened hotel located in a great neighbourhood was a delight to stay at. Amazing service with a smooth check-in and check-out. The room was clean and fresh with good-quality products in the bathroom. The bed and sheets were clean and nice quality!,4,2019,07,21
224,Nice modern hotel,We've stayed in Dublin many times but our first time around Charlemont. The Clayton Hotel has been fantastic. Upon arriving the check in staff were very friendly and helpful. We sat down at the bar to have lunch and were greeted by Eva. She was very friendly and attentive. Room was also clean and comfortable. We've really enjoyed our stay.,5,2019,07,19
224,Marvie Sajid,Eva makes the best coffee at the hotel! She made me a latte today...probably the best one I’ve had in Dublin. She is wonderful. Also she recommended a great breakfast here at the hotel and it was amazing.,5,2019,07,18
224,"Great Hotel, Service and Coffee","The hotel is located close to all major attractions and city Centre. The staff is helpful, kind and always ready to help. Lastly, Eva who makes coffee at the coffee bar on the main floor, makes the most incredible lattes. I have been to her multiple times and have had excellent service every time.",5,2019,07,18
224,Best Coffee in Dublin,Eva in the Clayton Hotel makes the best coffee in Dublin City. She is so nice to see every morning & always has a smile to welcome you. I go there every day and all the staff i talk to are so helpful & really nice. I have had food and it is top class,5,2019,07,18
224,Great rooms and great staff,"The rooms and the amenities are nice. The staff is very helpful. Ewa makes me coffee in the morning, even though the coffee bar is not yet open ( not sure why it is not open until 7:30).

Good location; lot's of restaurants close by and very close to the LUAS (train).

Decent gym; clean and spacious. It would be nice if they had a BOSU ball. Unfortunately there are no sanitizing wipes which is pretty gross.",5,2019,07,18
224,Short stay,"Stayed in this hotel for 1 night - the positives are location and staff; location is central to centre (about a 10 min stroll to Stephen's Green, or a 2 min walk to a Luas stop), and staff were very welcoming at check-in. The decor in the lobby / rooms etc. is modern but pleasant. The negative for me was the room itself - I found it really hard to sleep because there was a green bulb in the room (which I think was some sort of emergency lighting) which meant the room itself was really bright, even when all the lights were off. Also, as soon as the sun started to come up, it came through the curtains, and no matter what way I closed them.",4,2019,07,15
224,Best hotel in every way,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay in this hotel. Front desk and restaurant staff are nice, professional and can't be more helpful. Recommend to include breakfasts in your reservation b/c it is delicious and good quality. Room is clean and bed is very comfortable. Bathroom is well thought out, e.g. the faucets placement in the shower is so user-friendly, all hotels should copy.  We found that a shaving mirror was not available in the bath room. That made shaving and putting on make up a bit challenging. Overall, it is an excellent hotel.",5,2019,07,13
224,Time for Coffee,"Hello there! 
I would like to share this special time today.
I and my friend went to visit the hotel this evening we had some coffee and a great time there. I would like to say thank you for the team special the waiter James! He is a great character and very good in his job. We had good conversation and big laugh-:)",5,2019,07,10
224,Petty it was a short trip.,"Great location, quiet, handy for Luas tram network to City Centre, bus and taxi services.
The Hotel is exceptionally clean, all facilities are modern and plentiful.
Controlled access via Ving type card, rooms are spacious, beds are very comfortable, small fridge, iron & board, hair dryer, TV, USB sockets, indirect led lighting, luxurious carpets (keeping noise to a minimum), large ensuite, curtains are perfect for keeping light out if required.
The breakfast choice is quite exhaustive, choice is very wide and varied. 
The staff are friendly and helpful.
This is a very good hotel and I would definitely use again.",5,2019,07,09
224,Amazing front desk staff,"My husband and I recently visited the Clayton Hotel Charlemont. We found the hotel to be comfortable and clean and the room had everything we needed. I would like to mention however, in particular, Damir Nemet, front desk staff  member, who went above and beyond our expectations. We were celebrating our 20 year wedding anniversary and Damir very kindly left a wonderful chocolate dessert in our room along with beautiful chocolates - a really lovely surprise! Damir's assistance was also very much appreciated when we ordered some food from a local Chinese restaurant. He helped finding a local restaurant, phoned the order through and notified us when it was delivered. Damir really is a credit to this hotel. Thank you so much !!",5,2019,07,08
224,Great new hotel in the city!! ,"Stayed on a Saturday night for a concert!

Check in was seemless, very impressive modern hotel!
Room was spacious, very clean with a very comfy massive bed, a coffee machine, a great size bathroom and amazing shower also had a nice view of the canal, didn't get to sample any of the food or beverage but the lobby and bar looked beautiful...

Would stay again if in Dublin!! ",5,2019,07,08
224,Julie O Connor,"Impressed with this lovely hotel. Would stay again if in Dublin.  Located within walking distance of city centre. Double room good size. Stayed for concert 1 night. €259 for 2 people sharing with brekkie which had a great variety to eat. Hotels very expensive in Dublin for concerts, but this was the best value we got. Some hotels overcharge far too much.",4,2019,07,08
224,Great stay,Stayed at the hotel for 1 night to attend a concert -  room only stayed with friends in 2 separate rooms. Hotel was clean and tidy and staff were friendly. Hotel was decorated really well and was easy to tell was a relatively new premises,5,2019,07,06
224,Excellent Hotel,"When planning a week's visit to Dublin for holiday and visiting relatives we chose this new (opened November 2018) hotel in a location we know is convenient close to the Luas (Tram) and within walking distance of the city centre having stayed at another hotel nearby that is now getting shabby.

We had a warm welcome from concierge Damir Nemet and the reception staff. This gave a good first impression that was reinforced by every member of staff we encountered for the whole of the stay. All gave the impression that nothing was too much to ask and there was always a pleasant smile and greeting. 

The room and facilities were also excellent and though there is no restaurant serving lunch or dinner adequate food options are available in the bar area where, again, the service is excellent. The breakfast buffet is the best we have experienced in Ireland to date!

We had one small problem with laundry that was resolved promptly and with genuine apologies.

We would highly recommend this hotel and will certainly use it again in the future.",5,2019,07,03
224,Lovely stat,"The hotel is beautifully decorated and exceptionally clean. The staff were warm, welcoming and kind, especially Damir who was most helpful! 🤗👍 Many thanks for a wonderful stay! I look forward in returning to the hotel on my next trip to Dublin!",5,2019,06,30
224,Fab hotel,"Damir Nemet was a fantastic member of staff, he was super friendly and very helpful!  Great breakfast with loads of options, lovely décor and was a great location. It was a bit pricey or would have given 5 stars.",4,2019,06,29
224,So overpriced,"I'm not sure why I chose The Clayton, but we were there for a short stay. We arrived in Dublin at 5am and went to the hotel. I had mistakenly booked two nights, thinking that we would arrive earlier. That is, we paid for the night when we were actually en route to Ireland. But that's on me - my mistake. I talked to the manager, explaining that we would be there for just over 24 hours, but he said they would have to charge us for both nights. OK, like I said, my mistake. However, when we went to eat and were told that our room rate did not include breakfast, I had to say something to the manager, and he would not comp us for breakfast. What kind of price does one have to pay to get breakfast included? We were paying 240 per night. Every other hotel on our stay cost less and included a full breakfast. So, for nearly 500 euro, we paid for a small room for 24 hours. We did end up paying for their lackluster continental breakfast at the rate of 22 euro each - such a waste! All I could say for the place was that it has a pretty lobby. The Barge, a nearby pub, had a good lunch and nice staff. And a little breakfast place across the canal - where we ended up the second day - had way better food for a fraction of the price. I would NOT go back there. There are so many charming inns in Dublin. This place is part of a large chain with no local flavor at all and has an unfriendly, stuffy staff.",1,2019,06,27
224,Shopping trip,This hotel is beautiful. What a great location. Great value. The service was impeccable. Room was fabulous. Great choice for a shopping trip to Dublin. Will definitely book again in future. Thanks again. ,5,2019,06,25
224,Clayton Hotel Charlemont,"We had a great time in Dublin, going on tours and seeing the sights. We stayed at the Clayton Hotel Charlemont in Dublin. It is a beautiful new hotel, very close to parks, cathedrals, and Trinity College. The hotel was clean, and room service, breakfast, and amenities were great. We would especially would like to commend the help and assistance of Mr. Damir Nemet. When we first arrived in Dublin, we were confused and totally exhausted.  Mr. Nemet first helped us with our luggage and then got us a room early so we could get some sleep.  After we woke up, Damir gave us some great tips on what to see and do in Dublin. He is a really friendly, nice guy who definitely made our trip much more enjoyable.",5,2019,06,22
224,Very small rooms at considerable cost!,"Here now in a room booked for 3 adults ... the rooms are extremely small and so do not adequately accommodate 3 - there is barely any room to move! The hotel clearly do not like catering for 3 either as only 2 cups and glasses and towels for 2.  There is only one shower gel and one shampoo (no conditioner) so as 3 women we will struggle! Have now asked for an extra item of each missing to be brought but the hotel staff do not understand- after 3 attempts we have been brought a cup, towels and a glass (all separately) don’t think I can bring myself to call for toiletries so I’ll end up going to buy some! Building work outside our room (not told about at the time of booking) so no view for the £278 per night cost either! Location is not ideal for walking into the city centre as the route takes you down some ropey looking roads - I would say better hotels for less more central than this! Wish we’d paid a little more for the Conrad which was excellent!",2,2019,06,21
224,"Nice clean hotel, a bit far from the central","The hotel is clean and nice, with friendly staff.  However it’s around 30 mins from the Temple bar and the rest. Try to get a hotel closer to the downtown. Breakfast so expensive.  There is store next to the hotel which is very useful.",4,2019,06,19
224,DISSAPOINTING,Very disappointed with the service provided by this hotel.  We stayed here last night as we were going to the pink concert and we availed of the valet parking which was 25e which was paid on check in.  When checking out this morning at 10.30 we were told we would have our car in 10 minutes to which we still had not got by 12 o clock and asked different members of staff at numerous times how long more it would be and was just brushed off and told it was on the way.  Not once did a member of staff come near us to apologise or to even offer us a cup of tea or coffee whilst we were waiting for 2 hours to get our car back with no explanation.,3,2019,06,19
224,Okay visit ,"Room was clean and tidy with a lovely bathroom
Very surprised it didn’t come with a fridge and bathrobes but I guess you get what you pay for. 

Tele signal was awful kept going on and off 

We also stayed in room 229 and there was a slight noise (sounded like a washing machine) underneath our room. 

Also ordered a taxi for a guided tour which was told it would be here there in five minutes. A group then took all the taxis coming to the hotel. Meaning 25 minutes later and no taxi the girl then tells us to take someone’s else’s taxi. 

Both us and the taxi driver was annoyed with this. But he helped us out of a pickle. 

Hotel itself is lovely and clean, and great for a short break. Bathrooms are really the high point here. However the service needs a bottle polishing up. There was a lovely blonde (straight) hair at reception who was helpful. The other one wavy hair (I think maybe a supervisor) could of been more helpful but I guess she couldn’t be asked it seems with regards to the taxi matter. 

",3,2019,06,18
224,"New Hotel, great staff, good beds","We stayed in the Clayton Charlemont at the start of an Irish Odyssey.  It just  opened in November of 2018 and even our taxi driver of 36 years thought we meant the nearby Hilton.  Staff, and especially Eve, went above and beyond to meet our every need.  Good location a block from the team and 4 tram stops south of Trinity college and the Book of Kells.  Ernst and Young, Deloitte and KPMG have their headquarters nearby for business types.
Superb full breakfast, though at 20Euros, not cheap.  And do not overlook the beds, which are new, firm and excellent. ",4,2019,06,17
224,Nice stay!,"This is the hotel that me and my friend chose to stay at when staying in Dublin, This is one of the nicest hotels that I have been to in a while I have to say. From checking in we were greeted with a friendly member of staff who was very helpful with checking us into the hotel. The room we stayed in was a twin room and I cannot fault it! The room was clean and tidy! It was perfect, granted we didn't have a great view (view of the wall) but you cannot complain for the price. I cannot recommend this hotel anymore, Such friendly staff who were very helpful with any queries.",4,2019,06,15
224,Good find for the price ,"Stayed here for two nights in the weekend. We arrived at 9am, taxi driver was confused and dropped us off at Hilton. There r two entrances in this hotel, connecting a new and old building which was a former hospital. Early check in wasn’t available, so we dropped off luggage and had a nice Irish breakfast in the restaurant next door. Everywhere is about 10-15minutes walk and the tram station is just a block away. There’s a pharmacy on the same block. I like this location as it’s slightly away from the crowd and yet very easy to get into town. Our hotel room is new, nice and simple with carpet floor. It has big window but it’s facing the back of some apartments. Shower water pressure is great, however the toilet seat was a bit narrow and uncomfortable. The hotel has a nice bar, it doesn’t serve food late night but room service is available. One night I had a chicken curry rice and it was quite tasty.",5,2019,06,10
224,Loved our stay here,"This is a more modern hotel in Dublin, so if you are looking for old, authentic this is not your place. But if you are looking for clean, modern, well appointed, robes, lovely bed and linens, convenient location to the LUAS rail line, air conditioning, restaurants, grocery and bars nearby... this is the place.",4,2019,06,07
224,"Nice Hotel - great breakfast, decent gym","The location was slightly outside of the main downtown area. We preferred this because it was quieter. We felt safe and could walk 15 minutes to popular parks and streets. A Lidl (grocery store) was a 10 min walk away. 

The hotel had a nice lobby, great breakfast and was recently renovated. There were two wings of the building and we were in the older one with narrow stairs and no elevator. You could hear the stairs and noise from hallway in the room. The room was modern but small.  We had an issue with a fire alarm but the hotel manager resolved our complaint.

The gym was small but decent with modern equipment in good condition.",4,2019,06,07
224,Good for a business trip,"I booked this hotel through work due to client commitments in the local area.  It is a lovely, fresh hotel with excellent transport links nearby and a tasty varied breakfast in the morning (the soda bread was particularly good!).  The room pictures on the hotel website are very true to reality and it was always beautifully cleaned, with bottles of still and sparkling water replenished daily. 
The only issue i faced was that the walls are a little thin- I could hear the conversations of my neighbours at 6am in the morning.  Other than this occurrence, however, i had a very pleasant stay and would return if I am in Dublin again.",4,2019,06,07
224,Great hotel,Stayed for one night. Check in was really easy with polite and informative staff. Room was a great size and very clean. There was an extensive choice for breakfast which was all fresh and tasty. Only very small complaint was a couple of the channels on the tv in the room (ones we wanted to watch!) had bad signal and there weren’t really many to choose from as an alternative.,5,2019,06,05
224,"Comfortable, but beware of the parking charges","This was a relatively new hotel that provided a very comfortable stay not too far from the main action in Dublin City. The room was comfortable and the breakfasts had everything you would ever want. Staff was helpful until we asked for recommendations on seafood restaurants for dinner. Maybe this was because they are new or not too many option in Dublin, but if it was not on google they did not know about it. Only gripe was the 25 euro per night to park there, explanation was that this was in line with other hotels in the city center, but I did not consider them city center as it was a 30 minute walk to get there. Overall clean comfortable place to stay if you do not have a car you required to park.",4,2019,06,05
224,Just the right balance,"A really good bolt hole when visiting the fair city of Dublin. Possesses all the attributes needed to make your visit really enjoyable without spending shed loads of money. I will qualify that with the following:  
  
All the staff are a friendly, engaging bunch and always eager to help.
The place was spotlessly clean throughout our stay.
Comfortable air conditioned studios/rooms.
Excellent breakfast, for both choice and quality.
Well positioned. 15-20 minute walk along the canal into the centre of the city.   

'Nuff said.

   
 
",5,2019,06,05
224,Lovely stay in Edinburgh...,"We stayed in the Clayton Hotel for a week, while visiting Dublin.  The room was clean and spacious!  Breakfast was what is expected and ample.  Customer Service was able to answer any questions about the area and events.  We enjoyed eating at some of the local pubs, which we could access by walking from the Clayton Hotel.  They were able to find some face cloths for us, which we found was not common in Europe. We would stay here, again.",5,2019,06,05
224,Lovely ,"Lovely new hotel ground floor incorporating the old house is done in excellently. It’s is in a great location quick walk or Luas ride into town . Room super quite, comfortable bed and well furnished loved the TV with Cromecast was great feature. Will definitely stay here again.",5,2019,06,04
224,Brand new hotel in Dublin D4,We booked the valet parking to save walking to the nearest qpark. Efficient staff on reception. Took care of everything. Room was perfect for us. Breakfast in the morning was delicious. We would definitely be back again. ,5,2019,06,01
224,"Good overall, with some caveats","Overall, a very nice hotel. They connected and remodeled three somewhat historic buildings; the hotel faces both Charlemont St. and the canal. That proved somewhat confusing to at least two taxi drivers. The Charlemont St. entrance is closer to the reception. 

Nice lobby, extremely helpful staff, reasonably good restaurant, good choice of beers and whiskeys in the bar. Nice spacious rooms, a bit low on storage for both clean and dirty clothes, but nice overall. Plenty of restaurants nearby. The usual Clayton breakfast choices. LUAS close by - gets you to downtown in about ten minutes for EUR3 or so (then again, a pleasant twenty minutes walk will get you there for free).

Caveats:
- there are two rooms located on the first floor. The windows face the street entrance. Okay if you are out most of the time, otherwise better avoided. Honestly, these two rooms would work better as a gym.
- The gym is ridiculous: a closet in the basement, with a low-end elliptical, a treadmill and a couple weights. Clayton Burlington is a much better choice if you expect to work out.
- some growing pains. E.g., there were water supply issues one day, apparently b/c of some activity by their water utility, Irish Water. There were written apologies everywhere, and it was back to normal soon.

Overall, a pretty nice place - will have no problem staying there again. However, consider also the Hilton next door. Prices look to be similar.",4,2019,05,30
224,Best overall hotel during our whole trip,"Must give compliments to the management.  Excellent service throughout the hotel, wonderful food, and everyone couldn’t do enough for us.  Love the location.  Easy walking distance to center city.  Lovely foot paths along the canal.  Beautiful rooms.  
Wish we were going back soon.",5,2019,05,29
224,Beautiful hotel,"I stayed at this hotel with my 5 friends over the weekend and must say it was a really beautiful hotel.

We arrived really early at around 9am so we couldn’t check in straight away so we were able to leave our bags in the secure luggage room behind the reception desk.

We then went out to explore Dublin, the reception happily ordered a taxi for us to get into the main city centre bit. We could have walked but according to my maps it would have taken us about 25 minutes. A taxi journey for the 6 of us cost around €13 and is about a 10 minute drive.

When we checked into our rooms the reception ensured we had both rooms on the same floor which was great. The rooms were very clean and comfortable, the beds and pillows were perfect. The bathroom had a shower over a bath and it was a powerful shower.

When the rooms got cleaned it was done really well and the shampoos etc in the bathroom were replaced as well as the tea, coffee and water in the room.

Even the lifts in the hotel were so quick, as soon as you click the button a lift practically arrives.

One night we had bought a bottle of Prosecco to have in the room not realising it was a cork one and would need a cork screw bottle opener to open it. One phone call down to room service and somebody brought one up straight away with no issues.

The staff at breakfast were really friendly and whenever you asked for something there were no issues or bad attitudes. The breakfast was lovely, so much choice. The only negative thing about breakfast is the orange juice, it was just very watered down. However they had other juices available e.g apple, pineapple.

We did not use the gym facilities so am unable to comment on this.

Overall the hotel was so lovely and beautiful. Around the hotel there are plenty or restaurants and bars to choose from. I would definitely stay at the hotel again, thank-you very much.",5,2019,05,28
224,"Excellent hotel , related staff","We stayed 2 days and it was amazing for us. The location is very good , only 15-20 minutes to city center by walking. Staff , especially Graham O'Dwyer is so nice. When I arrived Dublin , I wanted to go Kilmainham Goal but I couldnt buy a ticket due to my credit card's problem. Graham called Kilmainham Goal and somewhere else and I could buy a ticket. He spended 10-15 minutes for me and all the time he just smiled , he was sincere. Thank you Graham , thank you Clayton , you made us happy.",5,2019,05,28
224,Nice but a bit out of the action,"This is a new hotel - the carpeting is still outgassing. The room was fair sized and the bathroom quite lovely.
The staff were friendly snd helpful. 
The hotel breakfast wad overpriced and not stocked with the best quality items. Thr orange juice was not fresh nor was the grapefruit juice.
The hotel is located along the canal andcthe surroundings are quite scenic. However, if you are planning to shop or sightsee, St. Stepen's Square is a good 15 min walk away.",4,2019,05,26
224,Very good hotel,"It’s new, it’s fresh, it’s exactly what you look for on a business trip. 
Hotel had a casual but professional atmosphere created by the friendly staff in reception, bar and breakfast.
I really enjoyed my 3 nights here.  ",5,2019,05,26
224,"4 star rooms, 3 star service","We stayed here for 3 nights to celebrate my 30th birthday. When checking in, the reception staff told where our room was then asked if we wanted information on the hotel, forgetting to mention there was a gym, what breakfast options were etc. 

My partner paid extra for a birthday package as a surprise. When we arrived in the room we had a small dessert with ‘happy birthday’ written on it and they wrote on a plain Clayton Hotels card as well as about seven balloons with the number 1 on. May as well not even bothered.

The rooms are lovely but we were interrupted on 2 separate days when in our room, for the staff to check the room had been cleaned. 

When walking in and out of the hotel, the reception staff don’t welcome you or smile, they keep heads down which is not what is expected with the price paid

Hotel itself is about 15/20 minute walk to the centre and the tram is 5 mins away for ease. 

If you want a lovely room with basic service and happy to pay a bit more then would recommend.",3,2019,05,25
224,Fantastic Hotel,Attended meetings in Dublin for a week and was booked into this Hotel by the organization that hosted the meetings and was really pleased with the choice. Just recently opened the Hotel was in a great location and the facilities were fantastic. We walked into the city centre from the hotel and as it was located by a canal and surrounded by lots of resturants this proved to be a great hotel. The rooms were fresh and had everything that I needed.Would stay here again,5,2019,05,22
224,Enjoyed staying in this hotel,"Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights during our recent Dublin trip.  Very modern new hotel in a quiet neighborhood that's close to a tram station.  The entire staff was always very helpful and the restaurant convenient with great selections for breakfast.  This is our first experience with Clayton Hotels, but we would definitely stay in one of their other hotels based on this experience.",5,2019,05,20
224,No hot water all morning,"We had no hot water from 7am until 11am, 1 hour prior to check out. Once highlighting this to reception they were already aware of this but decided not to notify us of this. Once the water came on it was cold, meaning we had to shower cold before checking out then starting a long day of travelling home. Apart from this the hotel is lovely, the staff are friendly and all round a really well presented hotel. I hope they can ensure the water issue does not happen again and people can enjoy this wonderful
Hotel.",3,2019,05,19
224,One of the best hotel,I’ve stayed there in first week of April for business visit. Hotel is super nice and staff is very friendly. I would recommend everyone to try this hotel atleast once. It’s 2 mins walk from nearest train station.,5,2019,05,19
224,"Ultra modern, great location & service.","Less than six months old, ultra modern electronics hookups, great location and very easy access to tram station.  Special shout outside to Raphaela & Rus at reception.  Their assistance with everything from where to go, how to get there, every question or need answered with a smile.  I have had several experiences with Clayton (Cork, Dublin & Galway) and the service is top notch.",5,2019,05,10
224,Impeccable staff,"Stay here for business and the staff are fantastic - can't do enough to help. Thanks to Arsalan in particular for your patience in getting me a room with a bath. Brand new modern hotel with everything you need plus a fantastic location, 20 minutes walk from main strip.",5,2019,05,10
224,"New, On the Canal, Great Service","Located on the Dublin canal, the Clayton Charlemont is a perfect, comfortable, high service hotel near enough to the city center to enjoy it and far enough away to avoid being consumed by it. The hotel restaurant and bar are excellent, there’s a good exercise room and the lobby area is social and comfortable to work in. And going back to the view, it’s really a great location with the windows of the Dockside restaurant looking directly on the footpaths of one of a great stretches of the canal. ",5,2019,05,08
224,favourite hotel experience,"Stayed here over may bank holiday weekend and had such a lovely time. The hotel has not been open long so everything is new. I love the design of the lobby, very impressive. Because of our flights, we arrived to the hotel at about 9am and even though check-in is normally 3pm, we were able to check in at 9am which was very much appreciated. We enquired about late check out (its normally 12pm) but it was 25 euros just to check out at 2pm so we left it. 

The bedroom was lovely and spacious and the bed is the most comfortable bed we've ever slept in. We had room 426 and this overlooked the canal with a huge window meaning we could lay in bed and enjoy the view in the morning. The room was cleaned and all toiletries that we used were replaced. The bathroom was pristine and the shower was a proper spa experience. 

The staff at the reception desk were friendly and happy to help. We had one drink in the hotel bar and they served the G&T perfectly. These came to 20 euros. Although pricey, so is everything in Dublin.

When planning, I overestimated the distance from the hotel to the city centre. The hotel is right next to the Luas stop and three stops gets you into the city centre and main bar/shopping district. The city is very walkable, anyway. We got a Flexi-ticket each day which is 7 Euros and is unlimited use on both lines. Well worth doing so we could explore a little further afield. If you don't want to go into town, behind the back of the hotel is a small collection of bars and pubs which are pretty fun. 

We plan on coming back soon and we will definitely be staying here again!",5,2019,05,08
224,Amazing service Delivery.,"The Restaurant is Amazing And the chef “method” he was really gud wid presentation skills as well as the taste. Will recommend a definite visit. 
The attendant in the restaurant were real friendly and professional. A service With warmth. “Tyler” and his colleagues are really nice. Cheers",5,2019,05,05

224,Very good hotel,"Very nice hotel, everything was so fresh and new. Great and friendly service at the front desk. The room (executive) was nice, not anything luxurious but very nice. The tram station is near the hotel, so it was easy to reach downtown, which was in walking distance, but in rainy days it is convenient to catch the tram. ",4,2019,05,01
224,A fabulous stay! ,"We had the most wonderful stay at Hotel Clayton Charlemont. The staff was very supportive and extremely helpful. The Hotel was nice, clean and located very close to the Luas station. Beautiful ambience! Rooms were neat, bed nice done every morning by room service. Food was good too.
Special thanks to Rafaella from the Frontdesk Team for guiding us around and making us feel comfortable. 
We had a fabulous stay! Thanks much guys for making it so memorable!! ",5,2019,05,01
224,Clayton is the place to be!,"Recently stayed at the Clayton in Charlemont and had the most delicious breakfast. Self service buffet topped with almost anything you can think of! Great service with good staff, the breakfast was made more special by Ester who ensured I was looked after very polite girl. Can rave on about this hotel, check it out people right in the heart of Dublin too.",4,2019,04,30
224,Perfect stay,"New hotel which is spotlessly clean and staffed by a professional team making our stay a very good one.

A negative: The built in wardrobe protrudes annoyingly into the room upon entry, although it is not huge problem.",5,2019,04,30
224,"Thomas, Giovani & Dianna Rock!","Enjoyed my stay. Clean, comfortable rooms. Good location. Overall service was terrific. Thomas, Giovani and Dianna were super stars among an excellent crew. Since I have to write 200 characters blah, blah, blah, blah Thomas, Giovani and Dianna rock!",5,2019,04,29
224,Amazing Coffee!,I called into the Clayton Hotel while passing one morning to relax with a coffee and the barista Ewa made me one of the nicest cappucinos I've had in Dublin! I will most definitely be back for more!!!,5,2019,04,29
224,Excellent hotel in every way,"We stayed for two nights 25/4-27/4/2019. This is a quiet, unobtrusive hotel, tucked away opposite the canal on one street and on Charlemont St the other. The hotel is very new and our floor was only recently opened. From the moment we stepped inside the hotel, the welcome was warm and inviting. The Reception staff were all very helpful, providing us with maps and directions. Damir, with a big smile, took our luggage and brought it to our room for us and made sure he showed us how everything worked. He also helped us when we left and made sure we got our luggage into our taxi.
Our room was very modern, with every thoughtful touch including glass bottles of water instead of the usual plastic. There was adequate tea and coffee provided on a pull-out tray which was so convenient, rather than stuck on a bench. The bathroom was very modern, with big fluffy towels and very nice toiletries. The hotel itself was only a few minutes' walk to the tram, and a 10 minute walk to St Stephens Green, and the city. As far as we know, there was only parking in the street outside. I could not fault this hotel at all and would only stay there if I ever went to Dublin again.",5,2019,04,29
224,"Modern, high class and professional","I stayed in the hotel for 3 nights and was extremely satisfied with everything. The room was nice, the staff was friendly and the food at the bar was great. If you find your way here and go to the Lockside bar in the lobby area, I recommend Thomas as a server. He was incredibly friendly as well as helpful. He suggested meals and desserts for me which all ended up being great! I highly recommend this hotel to all future travelers.",5,2019,04,26
224,Great experience..,"🇬🇧 I would strongly recommend this hotel to those who want to be just outside the city but still only 10 minutes from the shopping area.  Opened this year in January, the hotel has all that great hotel favors, beautiful design, top service and comfort. I will say that most of the staff did really well, but Damir Nemet stood out.

🇮🇸 Ég vill sterklega mæla með þessu hóteli við þá sem vilja vera aðeins utan borgar en samt  einungis 10 mín frá göngugötunni. Hótelið er byggt a þessu ári í janúar og hefur allt það sem góðu hóteli sæmir, falleg hönnun, topp þjónusta og þægindi.

🇩🇰 Jeg vil stærkt anbefale dette hotel til dem, der ønsker at være lige udenfor byen, men stadig kun 10 minutter fra shoppingområdet.  Bygget i januar 2019, hotellet har alle det store hotel favoriserer, smukt design, top service og komfort.",5,2019,04,25
224,Beautiful hotel and cafe,This brand new hotel is finished to a very high standard. A welcoming and comfortable vibe throughout. Make sure to get a coffee and a treat from Eva at the bar. She makes the BEST coffee in the area.,5,2019,04,24
224,Nice but not perfect. Great location.,"Had a comfortable stay here. Chic and modern room with a big bed. Hotel is very close to the monorail.  For the price, the overall experience was a little overwhelming. Staff were generally pleasant but not as friendly as you'd expect. Air conditioning was a bit difficult to manage. Room service menu was extremely overpriced. It was around 15 euros for a sandwich (plus a 7 euro delivery fee). Breakfast was also expensive at 20 euros. Food on offer was okay but nothing too special. ",3,2019,04,24
224,Good hotel,"It is a nice hotel with big rooms and friendly service. There are nice touches like quality shampoo&shower gels or usb power sockets for your phone in case you are missing a travel adapter. The breakfast was good too. The lobby area was very big with good furniture. We enjoyed having few drinks there. 

Overall it is a nice hotel with good location (10-15 mins walking to the city center). However it is also expensive. It gives valye for the price, but it does not exceed expectations. ",4,2019,04,22
224,Some improvements possible,"To be honest, it is a nice hotel. Not too far from city centre. But, when I come back to the hotel after 17.00 after a long sunny day, I expect the room is cleaned. It wasn't. Both days we stayed, we had to ask if the room was going to be cleaned. For € 200 a night, I expect more. They could have offered something to drink while we had to wait in the lobby, they didn't.  
Yes, I am a bit disappointed on this.",3,2019,04,20
224,Excellent hotel!  ,"Customer service is thru the roof.   🏆Very comfortable beds and pillows. Never slept better in my life. Within walking distance to bars and restaurants. The only thing I would add is a mini fridge in the room, otherwise I would highly recommend this hotel.",4,2019,04,20
224,Fantastic newly refurbished hotel,"Stayed here for my boyfriend's birthday and the hotel was fantastic. I rang before we arrived and they arranged a birthday plate (with cheesecake and chocolate!) for him as a surprise which was a lovely touch. Hotel is near a tram stop and about a 10 minute tram ride to the centre, or about 20/25 minute walk. The hotel has been recently refurbished and the decor is beautifully done. The room was big, spotlessly clean and the bed was very comfy. You get fluffy bathrobes and lovely rituals toiletries! We could hear the tram from our room, but this didn't worry us. Staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was delicious, fab choice of hot and cold items. Knocking off one star as we were awoken by a very loud accidental fire alarm one night, but apart from that I would highly recommend this great hotel.",4,2019,04,19
224,Great location and hotel but poor cleaning,"Great rooms and hotel and its located in a very nice area and in walking distance from the city center.there are some very good pubs and restaurants nearby that serves very good food. Unfortunately, we were not very lucky with the cleaning of our room. Even though the hotels says that they are cleaning the rooms everyday they forgot to clean ours two days in a row and that’s not good enough",4,2019,04,18
224,Fanastic hotel,"I stayed at this hotel in January, I was greeted at the desk by the lovely reception team,had a coffee in the lobby area and the architecture was stunning the detailing gone into the planning seemed very thought out. I loved how the colors complemented each other. I stayed on the third floor and the view was amazing staring onto the beautiful canal, I took a walk by it the next morning. The breakfast the next day was extremely pleasant, I had the most exceptional service by Esther Cole. She ensured I was well looked after always coming back to my seat and asking if I wanted extra tea or toast, and further explained to me what good activities were available in Dublin. Would recommend going here as everything is within walking distance and Stephen green only being about an 8 minute walk!",4,2019,04,14
224,Very good hotel,The Clayton is a modern hotel with a nice lobby and decent size rooms. The rooms have good amenities and the bed is comfortable. Free wifi. Nice breakfast. Location is not great if you're coming as a tourist - most attractions are a bit far but it's a nice neighborhood to stay in and there's plenty of restaurants and pubs in the area.,5,2019,04,13
224,“First visit looks promising “,"This hotel, newly opened is just finding its feet so to speak . 
We stayed in an executive king room at a good rate . Great bed and linens, very comfortable bathroom with lovely towels, good shower and great bathroom mirror that doesn’t cloud over with steam.mini fridge with water , chocolate and fresh milk and room to put in your own stuff if needed.,happy with room.

Breakfast was very nice and well presented, great selection of fresh fruits, cold meats , nice breads and lots more options .. I had wanted to book their advertised restaurant, couldn’t as I was told it was closed , which surprised me on a Friday night. They did however have their lockside bar / restaurant open. Dined elsewhere so didn’t sample food.nice bar area.

Staff are trying hard to make this hotel a success by the looks of things. LUAS is a few minutes walk away and barge pub next door. We normally go to the Hilton in Charlemont place , when in this area so it’s really between these two hotels for further stays . So it’s worth giving it a try , ring them re parking if bringing a car . ",4,2019,04,06
224,Great hotel,"What a lovely hotel
Very new hotel

Great pint of Guinness in the hotel bar
We also had a margarita shot made for us by the bar staff
Walked down to temple bar for a evening out then on the way back we got a taxi

224,Coffee Dock & Gaudens,"As I study in the city centre, I come into the hotel most days of the week on my way into college in the morning to grab a quick espresso and breakfast, and every morning I am greeted by the wonderful Eva. Cannot express enough how appreciative I am of how she looks after me every morning. No matter the day I always get service with a smile and a lovely coffee (which is absolutely needed when facing 7 hours of engineering lectures). 

Have also been in Gaudens for dinner where I was served by Andrea, again absolutely superb service, had lovely chats with her while I was there. And to top it off the food was gorgeous. Compliments to the chef.  

All the staff I have met here have been lovely and I couldn't fault a thing.",5,2019,04,03
224,The best!,"Couldn't reccomend this place anymore. The front of house were very welcoming. And Thomas, in the bar was such a friendly and helpful person. The best waiter we have had in a long time:) clean rooms, good location! Thank you!",5,2019,03,29
224,Breakfast early morning,My self & my husband Walk by this hotel very often so on Tuesday morning we decided to pop in for an early breakfast before work we were quite a -bit shocked by the price of the breakfast buffet but the service was amazing by Chloe &  diana we were granted with tea of any choice and coffee my husband ordered an omelet and the quick service was amazing could come back in a heart beat,5,2019,03,28
224,Clayton Hotel-,"Just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel and we really enjoyed it.
The hotel is new and the rooms were very clean. we had a good nights rest on the bed especially after all the days touring.
the staff were nice and cordial.
breakfast was great! and the ladies in charge of breakfast were super nice and do a great job!
Ii very wide selection, with tasty and hearty food gave us enough energy to get thru the day and the touring.
the only point I would suggest to the hotel is to hire a concierge. we were in Dublin for our first time and could have used some help with restaurants and  attractions.
other than that, this is a good stable hotel , a real value for the money.",5,2019,03,28
224,50th wedding anniversary,"Had four days stay. Really enjoyed the experience. Food great. Room excellent. Staff wonderful especially Chloe McGrath and Damir Nemet. It is a reasonably new hotel and still trying to getting things running smoothly. Has a great future and I have no hesitation recommending this hotel. Hope to return again in the near future. Stayed Sun - Thur, 24th to 28th March 2019. Gerald and Carole",5,2019,03,28
224,Lovely stay and perfect hotel,"Just returned from a lovely 3 night stay at this hotel. When we arrived they didn’t have a double room available which is what I had booked so they upgraded us to an executive room free of charge. The hotel is spotless and smells brand new, the rooms have lots of space and the beds are so comfy. All the staff were very friendly and polite and we got a very warm welcome. We could have done with being a little closer to the centre of town but it was only a little walk of about 25mins to be in the temple bar early so it’s not too far really. The breakfast we would recommend, it was €20 a person which you would probably spend if you were to go out anyway..there was a wide selection of food to choose from on the buffet for breakfast and the food was all lovely.

All in all a lovely stay and I would recommend this hotel for anyone looking to explore Dublin in a quiet area in a newly refurbished hotel.",5,2019,03,25
224,Excellent service,I was in a couple of times for food and coffee in lockside and the service was amazing. All the staff are nice especially Giovanni. He was very welcoming with such a big smile. I'll be back for lunch again very soon.,5,2019,03,24
224,Good value!!,"Stayed at the clayton for 2 wks, was upgraded to a bigger room upon arrival (really appreciated it!), rooms are well appointed and clean. The only thing missing would be a mini fridge and some slippers in the standard rooms. Very comfy beds and linens. Big and comfortable sitting area in the lobby, really good coffee, they always have soy milk and almost always almond milk. Café menu lacks vegetarian and vegan options but staff willing to adapt, don’t hesitate to ask! Very open to change! Bfast simple, a bit of everything, good GF options (especially oats!), eggs on-demand. Closed to the tram stop, 5’ to the city center, very convenient. Great service at bfast by Andrea (very welcoming, smiling and willing to make guests feel very comfortable, such a kind person!) and the staff at the café as well (Eva and other staff whose names i didn’t write down, sorry!). The gym is a bit depressing though, no window and not a lot of equipment. However i would definitely go back!!!! ",5,2019,03,23
224,First time,"Stayed at this lovely hotel from 18 to 21 of March with my husband and son .From the moment we arrived till we left it was great ,staff were friendly and helpful rooms were clean everything we needed was there .Close to tram station which maid it easy to get around .",5,2019,03,21
224,Great place to stay,"I stayed for a couple of nights the first week it opened and have been back most weeks since.
The place is just comfortable comfortable comfortable. The burger from the bar menu is up there with the best, the ale is good and cheaper then some of the local pubs and you get better service. 
Rooms are a good size and the walk in shower is LOVELY. Plenty of good nights sleep for me.
I must say though that they must have been extra picky when choosing the staff, from the breakfast people to the bar, the cleaning staff to reception, they are all so professional and really friendly 
Would recommend this place above the other 2 I’ve stayed in Dublin any day 
I’m back next week ",5,2019,03,19
224,Very central,"New hotel, bright entrance and staff were lovely.

 Car parking can be an issue in that it’s very limited so you need to book it otherwise have a trek with your suitcases. Also you cannot leave the car after 12 midday if you’re checking out so that can present a problem if your meeting runs overtime.
Bar food was lovely and menu is good for vegetarians. 
Bedrooms basic but very clean and comfortable. Perfect hotel for work or city break as so handy for the Luas line.",4,2019,03,17
224,Really nice hotel,I enjoyed my stay at the Clayton Charlemont. I was able to check in upon my early morning arrival. The staff was very nice. The hotel is new so everything is in really nice condition. The room was clean and comfortable. The breakfast was great. I liked the location- a very pretty and quiet area yet was able to walk to most places in the city in about 20 minutes. Overall a wonderful stay.,5,2019,03,17
224,First time at the Clayton Charlemont.,"Stayed at the Charlemont to attend a concert at the Sugar Club a short walk away. Friendly welcome from Leo at reception, who also gave great directions later on in our stay, very well appointed room, spotlessly clean and quiet, fantastic breakfast, great choice and quality. Very clear allergies info for everything and gluten free options readily available. Great service from Chloe our server who went the extra mile writing out directions for my wife's shopping trip. Lovely hotel great staff, good location and transport nearby. Walking back from concert no issues felt safe. Great trip and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel and its staff.",5,2019,03,06
224,Great staff with an amazing ability to make you feel at home,"I recently stayed and even made the hotel lobby area a space to meet people for coffee's and base myself between meetings while in Dublin. All the staff have been fantastic in the past few weeks - the hotel has done a great job with the people they hired in. As with any cafe/ restaurant it is all about how welcoming the team are every interaction (especially when half asleep before your first caffeine hit of the day!) Eva at the front cafe is beyond phenominal at her job - a very strong barista, great to chat to and is always happy to do anything to make the service better than you can find elsewhere in the area. Keep it up",5,2019,03,06
224,Amazing staff,Warm welcome and hospitality from the staff - Eva makes the best cappuccino! The rooms are modern with all of the essential amenities - the beds are also super comfortable; I had the best nights sleep here!,5,2019,03,04
224,Fantastic Hotel,"I stayed last week and it was stunning. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. The room was lovely and big, exceptionally clean and it was very comfortable. I would highly recommend this Hotel. The food was lovely. Check in and check out were seamless. Great central location. I know where I will be staying in future.",5,2019,03,04
224,A great hotel with fantastic service,"I come here a lot and could not ask for a better hotel. Eva, Lucia & the rest of the staff here are fantastic. Its extremely comfortable and the perfect walking distance to the city centre (Id say 12 minutes to Grafton Street)",5,2019,03,04
224,Coffee to die for,Eva from the coffee bar is has the best customer service and is the right person for hospitality. I get my coffee every morning and she makes the best coffee and with a smile 😀 on her. I always look for for my coffee ☕️,4,2019,03,04
224,New City hotel,"Stayed one night here and it is as you’d expect from a new city hotel, bright fresh but functional.the bathroom is immaculate but doesn’t have a bath ! Great shower though. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and the pillows were perfect. The hairdryer was fabulous ,in all they’d got it right but not five stars because it’s downfall was the room was so hot ! The air on didn’t seem to cool the room and that made it difficult to sleep.",4,2019,03,03
224,Excellent staff,"I go regularly either on my own or with family, mainly for coffee and sometimes lunch.  The staff are incredibly good, especially my regular barista Lucia who has a real gift for customer service, always remembers my order and really goes the extra mile with attentive service when I bring a child.",5,2019,03,03
224,Grande Coffee on the Clayton Grand Canal,"This new Clayton Hotel opened up along the banks of the Grand Canal a few weeks ago and is now my favourite place for my Morning Coffee on the way to work . 

I used to stop at the other local hotel but since the Clayton opened its doors there is no better place.  
The Barista lady  -Ava- is always bright and cheerful , even at 7-30am in the morning and its great to see somebody enjoying their job instead of the Grumpy service you get from the Hilton hotel which I used to frequent . 

Ava has also given me advice on the dinner menu and recommends the Seafood Risotto as a must . I will definitely be trying it as I have heard good reports from others who have dined there.  

The Coffee is really good at €2.50 for takeaway which matches the other local cafes and  is a superior tasting coffee..
3Fe is a hundred yards down the road and charges an Extortionate €3-70 for a takeaway coffee. ( ridiculous ) 

The Design and Decor on this Clayton Hotel  Reception area is a must see as they have Mixed Ultra modern decor and  Colours with just the right amount of use of the Existing old building and Glass Ceiling 

Great place to Chill if you want to just sit in the really comfortable seating in the Foyer and treat yourself.  

Great place for Coffee ,  cake and a chat.  
Keep up the Good work .",4,2019,02,28
224,Brilliant stay!,"A lovely hotel, friendly staff, comfortable and stylish rooms, comfortable bed, and a lovely shower.
Location is good- 15 minute walk to city centre. 
Overall great experience! 
Bar prices are a tad expensive but worth it",5,2019,02,28
224,"Superb value, fabulously comfortable","In Dublin, you seem to either get super expensive hotels which are just OK, or really expensive hotels that are absolutely diabolical. I have to travel here frequently with work, and the hotel accommodation had proved a bit of a lottery. Not any more! Great value, superb accommodation and staff, great location.",5,2019,02,26
224,Fabulous ,"Stayed two nights while in town for a gig. The room was lovely - very modern and clean. Lovely view of the canal with big windows that let in a lot of light during the day, with solid blackout drapes for sleeping (a must for me). Plenty of towels and toiletries. I thought deluxe room came with robe and slippers but neither were provided but wasn’t an issue as had brought my own just in case. Asked for a quiet room and I had no
Issues with noise and slept very soundly. Bed very comfy. Staff friendly and helpful. Breakfast not included but not bad value - €15 a night for buffet and was good quality. Hot food a bit tepid but I always find that to be the case with buffet breakfasts. Otherwise was very good. Housekeeping standard was great. Despite nice view of canal the area is slightly cut off from the town and is a bit shabby and run down in terms of shops, pubs and restaurants but this doesn’t reflect on hotel and didn’t affect my stay - and may suit you. There is a Luas station two minutes away with a regular service and bus stops close by and it’s only about 15 minutes walk to Grafton Street. I’d definitely recommend staying here to others and I would definitely return myself next time I’m in Dublin. ",4,2019,02,26
224,100% worth staying! ,"Stayed here for just one night over the weekend in February. Despite arriving at the wrong Clayton hotel originally, we were able to check in early, around midday which was perfect. Our room was on the top floor (4th) and we had a corner from which had a fantastic 180 degree view! The room was huge and very modern. Coffee machine was provided and free biscuits :)
The toiletries in the bathroom were also very nice. I slept really well in the bed and we had the buffet breakfast in the morning, which was of a good standard. The waiting staff could have been a bit more forthcoming as I had to ask someone for tea and toast. The area of the hotel is good and we were a short taxi ride away from the bars and shops. When I come back to Dublin I would most definitely stay here again. Well done on this nice new addition. ",5,2019,02,25
224,Excellent meal,My boyfriend and I enjoyed a fantastic 3 course meal here on Valentine’s Day! We could not fault the food or the service. As seen in the pictures the portions sizes are good and the steak was cooked to perfection. Highly recommend a visit here and we will be returning soon.,5,2019,02,25
224,Another faultless stay,"From obtaining a great deal for block booking form the booking team over the phone, to the friendly and reliable and helpful staff at reception, , Jessica In the Italian restaurant  and George and his fellow colleagues in the bar, the venue and staff live up to the quality reputation it holds!

Nice clean, reliable venue with good food, great atmosphere and friendly staff

Another great few days away whilst working in Dublin and highly recommended by myself and DHL!

Keep up the good work!!",5,2019,02,25
224,room not as advertised + rude manager,"Let me start by saying that I am a frequent traveler and rarely post negative reviews, however, our experience at this hotel, especially with the manager [-], was quite unforgivable. To start, they moved us to three different rooms, none of which were what I booked (they claim they have the same specs but they looked nothing at all like the picture). The manager agreed that the room I was given did not look at all like what was posted online but said, in a direct quote, ""well don't complain, you aren't paying that much anyway"" (at more than an average of 150 euro per night!). He told me he would look into compensating the inconvenience but the next day told me that he decided not to do anything because, and he repeated, the room was below market price anyway (again at 150 euro a night). As a frequent traveler, I can confirm that he is the rudest manager I have ever come across and this was one of the worst check-in experiences I have ever had. The rest of our trip was clearly very uncomfortable which was unfortunate because we were stuck there for four nights. If the hotel does not provide the room as described (and paid for!) then there must be a mechanism in place to get a refund or the option to leave the hotel. At the very least, the manager should not be rude and insulting. We were bitterly disappointed with this stay.",1,2019,02,21
224,Excellent stay,Absolutely loved this hotel - newly opened so everything very sparkly.  Location was in a nice quiet area opposite canal but only a 5 minute walk from some great pubs.  Staff always very helpful and friendly.  Room and bathroom very spacious with quality toiletries. Would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2019,02,20
224,Great and quite hotel in Dublin ,"Well located, close to Saint Stephen’s green park. I visited with two friends and we felt completely satisfied with the room and the kind staff attention. Everything is new, clean and comfortable. The neighborhood is calm and have some good places to have a drink closer. Totally recommended. 

",5,2019,02,18
224,Great stay,"Stayed at the hotel for valetines day. Great service. Friendly staff. Had dinner in the retaurant and it was amazing. 

Overall great place in city cetre with delicious food, amazing coctails, and vwry friendly staff. I would definately recomened this hotel.",5,2019,02,17
224,Very Stylish!,Stayed here with my partner in November 2018 while it was still having some work done to the front of the property. So I can only imagine how it looks now as it was a bit of a building site at that entrance! Inside however was a different story the hotel is obviously very new with stunning contemporary decor! Whilst the frontage was not finished during our stay I have no doubt that it will look fabulous by now. The room we stayed in was practically brand new and oozed quality though it was not the largest of rooms it was still very comfortable. The staff were all very polite and courteous. It was a good base for exploring Dublin and I would highly recommend it to anyone considering staying there.,5,2019,02,12
224,Great Hotel,"Brand new and Fresh hotel, nice cozy rooms, great and helpful staff, nice breakfast area, walking distance to downtown (Grafton Street) (quicker by tram), fast enough wifi and quite small gym but does the job.",5,2019,02,12
224,Excellent,"Myself and my girlfriend stayed at the hotel over the second weekend in February 2019. First time we had both stayed in Dublin together. The room we stayed in was spacious and well-cleaned/presented. Came with a very nice bathroom (However no bath), TV and large bed to fit both of us in twice. 

The location is about a 15 minute walk into the Centre of Dublin (Temple Bar). Other methods such as the tram is 7 Euros a day (Which is around the corner from the hotel location) or you can get a taxi which is around 15 euros per trip. 

Next to the hotel is a lovely pub called The Barge, where we ate and drunk there most days of our stay (Mostly for breakfast). We didn't use the hotel breakfast offer, but it was busy every morning - you might find cheaper places to eat then at the hotel though. 

The customer service from reception was fantastic, really helpful and kind. They also have a storage room to place bags into when you arrive or after you need to check out.

Overall and very pleasant experience and we will be returning when we come back.",5,2019,02,11
224,Brilliant New hotel ,"Brilliant new hotel, with great facilities including a gym. Staff very friendly especially a young woman that was serving breakfast, she was very personable and seemed to remember each customer every morning. 

This hotel offers value for money with the hotel rooms spacious and having everything you need. Only had breakfast in the hotel and there was a great selection available including hot breakfast, variety of cereal, bread, cold meats and cheese etc. 

Definitely will be back, and will be using this hotel as a base for when I am on business in Dublin. Would highly recommend this hotel to others.",5,2019,02,09
224,Great base for a business trip,"This was a great location for my group as we were visiting clients in the area. Check-in was ok but could have been quicker. Once in the room it is just as expected, clean and today, very comfortable bed, big tv, tea/coffee facilities, and decent bathroom.

I ordered room service and that came quick enough, my only gripe being €7.50 tray charge on top of the cost for a toasted sandwich.

Breakfast was typical for this hotel chain, good variety and well stocked with service for tea, coffee and toast.

Overall I would definitely return when on business.",4,2019,02,08
224,Great and New!,"The hotel is new and our stay was spectacular. The room was big and the bed very comfortable. We had to walk to the city centre but the surroundings were so beautiful, it didn't matter. You can also take the tram and be there in minutes. Though it only takes fifteen minutes to be there walking. 
Customer Service was good and we made some good friends.",5,2019,02,06
224,"Not a bad option, quite disappointed in some of the reception staff","First time visiting Dublin, stayed for three nights with friends:

Room - nice, quite new, spacious, very comfortable bed.

Location - not bad, I, personally, wouldn’t call it central location. I’d say about 25-30 minutes walk into city centre. But the area itself is nice and there is a lovely local pub just around the corner - The Barge, would 100% recommend!

Service - unfortunately, was left a bit disappointed with some of the reception staff. When checking in I was made to feel very uncomfortable when I asked what I believe was quite a simple question about the total cost of the room. I literally asked why the price we were told on reception is different to what it was when we were booking - I believe as a person paying for it I do have a right to ask this question, which I did in a polite manner. However, i received an answer which, in my opinion, had quite a bit of an attitude in it, namely, the way it’s been delivered and facial expression etc, that its ‘obviously’ a conversion between GBP and EUR. As a person who works with currency conversions on a daily basis, I am aware that there is no such thing as a nearly €100 difference between the two currencies. When I mentioned that, all I’ve been told that it must be something with booking.com then and I should call them instead if I’m not happy. That situation made me feel really uncomfortable and genuinely ruined the first impression of the hotel, I wasn’t for a second refusing to pay - I actually already paid by then, I was just asking a simple question and didn’t expect to be made to feel kind of ‘ashamed’ of my question - surely I wouldn’t be staying in a hotel that I cannot afford. That put me off from approaching that person on reception for the whole stay so I had to wait for any other reception staff to ask for help when I needed it.

Overall, I personally, wouldn’t stay in this hotel again because the main point for me is service and friendliness of the staff, especially if it’s my first time visiting the city, but everyone is different so I totally appreciate reviews that are a complete opposite to mine, I might’ve just been unlucky. Thank you",3,2019,02,02
224,"New hotel, OK location, disappointing service from reception","Travelled first time to Dublin for my Bday in Jan 2019, long weekend for 3 people, I have booked a room in December 2018 via booking.com.We arrived to hotel 7-8 pm, there were few people in the lobby sitting, reading drinking, no-one was checking in.
There was 2 staff members at reception, we were checked in by Leo (who may be still in training) and a supervisor. We were a bit confused about rate from pounds to euros, which seems to be high and asked to explain how it worked out and received a very brief explanation from supervisor with an attitude as if she was doing us a favour explaining. We were too tired and wanted to go to our room to leave bags and eat something. I had a very bad back, which I explained and asked for some ice to be brought to our room, which was advised I should get myself as its only down corridor... smb brought it eventually so thank you for that. We found ice machine after so we did not bother anyone anymore.

Room was ok, very strong smell ( air freshener or some sort of fragrance) as soon as we entered the room, had to open windows and it was cold in a  room after. Booking was done a while ago and yet we had to call for extra towels and mugs as room was set up only for 2 people. Dust on a headboard was all 4 days untouched, but since the hotel is only new- everything else was functioning and clean-ish still.

As smb said before its still unfinished so construction still going and there is a noise if you facing that side and a very sensitive sleeper. Also I would agree that the hotel is good for 2-3 night stay due to location and there is not much around, not a bad pub on a corner and a grocery shop. We had 2 intense day planned so did not stick around much in a hotel.

Next morning, We have asked same supervisor how to get to bus stop 757 to go back to airport, explanation was given as if we lived i Dublin and were asking stupid question. In the end we booked a taxi. To be honest-Me and my friend were actually shocked of the attitude we have seen both days from same Person for no reason. we both worked on reception  in a big hotel, with weddings and golf events all year round, with vip guests every weeks, countless groups checkins over 200 people sometimes and such behaviour from anyone, especially a ""supervisor"" was unacceptable. For a newly opened hotel the reputation with this approach will be not so great. As i said we hardly been in a hotel both days, and hardly were a demanding customers, and trust me I know how demanding guest can be. I have read positive feedback about staff, and I can agree that bar staff, cleaners and few other people on reception were nice, however we were not that lucky to experience that.

Last day morning we had coffee and breakfast in hotel bar/restaurant to save time before airport. Lady that served us was lovely and the restaurant manager/supervisor was very nice and apologetic as we had to send food back and my friends did not eat in the end as it still came out wrong. I asked if I can speak to anyone, but waiter just brought the bill, where we were not charged  for food, which is a nice gesture but we left hungry..

To sum-up: new hotel, nice room, ok location, rooms are pricy and if you book from UK better pay straightaway online as the euro rate is changing all the time and you will end up paying more on arrival.

If reception staff especially supervisors, who should  really be an example to their team give attitude to the guests from the very second they check-in- you won't go far with this approach. We all have good/bad days, but guest is a guest and wants to feel welcomed from arrival and thought whole stay,  first impression can't be changed and ruins overall picture and impression, if you loose your guests- you won't be in this hotel or business for much longer.

I did not mention all names, people who were those days on their shifts know who they are. I really hope that you make adjustments for your next guests.

Thanks!",3,2019,01,28
224,Excellent new hotel with superb service,"A fabulous, faultless, five-day stay at this classy new hotel nestling on the banks of Dublin's Grand Canal. Wonderful,friendly professional staff make this latest addition to the long-established Clayton group stand out from most of the 4-star competition in this most vibrant of cities.
During our stay some final construction work was taking place, but we weren't inconvenienced in any way, either by access or noise.
Breakfast was always of impressive quality- the fresh fruit was delicious and, as a Scot, I loved the porridge.
As a journalist WiFi is always vitally important to me and the speed and reliability at this hotel were both first-class.As a result my weekly columns for the Sunday Mirror and Sunday People whizzed over to the London desks faster than usual.
Special mentions too for the simple-to-use room safes and the state-of-the-art lifts, which are lightning quick.Our comfy double bed was also another big plus and the servicing of our room was of a very high standard.
To be honest it was very hard to find fault with anything at all.If I was being picky,perhaps ice machines situated on all floors rather than just on the second and fourth, would be a bonus.
And maybe the outside smoking area at the present entrance could be moved to a more suitable area once the building is complete.
When filling the bathtub in our room 335, we were unable to get the water hot enough, despite the shower being perfect.
The only slight issue we had during a memorable stay was due to a misunderstanding over a request for a late checkout. But it was quickly resolved by the professional and courteous intervention of the ever-patient reception staff.
The location is great- right next to a Luas station that will transport you near and far. There is also a really good gastro, music and sports bar, The Barge, just 100 yards away.Some lively craic and tunes in their most nights.
It's also just a 15-minute walk to the picturesque city centre park at St. Stephen's Green and the designer shops of bustling Grafton Street. This area is a shopaholic's dream and packed with bars, restaurants, theatres and all kinds of entertainment.
All in all, a very relaxing and enjoyable experience that was as close to perfection as could be. I will definitely return to the Clayton Charlemont in the very near future. It's now my number one choice in Dublin. A big well done to all the staff.",5,2019,01,28
224,New hotel,"Spent three nights at this brand new hotel in Jan 2019.  Hotel is located on the corner of Charlemont Street and Charlemont Mall, overlooking the canal, NOT on Adelaide street as shown by google maps and some other sites!  Close enough to restaurants and pubs in Ranelagh, Bagot St and Richmond st and a 15 min walk into the city centre.  Rooms are pretty standard but well designed and, because hotel is new, pretty good value at the moment.",4,2019,01,27

The Hotel itself was stunning,very modern and in a great location! Would highly recommmed the hotel.",5,2019,01,27
224,Can’t give 5/5,This hotel has everything I look for. A contemporary feel. Love the decoration. Very comfortable large rooms. Gorgeous bathroom. Friendly helpful staff. 10/15 minute walk into town. Nice pub next door. So why can’t I give 5/5? Because the restaurant was shut all weekend 😩. Otherwise 👍👍👍👍👍,4,2019,01,22

224,Fantastic hotel,"We went for a weekend to Dublin and spent a night in Clayton Hotel Charlemont which was amazing.The staff were nice and polite, they managed to check us in early and even give us a free upgrade to Executive King Suite! 

The hotel is beautiful as it is brand new, it is decorated with care and the bar/lobby area is a great place to relax with a coffee or drink before dinner. Breakfast was a great selection - cooked items such as bacon and eggs were delicious, and there was plenty of choice for healthy items such as fruit, granola, nuts, yoghurt. Everything was fresh and delicious.

The room itself was lovely - we loved the soft bathrobes and we even want to buy some for home! The toiletries were Rituals brand which was another small luxury touch. Room are supplied with ice buckets for wine or champagne and there are ice machines on two of the floors which makes it very convenient for guests.

Overall, fantastic stay and would definitely come back there next time in Dublin.",5,2019,01,15
224,Christmas present ,"My son and daughter arranged a trip to Dublin for my husband and I as a Christmas present. They booked us into this new hotel for the weekend. We arrived very late on the Friday evening, this was no problem. We had a quick drink in the bar before heading to our room. It was so new you could still smell the carpet. The room was very clean with plenty of fresh towels. The bed was extremely comfortable.  All the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful, especially Andrea ( I think that is her name- apologies if not) in the dining area. I wouldn’t hesitate in returning here. The walk to the city centre was about 15 minutes. One suggestion- fresh milk for tea in the rooms x",5,2019,01,14
224,Very nice hotel,"Very nice hotel, brand new and lovely interior. 
Staff were helpful and welcoming, bar very nice but expensive (as is the rest of Dublin). 
Only problem with the bathrooms- 
Shower was lukewarm and not very powerful, also toilet roll was very cheap and didn’t have a nice feel- not like Andrex! Also more toiletries would have been useful. 
The hotel is located about 30 mins walk from Dublin centre but we did not mind this as the walk is very interesting and lots of different places to eat along the way. 
Saturday morning around 9.30am was very quiet around the area however the closer you get to Dublin centre the busier it was. 
Really good hotel and would visit again!",4,2019,01,13
224,Fantastic hotel and amazing staff,"I stayed a overnight with my friend just to relax and we really enjoyed it.
The service is great and all the staff is very friendly, helpful, and welcoming.
The hotel is new and beautiful with a good location (just a 15 minutes walk to Grafton Street and few minutes to Luas stop).
Room and bathroom were spacious, clean and modern. Bed and pillows were super comfortable.
The reception and the bar are lovely. In the bar, we enjoyed a delicious and casual dinner (tapas style). Also, we enjoyed a good breakfast with delicious and many options.
We highly reccomend the hotel.",5,2019,01,08
224,"Unfinished hotel, forgetful, roasting room, cold showers","We attended as a birthday gift for myself and arrived to an unfinished hotel, with building works sounding out fairly early in the mornings. Additionally a birthday welcome was laid on at extra cost which was forgotten upon arrival, an extra £30. 

The shower/s are energy saving, so don’t expect hot temperatures. The bedroom was absolutely roasting hot and the only way to manage it would be leaving air con on which of course most people are not comfortable with, this meant waking each morning with a really dry throat because of the dry heat in the room. 

We were lucky we kept ourselves busy in town during the days and didn’t spend a great deal in our room. But value-for-money the 5 star reviews I imagine are for very short-stays, but anything +3 nights I’d advise to look elsewhere. 

The room porters were extremely lovely and helpful so credit has to be given there and some of the reception staff were very nice. Bar/restaurant staff seemed somewhat undertrained and confused when asked some simple questions, not to their discredit but more so down to management I imagine.",1,2019,01,07
224,Nice stay,"This hotel had the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. Was nice that everything was so new and clean however there was 2 long black hairs in the sink and another two in the shower,  not so nice!! Breakfast was typical hotel breakfast although cooked food was not as greasy as others. We didn’t have drink in the bar as there was no atmosphere and very open just off reception area although some lovely bars near by. Toilet roll was like sand paper so would advise you to bring your own. Hotel was easy to get to from car park in st Stephens green (€17.50 per night) by Lucas although it’s only 10mins walk. Would return to this area although not sure if I’d return to this hotel.",3,2019,01,06
224,Great stay!,"This hotel really is beautiful, you can tell how new it is by how perfect everything looks! The staff seem to be lovely and very helpful with any queries you might have, always greet you and happy to help.

The reception area and bar are lovely and the rooms are just as good! we got a free upgrade which was a lovely gesture, the room was huge, plenty of hangers in the wardrobe is a plus for me and a huge comfy bed which was like sleeping on a cloud! the bathroom was also lovely, good shower etc. if there was one thing to moan about with the room is that it was too hot! and that was in December! we didn't spend much time in there but when we did at night it was quite stuffy and obviously the windows don't open very far which is fair enough for security! 

The location is decent, not too far from temple bar and Grafton street, easily walkable if you enjoy a good walk, also Stephens green not too far away for a nice dander and people watching! If you prefer to get a taxi i don't think we paid much over 10 Euros from the centre which was worth it late on. 
All in All a wonderful stay and would 100% recommend it and visit again if returning to Dublin.",5,2019,01,03
224,Wonderful stay in a beautiful new hotel,"I stayed here the week before Christmas and I cannot fault it.  The room was spacious, spotlessly clean and really comfortable bed and pillows.  Staff were friendly and smiley.  The hotel itself has an impressive foyer and decorated really well.  Breakfast was one of the best I have had in a hotel.  There is a huge choice and the set up was really attractive.  The bacon was cooked to perfection, and the scrambled eggs were perfect (very rare in a hotel), they were not overcooked.  The breakfast staff were attentive, but not intrusive and very professional.  I would highly recommend staying here, its situated on the Grand Canal and is a short 20 minute walk to Grafton street, via Harcourt street.",5,2019,01,02
224,Amazing hotel and service!,"Me and my friend came to Dublin to celebrate new year and stayed at the hotel, we had a fantastic stay hotel was very fresh modern along with great service from the staff- very friendly and helpful. easy walk to temple bar area and a €7 bus journey from airport that stops 5 mins outside hotel. All in all great stay would be back( and the beds are seriously comfy)!",5,2019,01,02
224,Excellent stay ,"Spent two nights at this lovely new hotel in Dublin. Staff were excellent and very accommodating. Great location and fantastic food. Room was perfect, could not fault this hotel and will definitely stay here on the next visit to Dublin. Breakfast is a must !",5,2018,12,31
224,Lovely hotel!,"I stayed here with my husband, father in law and brother in law for a weekend in December for my father in laws 60th. I booked this hotel as it had a great offer on as it was opening soon (we booked well before it opened), I also booked it because it advertised that it had a fitness suite.

General hotel and staff - all very smart, clean, well decorated and looked lovely decorated for Christmas. the lobby is really smart incorporating the older building into the newer lobby. The staff were all so friendly and polite and always checking we were ok.

Food and drink - we didn't eat at the hotel but the bar staff were all very attentive and couldn't do enough for us.

Room - this was lovely, so clean and tidy, nicely decorated and finished to a great level. I am not sure it had even been used as there was still a cover on the shower!

Facilities - this is where I was a little disappointed as I booked this hotel as it was advertised as having a fitness suite - this is a really important aspect for my husband and I when travelling and one of the main reasons we pick hotels. I would have not stayed here had I known the fitness suite did not exist when we stayed. I came down shortly after arriving to use the gym, I was told it didn't exist despite there being floor signs and signage telling you where to go and being on all booking details. While I appreciate this is likely because it wasn't ready after the hotel being finished we were not told at any point. I received several emails ahead of my stay reminding me and we checked in and at no time were we told it was not there. As mentioned I would not have booked this particular hotel if I had know it was not there - I do also note that for future guests this will likely have been finished and available to guests but for us it was an issue.

Overall this was a lovely hotel with great staff and I would really recommend it, comments on the fitness suite aside.",4,2018,12,24
224,Fabulous,"Just checked out from spending a weekend here to have a relaxing break after an illness.
The staff were wonderful, from facilitating am early check in so I could rest to changing my room as I wanted a bath. 
The room was beautiful and the bed so comfy my husband is trying to track down the manufacturer to buy one! The breakfast was gorgeous and a huge choice of food on offer.
If you want great traditional Irish hospitality in modern surroundings stay here. I had thought that wonderful polite service was going out of fashion. Not here!
As an irish person living abroad I will return. And recommend this hotel to all",5,2018,12,23
224,Amazing hotel!,Stayed over night at the Clayton Hotel Charlemont. It's the nicest hotel I've stayed in. Beautifully designed and fab location on the canal.  The breakfast is very impressive with such a wide variety you honestly wouldn't be stuck for something to eat.  Credit to all the amazing staff who were all so happy and helpful. I would highly recommend the hotel and will be back myself!,5,2018,12,20
224,Very good comfortable hotel in an excellent location,"Chose this hotel for it's location, reasonably quiet, a decent walking distance to the City centre, Temple Bar etc. but also for the Aviva Stadium as we were attending a rugby match there. The hotel is very comfortable, the staff extremely polite and helpful.
We stayed 3 nights, our room overlooked the canal, was warm, spacious, cleaned each day spotlessly. Breakfasts were some of the best hotel breakfasts we have experienced! Wide range of fruits, cereals, breads, cakes and cooked Irish breakfast!
My wife rates hotels on the standard of their poached eggs, these were excellent!",5,2018,12,18

224,Shopping trip,"We stayed in the Clayton Charlemont to do some Christmas shopping, we thought it would be handy,not to far of a walk from the city! We were advised on their website to park in q park st Stephens green and have our ticket validated for 24hrs at €17.50. It said to catch the green luas two stops to the hotel but as it was a fine evening we walked it in 15 minutes. 
The hotel is newly renovated and was very clean and warm. 
We decided to get room service as we were tired from shopping, the room service menu was great and they even have a 24 hour menu! I thought I’d be woken by party goes through the night but we slept very well undisturbed!",4,2018,12,12

224,New hotel,"This is a new hotel which wasn't quite finished when I stayed a week after the official opening date. Room was lovely with comfy bed and monsoon shower. A few teething problems meant the restaurant wasn't open yet and the bar only does tapas style small plates, so I had to walk down the road to the Hilton! Also, there were tradesmen finishing off the painting in the corridors.",3,2018,12,04
224,Perfect stay,"Stayed at this brand new hotel in December of 2018 for two nights on business - great hotel, great bed, everything brand new and up to date, staff so eager to please the whole stay was a true pleasure for a very compatible price. Highly recommended!",5,2018,12,04
224,Great stay,"Lovely stay at this new hotel, staff were really helpful, as this was our first visit to Dublin, showed us where to catch the tram from, and drawing us a little map of attractions.  Hotel its self is shiny and new. The room we had was very spacious, and as it was new every thing was immaculate. Didn't eat at the hotel so can not comment on food. This hotel is easy to get to from the airport, we caught a bus from the airport which dropped us about a 5 minute walk away. You can walk into the main areas from the hotel, it's just over a mile to walk into Grafton street, or a quick tram ride away. Plenty of near by pubs or reasturants to get a bit to eat or a pint of Guiness. ",4,2018,12,03
224,Lovely hotel,"This hotel is beautiful, everything is so new and fresh. We stayed for 2 nights in an amazing room, very clean and well maintained. The staff were very friendly and helpful.

224,Fabulous Stay! ,"As two of the first guests to stay at this hotel we were treated like royalty. From arriving to a free breakfast (which was outstanding) to getting a room upgrade we had the greatest stay. The rooms were lovely, it is in a great up and coming area and all employees were very friendly and accommodating. We couldn’t recommend this hotel enough and we will definitely be back! 

Thank you to everyone who made it so special! ",5,2018,11,26
224,Newly Opened Hotel,We were the first customers staying in this hotel; newly built and you can clearly see this by looking at the facade. Friendly staff and top of the notch rooms. Definitely will stay here in our next Dublin visit.,5,2018,11,25
224,Location and rooms mediocre,"Unfortunately, I cannot quite agree with the reviews so far;
The location is okay, but central is different in my opinion. About 15-20min walk or a few stops by SBahn (stop is very close, however) are already needed to get to the center. 
The room was adequate, but you can only tilt a window slightly because these are to the floor. 
To top it all off, the windows have struts attached to them like bars in the prison (should be architecturally valuable?) and extremely dirty (especially inside). The rest of the room, however, was mostly clean. The shower has very little water pressure and the ventilation system above it has been full of dust. 

Pros: The friendly service in the restaurant / breakfast (especially. Caramel does a great job). 
Breakfast is typically Irish in terms of choice (sausages, beans, blood pudding etc...), but you can also order good omelettes, porrigdes, etc. fresh at the table. 

I was surprised by the really good chicken curry in the evening restaurant !",3,2024,09,23
224,Very nice and modern hotel located south of the city center,"We spent 4 nights at Clayton Charlemont and had a spacious 3-bed room in the 2nd floor. Floor (1 double and 1 single) overlooking the backyard, quiet location. Very good and rich breakfast buffet. Nice and large lobby area. Friendly and helpful staff. Location good, located on a canal. Downtown easily accessible on foot or by public transport. Pub around the corner (McCaffertys at the Barge) in the evening highly recommended. We would definitely come back!",4,2024,08,30
224,Great choice just minutes walk from Dublin city centre,"We have been 1 adult and 2 teenagers.
Buen hotel. It is just a few minutes walk from Dublin city centre. Quiet area, no noise.
Spacious and clean rooms.
Bus and tram stop next door.
Excellent service and attention, both at reception and in the restaurant area. Thank you to Gloria for her kindness. Very professional. He kept an eye on how comfortable we were.
Recommended.",5,2024,07,31
224,Very disappointing,We paid almost €1600 for 4 nights. We were initially given a room in the basement with a very small window. Terrible. We were then offered a room with leaky windows. Here you could hear every car driving past. Terrible! Incredibly bad experience to end our vacation.,1,2024,06,18
224,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel and very good service. Special mention to Oriol who was always available and willing to help us about places to eat, visit, etc. The location is very good and pubs or bars are super close. We will have to repeat it if we return to Dublin",5,2024,05,12

224,Very irregular room service.,"I have been there for five days, four of them I had to notify the reception so they could bring me clean towels, we were three people in a triple room and they only left one or two clean towels each day. They didn't make the bed, they put the duvet on top of the mattress and that's it, they didn't even stretch the bottom sheet, they left it full of wrinkles, exactly the same as I left it in the morning when I got up. The positive thing is the breakfast, and Gloria, Alba and Oriol, three Spaniards who work there and who are very friendly and attentive.",2,2024,05,01
224,A comfortable stay,"The facilities and cleanliness are correct, the breakfast buffet is good and Oriol's friendliness made the stay more pleasant by attending to all our needs in a more than correct way, I will recommend this hotel to my friends",5,2024,04,30
224,Good hotel to visit a big city,"The hotel is well located in a quiet neighborhood (no more than 15 minutes walk from the shopping area and 20 minutes walk from the Temple Bar area). The comfortable rooms.

224,Comfort and relaxation,"Modern hotel, with careful design especially in the hall which recalls an internal courtyard with a Mediterranean flavour. Friendly staff attentive to every need. Strategic location, away from the nightlife but two tram stops from Grafton Street and still convenient for most of Dublin's attractions. Excellent breakfast, perhaps a coffee machine should be added to limit the queue in the morning. Also tried dinner at Lockside, everything was excellent, in particular the steak sandwich, chicken curry and salmon fillet. One of the waiters was particularly hospitable and made us feel at home. Comfortable and quiet rooms. Super competitive price, difficult to find such good value for money during the Easter period.",5,2024,04,04

Recepción espectacular  amplia y útil para estar tiempo de relax, leyendo, navegando por internet o tomando algo.
Solo desayunamos 2 veces en el hotel y hay que decir que fue muy completo y con mucha información de las alergias, cosa que nos vino muy bien. Eso sí, el pero es que es caro el desayuno.

Estuvimos en una habitación triple con camas super cómodas. Con bastante espacio para la ropa. Suficientes enchufes USB, mesa auxiliar útil para tomar el te / café o agua y galletitas que todos los días teníamos preparado junto al hervidor de agua.
El baño amplio y muy bien equipado con una ducha muy cómoda.
La habitación estaba muy bien insonorizada y limpia.

Pero si queremos destacar algo sobre todo lo demás fue el trato del personal. 
Raquel de administración es un sol. Ya antes de ir, en alguna consulta que realizamos por email nos contestó rápido y claro. Pero cuando la conocimos allí, nos sorprendió por la amabilidad y disposición a aconsejarnos sobre Dublín. Lo mismo podemos decir de Isabel que nos aconsejó alguna excursión y restaurante que nos encantaron. Y Oriol con quien pudimos hablar incluso valenciano aunque mas novato que sus compañeras, fue todo amabilidad y preocupación.
Es un lujo hablar y entenderte fuera de España en Castellano pero si además son gente profesional y amable eso es ya de 10.

En fin un hotel muy, pero que muy recomendable.",5,2022,08,22
224,Consigliato,"L’hotel , molto bello, è in una posizione strategica perché facilmente si raggiunge il centro sia a piedi che con il tram che si trova proprio ad un minuto di distanza. Stupenda camera panoramica al quarto piano,ottima colazione e servizi eccellenti. Personale gentilissimo e professionale",5,2022,08,19
224,Clayton Hotel Charlemont Dublín,"Hemos estado alojados 6 noches en el Hotel Clayton Charlemont en Dublín. El hotel está bastante céntrico, es nuevo y las habitaciones cómodas. Teníamos el desayuno incluido y nos gustó mucho, pero el día anterior a la salida solicitamos que nos prepararan algo para llevar pues teniamos que dejar el hotel antes de que abriera el desayuno. La decepción fue grande ya que nos entregaron una bolsa con un croissant, un plátano y un zumo. También reservamos un taxi y nos dijeron que esperasemos en la recepción del hotel, que el taxista entraría. El taxista llegó 10 minutos antes y entró para avisar de que ya estaba. Aunque nos vieron esperando los recepcionistas nadie nos dijo nada.
A pesar de estos detalles de último momento, la estancia general ha sido satisfactoria, gracias también a la gran amabilidad, simpatía y profesionalidad de algunas personas del equipo, destacando a Raquel Martínez, que facilitó todos los detalles de la reserva con total diligencia y prontitud, y a Oriol Traver que desde la llegada nos atendió con tanta simpatía y se preocupó en todo momento por nuestra estancia.  Tanto Raquel como Oriol, ambos españoles, facilitaron nuestra estancia en Dublín con sus acertados consejos.",4,2022,08,06

224,Estancia perfecta,"Hotel nuevo, las habitaciones triples son grandes, comodas y muy limpias, la cama cómoda y en el armario tambien hay más almoadas por si las necesitas. 
Tambien hay plancha para ropa, secador, cafetera en todas las habitaciones, asi como agua de cortesia cada día. el unico pero seria que no hay nevera, pero la verdad es que tampoco la necesitamos. 
Muchos enchufes por toda la habitación , con el enchufe de alli y con usb por lo que no tuvimos problemas para cargar, y si por si tenias problemas de adaptadores en recepción te dejan uno.
El personal de recepción, las camareras de planta y del desayuno muy atentas y serviciales.
El centro es un paseo a 15 min por calle animada con muchos restuarantes y pubs, ideal para ir a cenar o tomar algo.",5,2022,04,11
224,Prima volta a Dublino,"Arrivati un po' in anticipo rispetto all'orario previsto per il check-in, ma la camera era pronta ed il ragazzo alla reception è stato professionale e cortese. Hotel bello fuori e dentro, molto moderno, con atmosfera cosmopolita. Camera spaziosa, pulita, recente. È il nostro primo giorno di 4, speriamo che la buona impressione iniziale permanga durante tutto il soggiorno.",4,2021,11,04
224,Vacanze a Dublino,"Abbiamo trascorso un bellissimo weekend 
di 4/5 giorni a Dublino. Indimenticabili. Presso l’hotel Clayton Charlemont Street, siamo stati coccolati dallo staff... camerieri, baristi, il personale della reception 🛎.... 
L’albergo e davvero elegante, comodo, pulitissimo degno di 4/5 stelle ✨ .
Il bar con una varietà immensa di birre artigianali.... il ristorante davvero comodo e con un ricco menù. 
Il cibo buonissimo 😋!!!
Un grazie di cuore a tutto lo staff... uno in particolare a Errica del ristorante, alla signora Carmel delle colazioni ed al signor Gabriele della reception 😘👍👋
Grazie davvero a tutti ed un arrivederci a presto 👋🍺

224,Relax e comfort,"Hotel in posizione strategica, non lontano dal centro. Abbiamo scelto la camera con il letto king size, indispensabile per la statura del coniuge e l'abbiamo trovata veramente confortevole. Il personale veramente cortese. Un particolare ringraziamento al barman Simone e alla receptionist Cristina che ci hanno aiutato a dirimere piccole questioni legate alla poca dimestichezza con la lingua. Da consigliare assolutamente",5,2020,08,10
224,neu renoviertes Hotel mit tollen Mitarbeitern,"Sehr schöne Zimmer, leckeres Restaurant (Abendessen) und sehr gutes Frühstück. 
Der Empfang war wunderbar, sehr nette Mitarbeiter an der Rezeption, die einem immer Hilfsbereit zur Seite standen.
Ich hatte schon vorher mit einer Dame per Mail Kontakt, die war sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit.
Zum St.Green Park läuft man ca. 15 Minuten.",5,2020,02,05

224,Confortevole ,L’hotel è vicino alla strada degli artisti non è in pieno centro ma ne vale la pena. Le stanze sono molto confortevoli e c’è tutto compreso il ferro da stiro 🙈🙈 Il personale è molto professionale e gentile e ci sono anche 2 italiani alla reception che ci hanno consigliato benissimo!!! 🔝🔝🔝,5,2019,11,28

224,Neues hübsches Hotel,Sehr schönes neues Hotel in recht guter Lage direkt an einem Kanal gelegen. Ca. 20 Minuten fußläufig bis zur Innenstadt. Die großzügigen Zimmer sind sehr ruhig und mit einem schönen Bad ausgestattet. Das Frühstück war ordentlich. Das Hotel verfügt über eine hübsche große  Lobby mit einer kleinen Bar.,5,2019,10,28
224,Un'esperienza unica,"Con il mio compagno abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel 4giorni e tre notti... L'albergo è pulito, abbastanza vicino ai luoghi d'interesse...

224,Esperienza fantastica,"Bellissimo hotel  dotato di camere confortevoli e molto pulite. Prima colazione varia e abbondante. Disponibilità di alimenti gluten free. Personale altamente profesionale, gentile e molto accogliente. Una particolare menzione per Cristina della Reception che ci ha seguiti  con grande attenzione e cordialità. Consigliatissimo.",5,2019,10,13
224,Consigliato ,"Struttura nuova e molto ben curata. Posizione decentrata, la qual cosa, per inciso, non è un difetto vista la varietà di mezzi con i quali è possibile raggiungere il centro città in pochi minuti. La fermata della Luas (tram), ad esempio, dista 200 metri dall'hotel. Il centro città è comunque facilmente raggiungibile a piedi se si ha voglia di fare una bella passeggiata. Colazione varia e di qualità. Una speciale menzione alla cortesia del personale, ed in particolare di Cristina, che si è resa disponibile e prodiga di consigli. Ci tornerei.",5,2019,08,28
224,"Ottimo soggiorno, cosigliato.","Vacanza in famiglia di 4 giorni. Hotel nuovo, in poche parole.......tutto perfetto, posizione non centralissima ma a piedi in 10 minuti si è in centro, servito bene da autobus e tram. Servizio receptions e concierge perfetti. Pulizia della camera e servizi nulla da dire, quello che ci si aspetta da un 4 stelle e devo dire non così caro per il tipo di hotel e servizi. Macchina del caffè Lavazza con cialde in camera sempre pronta, asciugamani sempre perfetti, insonorizzazione della camera ottima come anche il Wi-Fi gratuito e in tutto L hotel e moooolto veloce. Lo consiglio assolutamente. Info per chi arriva e va dall aereoporto, in taxy ci voglio circa 20 minuti con una spesa di circa 25-28 euro in tre.",5,2019,08,26
224,Angenehmes Hotel,"Sehr nettes Personal, schöne und neue Zimmer, tolles Frühstück, gerne wieder beim nächsten Besuch in Dublin. Die Lage ist perfekt als klassischer Tourist für eine Sightseeingtour. Der Flughafen ist mit dem Taxi gut erreichbar.",5,2019,08,25
224,Perfetto,"...al confine tra la zona residenziale di Ranelagh e il canale, accanto a The Barge e a 100 metri dalla fermata metro verde è ottimo per serenità, cortesia senza invadenza, professionalità, comodità, colazione, pulizia...insomma, non potevamo trovare di meglio per la nostra prima volta a Dublino. Torneremo di certo. Per i turisti italiani, Cristina è gentilissima e molto preparata per ogni vostra esigenza, ma al bar c'è anche un altro ragazzo molto in gamba. Tutto il personale è comunque pienamente adeguato e gradevolissimo. Grazie. ",4,2019,08,18
224,CHE BELLO!,"Non si è in centro, ma l'hotel è vicino alla fermata del bus che arriva dall'aeroporto e a quella del tram che porta in centro. La camera è grande, pulita e molto ben insonorizzata. L'unica pecca è che mancano i cassetti per riporre i vestiti. Molto gentili i ragazzi alla reception, tra cui vorremmo ringraziare e salutare con grande simpatia Cristina.",5,2019,08,17
224,Moderno e accogliente,"Pur essendo un po’ decentrato, l’hotel è a due passi dalla fermata del tram che porta al centro di Dublino. Le camere sono essenziali ma hanno tutto il necessario per un soggiorno confortevole, sono ben illuminate, nuove e spaziose. Una menzione particolare spetta a Cristina, receptionist italiana che ci ha accompagnati durante il soggiorno con simpatia e professionalità. ",5,2019,08,16
224,Irlanda on the road,"Hotel ben attrezzato di tutto, le camere pulite e confortevoli. Staff gentile soprattutto la signorina Cristina che ci ha seguiti e consigliati per qualsiasi cosa. La posizione rimane leggermente fuori dal centro ma per chi ama camminare è l'ideale.",4,2019,08,10
224,Dublin and Dubliners ,"Ho trascorso una notte in questo hotel, durante un breve tour un Irlanda. L’hotel è facilmente raggiungibile anche guidando una propria auto e dispone di posteggi privati. L’architettura della hall è interessante con salottini su più livelli ed una parete su cui si aprono finte finestra da edificio commerciale. L’ arredamento moderno crea un giusto mix tra modernità ed accuratezza nella scelta di colori e materiali dai colori caldi e crea una sensazione di morbida serenità. Al check-in siamo stati accolti da una giovane e sorridente signora, Cristina, che, riconosciuta la nostra origine, con garbo e gentilezza ci ha spiegato ogni dettaglio in Italiano. Ci ha procurato numerosi adattatori per ricaricare i cellulari e ci ha  offerto suggerimenti sul quartiere. Una ragazza deliziosa capace di farti sentire accolto, quasi come se ti si stesse aspettando. Le camere sono spaziose, pulite, senza minibar ma con acqua minerale e kettle a disposizione. Torneremo per la nostra ultima notte a Dublino before  going back home. ",3,2019,08,04
224,hätte besser sein können,"über das Hotel & Zimmer gibt es absolut nichts einzuwenden. Es ist sehr neu, modern und wir fühlten uns wohl in unserem Zimmer. Es ist nicht gerade an bester Lage gelegen, aber in Ordnung. 

Als wir ankamen, konnten wir nicht einchecken weil sie einen Systemausfall hatten. Die Checkin Zeit ist ab 15:00Uhr - wir sind um 14:30 angekommen und mussten fast einundhalb Stunden warten bis wir ein Zimmer erhielten. Alle Gäste wurden vertröstet die einchecken wollten. Ich hätte zumindest da erwartet, dass uns eventuell ein Getränk abgeboten wird um die Wartezeit zu überbrücken.. naja, wie auch immer. Als wir dann endlich unser Zimmer erhielten, der nächste Schock!!!

Ich habe für meinen Partner eine Überraschung vom Hotel organisieren lassen, indem ausdrücklich das Geburtstdatum vom 31 Juli drin stand.. dekoriert war das Zimmer bereits beim Checkin am 28 Juli...  toll!! War wohl nichts mit der Überraschung! Dieses Missgeschick hat mich sehr enttäuscht & deshalb kann ich es nicht weiterempfehlen.

",3,2019,08,01
224,Ottima struttura ,"Camere pulite e staff gentilissimo, in particolare la receptionist Cristina che è stata molto cortese e attenta ad ogni nostra esigenza. Collegato al centro attraverso la linea verde del tram ( 5 min). La cucina del ristoratore è ottima",4,2019,07,25
224,Muy bien,"El Hotel está en un lindo lugar, cerca del tren hacia el centro. Se ve lindo y con una decoración atractiva. La atención es muy buena, tanto en recepción como en el desayuno/ bar. Especial mención a Leo, de recepción, que nos atendió en español y con toda la onda.",4,2019,07,23
224,Hotel recien estrenado bonito y confortable,"El recepcionista que resuelve con eficàcia los tramites es Leo, las otros recepcionistes necesitamos mejorar. 
El desayuno es muy bueno, la vista del canal desde la sala entre semana, es genial, las habitaciónes son còmodas. Ojo con las habitaciones que solo tienen bañera por es muy alta.",4,2019,07,08
224,Stanze piccole a prezzi enormi,Un po’ decentrato ma soprattutto stanze molto piccole se comparate alla categoria dell’hotel ed al prezzo !! Ma soprattutto non chiamate executive dei buchi abbiate almeno il coraggio di chiamarle standard. Così per non ingannare nessuno....,2,2019,07,07
224,Consigliatissimo ,"Ho alloggiato presso questo hotel dal 25 al 30 aprile. Mi sono trovata benissimo. Ottima posizione, con una piacevole passeggiata si arrivava al centro della città. Camere confortevoli, arredato con gusto in ogni settore, dalla ampia hall, al bar, alla zona ristorante /colazione. Pulizia, servizio, cortesia da parte di tutti, in particolare Cristina alla reception ci è stata di grande aiuto,. Colazione abbondante e ottima.. Sicuramente ci tornerò!!!! ",5,2019,06,15
224,Peccato,"L'hotel è nuovo, pulito ed in posizione ottima, la ragazza italiana molto gentile. Per queste cose non do un giudizio pessimo.

Peccato che ho speso 550€ per 3 notti e mi hanno riservato una stanza per disabili con il lavandino a 60cm da terra (quello dei puffi), e per uno alto 185cm doversi piegare a 90° per lavarsi la faccia non è il massimo della comodità (cosa che esigo data la spesa), le mie ernie ringraziano. Nonostante ci abbiano offerto il cambio stanza dal secondo giorno, io ritengo sia una grave mancanza di rispetto se non una presa per i fondelli. Se prenoto una stanza, pago per quella stanza e non me la cambi poiché l'hotel è pieno! Che serietà è mai questa? 
Altra cosa spiacevole la nostra stanza era adiacente ad un'altra, separata da una normalissima porta chiusa a chiave. Non vi dico i rumori, non era nemmeno sigillata tanto che se aprivi le finestre per il riciclo dell'aria tremava tutta.
Dulcis in fundo, l'unico 4 stelle dove manca il frigo in camera, cosa fondamentale per avere dell'acqua fresca in camera data l'aria secca e il non poter aprire le finestre per quanto su detto!",2,2019,06,06
224,Tutto perfetto,"Ottimo hotel situato a una decina di minuti a piedi dal centro, personale gentilissimo e ottima colazione anche la parte dolce è un po' carente a parte le marmellate e dei croissant...ma del resto siamo in Irlanda ed è duopo la colazione irlandese.
Peccato non aver potuto utilizzare la palestra. Consiglio sia l'albergo che il pub accanto, the Barge....
Da tornare per vedere altre bellezze a Dublino",5,2019,06,02
224,Alejado,"Un hotel bastante lejos del centro de Dublin y de las principales atracciones de la ciudad. Además, los taxis tardan bastante en llegar, siempre más de lo inicialmente previsto. Las instalaciones son modernas y la atención bienintencionada aunque los empleados, siempre amables, necesitarían un conocimiento más amplio de la ciudad y sus servicios. La habitación tirando a pequeña y el desayuno algo justo.",3,2019,05,28
224,Angenehmer Aufenthalt,"Generell hat das Hotel unsere Anforderungen an ein Haus dieser Größenordnung erfüllt: gute Organisation, freundlicher Service, ansprechende Zimmer. Persönliche Details sind hier nur schwer umzusetzen. 
Die Sauberkeit unseres Zimmers war weitgehend einwandfrei wenn auch erst spät am Nachmittag gereinigt wurde. Mangelhaft war lediglich ein verschmutzter Bettüberwurf bei unserer Ankunft, der jedoch umgehend entfernt wurde. 
Das Zimmer ist mit zahlreichen Steckdosen und USB-Anschlüssen ausgestattet. Adapter kann man problemlos an der Rezeption ausleihen. Positiv hervorzuheben sind außerdem das Tee-Zubehör (für kältere Tage), der Föhn sowie die Bügel-Station.
Bett und Bettwäsche waren sehr bequem und wir haben wunderbar geschlafen.
Die Lage ist ausreichend zentral, gut vom Flughafen zu erreichen und fußläufig befinden sich zahlreiche hervorragende Restaurants (Little Kitchen, Locks, Pickles). 
Das Frühstück war ansprechend, wir haben es jedoch vorgezogen, in einem nahe gelegenen Kaffee zu frühstücken (Grove Road).

Schade war, dass - anders als in den öffentlichen Bereichen - Pflegeprodukte auf dem Zimmer nicht von Rituals waren. 
Als unangenehm empfanden wir außerdem den synthetischen Geruch im Treppenhaus, der wohl davon herrührt, dass das Hotel noch sehr neu ist.",4,2019,05,22
224,Nuevo y bien situado.,"Hemos estado 4 noches en este hotel y ha sido una muy buena elección, recomendable 100%. Hotel muy nuevo, con habitaciones correctas, no muy grandes pero no agobia y cama muy cómoda. La habitación superior es genial!!
Personal agradable y servicial.
Situado a 20 min andando del centro, y bien comunicado con el aeropuerto. En los alrededores hay de todo: supermercado, cafetería, un pub y un río precioso para caminar.
Por poner una pega: la cuna es regular, casi sin colchón, y no tienen edredones ni mantas para el bebé. 
Si volvemos a Dublin sin duda repetiremos hotel.",4,2019,05,05
224,Fantastico,"L'hotel per eccellenza, impeccabile immagine per un accoglienza a 5 stelle, e a tal proposito un particolare plauso, va alla grandissima professionalità  della reception in particolar modo Cristina. Un Hotel che rispetta in pieno tutte le normative di sicurezza e confort. Le stanze perfette ed una hall di gran lusso. La sua posizione geografica é strategica, poiché vicinissima al centro. Colazione ottima. Sicuramente più costosa, rispetto agli standard italiani. L' angolo bar, offre un ottimo presupposto per gustare un buon bicchiere di birra. Consigliatissimo.",5,2019,05,02
224,Sehr zu empfehlen!,Das Hotel befindet sich in einer guten und ruhigen Lage unweit der Innenstadt. Die Zimmer sind sehr gut eingerichtet. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und aufmerksam. Das Frühstück ist ausgezeichnet. Die Hotelbar ist ebenfalls zu empfehlen. Wir haben uns dort sehr wohl gefühlt.,5,2019,04,24
224,Favoloso😍,"Ho soggiornato presso quest Hotel qualche settimana fa e sono rimasta positivamente stupita
La posizione è ottimale ...dista dieci/quindici minuti dal centro ma è a due minuti dallo sturbucks😅
Personale gentilissimo,hotel pulitissimo e davvero davvero bello.
Camera e bagno molto grandi,ambiente caldo (vi consiglio di portare un pigiama estivo anche in pieno inverno!)
Dovessi ritornare a Dublino sceglierei sempre il Clayton Hotel !
Rapporto qualità prezzo ottimo ,soprattutto per i prezzi che ho visto in giro di b&b e appartamenti!
3 notti €200!
Ne vale la pena 🙃🙃🙃
