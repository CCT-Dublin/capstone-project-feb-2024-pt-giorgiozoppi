11,Fabulous Hotel that pays attention to the details that make a stay exceptional.,"Wonderful hotel, so much attention to details that make a stay exceptional! The staff and service were impeccable. The hotel itself is gorgeous and well maintained. The towels were soft and fluffy with warmers available. The shower head was fabulous and the pressure excellent. The bed was very comfortable. It was also great to have adequate electrical outlets for all our charging needs and our bedside appliances. The location is also very centrally located, so you aren't far from any of the major sites and it is literally just a few blocks from some of the best restaurants in the city. 
We were upgraded to a double balcony junior suite overlooking the Passeig de Gracia and it was a lovely view of the vibrant boulevard. Surprisingly, it was not too noisy at night and we had no trouble sleeping. 
Overall, it was a great stay and we will DEFINITELY return to The Majestic in the future.",5,2024,10,17
11,The only place to stay in Barcelona!!!,"Amazing location just minutes walk from Casa Batlló and 20 minutes from Barcelona’s most famous street La Rambla.  Beautifully appointed rooms with nice ambiance and amenities including turn down service.  Warm, helpful and friendly hotel staff. Beautiful and comfortable rooms with great amenities. Fun roof top restaurant and bar to enjoy city views. All and all a lovely place to stay. ",5,2023,03,27
11,Outstanding Hotel,"The Majestic Hotel is located in the most beautiful part of Barcelona with easy access to Las Ramblas boulevard and the Gothic Quarter. The Hotel is extremely attractive and well maintained with excellent amenities. The Hotel staff are friendly, attentive and helpful.",5,2024,10,14
11,Barcelona Hidden Gem,"Fantastic, grand hotel in great location.  Service, food and room were all top notch.  It was ideally located on Passeig de Gràcia and easy access to all areas of the city.  Breakfast was also amazing and staff was professional and friendly.  I recommend staying here for anyone planning a trip to Barcelona.",5,2024,10,12
11,"Upscale, top notch hotel","The entire experience was memorable from arrival to departure.  The staff was very friendly and helpful, everything done with a smile.  The room was incredible, the bed was large and comfortable.  The cleaning staff was very thorough and the room was meticulous clean.  I would rate this as a five star stay.",5,2024,10,11
11,A good place to stay in Barcelona,The Majestic Hotel is centrally located allowing us to walk to most sites within Barcelona. The hotel restaurant and lobby bar were superb. An added treat was the the Rooftop Bar. It has a panoramic of the city and is great place to finish a day in Barcelona.,5,2024,10,10
11,last experience at the Hotel,"Excellent service and great pemises which combine the best of the old days with the newest advantages and amenities. It maintains its flavour.

11,Great hotel and location,Wonderful stay at a classic Barcelona hotel. Location is perfect. Staff is extremely friendly and attentive. The place to stay in Barcelona ,5,2024,09,30
11,Tiny luxury hotel,"The rooms were very small. We were just a couple and with luggage we kept bumping into each other. A small closet to store your luggage but only 1 carry-on suitcase can fit in here. A minibar that included a coffee machine, tea station, and a fully stocked fridge. A small desk which was half occupied with snacks that you needed to purchase. The room has overlooked a whole lot of pipes.  The bathroom had a walking shower and a separate toilet area. All amenities were provided including gowns and slippers. A little disappointed that turndown was only provided for the 2 nights we stayed there. The rooftop bar has amazing views of Barcelona. A tiny pool on the rooftop is available. The hotel breakfast is outstanding. There is a buffet of savory and sweet and the hot breakfast is available from an al-carte menu. The breakfast area is under a glass area which makes it. The service was quite good at the breakfast area. There was only one restroom in the lobby area. There was a decent gym and there was another pool in the spa area which was not private. The location was on the best street in Barcelona and around 15 minutes of walking distance to Ramblas and the Gothic area of Barcelona. The best churros in Barcelona can be found within a 10 minute walk from the hotel.",3,2024,09,29
11,Perfection,The rooftop alone is a reason to visit! The service was impeccable. The staff was very kind and helpful with everything. Very central location. Can be a bit noisy at night but that comes with the territory of being central to everything. Would definitely stay there again. ,5,2024,09,29
11,Magic in Barcelona,"The Majestic in Barcelona provides a world class location and experience. From in house dining choices, to the quality staff, to it’s decorating /architecture and its proximity to high end shopping and must see tourist sites, makes the Majestic the choice when in Barcelona.",5,2024,09,28
11,Amazing hotel,"Great hotel, super nice staff and the best location! The hotel was super clean and the roof terrace has the best view!",5,2024,09,27
11,First experience.,"Had heard this hotel long time ago, finally got chance to stay. Just as it imagined to me, high end class.",5,2024,09,27
11,Fantastic stay,"Excellent stay once again. Fantastic service from all staff from arrival to departure. No issues room was exceptional and extremely clean, very high standards",5,2024,09,27
11,Fantastic Location and Service,"We stay at pretty nice hotels around the world so I can say confidently that the Majestic is operating at the highest levels of service and ambiance. We checked into the Majestic after my wife attended a conference in Barcelona at the Torre Melina for the first part of the week, our 15yr wedding anniversary. I had left a note about the occasion and the staff left us a nice note and a bottle of Champaign for the occupation! That was a special kickoff to a wonderful stay. The location is also exceptional, within blocks of 2 Gaudi master pieces right on Passeig de Gràcia, was also an exceptional place to watch the Carrefoc during La Mercia. Last time we were in Barcelona we stayed at the Mercer Hotel in the Gothic Quarter, which is also very nice, but we did like the feel of this larger hotel that still feels intimate. We are excited to go back to the Majestic!",5,2024,09,24
11,Helpful and Kind Staff,The Majestic is a lovely hotel with a welcoming staff. It is conveniently located and has a number of amenities that provide opportunities for a total holiday experience.,5,2024,09,24
11,CANNOT WAIT TO VISIT AGAIN,"Absolutely beautiful hotel on THE street to visit in Barcelona. Greeted by attentive doormen, reception staff who can’t do enough and check in process was a breeze. The hotel is all marble floors and walls. The room was beautiful with a very large bathroom and the most comfortable big bed. The roof terrace is probably one of the best in Barcelona. It is possible to see nearly all the skyline and the famous buildings and the food and drink offering is delicious. Will definitely visit again.",5,2024,09,23
11,Majestic view features rooftop A/C units,"Majestic view of rooftop A/C units for $500 per night. Barcelona standards differ greatly from other international places we travel. 

Room inside is nice with a sitting area. Modern bathroom, flat screen TV and large closet space. 

European separate twin beds to give you a quasi Queen bed appearance. 

Espresso machine and mini fridge.",3,2024,09,21
11,Not everything as you would expect for a 5 star hotel,"Breakfast food and the staff were superior and the same apply to chambermaids. On the other hand, the reception staff was not up to par, not sufficiently friendly and helpfull, not as expected for a 5 star hotel. ",3,2024,09,20
11,This Hotel is Amazing!,The Majestic Hotel is a must stay! The staff is very friendly and helpful. The bed is very comfortable and all the housekeeping staff goes out of their way to make sure you are taken care of. It is located in a great area for walking to shops and restaurants.  I would stay here again for sure!,5,2024,09,18
11,Worth it if you’re looking for a cheaper 5 star hotel to fit your basic needs,"Someone in an earlier review stated that it’s “on the lower end of 5 star hotels and you get what you pay for.” They are absolutely correct! 

What makes this hotel 5 stars:
1.) staff! 
2.) cleanliness 
3.) modern rooms 

Cons: 
1.) you have to keep on asking for the amenities, you won’t find anything in the rooms, not even a shower cap! It’s just annoying that in this standard of a hotel you have to keep begging for simple things. 
2.) the automatic lights turn off SO quickly and their sensor system is not the best! So there were times when I was in the bathroom and the light just shut off on me. And I tried to find a way to see if the automatic shutoff could be turned off but it was not possible. 
3.) FRUIT FLIES all over the breakfast buffet!! This is unhygienic. Please do something about this! 
4.) Speaking of breakfast, I must’ve had high standards based on all the reviews but it was not good. Except for the meats, there weren’t that many other options. 
5.) we personally did not like our room layout. It was hard to walk around",4,2024,09,17
11,My Stay,Great place to be in the middle of Barcelona.  I fell in love with the sangria and the view from the rooftop.  My only complaint is our stay was too short.,5,2024,09,17

A nice room 
Best place in barcelona

Majestic is magic 
Nice to see you soon ",5,2024,09,16
11,Best hotel in Spain,"Fabulous hotel with the perfect location, you can walk everywhere! The new Wellness. Enter is amazing and really, really beautiful. Hard to imagine how calming it is until you experience it. The staff is wonderful, very helpful and very, very friendly. They enrich the experience in every way.",5,2024,09,15
11,Promises broken,We were promised a city view!  The view we had was of a roof top and a building wall!  Not what we were expecting for the price!  ,4,2024,09,15
11,Good but not great.,"The hotel is beautiful and our balcony was one of the best outdoor spaces I have ever had at a hotel. Breakfast was as amazing as it was reputed to be. The only things that made it not earn full five stars was (a) a Concierge who was less than helpful when I asked for assistance/recommendations (b) cumbersome checkout process that took much longer than it really needs to be, and (c) we did not get free water or snacks in the room. Having stayed at properties of the same caliber in Barcelona, Paris, London, Copenhagen and NYC in the past year, it was shocking to have a Concierge who was so reluctant to give personalized restaurant recommendations and that everything except for tea and coffee in the room had a price tag.
Overall, I love the location, the room, the rooftop and the spa service... but I would not say this this hotel delivers nearly the bang for the buck as much as two nearby competitors in the same niche.",4,2024,09,14
11,Luxury,"From walking in the door to your departure service is superb, food is delicious, wine list extensive, area is safe, accommodation is grand",5,2024,09,14
11,The worst quality for money,"Overall, my experience was unfortunately disappointing:

1. Misleading Information about the Room: I booked a Deluxe room via the website for €600 per night. While I expected a base room, the online photos showed a bright room of 20-25 sq.m with views of the Eixample District courtyard or Pasaje Campos Eliseos. Instead, I was given a room with no windows. When I requested a change, I was moved to a room with a view of a wall. The following day, I still couldn’t understand why the room I paid €1,200 for two nights didn’t match the description or photos 
2. Unhelpful Staff: When I asked to change rooms, the staff requested that I vacate my current room by 10 a.m. and leave my luggage behind. I was only given a new room at 3 p.m., which had a view of the parking lot. In this hotel, “views over the Eixample District courtyard or Pasaje Campos Eliseos” seems to mean “no windows,” “view of a wall,” or “view of the parking lot.” (Please find real views from Deluxe room attached)
I had to carry my luggage around for five hours with no assistance.
3. Poor Cleaning Standards: I observed inadequate cleaning in the three rooms I was assigned.
4. Rooftop Terrace: The rooftop terrace is a nice feature, but you can access it even if you're not staying at the hotel. Hotel guests have to wait in the same line as non-guests. 
5. Aging Facilities: The hotel and its facilities are quite old and in need of renovation.
6. Hi Frozen Deposit: The hotel requires a deposit of €100 per night, which means if you stay for a week, €700 will be held until after your stay. This information was not provided in advance.
Based on my experience, I would not return to this hotel or recommend it to friends. The value for the price is poor compared to my previous stays at Sofitel and Grand Hyatt in Barcelona, which were significantly better.",1,2024,09,13
11,Fabulous Experience,Perfect location. Elegant hotel and staff. Rooms were clean and well serviced. Food was excellent. Rooftop experience very special. Wish we could have stayed longer.,5,2024,09,13
11,Tough but the hotel is nice,This hotel is beautiful. Located exactly where you want to be. Close to everything. The front desk people and bell staff were excellent. The problem was that we couldn’t get any sleep. We were put in to room 742 which is in the corner but the service staff and the door to service was in that same corner. The service staff was loud all day and that door kept on being opened lol night. It makes the worst noise and so do the service people. That was just horrible. Make sure you don’t stay there.,2,2024,09,13
11,"Excellent location, architecture, art, first class amenities with staff who make you feel like “ family”","For over 10 years, the Majestic has been the location for our final 2 nights after spending 3 months at our holiday place in Spain. These 2 nights continue to be must do for my wife and myself for not only the location, architecture, first class amenities ( our favorite being the must visit Roof Top Bar) but more importantly the fact that we are made to feel like part of the “ family”- this is unique .😁😁",5,2024,09,11

11,"The Majestic Hotel,  Same Outstanding Service Since Our Last Visit in 2019 Due To The Pandemic. ","It's been over five years since my husband and I were in the exemplary hotel.
We had had a difficult flight to Barcelona and The Majestic Hotel.  The Majestic Hotel team were in action before we arrived.  I was very concerned about our delayed flight from Heathrow.  I texted my travel agent of the delay.  She said they are monitoring your flight.  You see The Majestic had arranged for a driver to pick us up around 6:30. When my husband and I finally arrived at British Airways baggage claim area, I saw only two bags . Did I mention that my husband was lost.  When the driver called me for an update,  I was crying and couldn't find my husband.  Our driver said ""Mrs. White do not cry"".  When I turned around he was there at baggage claim with me. I told him that my husband went to the restroom. He found my husband. I must say the reason I was so upset is my husband was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.  It is in the mild stage. This was our first trip since his diagnosis. Now it was after 8 pm. Then I realized two bags were missing. Our driver stood in the British Airways Baggage claim line for me until it was my turn.  We were in luck because the two pieces of luggage were on the next flight.  He suggested that we stay there until the flight arrived at 9:30. They arrived and he retrieved our luggage.  We then pushed them out of the baggage claim because of security regulations. 
When we arrived at the Majestic,  we were greeted by a lovely lady.  She was waiting for us. Once in the room,  we ordered room service for dinner. It was now after 12 am. Now you won't believe this!  Pedro brought our cheesecake and said ""Mrs. White didn't you stay in 905 the last time you were here?"" Who remembers the room number that you stayed in in 2019?  Pedro did.  
When my husband and I arrived,  it felt like home. Yes, that's the type of service you will receive when you stay at The Majestic Hotel.  The next time you're in Barcelona,  stay at The Majestic Hotel!",5,2024,09,04
11,"Great location, Comfortable Accomodation and Good Staff","This has a great central location on a main avenue.  The hotel is modern and comfortable and the rooms, while not very large, were just fine.  The breakfast room and the breakfast were terrific and the staff very friendly.  There was a comfortable lounge and bar area.",4,2024,09,04

Excellent breakfast,for all tastes.
Go there with you eyes cloeded and let yourself be lulled by this wonderfull maintained establishment.",5,2024,08,26
11,Historic building,We stayed here for 3 nights. The room was a junior site and nice size. The room amenities were very nice. Bathroom was large with a good size shower and tub. Lighting was poor to apply makeup. Housekeeping kept the room very well supplied with amenities and water. The location was great to access the main shopping street but because of that it was a bit noisy at night. Breakfast was a very good buffet everyday with a lot of variety. Our only negative was what they called a pool. It was a small plunge pool on the rooftop in the middle of the bar. Not conducive to a “pool day”. But the roof top view of Barcelona was lovely!  This is a historic hotel with good service and very safe. ,4,2024,08,26

11,"Claudio, Camilla, Sofia & Fernando 5 stars each","Please don't use pillow examples it had me confused. But to be honest my review about this hotel is if it wasn’t for Claudio, Camilla, Sofia & Fernando my stay wouldve been hard and unspeakable. I dont speak spanish and its my first time in Barcelona. They have been soo sweet and nice and kind and helpful. They are never late in saying or doing anything. They are always available and caring to my wellbeing and happiness. Absolute Pleasure to have met and dealt with them. This is the quality of Duty Managers and leaders in the hoteling and hospitality business.",5,2024,08,20
11,The breakdown of a “five star” hotel,"My wife and I just completed a week long Virgin voyages cruise around Mediterranean. I decided to book one night prior and one night post cruise at two different hotels in bcn. Last Saturday we stayed at the monument hotel (second time there) and it was perfect. Attentive polite staff, excellent accommodation and on site 3 star Lasarte restaurant was great. Today we checked into majestic hotel across the street from monument.
They are both “five star” hotels and both part of Chase luxury hotel collection as well as Amex fine hotels. We’ve stayed at many many diff high level hotels and resorts around the world and I’ve never ever seen anything as poorly run as this place. There are many options in this area such as mandarin oriental and monument hotels. The level of rudeness and unprofessionalism at the managerial level is beyond expectation in the worst possible way.
We disembarked from the ship at 10am and were at the hotel by 1030. We checked in assuming our room wasn’t ready based on the amount of people in the lobby. We were told check in time is 3pm but there would be a note put into the computer that we arrived and as soon as the room freed up they would prioritize the housekeeping for it. We left our bags and went for a long walk u til about 1pm when I inquired on the status of the room to be told it’s currently being worked on and would be ready soonish. We sat in the lobby until 255 patiently waiting for the phone call to come get the keys. The call never came.
My wife went to inquire a second time to be told we didn’t actually miss any phone calls because the room is still being attended to. By this time it was 305pm (with a guaranteed check in at 3). She requested to speak to a manager to get some sort of explanation for the delay.
At 310, a “manager” showed up. (Three diff people were already in line to speak to this manager regarding various/ pretty serious issues). The response- your room will be ready in 15 minutes. Our question- why? Response- because it’s a big room it takes a long time to clean. I told him this is an unacceptable answer to me. Response- I’m sorry but it will be 15 minutes. I told him I heard him the first time but it’s not an answer. He didn’t care if I did cartwheels in front of him he looked me straight in the eye and said it’s too bad but right now it’s going to be 15 minutes. I realized we weren’t getting anywhere with this talk so I let the next guest go.
14 minutes later he showed up with a key, led us to the elevator said I apologize for delay thank you and you’re welcome.
If you are looking for a true 5 star hotel experience in Barcelona in the center of town I highly, highly discourage staying here. The location is prime; the room is ok, the level of service is absolutely the worst possible I could ever describe. I can’t fathom how this manager could’ve gotten a position in hospitality at a 5 star hotel with the rudeness and attitude that he presents his guests. Absolutely disgusting. And I will be sure to pass along these thoughts to anyone i know traveling to or thru Barcelona.",1,2024,08,18
11,First time Barcelona trip,"Hotel was excellent in a great location.  Included breakfast was awesome.   Navigating the hotel (finding the room) was a bit of a challenge.  Staff was good.   Rooftop deck afforded great views.  However, cocktails were rather pricey.  Workout facilities were nice but far to hot.",5,2024,08,18
11,My memorable stay at the Majestic Hotel Barcelona,"I hope to in the near future to return to Barcelona and of course stay at the Majestic 5 star Hotel

11,"Gorgeous hotel, great food, but the staff are EXCEPTIONAL.","An absolutely lovely hotel with a PHENOMENAL staff. 

My elderly father is…difficult and I am blown away by the patience and kindness of the staff members. 

Vera and Alicia were incredible at coming up with a solution when we had a slight accessibility issue. Sharon and Edurne could not have been lovelier every time they assisted us. A HUGE thanks to Laura for her tremendous help on a daily basis-just above and beyond. 

When you write a review several days later and still have everyone’s name in the front of your mind, they’ve clearly made a wonderful impression.",5,2024,08,17
11,In the Heart of Barcelona,Outstanding staff. Room was exceptional. Breakfast was like nothing I've ever seen. I can't think of anything they could have added to the variety. Loved the decor especially in the breakfast area.,5,2024,08,17
11,"Beautiful rooms, not for tweens","The hotel is beautiful and the individual staff very good, but I had a few big problems they did not properly address, both that made it less enjoyable fir my kids (and thus for me lol). Also this is not as great a hotel for kids in general as I was expecting from reviews. 

Our TV did not work properly the entire time. They tried to fix it once to no avail, and then I complained again and they tried to fix it and again it didn’t work. No follow up or concession after that. 

The pool is tiny, I mean tiny. You csn reserve the indoor pool which is also a small sliver but they let 15 people reserve at one time which would mean you would all basically have to stand and not move. 

After talking to the head of guest relations about both issues (He sent the second repairman), he didn’t follow up after the TV didn’t work again, and I ended up having to complain at checkout about it again. They finally took a massage service off my bill. All in all I felt like they didn’t really care that much.",3,2024,08,13
11,Gorgeous hotel,"Only came here for the rooftop restaurant. The hotel is gorgeous im sure the spa is 10 shades of fabulous simply based on the aesthetic of the hotel. I wrote a review for the restaurant but long story short: it was perfect, we loved our meal, the vibes were great and Filippo and team took excellent care of us during our time there. Having a reservation made the seating process seamless. Absolutely recommend",5,2024,08,11
11,Amazing and huge apartment hotel,Great apartment hotel with great central location. Great to have laundry machines in the unit. Would definitely stay again. Only minor issue is that I wish that the rooftop pool would stay open later than 7 pm.,5,2024,08,10
11,Bad services and dirty room,"Very bad front desk for check in and out. Many guests lined up and waited for check in for few hours and even until 4pm. Very dirty bedsheets, got blood stains on bad sheets  and some of the guests got rashes and allergy. No body came to help even we call the front desk 15 earlier as advised by the front desk the day before. We have no choice and push all luggages downstairs and cross the road to check out after 45 mins",1,2024,08,08

11,Beautiful stay in barcelona,"It is always a pleasure to come back to Hotel Majestic! Great location, beautiful rooms, nice breakfast and a gorgeous rooftop! You won’t be disappointed!",5,2024,08,07
11,You get what you pay for,"Great location. Wonderful rooftop bar.

Be careful on the room choice. Ours was provided by our Cruise line and it was minimal. Very small, great view of a brick wall. The entry level rooms are not advisable. Do not book the least expensive room.",3,2024,08,06
11,Spectacular,"This hotel knows how to make a tired guest feel like royalty just by walking in the door.  The beds are so comfy, the linens cool and crisp, the breakfast is divine and make you want to linger just a little bit longer.   You won’t want to stay anywhere else!   Our favorite Barcelona hotel",5,2024,08,05
11,Nice hotel for those who want to explore BCN on foot.,"Beautiful hotel and excellent location. The staff is fantastic and we enjoyed the breakfast buffet every morning. Even when they are super busy during checkin rush, they find ways to accommodate you. 

Just a couple of comments re the rooms. They aren’t very sound proof and you can hear guests come and go very audibly. Also, the bed in our room was on wheels that were not fixed. Woke up many times at night to readjust them and pull pillows out from the gap between the bed and the headboard. Other than that, it’s a great hotel and I would stay there again.",4,2024,08,05
11,The jewel in the crown,"Majestic really lives up to its name, the perfect exclusive location, the grand entrance, smiles everywhere you look. Helpfulness as a way of living rather than a job.
Delicately decadent bedrooms with all the details to ensure you feel pampered, a breakfast to die for…
Have I mentioned their new striking wellness area? Such fantastic way to end a day of visiting the city!",5,2024,08,04
11,"Great location, lovely rooms but too much forced fragrances constantly sprayed in lobbies and hallways","Nice rooms, lovely breakfast, great location. Pool is too small for anything. 
Some strong fragrance is pumped heavily in lobby and hallways making it claustrophobic",4,2024,08,03
11,Thank you,"Thank you for all you do for the comfort and service of the guests, the staff without exception are wonderful",5,2024,08,03
11,Love!,Everything was awesome. The hotel has an enchanting smell as well. I really enjoyed the food and the spa. Will definitely come back.,5,2024,07,31

11,Exceptional hotel,Stay at the Majestic prior to joining our cruise.  It was recommended by our travel agent and did not disappoint.  Exceptional hotel and staff!,5,2024,07,30
11,Trip to Barcelona,"Overall it’s okay but the service can be better. For example, there were no toothpaste and toothbrush in my room and I had to call the counter to deliver them. Also no razor…",3,2024,07,29
11,Luxury self-contained apartments for families in a perfect location,"We stayed in a 2-bedroom residential apartment, which is in a separate building across the road from the actual hotel.

This was a perfect location for sightseeing, atmosphere and safety, in an attractive and prestigious street surrounded by luxury shops, within one block of the top Modernista houses by Gaudi and his contemporaries.

The apartment was very comfortable for a family of 4, with 2 bedrooms, 2 full bathrooms, a fully-equipped kitchen, washer/dryer, and an enormous lounge room with full-height windows/balconies overlooking the street. Whilst the bedrooms were a bit too small to keep open suitcases, the lounge room had more than enough room for all of these. Soundproofing was very good, so we were not bothered by street noise.

There is full access to the hotel's facilities (restaurant, bars, 24-hour gym, spa, concierge, porters etc.), yet you have the advantages of staying in a self-contained apartment - such as privacy, space, being able to prepare your own meals, and being able to do your laundry on a long trip!

Overall we loved it and would certainly stay here again next time.",5,2024,07,28
11,Beautiful and Perfect Location,From the moment we stepped into the hotel we were so pleased!  Staff warm and helpful.  Rooms clean and well decorated.  Location and views from room amazing. Will definitely recommend to anyone visiting Barcelona!,5,2024,07,28

11,Luxury Authentic Local Experience,"I love to find local great hotels like this. You have amazing service, runned by people from the city, from the country... You can not compare this experience with any global hotel chain. A must to be in Barcelona ",5,2024,07,26

11,Exquisite location,"Wonderful experience with an exquisite location. However, the rooms are considered very narrow without room for movement.",4,2024,07,22
11,unfriendly reception staff,"I recently stayed at this hotel for a business trip and was disappointed by the unfriendly reception staff. Despite booking 5 rooms, we faced rigid and inflexible service when requesting a late checkout. The staff insisted on charging us 250 Euros to extend each room to 5.00 PM !!, which we did not need. This experience was quite unpleasant and left a negative impression.",3,2024,07,21
11,Would not stay again. Too overpriced for what you get,"Very overpriced. Great location.  80% of the staff is great.  Huge language barrier.  took forever (every time, like an hour) to get room service. Pretty hotel, but the views of Pasieg de gracia are blocked by huge overgrown trees.  You can't see anything below.  Rooms are NOT soundproof.  You get to listen to motorcycles roaring by all night long.  And there are ALOT of them.",3,2024,07,18
11,Another excellent stay at the majestic,"Overall arrival experience, the experience and the departure was seamless. It was really nice to notice that even some of the least visible staff like the cleaning service and the taxi porters did their jobs with so much attention. Looking forward to the next stay.

11,Great Hotel !,The Majestic Hotel was recommended by our Seabourn cruise line. It met & exceeded all expectations! Highly recommended!,5,2024,07,16

11,Barcelona visit,Enjoyed our stay at the Majestic.  Excellent customer service for arrival and departure. All staff were friendly and courteous.  Great location for the shopping district.  Great rooftop as well.,5,2024,07,16
11,Perfect and grandiose hotel with great breakfast. Shame about the poorly insulated windows in our rooms.,"We travelled as a family of five and we got 2 bedrooms, one for my wife and i and another for my three children. We're members of Leaders club and we got complementary breakfast and a room upgrade because of that. The breakfast was delightful with great food and service. The room upgrade was a bit of a let down because we were given a room facing a very uninteresting and too close facade of the building in front of us. The Hotel location is absolutely perfect and the whole Hotel is grandiose, pristine and lovely scent all over. The staff was competent, helpful and nice, particularly Elena at the check in and Roger at the check out. The rooms were classical and large enough and everything worked fine. The only let down was the poor noise insulation of the room windows that are not up to par in such a great overall quality hotel. We had a great time in Barcelona.
Thanks for everything.",4,2024,07,16
11,Not a 5 star hotel,"Waited 30min a monday to check-in, when done, the person in charge left with our luggages without telling us everything was done so we waited an extra 10min not knowing if we should leave or wait to the person to come back. We were supposed to be called once the room was ready. We were told the room was being done when checking-in so it should be ready quick, no one ever called us, we had to go back hours later to know. Small elevators that make you wait sometimes 10min to go up or down. This is not a 5 star hotel experience. Restaurant on the rooftop is average, spa ok. Will not go back there ever. I am sure there are nice hotel in Barcelona, Majestic is not one of them",2,2024,07,15
11,room (726) no transparent window,from the window is not possible to get natural light and if you open you see air-condition tube. I don't think is a 5 stars hotel. ,1,2024,07,15
11,A very nice room but without a view,Our travel advisor recommended this hotel due to its central location and also its reputation. Having had recent knee surgery our advisor requested a room with a walk in shower. While I appreciated this feature our room had no windows only skylights. We really enjoy being able to look out onto the city from our hotel room. The food and service were both excellent. Other than our room having no windows our stay was great. ,5,2024,07,15
11,I am satisfied,"Hotel in a perfect place, very cozy, comfortable. Service helpful, great full breakfast syborg and charming viewing on the roof",5,2024,07,14

11,"Great location, beautiful amazing views","the hotel is beautifully decorated, great staff (everyone is very accommodating, the concierge service is so much better than the one we got in Italy, so thank you!) amazing views and rooftop. cons: we had two suites, one was absolutely wonderful, the second was not as expected...had a smell and heavier curtains/darker inside. early in the mornings, starting at 8 am, you could hear the cleaning crew moving furniture/cleaning.",5,2024,07,10
11,Great hotel and location but staff needs improvement,"The location of the hotel is excellent! Close to shops, restaurants, attractions, you name it. Large pedestrian areas and lively spirit. The hotel is beautiful! However, the service at reception we experienced from Fernando was unsatisfactory at best. His attitude made us feel unwelcomed after the premium you pay for a five star hotel. They need to work on their staff!",4,2024,07,09
11,Well organised,"Rooms in perfect condition, friedly service and good food.
In the center of Barcelona, perfect view from the roof-top and beautiful ambiente.",5,2024,07,09

11,good location but not good service,"location is very good, but service is not at the level of what it suppose to be 
the staff was not friendly and not helpfull",2,2024,07,09
11,The best in Barcelona,"Great property and location.  But its the staff that sets this hotel apart.  Every single person we interacted with was friendly, engaging, and super professional.  Housekeeping is a standout.",5,2024,07,08

11,Exceptional service.,All the staff were welcoming and professional. Overall a wonderful experience and a positive introduction to Barcelona.,5,2024,07,07
11,Family Vacation,The Majestic Hotel after a long flight was amazing.  The hotel is Majestic & perfectly arranged rooms for our family of 19.  Rooftop bar/restaurant with a pool was great.   Centrally located in the heart of the city. Walk to dinner & shopping.   Quick trips to the main sights.  Highly recommend!,5,2024,07,07
11,Deluxe Suite to IKEA apartment,I paid a lot of money for deluxe suite to be then sent to an apartment that the furniture looked out of ikea that was 5 mins walk away,1,2024,07,06
11,Overrated.  Understaffed.,Overrated and Understaffed - takes forever to get a seat for breakfast and the staff is a bit condescending.   The wait staff in the restaurant are pretty apathetic.  On a couple of occasions I ended up fetching silverware and a napkin on my own from the bus station.  We arrived at 1 am as a family paying extra for our son to sleep on a rollaway and the bed wasn’t even made.   The last thing we wanted to deal with after a 9 hour flight.   Stay elsewhere and save your euros.,3,2024,07,05
11,A disappointing experience,"I have always since a long time wanted to stay at Majestic. This stay was back to back from mandarin oriental hotel down the road. Majestic practically was disappointing on every front of our experience. There was dysfunction in the communication between the staff, our luggages were at one point missing, and we even had to do a room change due to the breaking down of the AC at midnight, only to be taken to a room which had not been properly serviced and was only serviced at the last possible minute. I would not return.",1,2024,07,05
11,Good stay,"The hotel is located in a very good area with easy access to most of the attractions. 
The rooms are very nice and spacious . The bathrooms have double sink and a large.

The staff is very friendly and helpful.",5,2024,07,04
11,"Beautiful hotel, excellent staff and great location.","Really a beautiful hotel in a great location.  The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. The roof restaurant is great.  There is very small pool on the roof that is part of the restaurant, but it is not set up with lounge chairs, so don't expect a roof deck pool experience.",5,2024,07,02
11,Wonderful stay!,"Everything was first class!  Particularly HIOMAR at the lobby bar... a true professional!
A very classy, clean and friendly place.  I enjoyed it from start to finish!",5,2024,07,02

11,Great time at the Majestic!,"Had a lovely week at the Majestic hotel, everything was top notch, great facilities, food and swimming pool/jacuzzi. 

Also a special shout out for Franco in the Majestic bar, he was our waiter on a couple of occasions, he was friendly, knowledgeable and really eager to help and really helped make our stay what it was. 

Overall though, we had a great time and will definitely be back.",5,2024,06,26
11,Fantastic stay,"I had an exceptional stay in this hotel in November 2011, in the heart of Barcelona, ​​near Plaza Catalunya, La Rambla.  tourist site par excellence. Very clean hotel worthy of 5 stars.
Room service is efficient and speedy.
SPA relaxant .
In the evening the living hall is well animated.",5,2024,06,26
11,Doesn’t quite have it together,Condescending staff and rooms where you can clearly hear the slamming of doors and everything in the hallway. Not a great view but good location. Would recommend finding a staff more experienced if you’re going to F1. ,3,2024,06,25
11,Nice hotel in Barcelona,"The location was really great, you can find nice restaurant and shops, also coffee near the hotel!
The roof top bar was really beautiful , love the view there.
Also the smell of hotel is really relaxing.",4,2024,06,25
11,Fantastic experience......almost,"If I could I would have rated the hotel 4.8. The room was fabulous and so clean, the staff were lovely and nothing was too much trouble. We loved the restaurants, especially the roof top terrace and the food was lovely & good value for the location. The only downside was the cost of the drinks  I expect to pay a premium for the location but felt that 18€ for a vodka & tonic and 8€ for a bottle of alcohol beer was rather excessive & left a bitter taste.",4,2024,06,24
11,Beautiful hotel in the perfect location.,"Excellent hotel in THE perfect location. Right in the middle of everything. The rooftop is amazing and provides fantastic views of the city. Staff is excellent, especially Alex Lecea and Meri Ros. They made the stay for our large group very effortless. Would highly recommend.",5,2024,06,24
11,Amazing hotel,This is a beautiful 5 star hotel in the best location possible.  I recommend booking the “Red Level” for complementary food and beverage.  The staff is amazing and helpful.  We truly enjoyed every minute is this beautiful hotel.  ,5,2024,06,24
11,"Great location, nice staff","We had a wonderful 5-day stay. The hotel is beautiful, centrally located, and clean. The staff is friendly and helpful. Their only negatives: the restaurant food was average, and the room sheets and towels were worn for the premium price. Overall, I recommend.",5,2024,06,24
11,All the accolades are well deserved!,"The Majestic Hotel & Spa is in a class all by itself. The service is phenomenal. The staff is friendly and helpful. Martin Garcia, the director of front of the house, is the gold standard for hotel management. The rooms are well appointed, comfortable and roomy especially important if you are traveling with family. The indoor hotel pool and spa is a lovely break from exploring. The food at the hotel is also excellent, especially the breakfast. I can’t recommend this hotel enough and will be back next summer!",5,2024,06,24
11,Wonderful Experience,"We had a flawless stay at the Majestic.  It was our first time in Barcelona and I chose the Majestic based on the reviews and because I enjoy historic, ""grande dame"" hotels, but I often find that historic hotels are showing their age. Not so here. The hotel is beautiful and the room was lovely, very clean and fairly spacious, including a small quasi-balcony (french doors but no actual balcony to step onto). We were particularly pleased with the complimentary bottle of regional wine that was waiting for us in the room. The rooftop bar, though pricey, offers a panoramic view of the city, and because we were staying at the hotel we were ushed to a table ahead of the dozens of non-guests waiting in line. The concierge and doormen were friendly as well as knowledgeable.  I would definitely come back.",5,2024,06,23
11,Majestic Experience,Majestic lives up to it's name and provides a majestic experience; Wonderful location; staff extremely helpful with all aspects of stay,5,2024,06,23

We were treated to an upgrade which was very welcome after a long drive and every effort was made to ensure our comfort.",5,2024,06,22

Thank you Elias !!",5,2024,06,21
11,Wonderful stay!,"We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. The staff were very helpful and nice. The hotel was beautiful and the location was supreme. We also had a massage at their Spa, and it was great. Among all the wonderful staff members, I have to mention Maria (who works on the rooftop) individually. She is truly a gem of a person, so kind and helpful regardless of how busy she was, she went above and beyond to assist me in making our friend’s anniversary a memorable one! I truly hope her management can recognize her for the outstanding service! Highly recommend this hotel!",5,2024,06,20
11,Excellent,One of the best hotels in the world. The penthouse has a brilliant terrace with jacuzzi and a breathtaking view of Barcelona. The hotel is perfectly located.,5,2024,06,20
11,Great area but rooms in dire need of renovation,"Fantastic rooftop with a beautiful view and wonderful food and service. The facial I had at the spa was excellent. Overall the staff was friendly and courteous. Great location!
It’s the rooms. They are in dire need of renovation. We had three suites. One was dirty and had some mold. I expected much more for cost of the suites. Very strong smells in all three suites, not necessarily a bad smell but felt as if it was a coverup for other issues. We kept our windows open.",2,2024,06,20
11,Favorite place to stay in Barcelona!,"Two friends and I just stayed for a wonderful week in Barcelona, at the Majestic ~ beautiful hotel with multi-lingual staff and excellent service! Great restaurants too, and we loved the rooftop lounge with views of the city. Be sure to get a room with a view, the best one your budget allows, it's worth it!  Enjoy the spa, and definitely see the Concierge for best restaurant recommendations.  Thanks so much!",5,2024,06,18
11,Amazing Hotel!,Highly recommend this amazing hotel if visiting Barcelona. We had a wonderful experience and would certainly stay there again next time in Barca. ,5,2024,06,18

11,good stay,it was a very good stay at the hotel but i had a problem with the bedding blanket sheets it was annoying a little and the room service food wasnt that much good other than that everything else was perfect ,5,2024,06,17
11,A grand dame who still knows how to have fun,"We loved this hotel - a classic, with attention to all the important things: service, food, rooms, cocktails.... And it felt so comfortable. Great staff. Great bars. Great breakfast. And in such a central location if you want to see the whole of Barcelona. This was our favourite ""fun"" hotel.",5,2024,06,17
11,"Beautiful hotel, great staff","Everything related to the stay was perfect, expect for the WiFi availability. It was literally non-existent in the suite. The staff provided a portable router for the suite, but it was totally ineffective as well. As long as you don't need WiFi and internet connectivity, you will be joyous with your visit to the Majestic.",4,2024,06,16
11,Absolutely Majestic!,"Truly a perfect place to stay.  We booked two Privilege rooms for five nights to explore the city of Barcelona with our college aged daughters.  We were given rooms on the first floor, which initially seemed low, but worked out ideally for easy access to breakfast and the lobby, and had a very quiet view of the street below.  The rooms are very updated and comfortable, with nice closet space and an incredible shower.  We all enjoyed daily cocktails on the spectacular roof with a full view of the entire city.  The breakfast is truly one of the best in the world -- beautiful setting, a buffet with everything you could possibly imagine and a full menu to order from if for some reason you had a craving not on the buffet.  The staff is incredibly helpful and friendly.  The location is central to walk nearly everywhere, but with a taxi stand and metro right next door.  A true luxurious and happy place to stay. ",5,2024,06,16
11,Best Hotel I've ever been in,"Best ever regardless if is the food, the beverage, the smile on their face, they spa from my wife, drivers for anything we need.     ",5,2024,06,16
11,Fabulous breakfast and wonderful lounges and bars (view from top floor bar/restaurant was wonderful),"The room was close to lots of shopping and sight seeing, the concierge had great advice for places to shop, the breakfast was fabulous, the rooftop bar/restaurant was wonderful and the lounges/bar on the main floor were great.  Our room was small (which was ok) but the view out of the window was of another wall - kind of claustrophobic for us.",4,2024,06,14
11,Exceptional,Perfect location very clean first class service very friendly staff the food was excellent. I highly recommend it.,5,2024,06,14
11,Excellent hotel,The majestic is an excellent Hotel in the heart of Barcellona.  The rooms are noticeably better than most European Hotels and the shower was terrific. Teh bell staff were extremely helpful as were the front desk staff.  The rooftop bar has excellent views and very attentive wait staff though the food and appetizers were not nearly as good as the food in their main restaurant on the first floor.  In retrospect we wish we had gotten drinks at the rooftop bar to enjoy the view and had eaten more in the main restaurant.  The main restaurant was excellent and the wait staff were terrific. ,5,2024,06,13
11,Best of Barcelona,"Stayed in a junior suite on Paseo De Grazia.
Amazing breakfast gorgeous rooftop with splendid view all over Barcelona,and the best is the reception team managed by Mr.Carlos Ravella that are always ready to help and allow you a very late check out.",5,2024,06,13
11,One of the most beautiful hotels in a great location,"…however some things can be made better! I like the classic and chic vibes the hotel gives, however the age also shows. The wifi is unreliable and the TV channels were hard to navigate in the night time when we did want to just unwind and relax. Breakfast was delicious but I expected better. Our coffee and omelette orders did not come until the very end of our meal; it almost made us late to our Park Guell time. I was a little sad and disappointed because I’d heard such good things, and the pictures of the breakfast spreads were beautiful. I’ve had better and this can definitely have some improving. Overall though, this hotel was still one of my favorite parts of my Barcelona stay just due to its class, and the servicing of the rooms multiple times a day. Very clean. I would stay again, just have my meals somewhere else. ",4,2024,06,13
11,The Majestic Hotel,"Staff was experienced, professional and highly attentive.  Room with balcony exceeded all expectations, highly recommended.",5,2024,06,13
11,Posh and elite,This is a posh and hotel for the elite.  We stayed in apartments across the street.  They were awesome.  They met our needs and was in the best location in Barcelona.  The hotel staff were friendly and great as long as we stayed in our apartment away from the main hotel.  I don't think we were glamorous enough to stay there.  I felt like 3rd class citizen on the titanic.  Checking out the door man was rude to us and stopped as we were trying to enter the hotel.  Other than that the staff were great.  If you can afford to shop a Chanel and Prada this is a place for you.  Middle class Americans can find a cheaper hotel somewhere else in Barcelona. ,5,2024,06,12

Will be back on our next trip to Barcelona!",5,2024,06,08
11,Your High End Country Club In The Middle of Barcelona,This place is very centrally located and done to a very high spec.  The facilities and spa are great.  The breakfast is by far the best I've ever had in a hotel.  It does feel like you're in a fancy retirement home on family day in 1997.  ,4,2024,06,05

Recommending this hotel to friends and family!",5,2024,06,02
11,Terrace restaurant,The waiter Elias was amazing and so helpful with us especially that I was with a diabetic person and did not know what to eat so Elias made some options that we could have. The service was 100/100 the place is amazing and good looking. Will definitely come again.,5,2024,06,02
11,The Hotel Majestic is truly majestic!,"The reviews for this property are across the board outstanding. The location can't be beat. The rooftop bar is awesome. Our room was perfect, the bed was very comfortable, and the breakfast service and food started off each day with joy. The people and service in every capacity were truly beyond our expectations. We had hoped to find a hotel similar to the Hotel Alphonso XIII in Sevilla that we loved so much, and The Majestic was equally wonderful. Thank you to everyone at The Hotel Majestic for making our stay in Barcelona so enjoyable.

11,Mediocre,"Good location but other wise disappointing. The hotel rooms are small but comfortable , poor storage and have an overwhelming strong scent.

The biggest problem was the lack of internet in the rooms. For two days we could not access the internet at all via WiFi. The router they offered never materialised. Reception don’t answer phone calls.

Decent enough hotel but shouldn’t be 5 star.",3,2024,05,31

11,My personal horror story!,I accidently left my jewelry in our room when we check out.  Several hours and hundreds of miles later I realized my mistake.   The front desk was helpful.

11,great hotel,"The hotel, location and staff are all what you would expect in a 5 star hotel. Wellness center and rooftop bar are an added bonus. The only negative for me was the furniture in the bonus room, uncomfortable and dated. Overall, I would stay here again 100%.",5,2024,05,21
11,Wonderful Hotel,We were going on a 40th Anniversary cruise that left out of Barcelona.  We stayed at the Majestic a few days before leaving and a couple days after.  Everything about the Majestic Hotel exceeded our expectations.  I highly recommend.,5,2024,05,21

11,"Overall, valuable stay","We stayed in the penthouse for 3 nights. Overall, it was a very worthwhile stay. (Especially, the quality of the breakfast is the best! Delicious!)
However, the temperature of private jacuzzi on our terrace was too low. There was no staff or concierge to assist us (except for one female staff). Additionally, during the guidance upon arrival, there was a miscommunication regarding the Complimentary Service for guests staying at the Penthouse.
These things made us a little sad.",3,2024,05,19
11,Guest cannot control room temperature,"We have stayed at the hotel in the past and were very excited to return. But, now we discover though trial and error that the guest can nether control the temperature or the room or the cooling mode or heating mode. Someone behind the seans at the hotel controls it all. This does not work out for the guest!",2,2024,05,18

11,Regent Cruise,Trip was excellent and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and the stay at the Majestic Hotel was simply amazing. ,5,2024,05,12
11,Verify conditions of stay,"One of the best hotel in the city I believe. Well positioned and great standing. Although despite this I was offered to stay in a place across the street without any initial information. Therefore I could not benefit from the hotel amenities like SPA or pool ( I do t see myself crossing the Main Street in bathrobe ).
Also, no cleaning of the room offered for my 3 days stay, otherwise I would have to pay extra. Finally the transfer to the airport would have cost me 180€ will any regular cab is at 35-40€. 
In the end my experience was as in a RBNB but with a higher cost of stay.",2,2024,05,12
11,Gorgeous hotel in great location,"Majestic it is, indeed! Beautiful hotel in safe, very upscale location. Room was lovely and well-appointed, with espresso machine and fresh water. First rate!",5,2024,05,10
11,An exceptional experience!,The bartender in the main dining room was exceptional. Miomar is an award winning mixologist. She was number one in Spain several years in a row! She made the best dirty martini we’ve ever had! Such a kind and sweet person too. The Majestic Hotel is lucky to have her!,5,2024,05,10
11,Luxurious but still comfortable,We love the finer things in life but sometimes the higher end luxury can feel just a bit too stuffy. Not at the Majestic Hotel and Spa. It was the perfect blend of classic luxury with a more contemporary comfort. And this location can't be beat. We were in the middle of the best shopping as well as convenient to many cultural must-see spots. We enjoyed our time immensely and we will be back.,5,2024,05,09
11,Gracious old world elegance,"So grateful Regent Cruiseline placed us at The Majestic Hotel precruise.  We recommend three nights after arriving Europe (9 hour flight plus 9 time zone changes).
Food, drinks, service, rooms are perfection.  So very pleased with our stay.",5,2024,05,09
11,Top rate hotel.,"The Majestic lived up to expectations, although it was a very busy place in the middle of a very busy area of the city.

11,One of the best international hotels ever,I couldn’t say anything more positive about this experience everything was perfect from the entry to the room to the food to the exit.,5,2024,04,20
11,Excellent stay!,"We were joining a group tour that began at this hotel so we booked a few nights on our own before the tour started. Our room was spacious and well appointed. We were allowed to check in early and to stay in the same room after the tour started, both of which made things very convenient for us. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The location is wonderful, and we walked a lot, at all times of day—it was very safe. The rooftop bar is beautiful and has excellent food. We will definitely stay there again next time we go to Barcelona! ",5,2024,04,20
11,Majestic,"The “Privilege “ room booked did not have the expected characteristics ( separate shower, etc) Reclamations unattended. Very unfavourable price-value relationship..Poor service.",2,2024,04,19
11,Barcelona vistas,"Franco our waiter was excellent & very attentive. Great service, drinks, food, music, & vibe. Comfortable & relaxed. Gorgeous views looking out over the city out to the Med. Most landmarks are visible. Would highly recommend when in Barcelona. The Majestic Hotel is marvelous & in a great location.",5,2024,04,18
11,Great hotel with an excellent location,"If possible, I would have rated this a 4.5 out of 5. We stayed at the Majestic for 6 nights in late March. We (a family of 4) had a suite with a connecting room for the kids. The rooms were spacious with a nice view from our suite and no view for the kids. The hotel is situated perfectly in the high end district and we found it to be very quiet in our rooms, even when the road was busy or the sidewalks were jammed. It felt like we could walk anywhere in 15-30 minutes, so that was fantastic. 

Some highlights: The staff that handled the restaurant for our breakfast each morning (it was included with the rooms) were great. They were super friendly, always pleasant and ensured that we were taken care of. The cleaning staff was tremendous!!!! I could not say more about them, as our room was taken care of each day and waters were replenished. The crew that handled the rooftop were also great. Definitely recommend going there at night to get a beautiful view of the city and enjoy a drink or dessert. There are lots of great restaurants within 10-15 minutes, including some of our favorites: Vinitus (Tapas), Shanghai Stories (Chinese) and Bembi (Indian). 

Minor problems: Things look a little dated in the rooms, but nothing too bad. The pillows in the room weren't the greatest, super soft and your head immediately hit the bed. The staff welcoming you into the hotel (not the front desk / check-in team) weren't the friendliest, which is odd because it's the first thing you experience as you are walking up to the hotel. They have automatic doors, so maybe that plays into it a bit and there isn't a need for anyone to open the door.

We would definitely recommend if you want a great hotel that gives you easy access to shopping, restaurants, and short walks to many of the best sites & neighborhoods in Barcelona.",5,2024,04,07
11,Go outside high season and stay at Majestic,"We stayed in a Master Suite with a view to the main street. Really nice room. Lots of light coming from the 2 balconies. Roof top terrace is exceptional with at view to Sagrada Família and the olympic city. The evenings are outstanding. The pool is not really a pool; hence the hotel is best suited for off season stays as the beach is 3 km away. Shopping and great restaurants are around the corner, taxi’s low price and easy to get hold off. Restaurant was disappointing, no atmosphere but reasonable prices. Enjoy your dinner at the roof top. Breakfast is great but not at six senses level.  Good service experience. Fitness is small but high quality. Barcelona is too crowded in season, if you go outside high season, I would recommend to stay at Majestic.",5,2024,04,01
11,Good stay,Majestic hotel stay was a good experience for my family and I. The front office took our bags right away and made us feel welcomed. Their gym was exceptional with free we Guts and machine and various cardio machines. I would stay their again.,5,2024,04,01
11,"Good location and service, comfortable hotel. Still things to work on.","I would put 5 stars review, if not one thing that is unacceptable in the hotel of this level.

Hotel is well-located, in the one of the main streets still very calm inside even in the room facing Pg. de Grácia. A lot of staff in the hall, you receive enough attention and service is good. Amenities are on the high level, bed is comfortable and room is spacious. 

The one thing which was a fault: at 22:00, when we had a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign hanging on our door, lights off and our child was sleeping, housekeeping ladies were very persistently ringing and knocking on our door, and when my wife went our and told them ""Don't you see a DND sign?"" not even ""Sorry"" followed. They were just rude and the reason they were trying to get in was unclear. 

Also the hotel refused to refund last night of the 5-nights stay even when informed about the early check-out 2 days in advance.",3,2024,03,30
11,Great Barcelona Spot,"Great location near Gothic Quarter in a really nice area with lots of amenities. The hotel is brand new inside. Roof terrace is eyeball to eyeball with Sagrada and has a tremendous view of the city. Best of all the staff was uniformly excellent - friendly, helpful and efficient. Don’t forget the spa for a massage.",5,2024,03,28
11,Best Hotel in Barcelona,"Best Hotel in Barcelona. Service, staff and etc. on highest level.

11,I felt like a PRINCESS!,The staff go OUT OF THEIR WAY to make sure everything is PERFECT!  They make you feel like a princess and it is in the best location.  The rooms are beyond any expectation and the rooftop restaurant and bar are NOT TO BE MISSED!  You MUST experience this hotel when in Madrid.,5,2024,03,21
11,Great Value,"Feels like home. Great stuff, great. Location, definitely would stay again if we travel to Barcelona. Food is great, you can feel the freshness from breakfast to dinner. Wonderful terrace will allow you to relax",5,2024,03,21
11,Bad bedding,"I feel the 2 most important features when looking for a hotel are location and comfortable bedding. The Majestic gets 5 stars on location but 2 stars on bedding. My bed was so uncomfortable and sagging. I let them know after the first night but their solution was to put a ""board"" under my mattress! Now, this is a 5 star hotel, not Motel 6!!! I am very disappointed they did not change my room or give me a comfortable mattress.",2,2024,03,21
11,3 Star hotel with 5 Star prices,"Total rip-off. Bathrooms are so poorly lit that o could not shave, the shower stall is so small that at 5’ 8” and 165 lbs I could not wash by legs, non existent air conditioning that took 6 hours to cool off preventing any sleep the first night,  and a manager that is blase about solving issues. I will never book a room with this company again. ",1,2024,03,17

11,Top-notch truly five star experience in an upscale centrally located area,"This hotel delivered on every aspect. Truly a five star experience. Immaculate common spaces and rooms, the staff is constantly cleaning and keeping it fresh. Beautiful, tasteful, and calm. Every single person who we interacted with was just delightful, and seem to really care about having us have a great experience. So very grateful to all the people who Took the trouble to understand my unique needs and find me the perfect solution. The room was truly perfect. Upscale neighborhood and centrally located, Easy to get everywhere. The hotel is also really well staffed and there are always people around to make sure you don’t lose time and you are taken care of. Everything smells nice. 🙂 I wish I could remember everyone’s name who helped me but thank you so much.",5,2024,03,07
11,Nice but…,"We staued at the residence, the location is very good but we didn’t know thar the residence eas across the street on the avenue so not in the same building!  You have to get to the hotel to do check in and out, take a taxi…The should be a desk in the residence building. The residence is spacious and quiet. Even though I included the cleaning every day sheets were not changed and some amenities not replaced, some accessories needs to be replaced. So I would say good location but not 5 star service.",4,2024,03,05
11,Excellent stay both professional and family,"Highly recommended, in a vety nice area of Barcelona. Close to almost everything. Despite the category of room in which i was, with no window for an outside view, the room was permanently clean and room service was constantly present.",5,2024,03,04

Hotel is very classy with a gorgeous rooftop bar that is open to the public but priority seating is given to hotel guests.  Lobby bar is very nice too, but the views from the roof deck are amazing.  In Feb it mild enough to sit out there in the afternoon with a light jacket on.  The hotel itself is a bit old school classy, maybe it needs a little updating, but we thought it was great and very conveniently located in a safe neighborhood.",5,2024,01,17

11,Amazing Hotel,"Gorgeous property with friendly, helpful staff. They updated our room and it was lovely and clean. Wish we could've stayed longer and plan to return. The only con were the prices in the piano bar area. Unfortunately, for one still water and one sparkling water, we spent 12 Euros and for a double espresso and a small Coke Zero, 20 Euros. Although they asked for our room number, they had us pay before we left. Not sure if we were charged twice as we checked out hurriedly. All in all though it was amazing. ",5,2024,01,07
11,"Bad service, bad showers, room lacks polish. ","I let the bad service during our first breakfast slip since we sat down at close to 10am, and it was very crowded. At that morning I did notice the servers had an attitude and the level of service was not what one would expect at a five-star hotel, but again, it was very busy and I didn’t think much of it. As a side note, the physical space for the breakfast items is way too small for the number of guests and gets uncomfortably crowded.

On our second morning, however, we were one of the very few people at the dinning hall at around 7am, and yet we just stood by the door for a few minutes waiting to be shown to a table. As I was waiting, I looked at a waiter, and this gentleman literally made a face and shrugged instead of coming over or getting somebody who could help us. We then sat for minutes trying to get the attention of any of the servers to order some eggs and toast, but were dutifully ignored. The same waiter walked by multiple times, made eye contact, and just ignored us. 

As yet another wonderful masterclass in how not to treat guests at a so called five-star hotel, the manager who came over said the waiter had been working there for ages and he was going to hear him first, as if we were kids at school, and now guests at a hotel. At that pointI thanked the manager, and asked him to forward my comments to the general manager and told him I was expecting to hear back soon. I never heard back. 

The room had multiple flaws, such as a horrible shower and closet doors that would not close properly and leave a light on all night long. ",1,2024,01,02
11,💫🌲🙌,"This new year we stayed at the Majestic. the hotel is old. Every day something broke in our room. At first, the light in the corridor did not turn off, the electrician was called at night, three times. The toilet button did not work, I also need to call. The hotel needs to be closed for renovations and completely refurbished. The rooms are cleaned very poorly, you need to remind them to bring water to the room. very boring New Year, just one guitarist sadly playing the guitar. Very unexpected. For breakfast, a kettle with boiling water for tea, without a lid. This is not 5 stars at all. Change your staff and improve your skills! The location is a plus, but everything else is a big minus!",2,2024,01,01

11,"Our preferred ""home"" in Barca","We have visited Barcelona many times staying at a variety of properties and in different neighborhoods.  In the end, the Majestic is our favorite place to stay in Barcelona with its combination of a beautiful property, warm and gracious staff and super convenient location.  The fact that we now only look to stay at the Majestic when in Barca pretty much says it all.",5,2023,12,10
11,Nice breakfast and location,"The hotel’s location is hard to beat, extremely central and close to all of the tourist hot spots within the city. The breakfast was very nice served in a beautiful room and a good choice. The deluxe room I stayed in however needed some attention, it looked like it was refurbished 10 years ago and not been touched since, it felt dated and not super clean. ",3,2023,12,10
11,"Fair enough, but not the best .","Was okey . Not the best experience.it can be better, but to be honest have things to improve for giving a 5 star experience.

11,92% Dysfunctional Hotel!,"The Majestic was so dysfunctional it’s hard to know where to start this review.  Let’s start this way…this reviewer is a seasoned international traveler with high level lifetime status with Marriott for example.

Hey why don’t we start with the check-in process.
Our room was not ready altho it was “guaranteed” to be ready upon check-in.  Ok it happens …altho seldom do we have written confirmation of the room “will be” ready as we did here.
The check-in person was completely incompetent and kept asking someone else questions.  This person mistakenly did not return our passports to us which sometimes is a requirement of certain hotels.  I discovered the missing passport 6 hours later as went for dinner.  I called to the front desk mgr who confirmed they had the passports.  Wait …what?  You held our passports for 6 hours and did not call us?  We were leaving on a 10 day small yacht cruise the next  day at noon.  Could have been an absolute disaster w/o the passport’s.
While we waited for our room we went for lunch on the rooftop.  The mgr came over to us and said they were full (table for 4) , and we pointed to an open table in the sun and asked if we can pulled a few feet under the shade?   “No.  Go the lobby restaurant!”  
Ok we did that.  We ordered lunch with our friends.  Their lunch came after 50 mins in a virtually wide open restaurant.  Our lunch never came.  No I mean never…”There was a screw up in the kitchen”
I could on .because there is more.  One example-The hotel has some dangerous hallway stairs on most floors where they apparently remodeled or added on.The majestic contacted me numerous times offering compensation so I would not a review. There   Are excellent, lower cost hotel options right near this 92% dysfunctional hotel.  Save Yourself!",1,2023,12,02
11,Lovely but maybe not for vegetarians…,"Beautiful hotel, dressed wonderfully for Christmas. Only disappointment is a really poor choice of vegetarian food for room service. It’s 2023. Pasta with tomato sauce as the only main course? Really lets down the experience. Shame as otherwise the staff and hotel itself are great.",3,2023,12,01
11,Fabulous,"An excellent stay from start to end. Friendly and efficient check in, good rooms, great bathrooms, good WiFi, AC perfect, great breakfast, roof top bar and a fabulous location in Barcelona.

The room is old, not clean.

11,Senior group,This was a beautiful and elegant hotel. Convenient being near the hop on/off Bus and many restaurants. Was hoping it would be closer to the Ramblas or the Gaudi Park for some sightseeing as we waited for rooms. ,5,2023,10,17
11,Magical Barcelona,"The Majestic Hotel & Spa Hotel is a beautiful hotel in an excellent location. The rooftop bar/restaurant was a delight, and the view was incredible. Dinner at SOLC was delicious and delightful. The breakfast is outstanding.   First Class all the way!  ",5,2023,10,17

11,Beautiful hotel in a wonderful location.,"The Majestic is a beautiful hotel in the heart of Barcelona.  The staff was knowledgeable, helpful and gave great recommendations.  We booked through AX, and breakfast was included with our booking. Ample buffet and a nice selection of hot dishes. The roof top bar had a beautiful view of Barcelona. Oure room was comfortable and roomy. We will definitely stay here again. ",5,2023,10,14
11,everything was very wonderful,"The hotel has a very good location, the rooms are equipped with everything necessary, the rooms are well soundproofed, the rooms are cleaned very often. Thank you very much for the good staff. I will definitely come to you again",5,2023,10,14
11,Great Barcelona Hotel,"This hotel was the perfect spot for our stay in Barcelona.  It was centrally located, with lots of shopping and great restaurants nearby.  The staff could not have been friendlier.  We stayed in one of the apartments across the street from the hotel, and not only was it beautiful, but the view was amazing!  La Sagrada Familia was dead center in our view!",5,2023,10,11
11,Beautiful Accommodations in a great location!,"The room was well appointed, clean, and comfortable after a long day of travel to get there.  All staff were friendly and offered recommendations when asked.  Great hotel gym + loved the rooftop bar at night.",5,2023,10,10
11,Classic Luxury Hotel,This is a classic luxury hotel located in the shopping area of the best designer shops. Every staff member is interested in the guest's happiness. The Solc Restaurant serves the best breakfast in Barcelona.,5,2023,10,08
11,Classy hotel,"This is a classic hotel which is our go to choice when booking hotels in major cities. Beautiful suite, great food, helpful staff. Can’t beat that. Also, the 270 degree views from the rooftop bar are fantastic. ",5,2023,10,08
11,The Majestic  Hotel Barcelona Spain,This hotel is one of the best 5 star hotels I have stayed in my 50 years of traveling. The view from the the 6th floor room we had facing the main boulevard was amazing. The service and quality was outstanding and all the front desk spoke perfect English in this Spanish speaking city. For a traveler like me who can speak only a little Spanish this is important.,5,2023,10,07
11,A beautiful hotel!,"This hotel shines as one our favorites in our European trips. Everything about it was excellent. The rooms, the service, the staff, the room service... all of it. If I am lucky enough to come back to Barcelona I will absolutely stay here again!",5,2023,10,07
11,Not great,There appears to be no soundproofing of windows. Which is so unsual.  The hotel room doors ‘bang’ shut so extremely noisy. Beware of rooms near staff/employee areas- again very noisy. Rooms so not have a ‘second’ lock so anyone with pass key can enter. ,3,2023,10,05
11,Perfection,This hotel is the perfect location in Barcelona. Walk to everything. The staff are extremely helpful and highly trained. Don’t miss the breakfast buffet. The rooftop bar is a great location to take in the city views. Highly recommend !,5,2023,10,05

11,A Historic Gem on the Gold Coast of Barcelona,"This is a step back in time to European elegance. Attention is pad to every detail and every guest and the food was excellent as well. The location is convenient to La Rambla, shopping, restaurants, the local sites, and La Sagrada de la Familia. We couldn’t have selected a finer spot in Barcelona. The roof top restaurant/bar offers panoramic views of the city and the full moon over the Mediterranean was a once in a lifetime sight. If you’re looking for a spectacular hotel…it is the Majestic.",5,2023,10,04
11,Great location and great staff.,"I stayed in this hotel after a cruise. The hotel was brilliantly located and easy to get to the main tourist spots. The hotel was luxury in that all comforts were provided. Although I arrived early, and not able to check in, I was offered the hospitality of the hotel, lounge to sit and have a coffee and breakfast if I wished and a map if I wanted to go sightseeing. But the best thing of this hotel is the staff. They are effective and efficient, from the moment I was greeted at the door to take my luggage the staff were helpful and always with a smile. From service in the lounge, service at breakfast and the service of my room. I can't single one person out, but will shout out to all the staff. They are a credit to the hotel and the reason I would recommend a stay and a reason I will return for a stay.",5,2023,10,03
11,absolutely fantastic!,"great location, friendly and professional staffs, comfortable and well organized room - I will definitely stay here again on my next trip! I strongly recommend this great hotel to anyone coming to visit Barcelona. ",5,2023,10,03
11,Beuatiful,"The Majestic is a great place to stay on a top location with very friendly people overall. The rooftop restaurant/bar is fantastic with a beautiful view over the city of Barcelona. When I wille be back traveling for Barcelona, The Majestic is again for me the place to be.                ",5,2023,10,03
11,Best location and luxury accomodations,We stayed here for 4 days this past September and we couldn't be happier.  The location was great and the staff was wonderful.  The bedding is outstanding!  Best pillows and the bed was so comfortable.  We also ate at the roof top bar twice.  Food was outstanding.  We would definitely stay again!,5,2023,10,01
11,"service, location, luxury","From the moment we walked into the Majestic unitl the moment we left it was sheer bliss.  Ever single person we interacted with was profession and friendly.   
The location was in walking distance to Las Ramblas where we found great restaurants, we also felt safer in this area then we did other areas in the city.
The roof top bar was great way to end the evenings, not the mention the amazing view of sagrada familia.
From the professional service, beautiful decor and wonderful location this is a must stay in Barcelona",5,2023,10,01
11,Excellent Hotel,"The Majestic is a beautiful hotel with an extremely friendly staff. We have always stayed at Hotel Arts, but will from now on stay at The Majestic! Rooftop bar was beautiful, service is excellent and location is perfect. Thank you!!",5,2023,10,01
11,Great location! ,"I picked this hotel because of the location. The room had a nice balcony overlooking the street off to the side. It is a beautiful hotel. The breakfast was 5+ stars. Fresh, ample variety and excellent service! Best hotel buffet we've ever had in a 5 star hotel. Had nice amenities like bottled water, real bars of soap, slippers, robes, nice individual shampoo, etc. I would have rated this hotel 5 stars but had a few issues. The bathroom light wouldn't work and it always happened in the middle of the night. Even resetting it with the key in the slot didn't turn it on. Maintenance supposedly came up to fix it but it wasn't fixed. Didn't see a note that they were in the room. Taking a shower and using a toilet in the dark with a phone flashlight was not fun during our stay. Then we had dinner in the bar. Took forever to get our food. I had to ask for it. After a few bites of lasagna, it was lukewarm. I went it back but hubby kept his lukewarm fish n chips because he didn't want to wait. After another long period, I asked about my lasagne. It finally was brought out and they put it on a different plate and microwaved it. Served to me with 2 missing bites. Totally tackey for a hotel of this caliber. It should have been replaced. A 3x3 size lasagna costing about $20 is way overpriced in the first place. 
We never felt welcomed coming in and out of the hotel. The doorman never acknowledged us coming or going. Ignored us completely the entire time. One time one person only greeted my husband and didn't even acknowledge me. A little racist? This was unacceptable. Never have experienced this treatment at any 4-5 star hotels anywhere. Or maybe they were security guards? They stand around and talk to each other ignoring guests. Not sure but never welcoming. I want to give a shout out to Miguel Angel who checked us in and out. He was very pleasant and efficient. Upon checking out he asked where we were going and we told him. He said the hotel in Mallorca was their sister hotel and that he would call over to let them know we would be arriving. That was so nice of him to go the extra mile for us. When we checked into our new hotel in Mallorca, Diego mentioned Miguel had called. We got quite a reception!
Other than these comments, I would stay here again. I'll know not to expect anything from the several men that stand at the entrance of the hotel that don't even acknowledge, smile or even look at you. They don't represent the hotel very well. ",4,2023,09,30
11,Faded Glory,The over all experience was fraught with clinical and abrupt behaviour (Bordering on seeming to be a bit rude---(maybe due to lack of english language proficiency of the staff). We coming from India and being used to uber luxury  and out of the way provided service by any of the 5 star hotels...our personal experience at your property was way short of what we expected. Several irritants: 1. TV not working properly where majority of english channels were not having good reception. 2. Overcharge of car parking was later removed when we pointed out that our private rented vehicle could not be parked at the property for two nights. 3. The reception /valets/concierge etc not informing the guests that if we take the vehicle out for a short trip we might not be in a position to get back to the hotel as a festive gathering outside on the roads will obstruct the vehicle inlet to the hotel. 4. The magnifying mirror in the bathroom with the circular LED light not working  properly. 5. The Sanitary/health faucet adjacent to the WC not having sufficient water pressure. 6. We being charged extra for a few free coffee pods and creamer that we had requested on the basis of understanding  given to us that tea/coffee/water were free (And later the extra charge being reversed). These enumerated points are just a handful of those mentioned irritant triggers. Please do understand that the point of raising this is simply to impress upon you that it is high time that a property that is located at such a premium place cannot take for granted that it shall continue to bask in it's past glory...but it's continued success in the future is fully dependant on the quality of motivated service with a genuine smile where all stops are pulled to ensure that your guest is extremely happy. Problems/ aberrations/ breakdowns of any sorts are part of any working environments...but the crux of the matter is to identify/assess/tweak and then relaunch in order to ensure that ethos of a brand is preserved.,3,2023,09,29
11,Perfect room and location,"Perfect location for walking to many sites, shopping and restaurants, yet not in the middle of too much activity.  The roof bar has lovely views of the city. The junior suite was quite comfortable. Staff were helpful with restaurant and entertainment reservations. Our reservation included breakfast which is both a buffet and menu option. We would stay here again. ",5,2023,09,29
11,Perfection!,"My three daughters and I stayed at the Majestic hotel’s residence property for four nights. The residence suites are apartment style, diagonally across the street from the main hotel. We had two bedrooms, two full bathrooms, full kitchen, laundry, living room and plenty of storage space.  A lovely, spacious apartment with excellent security.  We visited the main hotel each day to get directions, grab a taxi, or to visit the beautiful bar.  Shout out to Mario, the most excellent concierge. Very helpful and patient with our many questions about Barcelona! Also, many thanks to Habibul who helped us with our luggage and showed us how everything worked in our apartment suite.  He greeted us each day as we visited the main hotel.  We miss him already! The spa treatment (massage) with Raquel Chamorro was excellent.  Five stars for the Majestic Hotel!!!",5,2023,09,28
11,Septic in Barcelona Majestic,"Perfect location and Beautiful hotel. Rooftop bar and pool lovely. Easy to walk to restaurants and sites. Staff and concierge were terrific
View from roof spectacular. Room was spacious and comfortable ",5,2023,09,27
11,Spectacular location and service,"Everyone is kind and professional, the location of the hotel is centrally located and walking distance to stores, restaurants and parks. The roof top restaurant and bar has one of the best views of Barcelona.",5,2023,09,26
11,Problem free stay,"Wonderful, problem-free stay.  Prior to Barcelona I was at The Mandarin Ritz Oriental and then Alfonso XIII in Seville.  Although I enjoyed both hotels, there were a few problems with A/C and at the MO they had ""winter"" comforters on the beds when it was still hot outside and when the thermostats wouldn't go below low 70's inside the room, which can be too hot for sleeping.  Fortunately the entire stay at  The Majestic was PROBLEM FREE !!!  This is very unusual and I am an extremely discriminating guest and if I didn't experience any problems --  that means the hotel is managed very well.  Rooftop restaurant is AMAZING with several stand-out dishes and killer views of Barcelona.  Breakfast also great and well  run.  Not to mention the amazing location right in the ""thick of things.""  Kudos to the GM for running such a tight ship.",5,2023,09,24
11,Two nights in Barcelona.,"Great location but the rooms and service are not indicative of a 5 star hotel. Would probably not choose to stay there again. The first room I was given smelled of mildew. The second room I was given the lights did not work properly. On a positive note, the breakfast buffet was very good. ",3,2023,09,23
11,Not polished and trained Staff,"I had trouble with the check in: bedrooms not ready

Staff not well polished and well trained, sometimes rude

A friend of mine was forgotten inside her bedroom without keys, without lights on her bedroom (???)

Another friend of mine was told to take the luggages herself to the others bedrooms (????)

No 5 stars quality in here

",2,2023,09,21
11,Not good overall,Room had black mold. Waited five hours for a room. Paid $600 a night through Silverseas and unloaded the bus filled with 50 pieces of luggage with no assistance from hotel staff at 65 years old with 75 year old woman! Rooftop was awesome and most of staff was very nice but fell way short of expectations of a luxury hotel.  ,2,2023,09,21
11,"""Beautiful hotel with terrible service.","Unfriendly service. The hotel is beautiful, very clean, good food, spacious rooms. It's well-located, but the service is terrible. I found it rude and unfriendly. I found them sarcastic. I didn't like the overall service.",1,2023,09,21
11,Great stay in barcelona,We have stayed here several times and have always had a great experience!  The service is terrific and it’s in a great location!  The rooms are very well maintained and were spotless.  We will definitely be returning on our next visit to Barcelona!,5,2023,09,20
11,Room with a window looking into a Concrete Shaft room.," Book a deluxe room 6 months in advance of our stay.  Checked in and was given a very nice room but when I opened the curtains it had a window that looked into a 20 ft by 20ft grey painted shaft.  NO Sunlight, a very well lit gray concrete shaft.  A window that did not open (obviously.  The room seemed like a fancy cave .  Room 414.  I refused the room and after much back and forth with the staff  and being told there were no other rooms available, we were offered a different room. but is was obvious that the second room was a lower level standard loom not the deluxe I booked and paid for. .  It was definitely older more worn out room two floors below the first room but did have a REAL window. The table edges were chipped, 2 lights burned out in the bathroom, a large chip missing in the bath tile, in need of woodwork paint, a door not closing on the closet, a curtain hook ripped and missing, and a phone with a message light that stayed on all three days of the stay.  I went back an hour later and again asked about the room quality.  I was shown a third room but told it was an extra 50 Euro/day.  We kept in the second room as it did have a REAL window.  For a 5 star hotel this was not what I expected.   I will say the lobby, rooftop bar, breakfast and locations were excellent.  BUt the room quality we had was not the level expected..  I felt we did not get the deluxe room we paid for and should of experienced.    It put a damper on the start of our trip.  I heard a second couple on our trip experienced the same ""Concrete shaft view"" that we did . I have never stayed in any 5 star hotel that gave out a room with a inside of concrete shaft.   It was not acceptable for a room we booked so far in advance.",3,2023,09,20
11,MAJESTIC was MAJESTIC,"From start to finish--everything about our stay was wonderful.  We booked thru AMEX PLATINUM and Miguel at front desk was able to get us an upgrade and made sure our check in was smooth and trip went great.  Breakfast was AMAZING--best I've had in Europe.  I love how every morning they had champagne and fresh fruit juices.  Roof top bar was Awesome--although if you go in evening , be prepared to wait as it gets Busy--understandbly.   Bed was super comfy, unlike the other 5* hotels we stayed in throughout Europe.  Most beds were hard and these beds were fabulous.  Oh, the Vitamin C face cream left on your pillow every night was awesome.  Service at the rooftop and Bars at night were slow and took a long time to get drinks but other than that--there is NOTHING Bad to say about this place.  All around a FABULOUS stay.  They deserve the 5* rating they get !  ",5,2023,09,19
11,Majestic anniversary stay,If you're looking for the best central location look no further.

11,Wonderful Short Stay in Barcelona,"After a wonderful seven day cruise in the Mediterranean we stayed for a couple of days in lovely Barcelona.

11,Midnight Majestic Miracle,"There was an issue with the booking at a previous hotel that we were staying with, and we called over 20 different hotels on a Saturday night in mid-August to find that Majestic was one of the only ones available! Even though we were only there for the night, the staff was incredibly courteous and treated us with top-notch professionalism, despite a 3AM check-in. The breakfast we had in the morning was the best we had on our entire honeymoon, and you can't miss it if you're staying there. We would definitely recommend Majestic to friends and family in the future.",5,2023,09,09

11,Exceptional Location and Service,"We stayed in 2 BR apartment which is located across the street. Multiple key accesses so felt safe. Easy in and out and access to cabs for attractions. Sagrada Familia is a 15 min walk, the Gothic Quarter required a cab which was about 15-20 mins and 12-15 Euro. Note it is easier to call cabs than use Uber app, so have Euro on hand in 1,2, and 5 dollar denominations so you can pay and tip a little. Cards in the cabs are ok too, but harder to tip. Some cab drivers did not seem interested in tip when asked or struggled with adding a Euro or two to credit card payment. The breakfast offering is probably the greatest breakfast buffet we have ever had. Great stay, to note we are from US.",5,2023,08,30
11,"The Majestic, a royal stay!","The iconic hotel The Majestic is a wonderful experience. Not only because of the extremely friendly staff, but also the very good care. The rooms are excellent, the beds fantastic and the bathroom pleasant. Then the breakfast, which is an experience in itself, in both corners of the breakfast room there is a separate section with meat, cheese, etc. and in the other is the sweet department. Too bad my stomach is so small! In short, staying in this hotel is a party!",5,2023,08,30

11,Majestic Hotel review,"Staying at the Majestic Hotel was amazing. I researched so many hotels by location, amenities, and reviews. Things I had to have: relaxing lobby area, great dining, and a rooftop area to take in all the views. This hotel did not disappoint. It was immaculately clean, had large comfortable rooms, bathrooms, and comfortable beds. The location is ideal on Passeig de Gracia which is so close to the attractions and just a few steps from the luxury shops. The staff was friendly and the price was amazing. I will stay here every time I come back to Barcelona. ",5,2023,08,27

To Barcelona and loved our stay at the Majestic.

From the cleanliness to room service to breakfast buffet. All was top notch.

11,Lovely location and rooftop!,"Lovely breakfast buffet to start the day and rooftop pool/patio for sunsets! Service was good by most staff. JOSHELINE at the rooftop was super friendly and helpful!! Despite being somewhat dated, the rooms were spacious and enjoyable. If you can get a room with an enclosed balcony, it’s a nice spot for coffee or a drink. Centrally located close to great shops!",5,2023,08,26
11,Slightly Disappointed ,"The hotel is in a fantastic location and when I arrived I had high hopes after all its a 5 star hotel. 

They have fantastic amenities, the staff are very polite and happy to help. 

But unfortunately I was severely disappointed with the room, I think the staff saw me and thought we can palm off any room and it will be fine. 

For what the company paid for me to stay I was borderline annoyed. 

If you are staying at this hotel make sure you do not have a corner room, one there is no natural sunlight at all which I found embarrassing. How can you charge what you do and have zero natural sunlight.....

And secondly the door to my room was not fit for purpose. You can hear everything from people walking past and talking to other doors open. I can imagine they could hear me talking on calls. 

Because of this door to the room I had two nights of poor sleep due to people talking when walking past in the early hours. These people were not being loud its just the doors are that bad.

If I was to stay here again I would ask to check the room before accepting. Its a shame as it could of been a much better experience.

",5,2023,08,16
11,Very disappointing management.,"We filled out the form for laundry and sent our laundry out to be cleaned, not understanding that the form was per unit. When we brought this misunderstanding to the manager and explained that we would never have given as many items had it been per unit rather than per category of item, he simply remarked ""This is a 5 star hotel and these are the prices"". 

We have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world - from The Four Seasons, to Aman, to the Waldorf Astoria, and have never been treated this way when an issue arose. I found the manager to be rude, condescending, and it really did taint our impression of your hotel. So much so, that we will not be recommending it to our network or to our family. 

It was quite a disappointment because all he had to say was that he understood that a miscommunication could be made. We didn't even ask for a price adjustment, just compassion, which he gravely lacked. Incredibly disappointing and unacceptable.",2,2023,08,15
11,Worth a try,"The overall experience is wonderful. Amazing view, decent room, excellent room service. Remember the name Karim he is the kindest hotel stuff I have ever met. He will help you solve anything!

11,The best hotel in BCN!,"On top of being the historical hotel, where intellecfuals and polititians wrote pages of the country's history, this is an outstanding place with an unveliabable breakfast that makes your stay dreamlike.",5,2023,08,13
11,Check out your room first!,"First night was in a closet next to the service elevator. Noise all night, we couldn’t sleep and missed our activity. 
( 2 stars). Next two nights were much better, very nice hotel ( 4 stars). Convenient to luxury shopping and dining. Watch out for pickpockets.",3,2023,08,10
11,Fabulous Hotel,I found this hotel online and we usually stay in 5 star hotel such as the Four Seasons/ St. Regis! The Majestic is centrally located and is on a high-end street filled with beautiful shops! The staff was really great! The smell of the hotel exquisite and their rooftop bar is gorgeous! This is one of my new favorite hotels! ,5,2023,08,08
11,Disappointing in many ways!!,Hotel is in a great location.   On checking in first room had  steps in the middle of the room.  Had to be switched.  2nd offered room had no windows. 3rd room was satisfactory.  Rooftop restaurant was beautiful location and scenery with  poor service and poor quality food.   Hotel did not honor Amex Platinum  amenity which was confirmed both with Amex before the trip snd with hotel on check-in.  The manager spoken to was disrespectful and would not acknowledge previously confirmed amenity.  Amex platinum is now involved in disputing issues with the hotel.,3,2023,08,08
11,25th wedding anniversary,"You won't be disappointed. Safety is paramount for us and its was far and above adequate. Then comes the luxury that you will love. Next to the finest shopping you can get near by, not to mention the architecture. Then comes the proximity. It is nearly enough to wherever you want to go. AND the rooftop bar- it will knock your socks off. This is a first class stay that they deliver. First time in europe and this is our top notch benchmark! Well done majestic.",5,2023,08,08
11,Excellent stay - apartments are great for families,"Excellent stay - apartments are great for families - location is great - bar and food are expensive though. Would definitely stay in the apartments again. A bit disappointed that we didn't get maid service, but we did get clean towels. ",4,2023,08,08
11,Excellent apartment part of fantastic 5 star hotel. Great location,"Stayed at the Residence apartments that are located just across the road. Stayed in an Eixample two bedrooms apartments that look over the courtyards at the back of the block.

Huge apartment! Living space was massive with three seater sofa and a classic leather Barcelona chair. Big tv on the wall but didn’t use it. Internal gallery kitchen, beautiful dark cabinets. Integrated fridge freezer, came with two bottles of waters from the hotel and a big bag of ice in the freezer. Dishwasher, job, oven and microwave and even a Lavazza capsule coffee machine, with four capsules provided.

Main bedroom was on suite with jacquzi  bath with a shower overhead which was really powerful. Big King sized bed, which as is common was two singles together but no gaps in between.

Smaller bedroom had two single beds and overlooked the hotels own internal courtyard. 

You get full use of hotel facilities. The roof top bar is lovely for a drink or something to eat. We went during the day and used the plunge pool and went up at dusk as the sunset and the lights of the city took over. Amazing views down to the sea, Sagrada Famliar and the Montjuic hill. 

Hotel is located on Passieg de Gracia, which is where all the poshest shops are, Chanel, Prada, etc all on your doorstep. 
Plenty of restaurants, cafes and bakeries to eat or get food form

About 20 mins walk to Segrada Familiar, 30 mins to the beach at Barceloneta 

Staff excellent and really friendly and can’t do enough for you. Would recommend to anyone.",5,2023,08,07
11,Great location and hotel,"Very good check in and departure procedures. Great bed and pillows. Bathroom spacious . The hairdryer was excellent, which is always helpful for us ladies. Location of the hotel is very good with easy access to all of Barcelona. ",5,2023,08,07
11,A majestical place to stay in Barcelona ,"A lovely hotel, in a great location so close to all attractions.

We paid for parking at the hotel which meant as you pulled up outside the hotel, the car gets taken off to the parking area, which made life so easy with children and luggage.

When we checked in, we were lucky enough to be given a free upgrade to a junior suite.
The check in process was easy, the lady spoke amazing English.

The suite was so comfortable, the sofa bed was already set up for the children.
Both rooms had tv’s with English channels.
The master bedroom had a king size beds which was extremely comfortable and very fluffy pillows.

The bathroom, had both a shower and a bath, two wash basins and a separate toilet with bidet.

The air conditioning was amazing, the curtains kept the room dark.

We had a windows, with a little balcony which had views of the city. 

We went up to the 10th floor to use the pool and it gave amazing views of the city, we could see la sagrada de familia and lots of other sights.
We went up in daytime and nighttime so we could also experience the city view at night.

We didn’t eat the hotel, just because we were out so much, but we did have a drink in the downstairs piano bar, which the service was very good and the atmosphere was very relaxing.
We also had a drink in the rooftop bar.

The staff were always so helpful, opening doors, asking if you need taxi’s etc.

We will definitely return to this hotel and advise anyone who visits Barcelona to stay here.
A jewel of a hotel to stay at in a wonderful city.

11,I have expected much more,When people pay the price to stay in hotel Majestic expect more. I have really expected much more from this hotel. The service I got is like in a normal 4 star hotel. The price you have to pay and what you get is just too much. The pool is small which could be ok if the terrace is providing space for people who would like to enjos afternoon by the pool. But in the hotel they have a bar and they only have chairs by the pool.,3,2023,08,02
11,Awful hotel,The hotel has not been maintained properly. The location is amazing but that’s the only positive I have to share. Ventilation is awful- we all started coughing and sneezing after the first 24 hours of our stay. Walls are paper thin. Make sure you are not put in a room outside of restaurant on first floor. You will get no sleep. Front desk staff is useless. Breakfast was included with our stay- they accidentally charged us - it took 5 international phone calls to rectify.  ,1,2023,07,31
11,Great location,Excellent service and location. Great rooms. They are very well appointed and the beds are very comfortable. There is a fantastic rooftop with bar and food service. They also serve one of the best hotel breakfast I have ever had. Very helpful staff.,5,2023,07,31
11,majestic hotel barcelona,"We enjoyed your magnificent hotel. The location was amazing , the services and the staff were wonderful. the breakfast was outstanding, the rooftop bar was fabulous and the concierges went out of their way to help us, plus we loved our room (122) with balcony.  We will definitely stay at the Majestic when we return to Barcelona and we will recommend it as the place to stay to anyone we know travelling to Barcelona.

11,"Top quality, great location","Great hotel, feels very recently refurbished.  Nice mix of classic grand European hotel and modern style.  Quiet and calm escape despite being in the heart of the best shopping district. Discrete, efficient staff.  Everyone we met from lobby to spa couldn't do enough to help.  Seemed a real mix of families, couples and business people.",5,2023,07,22
11,DON’T COME EARLY,"Great hotel presentation, comfortable outdated room. Bathroom shower control very difficult to handle. Excellent personal attitude .Poor mistake recognition with excuses for ,tired forgotten guests , sitting in the bar , waiting an extra hour having our room ready . We’d expect a management call at least . ",4,2023,07,21
11,Family Visit,"Stayed here on the great reviews. Front desk staff was very helpful. A special thanks to Mario for helping us with our breakfast billing issue. Room could use updating but was clean and comfortable. The shower gave us issues. Couldn’t figure out how to control hot or cold. It had a mind of its own. 
Rooftop was just ok. Went up twice. First time for a quick dip in the tiny plunge pool, second to take a quick photo of the view. Both times the staff was a bit pushy to sell us drinks. I get it if we were not staying at the hotel. But we were. 
The view is great from up there, but there is no real sunset as the hotel faces east. I’m sure the sunrise is beautiful. But no sunset to speak of.",4,2023,07,21
11,Excellent hotel,"Great hotel, although pricy but definately worth it. Loctaion,  room size and cleanness, are simply top quality 
Facilities are well equipped and staff is very experienced and friendly.
I especially liked the location where you literally go out of the main entrance e and you are in the heart if the lively city .",5,2023,07,21
11,"Classy, elegant, old-world charm.","First up, this is really a 4.5 rating for me, but unfortunately, Tripadvisor does not allow for half star ratings. The Majestic is grand, elegant and an old-world classic; in fact, some may find the design aesthetics and style a bit outdated and stuffy.  Thankfully, the rooms are furnished handsomely with a contemporary feel. We were upgraded, via American Express, from a Privilege Room to a Junior Suite, which had a sofa-bed for our daughter, and ample floor space & wardrobes and a huge 'marble-everywhere' bathroom. The room felt really luxurious and we were more than comfortable. 

However, there was a major issue with the position of our room. We soon discovered that we were near not one, but at least two, staff/housekeeping rooms, and throughout the day (and worse) at night, the doors kept slamming shut whenever staff would come in & out. Though we did not mind it so much during the day, the constant loud banging disturbed our sleep in the early hours of the morning. I just wish that these doors in older buildings can be tweaked with a soft close like the doors of the rooms themselves. After all, they are the ones which are used the most by housekeeping. We called twice to let them know of the noise and despite being assured that the staff would be informed, the noise did not dissipate throughout our stay. A simple stick of bumper pads or hinge adjustment would enable the doors to close softly. 

Other than this hiccup, we truly enjoyed our 3-night stay here. Everyone was professional, especially the breakfast staff. Breakfast was sumptuous and the quality commendable, though I have to say that if it were not included in our rate, EUR39 would be rather steep for the kind of spread offered. Perhaps it is considered large and extensive by European standards, but coming from buffet breakfasts in 5-star hotels in Asia, this pales in comparison. 

For its prime location, classy and luxurious setting, I would recommend the Majestic to anyone visiting Barcelona and would definitely return (especially if they have fixed the slamming doors!).",4,2023,07,18
11,Superbly positioned and very well appointed rooms,"Superbly located and despite an agonisingly long check-in, the stay was fabulous. Perfectly positioned in the heart of Barcelona and walking distance to La Familia, as well as the Medieval and Nuevo parts of the city. One block from some of Gaudi’s most remarkable designs and for the shoppers it is surrounded by the best designer labels in the world. Room was very spacious and well appointed, staff were delightful and the sky deck tapas bar and pool was fabulous.  Highly recommend!",4,2023,07,17
11,A hair found in the dining in-room service,"As a world class hotel, your kitchen cleanness is a major issue. We ordered in-room service and the experience was horrible.  It was not only later for more than 40 minutes and kept my children waiting hungry. What was even worse that my child found a HAIR in his Mac and Cheese plate! Although the kitchen head called and apologised and also sent me a fruit basket, we were still in shock due to the fact that we had never experienced this at any other world class hotels. ",3,2023,07,15
11,Big and beautiful ❤️,"Great location and the Majestic Suite was excellent! So was the breakfast, as long as you avoid the last 30-45 minutes that turned out to be a bit crowdy in the summer season. In all a great experience at a classic hotel.",5,2023,07,13
11,Perfect in every way,"Everyone was so nice and extremely accommodating 
I have never experienced such professional and friendly staff members
The service is 5 star 
From checking in to help from the concierge in finding restaurants and questions about anything 
Absolute perfection ",5,2023,07,12
11,Amazing Hotel,Upon arrival we were greeted by a big smile from Miguel to help with our bags. This Hotel is located in the heart of the city and you can walk everywhere. Our room was beautiful and clean. The staff at this hotel is so nice and always making sure you are taken care of. I especially wanted to mention Josheline at The Roof Top Bar who was so welcoming and nice and made us feel so great! She takes the best pictures BTW and with a smile. This hotel is a must if you are visiting in Barcelona. Thank you,5,2023,07,12
11,Excellent Stay!,It's centrally located and close to many designer stores. It was a very safe area and the hotel was very clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful as well. The rooms were very well maintained while we were there.,5,2023,07,11
11,Outstanding Service,We found the Majestic the perfect place to recover from hiking several hundred miles on the Camino. Our Jr Suite was beautifully decorated and updated and very comfortable. The facility and offerings rival the Four Seasons or Ritz properties but their EXCELLENT staff sets them apart . The Bellman made us coffee to go at 7 a.m. Monday while I was checking out ! Can’t say enough about how friendly and professional they are. ,5,2023,07,11
11,Wonderful experience,The family stayed here for the July 4th week in junior suit. The staff throughout the stay were excellent especially housekeeping and concierge. The rooftop pool lounge and breakfast buffet were very nice to start the day before venturing out to the city. We love the location too. We will surely return again ,5,2023,07,10
11,Unforgettable Experience!,"Everything was absolutely outstanding at this beautiful historical hotel. I started to feel the positive energy and vibes of this luxurious hotel since the moment I stood in front of its piece of art facade. And when I entered I started to enjoy my journey and their great attention to the details. Since the moment of checking in the front desk really gave me a very good time and explained every single information I needed to enjoy my stay. The room was very clean and the bathroom was so spacious with every amenity I needed. 
The was very good and the Spa as well. Thank you!",5,2023,07,08
11,Very good,"The best part of the hotel is the views from the rooftop bar and the BBQ peanuts served with the drinks!  It is a vintage hotel with modern amenities.  The room we had faced the interior, so the back of residential apartments, but the location of the property overall was nice along the main boulevard and walking distance to most things and public transportation. Housekeeping is impeccable.  The turndown service every night by housekeeping is very attentive and they provided nice bottle water. The food service is average, but there are better options steps away from the hotel.  We tried the breakfast buffet on our final day of our stay before checking out and going to the airport.  It is average/mediocre quality, but quite extensive and there are several options, they even accommodated gluten-free.  I would not have eaten the buffet every day of our stay, once was enough as there are better food elsewhere in Barcelona.  We could have spent our entire stay admiring the views from the rooftop, it was truly spectacular.",4,2023,07,07
11,Great spot,"Enjoyed our stay, staff were very helpful, accommodating and friendly. Location was nice, close to so many things. An easy walk to Sagrada Familia (abt 15 min walk), Casa Balto (1 block away), Cathedral of Barcelona (15 mins or so). Breakfast was a great way to start the day.  Rooftop was small but very nice. ",5,2023,07,05
11,Fantastic Hotel in every way .,"Excellent hotel with the best staff. Beautiful rooms with the best service . Breakfast is fantastic. One buffet for Sweet and one for salads, ham etc. You can also order dishes from the menu . On the roof a Nice pool with bar. We loved it . Located in the centrum with Close distance to Chanel, Burberry and El Corte Ingles. Looking forward to visiting the hotel again.",5,2023,07,04

11,EXCELLENT ON ALL FRONTS,"We had stayed in the Majestic years ago, and were blown away by how the property has been kept up to date. The lobby, restaurant, roof top, and rooms. The staff were all very professional, friendly, and attentive. Mario at the Concierge desk made our vacation by helping us with anything and everything we needed to know about and do in Barcelona. Cannot wait to return.",5,2023,06,29
11,"Wonderful, stylish, memorable","We visited this wonderful and stylish hotel in june 21 -25, 2023. Our experience was a strong 5. We vere very pleased! The rooms (two Junior Suites with view over Passeig Gràcia) were spacous, very clean and just splendid, and the service was excellent! We vere enjoying every minute. Nice memory: When we returned to a pleasantly chilled and very tidy room in the evening of June 23, a nice San Juan surprise waited for us. Later in the same night, when we had dinner and drinks at the wonderful roof top La Dolce Vitae there vere fireworks all over Barcelona. What a memorable Midsummer for our family! We wanted a different one, although the Midsummer in Finland is wonderful and magic, with the never-setting-sun. My parents passed away this year and our whole family miss then very much, especially on Midsummer. They loved to travel, and our whole experience with Majestic Hotel & Spa is definetly something they would have loved. We certainly did!
Kindest regards

Terrace overlooking the city.

11,Really rude check in and check out staff took us 45 min to check and 30 min to check out. Staff rude.,Really rude front desk. Check in took 45 min and check out 30 min and the laundry is 3-4x that of the ritz or mandarin and they up charge everything and overall just rude staff. Makes it un pleasant. I like the location and the rooms and the niceness but that can be found in hotels with nicer staff. ,1,2023,06,10

11,This place is full of grace,Amazing breakfast and beautiful place Thus place is full of history and traditions but the rooms reflect the age and could be modernised further. Try to avoid airport transfer as overpriced. My room terrace was a pleasant surprise Thank you,4,2023,05,30
11,A pleasant experience,"We stayed here for 2 nights and it was truly beautiful, we arrived and our bags where taken for us to the front desk and to the room, the room was tastefully decorated and homely whist big also, the sights were gorgeous from the room and had extensive views of the city during our stay we had all the amenities, there were lovely extras like creams that were provided each night and slippers next to your beds, the roof top terrace was gorgeous with magnificent views and decor, the food was gorgeous aswell as the drinks the service was lovely and quick and did Anyting to help you, the pool is lovely aswell, we slept well on the first night but then we changed rooms and the second night was cold, a draft was coming from the windows which was a disappointment with the amount you are paying each night, also the minibar wasn’t included which again what you are paying a night we expected it to be free of charge even if it was water or crisps and then for the more expensive things then a price list starts then that would have made more sense. Breakfast was lovely with a superb selection every detail has been thought out here and a high standard was achieved the staff were pleasant also, the hotel itself is located on the street where high end shopping is, you can shop for hours and hours and you will be back at the hotel in 2 minuties. Overall it was a good stay just would of expected more for the price you pay. ",4,2023,05,30
11,Majestic Experience,If you are looking for a first class hotel that’s in the midst of high end shopping and dining experience yet Mike away from affordable shipping the Majestic is the place to be. The attention to detail by staff is notable.,5,2023,05,30
11,Great rooftop bar and good rooms but mediocre service,The hotel is good. A bit overpriced but it has a great location and the rooftop bar is a big bonus. The breakfast is very good but not mind blowing good. The rooms are very good. Great beds. Soundproof windows. The staff needs more training. There is always plenty of staff available but the resulting customer experience is mediocre. Too many lost orders in the rooftop bar. Too many back and forth communication with house keeping to get a seconds duvet. ,4,2023,05,30
11,Amazing hotel and the best service you can get!,"The hospitality from the whole crew was amazing!! They really know how to give a service!  
The best location in Barcelona! 
The hotel was very clean, well organized,  rooms were big and you can find anything you need inside. 
I highly recommend this hotel because of the great location and great service we got from the staff. 
Next time I'm in Barcelona I'm coming back to this hotel for sure! ",5,2023,05,29
11,A beautiful hotel in a beautiful city,"I recently completed a four night stay at this beautiful hotel in the heart of Barcelona.
The location is excellent. You can walk to many attractions and there is easy access to the hop / hop off bus. The staff is smiling, friendly, and extremely helpful. 
The rooms are beautifully furnished and comfortable. The hotel breakfast is excellent and has many options from which to choose.
It is definitely not a budget hotel, but if you want to spoil yourself and have a wonderful time, I highly recommend it. if I am fortunate enough to visit Barcelona again in the future, I will definitely stay at the Hotel Majestic.",5,2023,05,28
11,Excellent stay in heart of Barcellona,"Hotel is located in the prime area of Barcelona. It is close to all shopping, tourist attractions. We walked all the places nearby to see key tourist places. The suite was a 2 bedroom suite so the kids had their own bedroom whcih was nice. Outside our window were shops like Dior, Channel so you know this is the prime area. Hop-off Hop-on buses stop just outside the hotel which was nice too.",5,2023,05,27
11,Excellent luxury hotel in a great location,"Visited Barcelona on a family vacation.  Hotel was recommended by our travel agent who specializes in high-end vacation packages.  Probably one our best hotel experiences despite being spoiled by marvelous hotels in Asia.  

We had two rooms: one for us, another for our three 20-something children.  The rooms were very nice in size, lighting and amenities.  Our room (275) had a slight mildewy smell.  The common areas of the hotel were gorgeous.

Excellent location, within walking distance of many key attractions.  Dinner and breakfast were top notch (taste and presentation).   Room rate and overall prices were in-line with large major US and EU cities.  Within walking distance of La Rambla (a pedestrian-friendly boulevard with many cafes and restaurants); Guadi's La Pedera-Casa Mila; Sagrada Familia cathedral; and others. ",5,2023,05,27
11,Best Choice Ever,"The location is the best especially for shopping and cafes. We felt very safe, the food in the hotel restaurant was great. The hotel room was very clean and they clean it twice everyday. They provided free transportation from the hotel to La Roca village and free entry to the village lounge and their services.  ",5,2023,05,27
11,Truly Majestic!,"The hotel is great and really majestic in the epicenter of Barcelona.
Wonderful ROI to terrace.
Great breakfast.
Wonderfully comfortable bed.
The windows are too old in some rooms and we’re too road noisy in the room we checked in.
Great staff. 
Took care of it and we changed room for the better.
Thank you!
We’ll be back for sure!",5,2023,05,25
11,Simply wonderful,"For a weary family traveling from California, walking into the Majestic was like walking into paradise. The staff are kind and understanding, they make helpful suggestions, and they do what they can to make your stay as pleasant as possible. The surroundings are impressive; it’s like a noble old museum of marble with modern glass panels replacing wrought iron railings. Food and drink quality are consistently excellent. The rooftop bar has a spectacular vista of the city, dominated on one side by the inspirational Sagrada Familia (near completion). Go up there, have a drink and get the tapas collection, it’s delicious.
For our toddler there was always a friendly smile and a little Majestic drawing pad with colored pencils.
This is an expensive hotel, but the level of service was the best I’ve ever experienced. We look forward to our next visit.",5,2023,05,24
11,Wonderful!,"Location and service are unmatched.  It’s near all the high-end shops and the not so high-end.  Sagrada, the old town, and even Barceloneta are walking distance.

Breakfast was wonderful.  It’s great to hang out in the lobby, the terrace and the bar.  The hotel could be a bit pricey but it’s worth it.  ",5,2023,05,24
11,In And out In Barcelona,"5 hours ago on  Google
I flew in from from Almeria last MONDAY 15/06/2023 i had a super VIP meeting in Barcelona since usually I stay in Majestic while in Barcelona.
I have profile and spend well there while at the hotel my big mistake was that seems after immature staff have taken over positions of people who give horrible service.
For love for the hotel, i had scheduled the meeting at the restaurant of the hotel. I was denied concierge service to hold my luggage, inspite of offering to pay for the same.
I am a Centurion member of Black Amex. I am ashmased to have taken lunch with my luggage.
I recommend people Hotel Arts or W or even Melia.
The hotel has lost its charm and is not an option for people who deserve a service at that price they charge.",1,2023,05,23
11,Giant apartment,"We stayed in the apartments across the street from the hotel (2 min walk).  Our apartment was huge.  Could have fit another family.  The rooms were nice, and the living room was gigantic.  There was a large patio as well where you could take in some sun or eat a meal if the weather was nice.  The Majestic's location is very central for the Eixample neighborhood, and the rooftop bar in the main building is a place to be seen.  There really isn't a pool there, even if they call it one, as it's just a small square crowded by all the people having drinks.  Our friends stayed in the main building in a regular room that seemed nice but pretty small.  

The only complaints I had were that the bathrooms and heating smelled like stinky water.  It's that old world poor drainage smell, but I imagine the hotel could do something about it.  Second the second bathroom (yes there are two!) locked my son in from the inside.  We had to get someone to come and help us (they came very quickly even though it was late at night), and jimmied the door open, but you could tell it had happened previously so they should just replace that lock.

All in all, I would definitely stay again as the space gave us a feeling of relaxation and home. ",5,2023,05,23
11,Prepare to be Spoiled,Beautiful hotel in prime location.  Walk to Las Rambles and luxury shopping.    Our room was spacious and the bedding incredibly comfortable.  Don't miss the spectacular views from the wonderful roof top restaurant / bar - including a fantastic view of Sagrada Familia.  I can't wait to visit again!,5,2023,05,22
11,The Majestic lives up to its name.,"The Majestic Hotel lives up to its name. From the moment of arrival, we were provided with a friendly and efficient check-in service and escorted to a large, comfortable room. The Majestic’s  breakfast service has been recognized as the best in Europe, and it live up to that reputation with a wide-ranging buffet, alongside table service, if desired. Service was always prompt, courteous and aiming to please. At the concierge desk, Daniel, was knowledgeable in answering our questions and was able to recommend restaurants based on our taste and was able to secure reservations. As for the hotel’s location, it is near many of Barcelona’s impressive sites and is in the center of high fashion shopping. A top choice for anyone looking to stay in Barcelona.",5,2023,05,22
11,The Best of Barcelona,A world class hotel - facilities and staff are truly 5 star! It was one of the most enjoyable experiences of our European travels for 2023. The customer services staff are all well trained and well suited for ensuring guests receive the kind of attention one would expect from such a world class property. We will return!,5,2023,05,22
11,An excellent 5 star iconic hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"The Majestic hotel is a superb 5 star hotel well located in Passeig de Gracia, Barcelona. You could not be in a better position and within a 5 min walking distance to the Gothic quarter.
It is a traditional hotel with friendly, helpful staff, offering the best highly rated Spanish breakfasts in town.
The rooms and bathrooms are well appointed with all the amenities you need.
The rooftop garden is is fabulous for drinks or meals with a beautiful view of Barcelona.
I can highly recommend this 5 star iconic hotel in the heart of Barcelona.",5,2023,05,21
11,Park West guest,"The entire experience was wonderful, loved the roof top area tremendous views. And the food for our cocktail party was exceptional, wonderful verity, the cocktails very professional also. The rooms very elegantly appointed and the bathrooms were exceptional. Will definitely return if we decide to come back to Spain. ",5,2023,05,21
11,Barcelona,Everything was extremely exceptional except the beds. Our beds were two small beds that were pushed together    They kept separating and moving around during the night.  Great staff and outstanding location.  ,5,2023,05,21
11,Barcelona Top Hotel,"The Majestic is a fantastic hotel. The guest rooms are very nice and the bathrooms are beautiful.
Highly recommend this hotel when traveling with friends , family or a business trip.
Excellent amenities.",5,2023,05,20
11,Lovely & stylish ,"Professional yet very warm service.
 The hotel is an adorable balance of beauty in all its spaces. 
Food at all restaurants is very good and the breakfast is top in class, best experienced in 5-star hotels worldwide.
The terrace is one of the top hot spots in the city.",5,2023,05,20
11,International meeting,"We were 30 guests holding a business meeting over 3 days, plus a social programme.

The organisation, quality of rooms, support and service were exceptional.

The staff at all levels, from helping with the conference programme, to catering, concierge and general support were efficient and a delight to deal with.",5,2023,05,16
11,"Great location, nice spa, interesting rooms","The hotel is in a great location and the spa is great. We didn't use any of the other hotel amenities.  We were a little surprised that our ""deluxe"" room didn't have a window.  I mean, technically there was a small casement window, but it opened into an airspace maybe 20 feet by 20 feet across and open to the sky.  But from our floor (2nd) we couldn't see the sky.  So we could not tell if it was sunny or cloudy.  I guess if it had been snowing or if there was a hailstorm we might have known.  Thankfully weather.com told us the outside conditions!",4,2023,05,14
11,"Excellent Staff and Service, but Room for Improvement in Food Service","The staff at the hotel were incredibly friendly and the front desk, as well as the concierge service, provided excellent assistance throughout our stay. However, we did encounter some issues with the food service in various areas of the hotel, including room service. The speed of the service was notably slow, and once the food was finally brought to us, we were not asked if we required any additional items or condiments. 

For example, during breakfast, we ordered pancakes, tea, coffee, and eggs. Unfortunately, we did not receive honey, sugar, milk, or syrup, which resulted in our food getting cold while we waited for these essential accompaniments. It was disappointing that we had to remind the staff multiple times to provide these items, prolonging our wait and further disrupting our meal experience. 

Despite these food service issues, the overall friendliness and helpfulness of the staff, along with the efficient front desk and concierge service, made our stay enjoyable. It is my hope that the hotel can address these shortcomings in their food service to ensure a more seamless and satisfying dining experience for future guests.",4,2023,05,13
11,Top Notch,"We stayed as part of a large business group and found this hotel and staff to be absolutely exceptional. No detail was missed. Every member of the hotel team was stellar in anticipating needs and providing the best service. We had interactions with the Front Desk, Maintenance, Breakfast staff, Concierge and more and each and every one was fantastic. Would return in a second and recommend to anyone visiting Barcelona. ",5,2023,05,12
11,Expensive but worth it,"We booked the duplex apartment at Majestic Residences. Check-in was smooth. The terrace is overlooking the La Sagrada Familia and La Pedrera. Our family was 5 adults and 1 child. Staff was very helpful. They helped us right when our airport transport van arrived in front of the hotel. Buffet breakfast has a large selection. Overall, excellent stay. I recommend this hotel for luxury travel.",5,2023,05,11
11,"Beware, this is a convention hotel not a luxury one","The Hotel, a Majestic has a greAt Location in the newer part of Barcelona. However, that’s about all it has going for it. Beware this is a large convention hotel. There is very little service, lots of lines and lots of waits. We were given 1 room that has, a window smoked out, so there was very little light. It was also the size of a closet. The air conditioning did not work, despite being attempted to be fixed by the maintenance. There was no response from the hotel, including offering a fan. this is an expensive hotel. Absolutely inexcusable!  We had to go down late the next morning to get anyone to acknowledge the problem. Again, no service no interest in the customer.
 There is a large  nice breakfast buffet but expect lines to get seated . they forgot our coffee order, they forgot our food. ",2,2023,05,11
11,Family trip to beautiful Barcelona,"The great Hotel with exotic roof restaurant in top five in Barcelona. Five Stars are there with a reason. The best is the location. Everything is around at the walking distance, including Gaudi, best food and shopping. ",5,2023,05,11
11,Great Experience,Beautiful hotel and fabulous staff. Great location with views of the city from rooftop bar. Staff was most accommodating in all aspects of the hotel. Would certainly stay there again and recommend it to anyone who has some time to spend in Barcelona.,5,2023,05,10
11,Perfect!,"Staff and room was impeccable. We stayed in the guaranteed Privilege Passeig de Gracia room and the view to the street was wonderful. We added the breakfast for 2 and was pleasantly surprised. Food buffet and menu options are both included and there are plenty of options to choose from. Room was clean, and they offer US converter which was helpful since we didn’t bring one with us (going on a cruise). Definitely recommend and would stay here again!!",5,2023,05,10
11,Great place to stay in Barcelona,"Well located, this is a eloquent and grand hotel. The rooftop lounge has a fantastic 360° view of the city.
The food was excellent and service superior!  I would highly recommend the Majestic Hotel and Spa to anyone going to Barcelona.",5,2023,05,09
11,Thanks for everything,We thank the staff for their hospitality. Especially Mr. Mario. We thank the administration for taking care of the guests and the cleanliness of the rooms and the place. And provide assistance to customers at any time through the phone or reception. We thank the administration for intensifying security in the hotel.,5,2023,05,05
11,room was cramped/bad WiFi/ noisy/misleading pics on website ,"The hotel - lobby/roofdeck/location/ - is lovely, but the room was very disappointing. We splurged on the Privilege Passeig de Gracia and  I was shocked at the disparity between online photos and the real thing. It was cramped, no real sitting area, the terrace could barely fit one chair, and we weren’t able to get wifi for more than five minutes at a time. And the street noise was horrible. I lived in NYC for 15 years so I understand that big cities are loud. But this has to be one of the loudest intersections in Barcelona. When I asked why our room looked nothing like what was advertised, the person at reception basically said — well, nothing ever looks as good as on the website. Weird response for a five-star hotel. Buyer beware when choosing your room. ",3,2023,05,05
11,Lack of communication from staff at admitting.,"Room was nice, mattress was soft, lumpy and uncomfortable. View was looking at the roof top of other parts of the hotel. For the cost of the room, we felt like we were treated as second class citizens.",3,2023,05,04
11,One of the best experiences we've had in a Luxury star hotel,"Absolutely fantastic service and amazing experience all round! We reserved last minute for our wedding anniversary, as the hotel we had previously reserved at had sold our room. 
From the moment we arrived until the end, the service was impecable. The attention to detail and the care with which they did everything to make sure you had a good stay was second to none. 
Facundo did everything he could to accommodate us and to make sure we were comfortable from the moment we arrived. 
We stayed in the Junior suite which was perfect! The size, the comfort of the beds, the views to Paseo de Gracia, the attention to detail during the ""turn down""... everything was perfect. I had a sports massage at the spa and Raquel was fantastic. She applied the perfect pressure and I could tell she had a lot of experience. 
It's a shame we didn't have a chance to try out the main restaurant as we were told that it's closed from Monday to Wednesday but we had lunch on the terrace which has amazing views of Barcelona and great food and cocktails.
We would definitely try to book this hotel again if we go back to Barcelona sometime. ",5,2023,05,03
11,Great welcoming staff and amazing location,"We loved our stay, we highly recommend this hotel. The roof top bar has spectacular views and offers comfort and great service. The food service was excellent particularly the breakfast. We got great restaurant help from the concierge.",5,2023,05,03
11,True Gem!,"This was our first time in Barcelona, this hotel was just amazing all around!  The service, the staff, and the food was all top notch.  Centrally located in the heart of the city.  Highly recommend!!  You will not be disappointed.",5,2023,05,03
11,Elegant & Amazing,"The hotel is really elegant and perfectly located.  The entire staff was amazing and kind.  We were here on a group birthday trip and everyone in the group raved about the hotel, the staff and the location.  We would def stay again and would def recommend to anyone.  You won't be disappointed. ",5,2023,05,03
11,4-Day Stay in April,"Our stay at the hotel was comfortable. Location and friendly staff are plus. We could walk in a short period to many main touristic attractions including Casa Battlo, La Rambla, Plaça de Catalunya. Although we reserved a family room, first a small room arranged, but changed in a short period. ",5,2023,05,03
11,A grand dame with a big heart,"We chose the Majestic over the better known high end hotels due to the size of the room for the price.  We stayed in one of the penthouse suites with the sizeable balcony with the hot tub and that was very special.  The room was perfect and most of the staff was very sweet and helpful.  

It does lack a certain international sophistication that some of the other hotels might have but we didn't miss it.  

The gym is just barely adequate for cardio and a limited strength training workout - definitely on the smaller side.  The pool is tiny and in the middle of the upper deck bar so no really useable.  

There were no male massage therapists at all which just for us was disappointing though one of us had a facial and said it was great.

Breakfasts were very nice - large mix of options - nothing spectacular but very good.

Rooftop is very popular with locals and other tourists so gets very busy - there's a rush hour at the elevators at times for this - but it's a lovely view up there so you can't blame there.   Service is very southern European so don't expect anything too quickly even when not packed.

Location cannot be beat.  ",4,2023,05,02
11,Incredible!  ,INCREDIBLE!!  This hotel was exceptionally clean and new and the highest quality of everything.  I couldn't have been more impressed.   Everything is so clean and new and the service was wonderful.  Only thing was apartments didn't have daily cleaning service.  ,5,2023,05,02
11,Great location,"The hotel location is awesome with luxury shopping and high end dining just everywhere. We had a mixup and put up in the apartment across with access to amenities a bit cumbersome. Minus that , great!",3,2023,04,28

11,Scam,Take care they charge my credit card twice for the stay and didnt refund the money till i had bug argument and scene with them. Make sure to check your bank statement before leaving the hotel because they kept promising they will refund the money and they diidnt get ntill the checkout day,1,2023,04,24
11,Worst customer service - heartless!  This is not a 5-star quality hotel!,"We booked a one-br suite for 3 nights via Expedia and prepaid. Due to a passport emergency (my son's passport wasn't valid for 6 months, we thought it was 3 months), we weren't able to board our flight but managed to leave a couple days later when we got a new passport. Meanwhile, I called the hotel to advise them the situation. Expedia submitted a refund request for the 2 nights and the hotel refused.  When we arrived at the hotel, the front desk manager straight out lied to us saying they would work something out with Expedia but the hotel never did.  She even said she would send up a bottle of wine as we went through a nightmare travel experience and she never did.  I think most 5-star hotels that prioritize customer service would have considered some sort of arrangement for a refund or charge for first night.  This hotel offered NOTHING and it wasn't like the hotel was sold out.  They still had rooms available on their site.",1,2023,04,21
11,Friendliest and Most Helpful Team,"The best thing about The Majestic is the top notch team.  Everyone was very helpful from bellboys to housekeeping staff.  Breakfast was amazing and the rooms were nice.  And offcourse, you cant beat the location right on Passeig de Gracia",5,2023,04,16
11,Excellent services!,"The hotel is located between Casa Mila and Casa Batllo, two popular attractions. Roof top Terrace provides perfect views in the evening. The hotel offers a family with two bedroom apartments cross street for a comfortable stay but still can use all the hotel amenities in main building.",5,2023,04,14
11,Majestic Apartments,"Great service. Beautiful apartment. Excellent location.  Slightly noisy from above. The hotel receptionist Irene told us the breakfast was one of the best in Europe, surprisingly in our humble opinion she wasn't wrong. Hit and miss on restaurant recommendations best vegetarian and average Italian.  Overall extremely helpful.  Would come again.",5,2023,04,14
11,Fantastic Hotel,Rooms are so beautiful and our bathroom was enormous.  Staff was exceptional and polite.  Can't say enough about this hotel.  Location is perfect. Roof top restaurant with view of the city. Buffet breakfast with a huge selection of choice.   ,5,2023,04,14
11,Wonderful place to stay in the heart of the shopping district,"The Majestic owns several apartments across the street from the hotel itself, and that is where we stayed. The apartment was wonderful! Very spacious and clean. The location is very central in Barcelona. If you aren't opposed to walking, you can literally walk just about anywhere. The hotel itself is lovely, and we made use of the lobby bar, the rooftop bar and the fitness center.",5,2023,04,13
11,Great level of service from the roof top bar team,"Spent a family afternoon on the roof terrace - staff were attentive and delivered a great level of service

The team recognised that something went wrong, they anticipated the issue and made it right .

I was impressed and their action made the afternoon even better than we planned.

Congratulations to the hotel team for great service.",5,2023,04,11
11,Zeljko,"Perfect stay, friendly and polite staff. Everyone is ready to help at any time. Hotel is beautiful and clean on excellent location, and with very good food.

11,Suite style residence apartments are poorly maintained,"I would not recommend residence apartments that the Majestic hotel has for family of 4 or more. The staff wants to help when things go wrong, but the hotel operations are very dysfunctional to be of any help. 
We had several issues from bath tub and sink being clogged to in unit dryer not working. The staff tried to help but only after lots of back and forth which made the overall experience bad. ",2,2023,03,20
11,Poor service,Doors would not lock and rooms not cleaned until 6pm. They let everyone but hotel guest onto roof top bar. We asked for help and this would not happen. It’s a very expensive hotel in good location. But rest is poor. ,1,2023,03,20

My room was upgraded and had an incredible view of the city. The staff at the hotel was very friendly, except for the overnight security guard, who was very rude. 

The hotel breakfast was excellent and never too crowded. The rooms were slightly dated, and the furniture may need an update soon; however, the bathroom was beautifully recently upgraded.

The spa was lovely, and they could get me in right when I arrived. The rooftop is a must for drinks; however very pricey compared to the rest of Barcelona. The pool on the rooftop is pretty much for show only. I can’t imagine someone properly using it.",5,2023,01,07
11,Majestic in many ways,"I have traveled all over the world and stayed in dozens of 5-star hotels.  What makes the Hotel Majestic so different, is the sense you get from the staff that you’re not merely treated as a guest, but you are treated like a family member or friend.  Upon arrival, we were helped by lovely Sofia, who had our rooms ready in no time.  don’t remember ever feeling so welcome at any of the hotels I have stayed in. Majestic location, Majestic building and, best of all, Majestic treatment of their guests.

11,"Great Hotel, Very poor front desk not caring for guests requests","Great hotel, but promises done by front desk and internet site were not kept !
I lost one day in Barcelona because of this.
All the rest in this hotel is good, but this experience was terrible, irrespectful and frustrating, erasing all the good parts of my stay. 
Confirm clearly what you want by written when booking or front desk will say yes without complying or even lying.
Sorry, this stay could have been fantastic with a 5 stars, but hospitality business starts with people.",2,2022,11,18
11,Perfect Headquarters for high end shopping expeditions,"It’s a great hotel, all staff warmly helpful and friendly.  And it’s on the Barcelona equivalent of Rodeo Drive, so perfect headquarters for shopping expeditions.  A special note of appreciation to Marc, one of the concierges, not only for his expertise and the magic he performed, but also for doing it sympatico.
Don’t forget to check out the terrace bar, top floor.  Aside from lovely, it also has a great view of the Gaudi church.  
Having said that, two things:
First, when reserving, insist that your room has an outdoor facing window, not one that faces what can only be described as a ventilation shaft.
Second, one tiny request to accommodate the North American psyche.  I gladly attorn to local customs everywhere in the world, it’s one of the reasons to travel.  Except when it comes to breakfast coffee.  The staff in the dining room (and it’s a great breakfast buffet) don’t understand that, across the Atlantic, your coffee is poured as you’re sitting down.  We don’t like to wait for it.  We don’t want it 5 minutes later, or longer.  We don’t want to have to ask twice (or thrice), and we definitely want it before the eggs show up….
In fairness, the coffee problem struck our first two mornings but by the third, staff saw my neediness….
",5,2022,11,17
11,Excellent service and central location,"Lovely classic hotel with central location.  Rooms are old European but updated with nice amenities (heated towel holders in our room). Service was excellent with several care steps that were unexpected and lovely.  Incredible food.  Make sure to visit the rooftop bar, but go early as this appears to be a favorite local hangout and books up early.  If you have the opportunity to include breakfast, take it.  This was the more incredible breakfast spread that we experienced our entire week.",5,2022,11,14
11,10 Year Wedding Anniversary Stay,"Exceptional service, immaculate facilities and cleanliness made for a PERFECT stay for our special occasion! Sealed the deal with a bottle of fizz waiting in our room on arrival.

11,Great amenities and location,I believe the staff treat you differently if you’re black. The hotel is great and in a strategic neighborhood. It’s really a great hotel apart from the observations from restaurant staffs. I saw a little bit of bias or racism as they’ll run to attend to a white guy than attend to a black Person. ,4,2022,11,08

I love that they gave you free coffee in the morning and the beds were so comfortable. I would absolutely stay here again it is definitely majestic!",5,2022,11,03
11,Not worth it for the price,"The hotel is old and it smelled musty and so did our room. My bathroom smelled of smoke.  I think way overpriced for these reasons.   Otherwise the staff was friendly, food on terrace was great and location is good for all the shops!  ",3,2022,11,02
11,first time Barcelona,"Barcelona is magical! We are looking forward to returning some day! It was impossible to see and experience all Barcelona has to offer!! Sagrida Familia was the absolute high point. Not enough time to see the Picasso museum, an exceptional space. ",5,2022,11,01
11,"Faded Majestic, past its prime","We decided to stay at Majestic because we had a positive experience several years ago.  Unfortunately, the property has not kept up with its 5-star competitors in its immediate vicinity.  We found a tired property with a cramped lobby that has not been updated.  The furniture in the room looked worn with scuff marks, and the carpeting in our room had a large pink stain.  The shower ran either hot or cold, nothing in between.  These are definitely not signs of a 5-star luxury hotel. 
I would have been kinder and would have rated this property as being moderate if not for an incident that happened, and how they mishandled it.  They provided an electric kettle that malfunctioned.  The kettle leaked overnight and unfortunately we had an ipad on the table that suffered water damage and was spoilt.  When we approached the staff, we were given the run-around, while they played for time till our departure.  During this period, it was evident that they lied as a staff member contradicted another by giving a different version of what was going on.  I was very disappointed by their lack of integrity and inaction.  This together with dated rooms and space, cemented the rating as poor and the hotel not worthy of a 5-star designation.",1,2022,11,01
11,Majestic Hotel,"Great and Friendly Staff all over. A 5 star hotel. The location is great with 24 hour convenience store nearby and shopping along the Passeige de Gracia.  The breakfast buffet was spectacular and the best service ever. Truly world class. Take note of the 24/7 room service. Everything is 5 Star and very European. It is a 100 year old hotel but the maintenace is superb. You wont regret it and will truly recommend it to friends and relatives.

",5,2022,10,31
11,Family weekend,"Really friendly and helpful staff.
Location is absolutely ideal and has major sites within walking distance.
Very cool rooftop bar with incredible views and the breakfast is 1st class.
I'd say the only less than positive aspect would be the rooms are a little dated and so seem overpriced.",5,2022,10,31
11,Nightmare in Barcelona,"Highlights of the nightmare:
1. AC not cooling had to open window in order for the room to cool.
2. Unable to check in early after an 18 hour flight and never contacted that our room was ready.

3. specifically requested two single beds but was once we finally made it to the room they had a queen size bed. They then split the beds up into single beds as originally requested.

4. This was an overnight stay. By 9 PM they had finally provided the two single beds as initially requested. We then we’re getting up at 3 o’clock in the morning to take our other European flight.

We had taken approximately 20 hours to arrive to Barcelona. Upon arriving and trying to check into the hotel we were informed the room was not ready however we would be informed once it was. hence, we decided to explore Barcelona despite being dead tired from our journey. By 4:30 PM I contacted the hotel and was informed that the room was ready. Once again we were never contacted that the room was ready. We then arrived to the hotel once again at approximately 6 PM or so. After dragging ourselves up to the room and finally thinking we were able to rest;  the bed in the room was a queen size bed instead of the two single beds we initially booked. Additionally, at check-in I had reconfirm that we were to have two single beds but that was just a dream. I contacted reception and informed them of the mistake. Unfortunately they did not have A room with two single beds they could place us in. Hence, they had to come up to the room and divide the queen bed into two single beds. Next obstacle to overcome was the air conditioning. The air conditioning was not cooling the room at this point I didn’t want to call anybody didn’t get maintenance to check the AC I had just given up. Therefore, opened the window which was actually cooler than with the AC running but was still hot. Essentially we then got up at 3 o’clock in the morning to take our next European flight. I would say we likely slept for four hours. This is more like a two or three star hotel stay away. However, on a positive note the staff was very friendly and professional. Additionally, the location is exceptional.",2,2022,10,31
11,Bad Hotel,"arrived on 29/10/22 and at the airport, despite having paid and confirmed the transfer, no one shows up. They gave me the apartment and even though I paid for the daily cleaning it was not done and I had to go to the reception to dispute. This is a five star hotel! Beware it is not worth staying there, too many mistakes and the customer is left in jeopardy.",1,2022,10,30
11,Exceptional Experience!,"The hallmark of a great hotel is its people - and in this regard The Majestic is truly exceptional. The entire team, from Concierge staff to Guest services and Housekeeping, worked seamlessly to make our stay enjoyable and memorable. The Breakfast Buffet has been voted ""Best in Europe"" with good reason - it is incredible. We can't wait to return!",5,2022,10,29
11,Majestic!,"Top of the line experience! I thoroughly enjoyed every minute and hated to leave! The breakfast buffet was amazing and my eyes were filled with delight! The arrival was trouble free and the same with departure. 
",5,2022,10,29
11,Excellence in Barcelona,"Do yourself a favor and stay at the Majestic.  The hotel will make you feel valued and appreciated, and should an issue arise, it will be handled quickly and fairly.  The Suites are incredible.  Well appointed with 1.5 bathrooms, a large terrace overlooking the city and a hot tub.  The downstairs bar is chic, but the rooftop bar is the place to be.  Finally, the location is perfect.  It is in the middle of everything.  Definitely a must when in Barcelona.",5,2022,10,29
11,Best hotel Barcelona,Beautiful hotel with great style and lovely location. The breakfast is just fabulous with a fantastic variety of healthy and delicious food. The bed -probably the main asset of a hotel- is very comfortable.,5,2022,10,29
11,excellent service and feel like staying at home,"Fantastic location and staffs, especially Mario's warm hospitality. I feel like staying at home. I'm sure it's gonna be my second home in Barcelona. I highly recommend this hotel and thanks to Mario who helped me to change my room.",5,2022,10,28
11,Vacation in Barcelona,"Location is excellent, room was spectacular and the amenities of the Majestic were excellent. Front desk personnel was very friendly and help us choosing the interest places to visit . room services was perfect.",5,2022,10,28
11,"If I could give it 10 stars, I would","This was one of the best hotel experiences of my life. First, the practicalities: outstanding location on Passieg de Gracia.  Walking distance to La Perdera, Casa Batllo, Placa de Catalunya, metro stops, and many restaurants. The hotel offers a pricey buffet breakfast that is excellent in quality and broad in choices. However, the price is off-putting over a longer stay; there are many simpler breakfast options within a 3 block radius in any direction.  
Most common areas of the hotel are classic in style, and beautifully maintained. The rooftop bar area is modern, has a small swimming pool, stunning views, good drinks, and excellent food choices.  
My room was moderate in size,and boasted a small balcony.  The room and bathroom had good lighting, plenty of electrical outlets, (plug adapters are provided if you forget to bring your own) excellent air conditioning and shower, and good closet space. Also provided are a room safe, a hair dryer, and an iron with ironing board, if you are so inclined.  Laundry and drycleaning services are available. My room was spotlessly clean. There is daily housekeeping, and the room is also refreshed in the early evening.

 Practicalities aside, the hotel is warmly service- oriented. No question goes unanswered and no request seems impossible. All staff--bellmen,  waiters, housekeepers, front desk, and concierge, are professional, helpful, knowledgeable, and very welcoming. Everytime I entered the hotel, I was greeted.  I was on my own for part of my stay, and I felt very much at home. I was sad to leave the Hotel Majestic.",5,2022,10,27
11,"Beautiful, grand hotel in Barcelona","We loved this hotel. It's a beautiful property that evokes feelings of the grand old 19th and 20th century hotels of Europe, when hospitality was an art form. Our room was fantastic (go for a Privilege room overlooking Passeig de Gràcia if you can) and so comfortable. I could not believe how quiet the air conditioning was, I couldn't even tell when it was on. And the shower! My wife and I both said we wish the shower in every hotel could be this good. If you appreciate a high pressure shower, you will love this one. We stayed twice over two weeks in two different rooms and the showers were consistently good in both rooms. The breakfast: we loved it, and looked forward to it every morning. The room that the breakfast is served in is beautiful, as was the room we were seated in; a lovely sun room in a courtyard behind the hotel. I'm still dreaming of the Catalan Eggs, and can't wait to taste them again. We didn't visit the spa at all, but we did visit the rooftop bar on our last night, and it is also not to be missed. It was busy, but the staff were able to get us a table very quickly, and the view really is unrivaled anywhere else. Overall, we loved our stay here and can't wait to return.",5,2022,10,27
11,Barcvelona Escape,"Room was wonderful. Rooftop Terrace and Bar was lovely, staff friendly, food was excellent. Spectacular Views of the city, Two Gaudi sites were within 2 blocks of the hotel. Shopping and restaurants easily accessible.",5,2022,10,25
11,Barcelona on a Honeymoon,"I visited Barcelona on a honeymoon. The room was too dark, so I requested to change to another room, but was ignored. I didn't get the honeymoon event I got from a 4 star hotel. They seem kind on the outside but don't really care about customers.",2,2022,10,24
11,Great Rooftop Bar,"We recently stayed at the Majestic Barcelona.  It was everything that one would expect of a five star hotel.  The location is great - walking distance from many of the city's best attractions and restaurants.  It also has a great rooftop bar that overlooks the city.   The fine dining restaurant at the hotel is also very good, and we had an excellent dinner there.

We did, however, have a problem with one aspect of the hotel.  They advertise tours which are described in great detail on the hotel website.  The problem is that as of our visit the website had not been updated post-Covid and the description of the very expensive tour that we booked was inaccurate and we did not what was advertised.  After a lot of arguing on our part, and after initial push back by the hotel's management, the finally made things right.  All's well that ends well, but it did put a tinge on an otherwise wonderful stay.",4,2022,10,23
11,Barcelona 2022,"Great, friendly and very helpfull staff!

You are received right at the taxi with a warm and elegant  greeting . Moreover, one gets inmediate help with the luggage,
We went to the Bar at the lobby several times for dinner , as the food , wine list and piano were the perfect ambiance to relax and enjoy.
Our waiter, Geronimo was very nice, made excellent reccomendations and welcomed us those days with happiness and good will .
Thanks ,

Highly highly recommend ",5,2022,10,21
11,The Hotel to Stay at when in Barcelona!,"The Majestic Hotel is in a great location.  Lots of shopping and places to eat in the area.  Our room was a junior suite.  It was large, comfortable, very clean and extremely welcoming upon our return after a long day out enjoying the sites of Barcelona.  The breakfast was wonderful having pretty much everything you could want for breakfast and more!  When we come back to Barcelona in the future, we will definitely stay at the Majestic Hotel.",5,2022,10,20

11,The Marvelous Majestic,This hotel is beautiful and very clean. All staff were consistently pleasant and very helpful.

Check-in line is very long. We waited 43 min. to get our room that was not going to be available until 3 pm. Yes.

Go if you do not mind a very crowded hotel and waiting and waiting to get your room. We were not able to check out late. 

Obvious that staff is overwhelmed.",1,2022,10,19
11,Amazing Hotel Majestic,We stayed for one night at this wonderful hotel.  The staff were without doubt exceptional and went above and beyond.  Our room was amazing and ready before official check-in time.  We enjoyed lunch and drinks on the roof too bar and pre-dinner drinks in the bar downstairs.  The hotel is so well situated for shopping and sightseeing.  I would highly recommend and can’t wait to return for longer next time!,5,2022,10,19

11,Luxury hotel with some issues,"Rooms are large enough, very well furnished and have all the features on e expects of a luxury hotel. Location is excellent for shopping and sight seeing.
But, many rooms look out on a sky light shaft with noisy air conditioner ducts.
Some more expensive rooms require climbing 5 steps and don't have much of a view.",4,2022,10,17
11,booked a suite but they put us in a shabby regular room,"I booked (6 months in advance)paid for  a Jr. Suite ($800 per night)at this hotel on American expresses Fine Hotel Collection website . They are all supposed to be 5 star hotels.

This place would have to improve to be a 3 star hotel. They sent me an email in advance asking me for my arrival time so that they could have the room  ready for me when I got there.

When I arrived they said the room was ready ,but it had to rechecked by the head maid ,probably an hour. No problem we came back and went the room .

It was awful ! It was not the Suite I paid for but a shabby regular room.

We were  told that this was an upgrade because it had  a balcony. The room was awful !  worn out carpet ,rust on the furniture that looked like it came from a garage sale 15 years ago(see pictures).

The King bed was 2 singles pushed together, not uncommon in europe but not what you would expect in a 5 star hotel and one of the beds was an inch lower than the other because the wheel was broken !

I called downstairs to find out why we didnt get the suite we paid for and first they wanted to argue with me! When I reminded them what I paid for ,I was told about the fabulous balcony.

It was almost 90 degrees outside so I had no interest in the balcony ,but if I had ,it was covered in scaffolding and workers actively renovating the outside of the building ! no one would sit out there !

After arguing with manager for 45 minutes they grudgingly agreed  to move us to the suite we paid for ,it was not ready.

An hour after we were told it would be ready we were rudely reminded that check in time was 3pm! 
 
Bare in mind we got there at 9am and had already checked into one room. We did finally  get into a Jr. Suite that was in as lousy condition as the first room .

The only thing this hotel has going for it is the best location in town, the building is historic and beautiful , but it would need to gutted and redone to be a 5 star hotel!

Given the treatment and the nasty staff ,I would not stay here again if they paid me $800 a night!",1,2022,10,16
11,Bad Experience at Majestic,"Checked with Natalia both in the morning when we arrived at 10:30 am (overnight flight from NY) and again at 2:45 pm (our suite wasn’t ready and she told us to come back at 3 pm). Tired, exhausted and hangry, she told me multiple times that our room would not be ready until after 3 pm. I questioned her about this because hotel policy check-in is at 3 pm. I continued to ask why we cannot have our room until after 3 pm if check in is at 3 pm. She continued to insist that we would have to wait. She was unpleasant and could not read my level of frustration. I explained that we have been traveling from New York and we were exhausted. 

She never apologized for the room not being ready until after 3 pm. I felt that no one cared that it was unpleasant and uncomfortable for my husband, my son and me. Additionally, Natalia also refused to agree for our luggage to be brought to our room after 3 pm. She insisted that we come back to her and get our luggage ourselves.  I asked her 2 times to do this for us. She was insistent that they could not bring our luggages to our junior suite.

I felt that we were not welcomed when we arrived, no one asked us if it was our first time in Barcelona. This was our first time experiencing such unfriendly and unwelcoming reception. I felt no hospitality from the beginning. I hope that you take my sincere feedback seriously. Isn’t good customer service is anticipating what your customer needs and letting them know you care?

After we were turned away 2 times, we all felt helpless, frustrated an infuriated. 

The next day, I got sick eating poached egg with vegetable ragout at their buffet breakfast one day. 

I do not think that the junior suite which cost almost US$800 per night was not worth it. I have told them that I would not be able to recommend this hotel to friends and family. The only reason we chose it was because a good friend recommended it to us.

Finally, breakfast was included with room. However, I got my final bill and they charged us 160 euros for the breakfast we had our first day when they made us wait to check in after 3 pm. I have never, ever experienced this before at any hotels when you arrive early from an overnight flight and you are hungry, tired and your room is not ready yet. 

We loved, loved Barcelona. But will never go back to Majestic Hotel. Will definitely stay at Mandarin Oriental next time. 

Please note that I was very honest with the management about our frustrations during our stay—check-in experience, getting sick from breakfast and being charged for breakfast when it was included in hotel for people staying in junior suites.

Reading all the previous unhappy comments here shows how often my experience occurred. Many people also could not check in until after 3pm

My advice— call ahead if you are getting in before 3pm, and definitely stay at the Mandarin Oriental.",1,2022,10,16

11,A luxury five star hotel located in the heart of Barcelona,"The Majestic Hotel & Spa in Barcelona lives up to its reputation. The hotel, which will celebrate its 105th anniversary in 2023, is a luxury hotel in every sense of the word. The neoclassical building is located on the famous Passeig de Gracia, the boulevard where such luxury boutiques as Chanel, Hermes, Burberry and Dior, are located. Enter the lobby and you will soon learn how attentive the professional staff is, from the porters to the bellman, concierge, guest relations, restaurant staff and spa staff. The ground floor features a lovely and expansive piano bar. The lower level is where you will find the fitness center (and where a new indoor swimming pool will be constructed in the next year or so). On the first floor, there is a beautiful restaurant which offers an extensive breakfast buffet every morning and farm-to-table dinners. The rooftop bar serves lunch and dinner and features extensive views of the city below, including a striking view of Gaudi's Sacrada Familia. There is also a plunge pool on the roof. Rooms are gracious with high ceilings. Bathrooms are clad in marble and most have whirlpool bathtubs. Suites are expansive, especially the ones on the ninth floor. Some suites feature terraces with hot tubs. If you are traveling with several children, you might want to inquire about the apartments in a building across the street. There are two and four bedroom units with kitchens and guests have access to all of the amenities of the hotel. I did not view these apartments but did see the exterior of the building, also located on the Passeig de Gracia. The spa is wonderful and has four treatment rooms. There is also a wet area with a large whirlpool, sauna and steam bath that can be privately booked by the hour. It is a luxurious experience to be sure! The spa offers facials and massages and the therapists are highly trained. 
The only criticism I can offer about this lovely hotel is the check-in process, which was chaotic as there were many cruise ship passengers also checking in at the same time. Rooms are not available until after 3pm, which is normal, and the hotel will store bags if you arrive early. The check-out process was more streamlined and the process was much quicker. There are many sights to see within a short walk of the hotel, including the Gaudi-designed Casa Batlló, the expansive food market known as the Mercardo de La Boqueria and the medieval neighborhood known as the Barri Gotic. I highly recommend the Majestic Hotel.",5,2022,10,12
11,A Grand and Luxurious European Hotel in the Heart of Barcelona,"The Majestic is a traditional European-style luxury hotel. Still a family-owned and operated enterprise, the guests are a priority as service is excellent. The hotel is adorned with a beautiful art collection. The lobby has a piano bar, and the rooftop bar offers a lunch and dinner menu plus views of the entire city. The full-service spa is excellent and there is a plunge swimming pool on the roof. Guest rooms offer high ceilings, and gorgeous marble bathrooms with many offering balconies. Penthouse suites have whirlpool tubs on private balconies. The hotel’s incredible breakfast buffet (with menu offerings) is world-renowned and not to be missed. Located in a beautiful space with a sunroom, dishes are beautifully presented and taste even better. Four nights a week a Michelin-star quality restaurant serves dinner in the same space. Its location is central with many shops, museums and restaurants only steps away. The Majestic is ideal for families, business travelers and sophisticated guests. I highly recommend it when visiting Barcelona.",5,2022,10,12

We highly recommend a stay here if you are going to visit Barcelona!!",5,2022,10,12
11,Hazard,"Please be warned there is an exposed steel piece that joins the living room to washroom in the majority of rooms. I sliced my foot on this and was only given 4 tiny bandages, an opened package of cloths with only 2 pieces left and an opened bottle of what I think was disinfectant (only in spanish). It took the staff 1 hour to address this with me. While the Manager dealt with this well, it was a learning opportunity missed with the other staff as all I got was judgemental looks.",1,2022,10,11
11,Excellent overall hotel,"My experience with the Majestic is fanatic. I have rated this property a real 5 stars on every category. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who visit Barcelona.

Their room is beautiful and bed quality is very comfortable. Their staffs are extremely helpful and will always accommodate my needs.

The food, drink, and dining experience from the rooftop was excellent. The location of Hotel Majestic is beyond perfect -- within walking distance (or short taxi ride) of all the best Barcelona spots. ",5,2022,10,05
11,Reunion holiday,"The hotel is clearly overpriced and with poorly trained staff for the type of property they want to be.

While the location is perfect, the execution leaves things to wish for.

Rooms without windows, 39 Euro breakfast, issues not being solved. Not working elevators for a 10 story property, a pool that is not a proper pool but more like a plunge pool.

They need to improve to be able to live up to the hype they want to create. ",3,2022,10,03
11,Excellent and planning to return next year,"Very pleased with the experience here.  The hotel is very clean, the air conditioning was great and the room and the bathroom were excellent, including the bath amenities.

The staff was very helpful and made it a 5 star experience.",5,2022,10,02
11,Calm luxury,We wanted a conventional hotel experience for the last night of our vacation. It was a biking trip and I knew we would be ready for a real bathtub!

11,A wonderful stay,"From start to finish the staff were happy, welcoming and kind.  The building is amazing, and we were very luck to have a special balcony room, which we so enjoyed.  The roof terrace bar offers amazing views over the whole city, with an equally great menu.",5,2022,09,27
11,Superb Upscale Hotel in Barcelona,"Elegant and comfortable hotel with an excellent restaurant, bar and breakfast facilities. Scrupulous service throughout. Excellent location provides walking access to many of Barcelona’s attractions. Recommended.  ",5,2022,09,25
11,Majestic in Barcelona is perfecto!,"The Majestic Hotel is in a great location with easy walk to la Sagrada Familia, the Gothic Quarter and many more sites. The room was clean and nice. The hotel staff very friendly and helpful. This hotel has one of the best roof tops!  Food, drinks and views are great! ",5,2022,09,25
11,Barcelona Sep 2022,"This Majestic Hotel and Spa Barcelona has Top notch service, location, accommodation, and food!
The rooftop terrace is a must visit when you are staying in the hotel to get a view of Barcelona including Sagrada de Familia and Casa Battlo.
5 stars all the way!",5,2022,09,25
11,Poor customer service and rooms like a 3 star hotel!,"We just stayed for 4 nights. to begin with, they did not honor our reservation made through Amex Platinum so we did not get the breakfast included so they asked for 30 Euros per person if we needed to add  breakfast, obsecene price on my opinion comparing other hotels we stayed in Spain ""same category"".we payed total $2000 usd. This was not all, we called american express and they called the hotel and even then after the call, they still denied the benefits. we asked for an upgrade becaust the room they gave us had supoosedly a city view and the window was less than the side of a door, the rest was wall covered by curtains, so no window. other thing the ""King size"" bed were two twin beds together, this was not the problem, but the sheets were for twin beds so it was only that they just put them together. Maintenance is poor , the sink had a terrible backup, the shower door did not close properly, the water all over the bathroom when we showered. Towels were all frayed Really????? for a 5 star hotel? unnacceptable.... it says renovated rooms, thisi is a Joke, carpet is nasty furniture as well. after all the time spent calling to amex and dealing with the "" manager"" who was obviously not the manager, at least you can expecto to get an apology or something maybe insignificant to the hotel to fake they care which they did not of course. Please dont spend yur money here, trys the Mandarin Oriental its very well located as well and I am sure the roome will be better and the service as well",1,2022,09,19
11,Excellent,"Wonderful beautiful room and accommodations The staff very professional and friendly , we truly enjoyed being walking distance to all the shopping and restaurants. We can’t wait to come back to Barcelona Spain ",5,2022,09,19
11,"Nothing to complain, I really recommend this hotel","I attended a meeting and many hotels in Barcelona were fully booked. 
I choose the Majestic because the price/performance seemed ok, 
I was not disappointed by anything regarding the hotel.
Specifically the personell is first class.
I want to mention that one can forget about LHW membership (the ‘hotel reservation system’) privileges, Since they are for free in the moment, this is not  surprising, though.",5,2022,09,18
11,Couples trip,Very nice hotel and room. Unfortunately very crowded with tours and cruise passengers. Not the exclusive experience we expected . Location good and room updated. Could use a separate lounge and concierge area.,4,2022,09,18
11,Perfect Location!,"I recently stayed for a week at this lovely hotel.  The location was amazing and the old world feel of the hotel was matched wth very comfortable room and excellent air conditioning.  Enjoyed the roof deck for lunch and cocktails.
",5,2022,09,13
11,Feeling refreshed,"After a weekend at the Majestic our family of 3 returned home feeling really refreshed. The beds are super comfy, we slept so well. We were made to feel really welcome, nothing was a problem, the staff were engaging and friendly. Food and drinks were amazing.... accompanied with the rooftop pool and amazing views, we couldn't have asked for more. ",5,2022,09,13
11,Very disappointing,"The bed was broken. The bed linen was dirty. The hotel charged me more than they had quoted the person doing the booking, and when I challenge this the member of staff was exceptionally difficult, eventually said that they would investigate and email me and never did. Claims to be a Great Hotel of the World but definitely isn't.",1,2022,09,12
11,Old World Charm,"This hotel is perfectly situated for Casa Mila and the posh area of Barcelona.  I liked the location as it was elegant and there was a feeling of safety.  The hotel couldn't have been more helpful with reservations, directions and meeting our general needs.  The roof top restaurant is very nice.  I enjoyed a late lunch and a dinner and had great food and a spectacular view.",5,2022,09,11
11,Amazing,"Really well located, close to famous places. All the staff was really kind and helpful. Room was big and cozy. We also enjoyed breakfast. The restaurante was really beautiful. We enjoyed our experience here.",5,2022,09,10
11,Majestic is unequivocally the best hotel in Barcelona,"I've been to every hotel in Barcelona and can say with some certainty that Majestic is the best. You sleep better, it's more comfortable, it's luxurious, the staff are great, it's quiet yet has fun stuff (like the roof top bar). It is the best location in the city. It has prestige and history. What more can you ask?",5,2022,09,09
11,"Great location, though rather expensive!","Perfect location for exploring Barcelona. 20 min walk to Sagrada Familia, 10 mins to Placa Catalyuna. Right across the road from Casa Battlo. Nice rooftop bar.
However, all this convenience makes for a rather expensive stay - around Euro 375/night!",4,2022,09,09
11,Excellent Hotel,"The Majestic is a five star Hotel. The location is excellent, close to almost all big attractions in Barcelona, including La Rambla via. The customer service and value is outstanding. I will stay at the Majestic Hotel again soon!",5,2022,09,06
11,incompetent managers,"Pre-paid room but stayed in a lower priced room and refused to refund me the difference. A lot of construction going on in the Hotel Majestic at this time; therefore, a lot of noise and hot down of hot water.",2,2022,09,05
11,Amazing hotel and location,"Location and service were superb. Spa and rooftop bar were incredible. Deluxe room category, though small was adequate for our stay. Food and beverage was excellent. Staff was courteous and helpful. We would stay here again!",5,2022,09,05
11,Spacious apartment in the city,"The Majestic Residences are located in the high end shopping district, close to shops, restaurants, and many of the sites. The staff were very friendly and helpful upon arrival and departure. The duplex apartment was very spacious; more than enough space for our family of 4. ",5,2022,09,02
11,Amazing hotel (we stayed in the apartment),"My family and I stayed in the apartment across the street. The apartment is well equipped with washer and dryer (a little complicated but super useful). The kitchen is useful and nice size. We had 2 separate bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. 

The breakfast is def nice a bit fancy lol. We loved the rooftop. The food is really yummy and the view is amazing! 

 I must say that the staff was amazing. I have to thank Mr. Billard and Bryan for making our stay so amazing. They went above and beyond for us and we will never forget. Thank you for your amazing hospitality. We will come back again! ",5,2022,08,31
11,Hours Delayed Checking In & Rooms Are Not 5 star,"When arriving I had a 12PM Check In from booking with AMEX. I did not get into my room until after 6PM!! There was an issue because they were sold out for a conference previous night and my room was not cleaned yet. Not my problem, hire more cleaning crew for the day.

Long story short, they put me into a temporary room around 4PM to shower then I had to move all of our stuff to another room after 6PM. I had to cancel my first night dinner plans and waste hours around the hotel moving around and unpacking. Not ideal.

The women at the front desk seemed like robots. They don't really care or show any emotion to your concerns. One woman promised me a bottle of champagne for the inconvenience but nothing ever showed up. No upgrade or credits offered to fix the issue. It's almost as if they judge you based on your age/status/what you wear and treat you according to that. Sorry not everyone spends their money foolishly on material things.

The room I had (supposedly an upgrade based on the AMEX offer) was very small. Smaller than the temporary room they put me in. There was one small door for a small balcony and then just a blank wall for the curtain to go over. Seems very old school and due for a renovation to update these rooms. Reminds me of Manhattan living with very little room to move around or even put two luggages out.

There are many other hotels for similar price in the area and I would not recommend this one.

The only positive to this hotel is the breakfast food and the staff at breakfast were amazing.",2,2022,08,31
11,Absolutely Perfect Hotel!,"I cannot rave enough about the superb level of service at this first class hotel. Not only is it centrally located in the Eixample neighborhood of Barcelona, but it is near all transportation and the accommodations are fantastic!  The gracious staff, cleanliness of the common areas, lobby and rooms is absolutely perfect. I recently spent one week there on two separate occasions, and both were the exact same consistent experience. My son and his bride-to-be were recently married in Spain and we selected this hotel as the preferred accommodation for our guests and had a wonderful experience from the planning to the execution. Planning an international wedding especially post pandemic was complicated and challenging and we felt the hotel accommodations were an important piece of the weekend. From the moment we reached out and inquired, the General Manager Pascal, made every request and accommodation seem seamless. 

Our guests (30 rooms) were arriving over a period of several days. From the moment a guest arrived, they were greeted by a bell staff waiting outside the hotel eager to assist with luggage. Upon check in, travelers were quickly whisked to a private area specifically dedicated to our guests. The planner (Jennifer@Crystal Events- the best!) worked with hotel management to be sure room type and special accommodations were all considered and fulfilled. As you can imagine, this is no easy task. Executive management, Pascal and Antonio and their team were in constant communication with me to be certain of a near perfect execution. Since many of the guests were coming from abroad, Antonio worked closely with housekeeping to get people in their rooms as quickly as possible. 

Throughout the stay, the staff was on point in all areas. Rooms were cleaned twice daily within minutes of a request, room service was delivered within a reasonable period of time and restaurant reservations were confirmed by the concierge in short order. I would be remiss to not mention the absolutely breathtaking city views from the rooftop bar/restaurant which serves lunch, snacks and delicious craft cocktails/dinner each day. It is a must! Susana and Chelsea from Guest Relations services were available to our guests via e-mail or cell phone so any issues that may have arisen were resolved as quickly as possible. We were particularly surprised the day of the wedding, without asking, when hotel security assisted each guest safely across the busy Passeig de Gracie to the private vans transporting everyone to the wedding! Wow!  All in all, regardless of the task, our stay was flawless and the service was impeccable. Hotel Majestic gets 5 stars!",5,2022,08,31
11,Nice hotel. Poor structures,"Nice hotel and good service. The huge turn down was that somebody has put a PARTY  invoice from the roof top bar on my room. More than 700 euros. Receipt signed by somebody. The hotel asked me to pay this bill but since that signature was totally different from mine they realized their mistake. 
No apologize, just a correct bill in  my hand. I will not be back and being a fraud goal again in the future",1,2022,08,31
11,Best Hotel in Barcelona,This hotel is in a perfect location. The breakfast buffet is amazing.  Everything from Champagne and fresh squeezed juices to eggs benedict and everything in between.  The shower/bath products were large sizes and very nice.  I highly recommend this hotel for a luxury stay.,5,2022,08,31
11,Lovely hotel,Perfect location and we had the must wonderful balcony. The staff was friendly and the room beautiful. The air condition work and did not make any noise. The bed was perfect and we had a walking closet ,5,2022,08,31
11,Great to come back!,"Always a pleasure to come to the Majestic - modern luxury with old world charm. The rooftop has gorgeous views of thid incredible and unique city.

11,Majestic hotel & spa Barca review,The location was perfect the hotel was absolutely stunning elegant & classy and the staff was so helpful and polite made my stay an experience and the Room was amazing with stunning views and service will be returning in future didn’t want to leave can’t recommend this hotel highly enough would love to see what penthouse room would be like in comparison to room I had just below that ,5,2022,08,30
11,Majestic,This is a very good hotel in perfect location across from the Gaudi house. Majestic staff is majestic. It is pet friendly. Our puppy received a teddy bear to play with and a very comfortable bed to sleep. ,5,2022,08,30
11,"Luxury, Location and Lovely 🥰","5 stars for exceptional location, service and friendly staff.  There is not a better location in the heart of old Barcelona and the Majestic Hotel has proven it is worthy of its 104 years of experience in delivering superior accommodations and service to its guests..  The hotel is expensive but not unusually high for 
A prime city hotel ; you pay for what you get.  Try for a junior suite, it’s worth the splurge.  We can also recommend the Penthouse.  Fantastico!",5,2022,08,28
11,Majestic Hotel is OK,"You hear a lot of WOW Majestic 
Ooohhhh Majestic
Amazing : Majestic 

Its OK.
The rooms are OK.
The lobby is OK.
The rooftop is OK.
The tiny pool, about the size of 3 bathtubs is OK.
The food is OK.

Even the large breakfast venue is also, guess what?  OK

I was not overly impressed by much in this hotel.  
Everything here was truly just, OK.

Nothing special. 

Not sure what the hoopla is all about.
I could barely put up a photo because everything I took a photo of.
Cocktails - OK
Room - OK
Service - OK
Lobby - OK

Everything put me to sleep.  Mediocre.",3,2022,08,27

11,Amazing service and great location,"We loved our time at the Majestic.  The rooftop bar is a perfect place for afternoon drinks and the views of Barcelona are spectacular. Breakfast buffet was also amazing. 

Staff was extremely professional and kind. Amazing location in the heart of Barcelona. We walked everywhere and loved it. 

Highly highly recommend.",5,2022,08,24
11,Great experience,Really loved our stay ahead of our cruise. Fantastic location. The breakfast was absolutely wonderful and delicious. The staff were all very friendly and helpful.  The hotel is immaculate and beautifully appointed. ,5,2022,08,22
11,A truly majestic experience!,"Barcelona is not short of fabulous hotels to stay at, but none provides the immersion into Spanish history and culture as does The Majestic.

The breakfast indeed delivered on its’ “best in Europe” claim. The location is superb, sitting amidst all the energy the city has to offer, yet, quieter walks through local neighborhoods are less than a block or two away.  

The staff, from the bell captains, to the reception, the breakfast service, the concierge, to even  the General Manager, Pascal, are on hand to share of this magnificent city and their experiences. Notable especially so given the staff shortages across the industry.",5,2022,08,21
11,Finest Hotel in Barcelona,"Location, Service, Dinning and Lounge both in the lobby area and roof top level. Makes the Majestic Hotel one of the best, if not the ultimate best hotel in Barcelona, Spain. Classy, relaxing vibe, very professionalyl run by management. ",5,2022,08,21
11,city break,"excellent hotel and location , staff really friendly , really clean / nice atmosphere . food was amazing , breakfasts had a great selection , roof top bar - food was amazing again and service was great , the plunge pool was ok ,  views where good , over all experience was fantastic ,",5,2022,08,15
11,A wonderful break,"I was in Barcelona on a business/leisure trip and stayed 1 night at The Majestic. What a pleasant experience!

I knew the hotel but it was the first time I stayed overnight. The hotel which is more than 100 years old (it opened in 1918) is located Passeig de Gracia almost opposite to Casa Battlo and very close to La Pedrera. 

I was very spoiled by the hotel which upgraded me to the Penthouse suite with a jacuzzi. It was a pure delight, especially with the heat of the past days. 

I had the opportunity to visit different room categories, all of which were beautiful. Some are facing the Passeig de Gracia (they are more luminous). My favorite one is the Privilege room but with the interior balcony (overlooking Calle Valencia). They are so beautiful. 

The staff is very friendly (reception, bar, terrace) and prompt to answer all requests. The rooftop is beautiful. There is a small pool which is reserved for hotel guests only. The view at night, especially the Sagrada Familia is lovely. 

My room (Penthouse suite 903) was on the 9th floor. A superb suite with a huge bathroom. The amenities are top-notch. They are from a French Maison de Parfum, Atelier Cologne, a niche luxury fragrance brand. The terrace of the suite is beautiful overlooking Passeig de Gracia and the ""cherry on the cake"" is the jacuzzi. 

Breakfast is not to be missed. It is served in the dining room of the restaurant SOLC which opens onto a charming patio. If you are lucky you can seat on the patio. Breakfast is oppulent with a very good selection. The Majestic received in 2018 the ""Villegiature Award for Best Breakfast in a hotel in Europe"". 

The hotel went into an important renovation a couple of years ago and every single corner is just net. The owners are art collectors and the hotel is nicely decorated. The colors are mainly neutral (beige) but very relaxing.

There is a spa on the 10th floor. I did not have time to use it but will do next time.

It was a truly wonderful experience and I do look forward to coming back either for a professional or personal trip",5,2022,08,14
11,Great end to a great trip,The hotel was booked through our cruise line so I wasn't sure what to expect.  The hotel was beautiful and in a wonderful location.  Restaurant in the bar was solid.  Atrium was amazing for breakfast and the rooftop had some photo-worthy views both day and night.  We will stay again.,5,2022,08,14
11,One of our favorite hotels!,We have been coming every year to the Majestic and every year it‘s been an amazing experience! From the valet to the receptionists and concierge to the comfort of the rooms…we give our highest scores to all!,5,2022,08,13
11,The rating is due to the hidden fee's,"I found the hotel to be pleasant and very well located.  Good value for the money until I received my bill via email.  I had to leave quickly so I did not review the invoice.  Upon receipt, I noticed a $205.50 euro charge for an accomodation package.    This was not listed on the Amex website or hotel website.  Neither was I informed when I checked in.  
I have contested the charge but the hotel refused to grant a credit.  So as they say, ""buyer beware""!   That's a pretty good bottom line increase when you can sneak this in the bill.  Sad, as I would have stayed there again.",3,2022,08,12
11,Terrible check out,"I faced a problem with the hotel during checkout, and more than the amount due was withdrawn in installments, and the hotel was reviewed more than once, and I did not benefit from anything, and I will file a complaint",1,2022,08,11
11,Excellent,"I won't stay anywhere else.  The location, staff, rooftop view and service were excellent. I especially loved the spa.  My massage was heavenly. I recommend this hotel for all US patrons.  You won't be disappointed. ",5,2022,08,11
11,It was very perfect place with perfect everything,"It was my best holiday in Barcelona. Your hotel is the perfect place! So nice view from our room, beautiful room style and interior. The staff was very politely, they fulfilled all our requests, prepared the room for sleep, always asked if there were any wishes.  The perfect place for any holiday!",5,2022,08,11
11,Amazing Hotel!,"Beautiful, well appointed hotel located right on Passeig de Garcia! Amazing rooftop terrace. Close to shopping, restaurants, sight seeing and just 10 min to the beach. We had a junior suite which was perfect for our family of four. Room had sliding door between bedrooms. We will definitely stay here again in the future. ",5,2022,08,11
11,Majestic wonderful,My husband and I had a wonderful stay. Our room was beautiful.  The staff was friendly and so helpful.  FANTASTIC location.  We will definitely come back again and recommend the Majestic as well.  Beautiful property. ,5,2022,08,10
11,Expensive but best location.,"Many many hotels in Barcelona and many cheaper hotels but this was our 2nd stay in Majestic because of the area, rooms,how clean the hotel and comfortable beds. We would not stay in another hotel when we go to Barcelona.",5,2022,08,08
11,BEST BARCELONA HOTEL,"The amazing staff and warm welcome was evident our entire stay! Every person we interacted with was personal and genuinely helpful. I would live here if I could.
The buffet breakfast was delicious and abundant with cooked to order foods. Rooms were very comfortable, great bed and air conditioning",5,2022,08,08
11,Majestic in every way,"Travellers from Barcelona are blessed with an abundance of good hotels littered all across the city. What makes the Hotel Majestic stand out from the pack are as what the reviewers have described - its most perfect location along the Paseo de Gracia, the warm and attentive service (expect friendly smiles and greetings from every staff you meet), the beautiful rooms, and of course the sumptuous award-winning buffet breakfast (voted best in Europe at one time).

I'll add one more important feature - its historical heritage. The Hotel Majestic is the oldest luxury hotel in Barcelona, and it exudes an aura of class and elegance in a way only a grande dame hotel can. 

So if you appreciate a hotel with a story and with all the luxuries of a proud five-star hotel, then the Hotel Majestic should be right at the top of your list. 

Here's a tip. Go for a Privilege Room and above for the extra living space -  or better yet one with the view of the Paseo de Gracia for an added balcony highlight - and you will assure yourself of a memorable stay.",5,2022,08,08
11,A top luxury hotel in Barcelona with old-school commitment to its guest experience,"Our family stayed at The Majestic for five nights at the end of a trip which brought us to Barcelona from Venice.  The hotel itself is fantastic and what you'd expect from a top property -- the historic bulding is grand, beautiful, and meticulously updated; it is fantastically located right in the center of Barcelona's Passeig de Gracia (the city's Fifth and Madison Avenues combined);  the hotel restaurant and food offerings are excellently done in every way, etc.  As a family that mainly frequent's global luxury brands (Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton, St. Regis) rather than standalone properties, what really stood out for us in this stay was how The Majestic handled a significant and unexpected problem we encountered with our residence.  Without going into unnecessary detail, I've always believed that the precise nature of a hotel's response to an surprise challenge affecting guest comfort is exceptionally revealing of the depth of its management team and commitment to its hospitality reputation.  Suffice to say that The Majestic came through with flying colors -- displaying all the grace, professionalism, responsiveness, and accommodation you expect but sadly often fail to find in even some of the world's very best hotels and resorts.  Bravo!  We will certainly be back and will strongly recommend The Majestic to our friends and colleagues.",5,2022,08,08
11,My staying in the hotel was not pleasant. The staff is overwhelmed. And the apartment is allocated in different building,"I will provide more details shortly about my stay there, but be careful please with staying there. There was extra charges deducted from my credit card claiming that when we left the room it was not to neat and needs cleaning. This is the first time i face such an issue anywhere in the world.",2,2022,08,08
11,Rooftop with amazing views and very friendly staff,"Amazing rooftop with very friendly and welcoming staff. 
I would like to mention Carla Colonnello in particular for welcoming me and my family in such a warm welcome which made our visit much better and pleasant.
We will definitely come back.",5,2022,08,06
11,The Best of the best,"Unmatched in Europe. Without doubt the best hotel I have ever stayed in. In a world of ‘5*’ hotels offering ‘5*’ service this hotel is the only one (of many) that I have stayed in that offered old fashioned service wihilst remaining contemporary and exemplary. 
Perhaps the family run enterprise has resulted in a personal service that I thought no longer existed. BRAVO. The leader in luxury, comfort and service.outstanding in every way.",5,2022,08,05
11,Mainly good…,"We stayed in the hotel for two nights before a cruise. We have been here once before some years ago. The hotel has many positive features which I will outline below. However, there are definitely some areas of improvement needed also.

The Room

+ Nicely decorated and recently renovated. 
+ The bed was comfortable (if you like a softer mattress) and the sheets were of high quality. 
+ The bathroom was nicely appointed although had a couple of issues which I will mention below. 
+ The room was very clean. 

- The shower controls are extremely difficult to operate and get the temperature right. This is an issue that a number of people we spoke to were having. 

- The room we were given didn’t really have a window. It had frosted glass as it opened on to a wall about 2 feet away. It made the room dark and had I been staying here for any length of time, I would have asked to be moved. 

- The tap in the bathroom is one of those sensor operated ones which is great for saving water but if you want to fill the sink, it doesn’t really work - not ideal in a bathroom. 

- The bathroom had a sensor light for the night time if you got up to go to the toilet which is a great idea in principle but because of the positioning of the bed if you turned over it would trigger it so we had to keep the bathroom door closed. 

The Breakfast 

The breakfast was very nice. Lots of choice and the service was good. At 40 euros you do need to eat quite a bit to make it worth while however! 

The Service 

Some of the hotel staff were excellent and couldn’t do enough for you. The Porter who took us to our room for example was exactly what you would expect in a 5 star hotel of this type. However, we did have a couple of occasions where staff were not very friendly or helpful. For example, the concierge had booked something for us and we went to check on some details but he had gone on his break and we were essentially told how are they meant to know what he did and we need to come back later. This could have been handled a bit better - for example taking our number and enquiring when he was back. While this is not a huge deal, when you are paying over 400 euros a night you expect the best service. 

The Location 

The location is excellent, right in the centre of things and very convenient for the shops and the sites. 

Conclusion

The hotel is a decent hotel in a great location, however there are certain areas in respect of attention to detail and some staff that need addressing. The issues wouldn’t stop me coming back but as such but they also don’t make me loyal to the hotel. My experience wasn’t bad but I don’t leave thinking how good it was either.",4,2022,08,05
11,Not 5* service,"Really unimpressed with the service and the unfriendly staff. It was not a pleasant experience to begin with. You had to ask for someone to carry the luggage, almost felt like they were annoyed. I had specifically requested a baby crib at reservation and they confirmed it on the phone and of course it wasn’t set up and I had to nag about it and follow up. There were 0 amenities in the apartment. I mean luckily they at least provided towels and soap. No courtesy water or anything either. Breakfast wasn’t spectacular neither. Just mediocre for a very expensive price. What they really got going for them is the superb location but I’m sure you can find better hotels in Barcelona",1,2022,08,05
11,Excrllent,It was an excellent stay at the hotel in terms of the location and the cleanliness of the hotel..but I faced difficulties upon arrival..even though the company reached booking..It arrived early at 11:30 am..I felt that there was no interest from the staff..Four times I ask the receptionist..  If it is possible to receive the room.. Finally around 3:30 I received the room.. And the other thing.. Some days it was noisy.. Repairs apparently repairs between rooms in the morning and noon time..,4,2022,08,05
11,Highly recommend,"Absolutely loved this hotel!! Everything about it was absolutely excellent. The location, room quality, and the staff were exceptional. Can’t wait to come back and visit. If you are looking for the best hotel in Barcelona, I recommend you stay here. ",5,2022,08,04

11,Home away from home,Seldom you cone across hotels that make your stay like you are at home. Majestic Hotel does a good job at this. The air-conditioning was well serviced and we hardly felt the 38 degree temperature outside.  One great feature of this hotel is its location which is right in the center of one of Barcelona’s shopping districts and walking distance to many tourist spots. ,5,2022,07,29
11,"Beautiful property, great service","Gorgeous, clean and well maintained. Staff is fluent in English and offer superb service. Lovely rooftop with pool and bar.

11,Fantastic 5* in the Centre of Barcelona,"Great Five Star Hotel in the Centre of Barcelona. We stayed at this hotel for a city break and we were not disappointed. The rooms were beautiful and characterful. The rooftop bar and restaurant holds a great view of the City including Sagrade Familia Cathedral. The hotel corridors were stunning. It’s neighbouring building were luxury establishments such as Chanel. The metro station is a 2 min walk and Sagrada Familia is around 20-25 min walking distance. The hotel has great access to restaurants, shops and bar and the room is very quiet.",5,2022,07,29
11,"Great location, slightly spoilt by details which would be easy to fix",we stayed in one of the apartments. It was Apartment no1. It was spacious with a nice balcony. Overall the apartment was nice but let down by poor plumbing in the bathroom which meant that in smelt. Also needed basic utensils to make cooking facilities useable,3,2022,07,28
11,Amazing Location!  Amazing Service! High Quality,"My wife & two daughters (8, 10 years old) stayed there for 4 nights towards our last part of our 1 month Europe trip.   Great service and location was great!   Hotel was high quality as well.  The staff there was very kind and helpful.   During the hot hours, my kids would go to the pool everyday while my wife and I would relax under the shaded area in rooftop.  I would definitely go back again. ",5,2022,07,28
11,Excellent hotel,"My family stayed in one of the 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartments and had a wonderful stay. The apartment was huge with plenty of space to hang out in the common area. The kitchen was also large with an American sized refrigerator. It also included a washer and dryer in our unit. And the air conditioning worked very well during the heat wave! The location is excellent on Passeig de Gracia with so many shops, restaurants and metro stops close by. The staff was so friendly at the front desk and at the rooftop bar which is a must do during your visit. Beautiful views of Barcelona! We highly recommend this hotel and will stay here again in our next visit to Barcelona!",5,2022,07,27

11,Fantastic breakfast buffet and great location,"We were surprised that our request for a ""quiet room away from street"" was granted by surprisingly effective soundproof windows--the only small suites were right on the street but it worked out.  Food was great, breakfast served as our lunch as well.  It was so hot during our stay, but the A/C was terrific.  All the staff were helpful. The restaurant Solc served us delicious dinner as well.  Nice view and bar staff up on the room La Dolce Vita.  Since we were arriving very early in the morning, we booked the preceding night so we could immediately check in.",5,2022,07,25
11,A winner!,"Having lost my passport, I had to extend my stay in Barcelona over the weekend.  While checking in with Robert at the front desk, I mentioned the reason for my stay.  Immediately, Robert swung into action:  he called the Consulars office, the restaurant where I may have dropped it, the Taxi I was in, and told me to go to the police & file a report.   Then he prepared a letter to present on Monday at the Consulars office.  My anxiety wilted and I settled in to enjoy a couple of found days at this wonderful hotel.  The top floor restaurant and bar became my new home.  Delightful staff, wonderful food and fabulous views of the city.  

Will I return to the Majestic?  Why would I even think about going elsewhere?",5,2022,07,25
11,Great hotel is central location but room was not ready until 4:30pm.,A quality hotel with good service. The room was very good and the bed so comfortable - we literally had the two best nights sleep in years!  Try the roof terrace for drinks and dinner with tremendous views and great atmosphere. Only disappointment was late availability of our room on checkin which  was very annoying - there appeared to be several people in the same situation on both days we were there. ,4,2022,07,25
11,Classic Luxury,"We stayed at the Majestic during the heat wave and it was an oasis of comfort for us.  It's located on a great street near several of the Gaudi houses and close to everything.  We were lucky to get an upgrade to a penthouse which was really spectacular.  The room and sitting area were luxurious and beautiful.  But we also had an extraordinary deck with a hot tub and incredible views.  The service and breakfast were also excellent, including the very helpful concierge desk.  They also have a fun rooftop bar which is great for a drink and a swim on a hot day.  And there's also a nice little gym.  We will definitely stay here again next time we're in Barcelona.",5,2022,07,24
11,Excellent stay,"From the minute we were checked in by the very helpful Diane until we were checked out by the equally helpful Trainee Miguel, everything was perfect.  Diane gave us a very warm welcome and pleased us by saying even at 1pm our room was ready so we were able to check in straightaway which was very welcoming as we had been travelling since 4.30am,  The room was a deluxe, with very comfortable bed and lovely marble bathroom.  We enjoyed a drink on the roof top bar with spectacular views over the city.  There was an excellent choice for breakfast of cold food on the buffet and hot food cooked to order.  One of those stays when you wished you were staying more than one night.",5,2022,07,22
11,Excellent Staff,"Hotel Majestic is a must stay if you are visiting Barcelona. The hotel is perfectly situated within the city and is easy to get to everything. Although, the best part of our stay was truly the Hotel’s staff, especially Manuel and his team. Manuel went above and beyond to make our stay special. We would recommend the hotel ten out of ten times.",5,2022,07,20
11,David fafore,"Really loved the hotel. The services were great. Staff were friendly and helpful. The breakfast is also great. Really enjoyed the breakfast. 
The rooftop is a sight to see. Enjoyed sitting at rooftop for a drink and watch the highlights of Barcekona. The pool is small though but eveghing emgarfiti ",5,2022,07,20
11,Perfect stay!,"This is our second stay at Barcelona in this trip. After visiting different cities and experiencing different hotels, I can easily say that this one was, by far, the best one!
Well located, amazing staff, classic service and cozy beautiful rooms!
No doubt that when returning to Barcelona, the Majestic will be my option!",5,2022,07,19
11,Terrible experience,"I was given my rooms hours after 3:00 pm which should should have been the check in time, and rooms were very small and had no wardrobe for dresses and the bed I used was really bad it was tilting to one side",1,2022,07,19
11,Barcelona at its best.,"Great hotel - good food, excellent staff and ideal location. This team went out of their way to look after us, friendly and oh so professional! The chargrilled Houmus is out of this world.We will be back! ",5,2022,07,18
11,Short stay,"This is a wonderful property. Centrally located in a safe and vibrant part of the city. What ever you want to find is only steps away. Front desk of hotel was very welcoming, Agent Sophia in particular.",5,2022,07,18
11,Great Location and Spacious Apartment,"I chose to stay at the residence apartments because of the great location, a/c, washer and dryer. It was also great to have it located right next door to my favorite store - Chanel :)

The apartment is spacious for my family of 3.  We were immediately greeted by Dave, the Door Man, who greeted us with a friendly smiled and helped us with the car door.

Kaise? was pleasant and professional when checking us in and Miguel helped carry our luggage across the street and show us to our apartment.  Christina, Linda, Beatriz, as well as the other staff each morning at breakfast were always so delightful and pleasant as well.  

My husband and I had drinks and dessert up at the rooftop bar one night and were pleasantly surprised with the Ferrero Rocher Nutella XXL ice cream sandwich. Not only was it presented beautifully, but it was absolutely delicious and refreshing on a hot summer evening. Just thinking about it again, makes my mouth water.  Albert, our server, at the rooftop bar, was also very kind and pleasant.  

The washing machine and dryer were challenging for me to use.  I accidentally activated the child lock at one point and spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out how to unlock it.  The hand soap in the bathroom and shower were nearly empty so luckily we brought our own soap.  The pillow was flatter than I prefer.  

However, the amazing staff, great location, spacious apartment that included the comforts of home that were important to me truly made this an enjoyable stay.  Thank you!

11,"Great Hotel, Great Location","We loved this Hotel.  We had great service.  Everyone was friendly and helpful.  We arrived early from a cruise and they were able to watch our bags while we explored the town before we could check in.
The location is great.  Lots of shopping and food.  Walking distance to the La Sagrada Familia Cathedral. We would stay again.",5,2022,07,17
11,Great hotel...terrible arrival process,"Outstanding hotel and I would 100% stay here again.  The arrival process was awful though and the staff without realizing it was as rude as can be.  Just don't arrive before 3pm ad expect to get a room.  If you do arrive before 3pm, there is no texting to let you know when your room is ready or an offer to have a nice meal in the restaurant.  It is basically a sit around and wait and keep checking only to fin out the room is still not ready.  Aside from arrival, this hotel is excellent!!!  Again, I would 100% recommend staying as after arrival, it was a great experience.",5,2022,07,17
11,Terrible experience and the feeling of being ripped off.,"Well. It started with the lack of customer service and follow through and it ended with the same. I expected a hotel I was  paying 3,000/night to offer more by way of the dedication to their customers and excellence of service only to be severely disappointed on all fronts. The suite was in desperate need of refurbishment and the furniture was ripped and falling apart. They lock their thermostats so that you cannot adjust the temperature. This is either a save money or because their mechanical equipment is to old to handle the heat and high demands from the room guests. Candidly I would highly rece one anyone domineering this hotel for anything other than a good location and average rooms to go elsewhere like the Mandarin, The Cotton House or other 5 star hotels which this hotel certainly is not….",1,2022,07,17
11,One of our favorite hotels!,"The service, staff, food and accommodations were all exceptional! We especially loved that the hotel was so centrally located. The manager was especially helpful and visible. Would highly recommend this hotel!",5,2022,07,17
11,"Terrible customer service, stole our money.","This hotel has a terrible customer service.

We booked a 3 nights stay in 2020. The booking was obviously cancelled due to Covid. Expedia issued a coupon that expires in Jan.1 2023, but we are not able to come before May 2023. Expedia and the hotel refused to extend the coupon. They basically stole our money. Emails remain unanswered.",1,2022,07,13
11,Nice Hotel but not worth the Price,We booked this stay with American Express.  The hotel has a great location.  The rooms were very small.  I couldn't walk at the foot of the bed with out turning sideways and our room had one window with a lovely view of a green concrete wall.  The staff was always polite but it seemed to have undertones in everything they said.  We stayed in many different hotels on our three country family trip in all price ranges.  This hotel was one of the more expensive and the worst experience.,3,2022,07,13
11,"Wonderful City, amazing Hotel experience!","We stayed at the Majestic Junior suites for 4 nights and it was more than we expected.  The residence suite across the street was very spacious and had every amenity my family of 4 needed for a very comfortable stay.  What made the experience most special were the people at the front desk.  Sofia and Paula were so wonderful and helpful from everything from restaurant bookings to offering advice on the ins and outs of Barcelona. What to do, where to eat and what to see. They always had a smile on their faces and each time my family and I walked through the lobby they went out of our way to see how we were doing.  I would go back to this hotel in a heartbeat.  Thank you Majestic for a magical stay in Barcelona!",5,2022,07,12
11,Barcelona Visit,"Will try another grand lux hotel in the same area next time.
The Junior suite was not the desired one specially having booked two months earlier.
The bidet in the suite was broken, but i never reported it.  I n a reputable establishment, these amenities should be checked and rechecked regularly.
The Tv reception was bad specially on BBC1",2,2022,07,11
11,Passeig de Gracia 2 bedroom apartment,"We loved our 2 bedroom apartment.  It had a fantastic view and was clean and spacious.  We would definitely stay there again.

The kitchen didn't have much equipment (no pans or potholders - and the only skillet caused everything to burn), but not a big deal.",5,2022,07,10
11,Great Location. Amazing Hotel,"This Is a great Location Hotel. We stayed at the two romos apartments which have the same  Hotel services. Friendly staff. Amazing services and the Best, It Is at the middle of everything. I fully recomend this hotel. ",5,2022,07,09
11,Excellent location and service,"The check in and check out experience is superb,  Nice classic hotel with excellent service, Great views from the roof top bar , food in menus very limited to French taste so not a good place to have a meal if you want different menus but plenty of restaurants around ",4,2022,07,08
11,Great Experience," Everything was what a find Hotel should be. Service was impeccable; room was over the top and our stay was beyond expectation. Even the lobby of the hotel welcomes you with an under stated elegance. We would definitely stay again.",5,2022,07,07
11,Great place to stay!,"Not only is this hotel very nice, but it is so centrally located you can walk to most attractions.  Plenty of excellent restaurants nearby6 and just blocks away from several of Gaudi buildings.  Many high-end stores in the vicinity.  Would definitely want to stay there again.",5,2022,07,06
11,Best Hotel in Barcelona,From the moment we arrived at the Hotel Majestic we were treated to a magical experience. The rooms are so well appointed and the bathrooms are luxurious. The concierge are mind readers and can set up literally anything. The breakfast is delicious and the outdoor room is so attractive. Best of all is the rooftop pool and bar. The views are breathtaking and the staff is so friendly. Be sure to go up at sunset. We can't wait to go back!,5,2022,07,05
11,Pretty Accommodation,"I just think it is a beautiful and simple city to live in.

One of the rocking places one could think of. I would love to settle down there. Once you step into this hotel you get a feel of being luxurious.",5,2022,07,05
11,Majestic Residences - perfect for family,"Loved the Majestic Residences right across the street from the hotel. The apartment was very big…perfect for me, my wife and my two adult children. Gave us a bit of Barcelona-city living while still having the amenities of the hotel right across the street. Love the hotel rooftop bar as well! Definitely recommend either the hotel or the residences.",5,2022,07,05
11,Horrible experience,We went there after speaking with the nice staff on the phone. Then we met Alexandra at the entrance who denied us access even though we were promised a seat on the terrace. She was rude and disrespectful even though she let other people in. We have had so many great experiences at their hotels in Cannes and Rhodos with very nice service. This was below all expectations and we will not chose Majestic again.,1,2022,07,04
11,Wonderful 4 night stay with my family,"My family just returned after 4 nights at the hotel and we absolutely loved it. My family (2 adults and 2 kids aged 8) stayed in the privilege room which was very spacious with super comfortable bedding. We all literally fell asleep so quickly and struggled to leave the bed in the morning as it was so soft and comfortable. The location of the hotel is right in the centre of the city providing easy access to public transportation and just a short walk to food, shopping and visits. 
My children was very happy with breakfast every day at the hotel too. 
We can’t wait to return to the Majestic Hotel when we visit Barcelona next time - hopefully soon. Thanks for making our stay so comfortable.",5,2022,07,01
11,Classic Hotel close to Gaudi landmarks,"Deserves its five-star rating and inclusion in “best of” hotel listings!  And notably, of the seven 4&5-star hotels we stayed at during our 18-day trip to Europe, it was the only one that could see fit to actually put an iron and ironing board in the room!  Bravo!",5,2022,07,01
11,Barcelona,Location was perfect. Close to everything. Metro was just a few steps away. Safe area with a lot of high end stores and restaurants. Friendly and helpful stadd. Barcelona is a fantastic city. Will be back for sure,5,2022,07,01
11,The Majestic Hotel lives up to its name.,"The Majestic Hotel lives up to its name.
The staff couldn’t have been any better. Our suite was perfect. We had a very uneventful stay. Which was perfect. The location of the hotel is very central to everything. Great job!",5,2022,06,29
11,"Great location, inconsistent service","Surrounded by luxury boutiques and within walking distance to more modest options, the hotel is in a very convenient location. The common areas are beautiful and and the room although small had some nice touches, like the sensors next to the bed that would detect your feet if you got up in the middle of the night and light up the bathroom. The common areas are pretty busy most of the time as it is a very popular hotel with a large amount of foot traffic. There's a tiny gym and an oversized bathtub billed as a pool.

The service was a little inconsistent. We checked in at 430pm and were told the room was not ready, and directed to the lounge to wait. Except reception never came back to update us and we had to go chase it up an hour later. I realize reception was busy but that was still pretty bad service.  When I attempted to confirm the guaranteed late checkout on my booking I was told the hotel was fully booked and I may get lucky if I check back later. Now I understand hotels get busy and a situation may arise where even ""guaranteed"" means nothing, but I detest it when you make me wait till 6pm for my room because it has obviously been used for a late checkout and then proceed to tell me that you do not honor guaranteed late checkouts. 

Breakfast was decent, a reasonable buffet selection and hot dishes to order, and the choc cake at the rooftop bar was very good. Service at the F&B outlets was also very good even though the staff were almost always very busy.

Good place to stay overall, if a little crowded at times. Better location than the Cotton House, but not as unique.",4,2022,06,27
11,Majestic Hotel in Barcelona,"Fantastic Hotel , best location & unbelievable service
We spent 5 nights in a Verandah Suite overlooking the main entrance

11,"Lovely, comfortable room in great location",Enjoyed 3 nights at Majestic. Pristine accommodations.  Great shower and cushy towels. Comfortable bed.  Friendly staff. And location is  great across from subway and taxi stop.  About 10-15 walk North of La Ramblas and across from Casa Batlo . Passenger de gracia is a Lovely street to walk on.  Perfect upscale hotel for Barcelona.,5,2022,06,24
11,Luxury and style in the heart of Barcelona,The Hotel Majestic is a welcome haven from the bustling streets of Barcelona and the staff go above and beyond to make your stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. The rooftop pool is fantastic and a great place to enjoy a sunset drink. The room was quiet and very comfortable.,5,2022,06,23
11,Well appointed apartment in a prime location,"We have stayed at a 2-bedroom apartment for 4 nights. The apartment building is across the street from the hotel and is very discreet. The apartment was very spacious and clean. Kitchen was well equipped with pots and pans, appliances, and starter cleaning supplies. The in suite laundry was very helpful. It is located in a central location with easy access to shopping, sightseeing, and restaurants. The staff were very friendly. The breakfast was awesome, but is very expensive. But there are plenty of other options. Highly recommended.",5,2022,06,23
11,Great Hotel,"This hotel was clean, quiet and in a great location. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The rooftop restaurant was a real treat. Would stay here again on our next visit. Shopping, attractions and other restaurants were easily within walking distance.",5,2022,06,22
11,Fabulous Hotel !,I can’t say enough good things about this hotel ! It’s a lovely place in a convenient and perfect location in Barcelona . The entire staff was friendly and helpful . There is a  beautiful dining room for a delicious breakfast buffet . They also serve dinner there a few nights a week but they opened too late for us . We spent most of our evenings on the gorgeous rooftop restaurant with breath taking city views .  Our room was spacious and very comfortable . Hope to go back one day !,5,2022,06,22
11,Beautiful Barcelona,"The Majestic is a stunning hotel in the midst of the designer shops and beautiful architecture of Barcelona.

The staff were friendly, the rooftop bar was a lovely way to spend the evening. We will certainly be returning asap!

The rooms were very clean and comfortable and the decor is modern.

The hotel is within walking distance of many of the key tourist areas and the concierge were more than happy to send us in the right direction for the best tapas!

Really lovely stay, looking forward to returning.",5,2022,06,21

Taxi stand in front of the hotel.
Large , comfy room with air conditioning.
Delicious breakfast.
Professional and friendly staff.
I wish there was a swimming pool.",4,2022,06,20
11,Majestic Residences,"Excellent hotel but the residences (apartments) across the street are not well maintained. 
Stayed 3 nights in June 2022. Getting stuck in the elevator for 45 minutes on the first day was upsetting.  This was followed by a broken balcony door and a broken dryer which created additional headaches.  The main hotel, breakfast, and location are excellent, but we would consider alternatives for a large family next time. 
",3,2022,06,20
11,Phenomenal Experience,"Fantastic Hotel with friendly, polite staff who want to ensure you’re not only  comfortable but happy during your stay. The hotel is immaculately decorated, the room was amazing with great views of the city. ",5,2022,06,20
11,Outstanding service. Memorable stay.,"What an amazing hotel! Located on the posh high shopping street, this hotel is in the heart of it all. We had 3 rooms: two interconnected and for the third, we were surprised with an upgrade to a penthouse suite boasting its own hot tub and private sun deck. 
The most memorable thing about this hotel has to be its outstanding service. Not intrusive but attentive and fast. Due to sports conditioning a member of our family needed ice for an ice bath and they provided it immediately. The other memorable thing is the distinct aroma of the hotel, a perfume called Musc Imperial Cologne Absolu. 
The areas they can improve are: the gym (tiny dark strange layout) and shade for the rooftop desk. The pool is no more than a water feature so it’s strange to have people splashing about in such close quarters to cocktail tables.",5,2022,06,19
11,Fabulous Trip,"Trip with my daughters…room was wonderful with great views. Rooftop was perfect for end of day drinks and relaxation. The morning breakfast was delicious with plenty of choices for all of my family.  Staff was lovely.

11,Beautiful hotel with rude staff,I’ve personally contacted the hotel with information on the rude staff. The hotel is beautiful and the breakfast is very good however staff are generally rude and unhelpful. For the price you’re paying there are many other fantastic properties far more worthy of your custom ,2,2022,06,18

11,Highly recommend,"Spectacular location, amazing service and properties. So many excellent cafes and restaurants around the hotel. Roof top area has one of the best 360 degree views of Barcelona you’ll find. This hotel is the perfect reprieve after a busy day in a bustling city. ",5,2022,06,15
11,Horrendous,"Front desk staff lovely, the rest rude and miserable looking, it certainly didn’t feel like you were a paying guest, food was awful really bad, pool view was overlooking an empty pool which did get filled but not cleaned full of leaves, pool overrun by young guest throwing balls to each other meaning no one else could go in pool unless you wanted to risk getting hit with ball, not their fault there was no one to say no this is definitely not a family hotel more 18 to 30, if you are taking kids please reconsider exceptionally noisy at night all night",1,2022,06,14
11,Amazing Place!,We had such a great trip to Hotel Majestic. Everything was of the highest quality. Every staff member we met were so nice and helpful. Barcelona is an amazing city & Hotel Majestic is in the center of it all. We can’t thank them enough for such an amazing experience. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. ,5,2022,06,14
11,Spain vacation,"The hotel was wonderful. Walking distance to everything, downtown, historic buildings, restaurants, etc.. Beautiful rooms, great ambiance in the hotel dining room and bar. We didn’t eat so I can’t rate the food. Staff was friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay there again.",5,2022,06,13
11,Not worth the price,"With so many other nice properties to choose from in Barcelona, this one would be near the bottom of the list. It advertises a rooftop pool, but there are no lounges and the pool is just to get wet wet in.",2,2022,06,10
11,Traditional hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"We visited this hotel in June for four nights.  The location is excellent, within walking distance of nearly all major tourist sights.  The hotel staff were unfailingly helpful, and met all our requirements.  

We had booked a larger room with a desk as we were working for part of the trip.  Unfortunately the desk was in a space that would have been too bright, and the staff immediately organised an alternative room for us which was perfect.  We had selected a room over looking Passig de Gracia which we would really recommend. We were initially apprehensive about noise, but the windows are double glazed with especially thick curtains, and there really was very little noise at night.

The rooftop bar is just lovely, with superb views over Barcelona including to the sea and in the other direction Sagrada Família.  We ate there 2 nights, and the service again was excellent.  The downstairs bar was a calm oasis, with, again, great service.

The bed was very comfortable,and alternative pillow types were available.  As many of the previous reviews have said, the breakfasts are extensive and very well organised.

The hotel is in a heritage building, and decorated in consistent style inside as well.  While this can feel a little formal, it is in keeping with the age of the building.  The reception and check in areas are always busy, and a specific concierge would be helpful, but the staff were both friendly and happy to assist with queries.  We would recommend.",5,2022,06,10
11,it was an unforgettable stay,the hotel is perfectly located in the middle of the city.  the staff is extremely friendly and always helpful.  we had a free upgrade and the room (suite) was a dream.  the breakfast buffet leaves nothing to be desired!  the roof terrace with a wonderful view over the city we would always come back.  Thank you for this great stay,5,2022,06,09
11,"Paying for location. Old hotel, disorganized","Hotel location was great. However, the check in process took forever and it was not due to lack of staff. Nobody seems to know what’s going on. Very disorganized. Though the breakfast was delicious, the waitstaff was disorganized too. It was a busy weekend and the hotel was pretty full. However, there seemed to be adequate staff, just no direction. The room was comfortable and the A/C worked great. However, it is an older hotel and had some issues with the toilet flush getting stuck and light switch not working. For the amount that was paid, I would expect more. ",3,2022,06,07
11,Spectacular facility & staff,"Could not be a better location. The Majestic is beautifully designed (architecture is very important to Barcelona), and the staff was supremely professional and friendly. Our requests were always met with a smile and a professional response. The doorman memorized our names on day one and greeted us by name every time we passed by. ",5,2022,06,06
11,Apartment stay,"We had a wonderful family holiday staying in one of the Majestic apartments. Our apartment was very clean, stylish, spacious and well equipped. We were very pleased with the Passeig de Gracia view. The location was ideal. We had breakfast in the hotel on one day, which was a real treat. 
We were very sad to leave!",5,2022,06,04
11,First Class Hotel,"Great Hotel in the centre of it all. The most amazing breakfast spread, decor and service! Rooms were high end and spacious. First Class all the way! I’ll be back next time I come to Barcelona. Great memories",5,2022,06,04
11,First Visit with Family,"Stayed at the apartments across the street.  Don’t worry, they will escort you and bring your luggage. Very private feel with all the amenities including room service that one would expect from a hotel. With family, the two bedroom setup was ideal.  Location was perfect next to high end stores. Concierge went out of their way to arrange a private car for a day excursion on short notice, as we arrived during the Formula One, and no private cars were available. I cannot say enough about the effort put forth by the concierge to make this happen. When you travel as much as we do, it is not always about the hard product. It’s the soft product that seals the deal. ",5,2022,06,03
11,Different view rooms,"We explained everything already ! The rooms were very good, but the view really terrible! Next time we book rooms with a better view. We like the hotel very much; so this was a pity! We will come back!",5,2022,06,02
11,Not worth your $$,"Honestly for what you pay is not worth your money. The spa ahs no clue of what a spa should be, the rooms are nice but minor details make the whole experience bad. I was charged 4 times for diner and twice for my stay at checkout. Silly...",1,2022,06,01
11,An incredible experience,"The staff is very kind, the room is incredible, the views from the room are stunning (all Barcelona!), they admit dogs and have a VIP service for them (which is lovely), the breakfast is served in a quiet room surrounded by plants and the location is superb. Highly recommendable.",5,2022,06,01
11,Amazing stay,"Wonderful hotel with such a great staff. My daughter and I stayed here and I wish we could have extended our trip! 

I can’t say enough good things about the front desk, the waiters and the cleanliness of the room. Amazing location close to all the sites. Also, don’t miss the breakfast!!",5,2022,06,01
11,Beautiful Barcelona,"The Majestic Hotel is in the perfect location to explore Barcelona. Such a beautiful hotel with a fabulous roof top terrace with views across the city. Excellent breakfast selection with homemade breads, cakes & pastries. So many choices of hot foods as well as wonderful cold meats & cheeses. If you can book in for the Sunday Brunch - not to be missed including a glass of champagne on arrival & brunch is accompanied by a violinist. Such a charming atmosphere & so many delicious courses including oysters and razor clams, pate en croute, sea bass, fillet steak and a special  dessert station serving Crepe Suzette & Rum Baba and so much more! Fantastic!!",5,2022,05,31
11,Beautiful Rooms and Amazing Staff,"Had a reservation in a room that was to sleep 3.  The 2nd Bed was broken.  The room itself was beautiful and it would have been a shame to give it up.  The hotel staff solved the problem and made the stay even more enjoyable.  The Rooftop Bar is also excellent with great food, drink and views of the entire city.  Can't wait to return.",5,2022,05,31
11,"Great Hotel, Great Location!",Great Location in the heart of Barcelona! Walkable to Goudi’s house and the Gothic Quarter. The staff at the Majestic are attentive and provide excellent service.  Love the rooftop bar.  Spectacular views!,5,2022,05,31

11,Location location location,"We stayed st the Majestic 18years ago and had a memorable stay.  We knew we wanted to return and it did not disappoint.  GREAT location, near La Rambla AND all the shopping. Room was comfortable .Staff is extremely attentive.  There is a small fitness room that is adequate.  A ;lovely spa with exceptional therapists- Anna- in particular.  And a rooftop pool.  However, there are NO chairs to just sit at the pool.  There are tabes and chairs and you are expected to order food and/or drinks.  ",5,2022,05,28
11,Hotel with isues,"Not working air conditioner in the room is not normal for such a hotel. Queue in the reception is permanental and to change the room took to long. I had to stay the night without airconditioner and to without sleep, because of the temperature of the room",4,2022,05,26
11,"Only one night, would have loved to do more.","Friendly and helpful staff are the first thing which springs to mind when I reflect back. Really great service and all of those I interacted with were enthusiastic and spoke excellent English (to my shame, languages are not a strong point).
Our room was well appointed and had everything we needed for a pre-cruise stay.
The breakfast was very good indeed.",5,2022,05,24
11,"Fantastic hotel, great value for money","Beautiful building inside and outside. Friendly and professional staff. I highly recommend the majestic suite, especially for a couple or 2 people. Nearby a train station, small shops, supermarket, and right on Valencia street with all the designer stores. ",5,2022,05,24
11,5 stars all around!,"Hotel- the hotel and grounds were well maintained. Everything was clean, thoughtfully decorated and you could feel the history of the hotel as you walk around. 

The rooftop was a nice addition, beautiful views and good vibes. 

Food- this breakfast deserves its own review. The self service area was adorned with meats, cheeses, breads, pastries, fruits, and juices. In addition you can get made to order eggs, potatoes, and meats. Soooooo tasty, well executed, and service was impeccable too. 

Service- I cannot say enough about the attentive, friendly, and helpful service from the staff. Special shout out to Felipe( doorman) , Guillion(doorman), Ana(housekeeping) , and Richard (front desk) who made our stay amazing.",5,2022,05,24
11,Barcelona Stay,"Hotel was conveniently located, staff very helpful, breakfast buffet was exceptional with a lovely sunroom surrounded by beautiful trees and flowers! Would definitely stay here again. The highlight was the roof top bar and restaurant!",5,2022,05,23
11,Barcelona Stay May22,"- Excellent location
- Splendid and rich breakfast
- Great cocktails at terrace
- Service can be better
- You need more manpower at reception (long waiting times)
- I was staying at/paying for a city-view room and instead I had scaffolding view. Also couple of wooden doors for the cupboards (that of the safe and that of the mini-bar) were obviously broken and not properly fixed ",3,2022,05,23
11,Amazing Experience,"Hotel Is amazing its very clean and luxurious, location is great and the staff are perfect. I cant get over the nice smell of the hotel lobby and corridors.

Next time and every time in Barcelona i will choose majestic hotel because its the best in town",5,2022,05,20
11,Stay here!!,"No need to look anywhere else, stay here! So clean, so friendly, great location, amazing food. I was so happy with our stay. I would recommend this hotel to all of my friends and family that are traveling to Barcelona.  ",5,2022,05,19
11,Excellent stay,Lovely hotel in a great location.  Lots of restaurants and shops nearby.  Metro very close and stops for the tourist buses close by as well.  All the staff were very friendly and helpful.  Lovely room with large walk in shower.,5,2022,05,17
11,Top of the town,This is for sure one of the best rooftop experiences in Barcelona. You have the best view of the city and the best in town services. With the finesse of luxury and the eye for the customers the team is treating you with open arms so you feel at home without being a resident of the hotel.,5,2022,05,16
11,Great Location,"On the plus side, this hotel is within walking distance to many lovely sites, restaurants and bars. The first impression is that the hotel is quite Majestic with its beautiful architecture. Upon arrival, the Bellman greeted us promptly and courteously and handled our luggage and vehicle. Unfortunately, the check in was not as easy. The wait time was long and the process longer. After making online reservations, which included all our information, we did not expect the check in process to take so long. There was clearly a need for more staff at the reception desk. It would have helped had the staff seemed friendlier. The rooftop bar was closed so we opted for the bar next to reception which was crowded and not as grand as I expected. The beverages were good though. The room was small but nice and clean. The bed comfortable although a bit saggy in the middle. The most disappointing factor for us was the lack of a concierge at the desk. We would have appreciated some recommendations and assistance making arrangements for dinner reservations as well as tour information. Overall, our stay was good.",3,2022,05,16
11,Accommodation,"The hotel is perfectly located. Very good services at large. Beautiful rooftop .
The services were excellent as every body trying to help the best way they can.
The lobby is nice and very lively as well.",4,2022,05,16
11,Lovely hotel with terrible staff,I can recommend this hotel for the location and the nice room.  Do not book a tour through the concierge.  We talked with someone via phone and she never called us back.  We then spoke directly to the concierge and he quoted us a price for a private tour and transportation.  When we checked out the total was double the quote.  The front desk person made no attempt to correct the issue when I brought it to her attention.  Very disappointing.  We will not use their services again. ,2,2022,05,14
11,Great place to stay!,"The Majestic Hotel is well located near high-end shopping and fantastic restaurants as well as must-see landmarks.  The hotel itself is beautiful, smells wonderful, and very clean.  The staff is respectful, friendly, and helpful.  The hotel’s amenities made the stay even better!  I would highly recommend their lobby bar, terrace bar, and spa.",5,2022,05,13
11,Lara's Review,"I had a good hospitality. The breakfast and every other facility was good. Breakfast could have had beagles bread and more other types of it. The location of the hotel gave me and my friend a chance to easily discover Barcelona. All in all, it was good! ",5,2022,05,10
11,Post cruise stay,"Hotel clearly understaffed - there were always queues at reception, there was no room in the bar on the Saturday night, servicing of our room was hit and miss.
Great location, however, and good food and beverage selections.",3,2022,05,07
11,Hotel with a great location,The room was very nice.  The price included a wonderful breakfast.  Location was terrific.  Bar restaurant was expensive and the food was not good.  Great rooftop bar/restaurant with a wonderful view of the city,4,2022,05,06
11,Highly recommend,"We really enjoyed the Magestic! We arrived early from a trans-Atlantic flight and our room wasn’t ready but they upgraded us to a room that was ready, the service was fantastic and the room was lovely. Excellent location. We also enjoyed the rooftop bar and nightly piano music downstairs. 
Would definitely stay at the Magestic again.",5,2022,05,05
11,Excellent stay,"We loved every minute of staying at the Majestic. Great location, lovely hotel and rooms. Staff were amazing, very friendly and helpful at all times and from all staff. We love the roof top terrace and also had a delicious meal in the restaurant.",5,2022,05,05
11,Superb,"I can't say enough about our stay and the perfect location of the hotel as we walked everywhere. Sofia checked us in upon our arrival, and we had the pleasure of seeing her several times throughout our stay and she always said hi and chatted with us- she made the stay truly memorable! In addition to that, our room was lovely- great sized, the terrace of our room was beautiful and all of the amenities in the room including the housekeeping service were impeccable. We loved the rooftop bar, enjoyed appetizers and drinks there on several occasions . Looking forward to our next stay with you!",5,2022,05,03
11,Memory of Barcelona,"Location, Breakfast and attitude of some of stuffs are excellent.
But it took so long time (15mins) for check in and check out. And they didn't take any care of the visitors who were waiting for check in and check out.",4,2022,05,03
11,"A high class hotel, professionally run","Lovely room. Nicely decorated and a comfortable bed. On the whole, a superb hotel and the receptionist by the of Richard was extremely friendly , professional and knowledgeable.
Great location at the luxurious street of Barcelona. Will definitely stay there again.",4,2022,04,30

11,Great visit!,"All staff was beyond professional from their uniforms, service, and knowledge. Welcomed in quickly and efficiently! Great food options and delightful lobby bar with food service. We were able to be tested for Covid prior to leaving and at the hotel!",5,2022,04,27
11,Gorgeous place,"Everything just couldn't be better. If you appreciate classic elegance and delicious food, book and don't look back. Friendly staff, fabulous view from the rooftop bar and delicious food. Beds and sheets ultra comfortable and the bathtubs are bliss.",5,2022,04,26
11,Very nice,"Nice service, comfortable mattress, good hospitality, clean environment, and good room design.
Although it was early morning, they treated well with kind and get me a cab.
Especially, the quality of mattress and bed made a really good sleep.",5,2022,04,25
11,classic great hotel,"great hotel, very helpful staff, best breakfast anywhere. have stayed two times and always pleased with staff, food and accommodations. roof top bar is best views in city, classic hotel that we have sent family and friends too and they are always pleased.",5,2022,04,22
11,Good location but that’s it.,"We had to queue for about 45 mins to just check in. When we did, our room wasn’t ready. They said it would be ready by 3. Come 4pm it was still not ready. When it eventually was, your front of house handed me my suitcase and pram (even though she could see I had a baby) and didn’t offer anyone to help with my luggage so I had to carry it all myself. Not the service I expect in a 5 star hotel or a LHW.

Other issues:
No space on the terrace
The pool is far too small
Had to ask for the same beer 3 times - service too slow
Your room service tried to charge me 13 euros for a glass of milk for my BABY.

The only thing your hotel has going for it is the location - but I would probably get better service in a 4 star in the same location for a much lower price. ",2,2022,04,21
11,Amazing Experience,"Great hotel, wonderful staff, can’t do enough to help. Breakfast is superb and the SOLC onsite restaurant does amazing seasonal food. Bedroom is very nice and bathroom. Great location, in exclusive area, walking distance to most things including La Rambla. Will be coming back again, soon.",5,2022,04,19
11,Fabulous stay at Hotel Majestic,"Absolutely fantastic stay at the Hotel Majestic in central Barcelona.  The location was absolutely perfect and made Barcelona totally accessible.  The room (Majestic Suite) was fantastic with very comfy bed and pillows and a large amount of room which was great for our family of 4.  It also had balconies to allow us to see and hear the city as well as overlook one of Gaudi’s buildings.  The staff at the hotel were superb and always available to assist from the initial check-in, the front desk team, the concierge, the breakfast teams, the house keeping staff and the roof top bar team and anything we asked was always accommodated.  I would highly recommend a stay at this fantastic hotel in Barcelona and definitely a visit to the rooftop bar!  Thanks Hotel Majestic for making our stay in Barcelona so brilliant!",5,2022,04,18
11,Trip to Barcelona,"The hotel is highly recommendable. Central location, easy to get from Barcelona central station.  The staff is professional and always helps with any query. Check-in and check-out process was made smooth and enjoyable.",4,2022,04,18
11,Family trip with 8 and 4 year old,"Cannot rate the hotel high enough. Booked junior suite for 5nights travelling with my husband and two children 8 and 4 year old. As it was my husbands birthday they upgraded us to a passieg de Gracia view. Room was immaculate and perfect for a family trip. Views from balconies were beautiful! 

We arrived late in the evening and the night reception staff made us feel immediately welcome and relaxed, giving the children colouring sets. Check in and out was super quick with no hassle. 

Breakfast was delicious, wide range available, really fresh and plenty of coffee!! 

We ate on the rooftop bar on one occasion and again for drinks one evening, views are incredible and service from staff was excellent. Really lovely atmosphere. 

Would definitely recommend hotel for quality , cleanliness, location and for being family friendly, it was perfect base for exploring the city! We can’t wait to come back some day!",5,2022,04,13
11,Incredibly slow service,Check-in and check-out took too long. I couldn't believe the staff is working so slow. I was not expecting that from a 5* hotel. However the hotel has really a nice location and our room was spacious and comfortable.,2,2022,04,12
11,Customer service is non-existent ,"I would give this hotel 0 stars if it were possible. I have been dealing for more than 2 weeks with a problem with a reservation at the hotel. I contacted the hotel 6 days before our scheduled arrival because my husband needed dental surgery and we couldn't go to Barcelona. Told to contact hotels.com since the reservation was made through them. The company was told to send an email to the hotel about whether you would cooperate in giving me at least a partial refund considering the circumstances. They sent it and never received a response. I contacted hotels.com again the day before we were to arrive. They sent another email to the hotel. That was a week ago, and again no response. If you don't want to refund any money, the hotel could have the courtesy to say ""no"" instead of ignoring us. This certainly doesn't seem like the type of customer service you would expect from a 5-star hotel.",1,2022,04,12
11,Wonderful luxury stay,"I lived in Barcelona in 2020 and came back with my family. We stayed at Hotel Majestic, as I remembered waking by it when I lived here thinking it was a beautiful hotel. There are 4 of us so we booked an apartment which are located right across the street from the hotel. It is beautiful, well appointed and spacious. Don’t let some of the older photos be misleading- some of the furnishings have been updated and everything is up to 5 star quality. I have been to several 5 star properties across the world and this one definitely meets the standards. The staff is extremely helpful and kind. They helped us with our bags and made check in easy. The apartment has 2 nice balconies overlooking Passeig de Gràcia, a huge living room, kitchen, and 2 bathrooms. One room has a king size bed and the other has 2 singles. Perfect location, excellent service, rooftop bar, restaurant, and luxury accommodations. Perfect place to stay in Barcelona. My only critiques would be no robes/ slippers in the bathrooms, and the master shower does not have as many water functions as the second bathroom. The second bathroom is also missing shower amenity  products. I know these are small things but a hotel of this category should have all the tiny details down. But it still deserves the 5 stars, as no hotel is perfect. Thank you majestic! We hope to return.",5,2022,04,11
11,Impeccable service,"Overall this is an excellent hotel with a great location and old world charm.  Our room, albeit small, was clean and comfortable.  Although the “city view” was minimal, we didn’t care because it was made available for a very early check-in.  What makes this hotel stand out, however, is its staff.  Everyone was always ready, willing and able to help – and with efficiency and a smile.  Check-in and out – no problem.  Service at the restaurant for breakfast, lobby bar and rooftop terrace – all impeccable.  The included breakfast was ample and had something for everyone.  Required pre-departure covid testing arranged easily and punctually.  The only glitch (minor) was pre-arrival email communications; either we got no response or three delayed responses all at once.  This was our second stay at the Majestic and there is no doubt that we will stay there again should we ever return to Barcelona.",5,2022,04,09
11,Excellent location. Outstanding service.,"Perfect location. Well appointed, clean and tranquil rooms. Pleasant views of treetops and and Passeig  de Gràcia. 
Excellent breakfast. Outstanding service from staff in all areas who went to lengths to accommodate requests, including (unprompted) specially ordering in breakfast bread for my child who has allergies. Impressive service all round. Delicious room service food. I look forward to returning. ",5,2022,04,04
11,Above and beyond!,"This was such a great place - the staff was so friendly and helpful upon checkin. We were late to a tapas tour and the amount do hustle they exuded was truly impressive. And everyone was so kind to our kiddos. There weren’t many kids on property, so the staff went out of their way to make ours feel welcome - teddy bears on checkin, always saying hi and greeting them. The location was fantastic. As a parent traveling overseas, we always look for a good lobby bar for my husband and I to share a nightcap while the kids go to bed and this one has a great one! And the peanuts they give you are so very delicious. Can’t wait to come back! ",5,2022,04,04
11,First trip to spain,I stayed here at the recommendation of my hunt outfitter and tour guide it is a great hotel your menu and food  Leaves much to be desired it is not good at all you need a  larger menu and perhaps a new chef! Staff try’s very hard to communicate and be  Helpful breakfast is very good I would stay here agin or recommend it to others ,5,2022,03,31

11,Fabulous and Unique,The hotel was amazing and so unique. Breakfast was fabulous and the staff was so wonderful. My room was so grand and comfortable and the room was cleaned so well every night. I loved the uniques of the design and decor and hope to return when I come back to Barcelona. ,5,2022,03,28
11,Forgot my Jacket -- just no use for Dishonesty,"NEVER GOT it back after a couple of hours after check out.
I usually do not hang things in closets but I did...
Called back. never saw it nothing sad. I am in Barca numerous times in my trip. will not be back at this hotel.
Ultimately my fault but still I thought there are honest people around.
I wait 5 days to post incase I received a call but nothing.

11,Ammar,"Ver Small rooms 
They ask you 100 euro/day as guarantee knowing that their is no minibar on the room and knowing that you can not have access to breakfast if you are not on the list, this why I don’t understand why 100 euro/day ?? ",3,2022,03,27
11,The best hotel in Barcelona!,"Look no further, Majestic is the best hotel in Barcelona. Service, food, rooms, amenities, everything is outstanding. Can't wait to come back to this beautiful place to stay there for longer, absolutely amazing!",5,2022,03,24
11,The best place to stay in Barcelona,of room is impeccable and the staff are friendly and helpful. The buffet breakfast is one of the best I have ever had at a hotel. This time I stayed in the apartment opposite the hotel which has a decently equpped kitchen and is ideal for longer stays or for families with smaller children. I can highly recommend this hotel to visitors to Barcelona,5,2022,03,23
11,Next level hospitality and unbeatable location,Second time I have stayed here firstly for work and then for holiday. On both occasions the staff make this place great. Exceptionally well run and no request is too onerous. Front desk Staff are a fount of knowledge and will help you plan a fantastic stay. They went above and beyond to arrange spa treatments etc in light of renovation and COVID constraints. The breakfast is amazing and deserves the award for best breakfast in Europe (recommend trying the baked apples and the tablet of honey comb) thank you,5,2022,03,17
11,Great location and great service,"The hotel is in a good location, convenient for shopping and tourist visits, the overall hardware condition of the hotel is also very good, the service staff are very good, give people the feeling of staying at home.",5,2022,03,15

11,Beautiful hotel in central location!,"Excellent location with lots of good Spanish restaurants around within walkable distance. Some of Gaudi’s buildings are on the same road. It’s a treat for those who are into shopping with high end shops on the same street.
Staff were friendly and very helpful and would definitely go back to the same hotel during our next visit.",5,2022,02,26
11,Super hotel in every way!,"Beginning to end, from the VERY helpful and kind front desk, to the funny porter assisting  with heavy luggage, to the turndown service woman offering a few extras to the rooftop bar with AMAZING views.  And the room, a Jr Suite, was sensational in all the ways you want and hope it to be: incredible bed and shower, great views, stone cold quiet even facing a busy street. And the breakfast buffet wa snot only varied and delicious, but the service staff was a complete delight, every day!",5,2022,02,25
11,"One of the best in Barcelona , outstanding staff","Location, staff and the terrace are absolute highlights .Little details make a great difference susch as the staff charging my care every evening even without asking.  Improvements can be done re the breakfast experience that is not consistent . Also restaurant SOLC was not entirely up to my expectations with uneven quality of the dishes . ",5,2022,02,25
11,Fantastic Hotel,This is my second stay at the Majestic and it just keeps getting better.  I love this hotel. Service is impeccable.  Whenever I had a request someone was at my door within minutes. The rooms were beautiful.  Luxurious sheets and pillows and huge bath towels which were plentiful in the rooms.  This is such a well run property.  Best hotel in Barcelona⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,5,2022,02,24
11,Most comfort in barcelona,The best of the best in Barcelona. Very clean. Organized. Friendly staff. Very fast service. I also love how they are attentive to middle-easterns’ needs like bidet in the toilets! Haha i had to drop that note cause as it is so important to me.,5,2022,02,21

11,Friendly staff make this hotel,"A lovely hotel in the heart of the high-end shopping district. The hotel truly shines because of it staff. I arrived on an extremely early flight from Asia, and Sr. Paco at reception made sure that despite high occupancy was able to get me a room for early check in. His help, along with the friendliness of everyone from the Doormen to the Bellman and the concierge, made my (short) stay wonderful. 

The main areas of the hotel are inviting and relaxing (the piano bar is pleasant), and The rooms are nice, but could use a little updating. The bathroom of the junior suite is amazing with what might be the best water pressure I have ever seen. 

A real downside to the Majestic Hotel and Spa is that the spa portion (including the sauna) is currently closed for renovation and won’t be open until spring 2022. That was one of the main reasons I picked this hotel in winter, so that was disappointing.",5,2022,02,13
11,Irina Melnik,"Amazing hotel, amazing service, amazing everything! When in Barcelona and the rooms are available we always stay only in Majestic - is like second home where we are always happy to be back! The best location ever - everything is by the hand. Highly recommended",5,2022,02,03
11,Best Hotel Ever!,"Definitely the hotel is a must when you come to Barcelona. The service and room was perfect. Breakfast was really good (everything for everyone). The bellman was very helpful since the receiving until departure. The location is walking distance from cathedral of Barcelona, Gotic Area  and Casa Bartlo. We love everything! Also close to all high end brand (Gucci, Louis Vuitton, ect).. we love pur 5 star stay.",5,2022,01,20
11,Amazing location 👌🏻,"Amazing location👌🏻
Very nice room
Good service 
Excellent breakfast buffet 
The only thing I didn’t like in the hotel is the concierge. He was the worst concierge I’ve ever deal with and he wasn’t helpful at all
If ill be back to Barcelona ill stay there again but ill never ask the concierge any thing",5,2022,01,15
11,Stopped by for drinks by the pool,"Nice hotel which is conveniently located on the main shopping street and was just up the road from the Mandarin Oriental where I was staying.

I had drinks with friends in the afternoon by the pool and ended up staying there until the evening. No pressure to leave, great service. Would recommend.",5,2022,01,09
11,Perfecto,Everything was perfect! Room was ready upon arrival. Food was excellent especially the breakfast. Comfortable room and bathroom.  I have family coming next month and I recommended the Majestic to all of them.,5,2022,01,06
11,It's where we stay in Barcelona,"We chose this hotel on our first visit to Barcelona back in 2015. It was very impressive in every way-decor, ambience, cleanliness, comfort and service. Luxurious? Yes indeed.

So it made perfect sense to book it again for our return in November 2021. There is no need for us to look for another hotel in Barcelona! 

What's to like?

The location on Passeig de Gracia within two blocks of Gaudi's La Pedrera and Casa Battlo. Close to La Rambla and bus stops for Bus Turistic HOHO.

The welcoming and helpful multi-lingual reception staff. Noniello gets a special mention for her efficiency.

The spacious and comfortable rooms with included wi-fi and  well-appointed bathrooms with copious fluffy towels, magnifying mirrors etc.

The views onto Passeig de Gracia and small balconies to enjoy them from

The rooftop bar and pool- unfortunately it had closed for the Winter season on October 31 just a few days prior to our arrival

The staff, all of whom represent the hotel so well. A special mention to Raphael, a very helpful bellman.

The lobby bar, so comfortable and a great room to relax in. Bar food including tapas is available. Service impeccable and at times a fine pianist plays there.

The fantastic buffet breakfast which we tried for the first time. Served in a beautiful room on the first floor. Not included in your room rate but worth the spend.

Comfort and 5 Star luxury which we only had two days to enjoy this trip but I foresee a week in Barcelona in our future and you know where we will be staying...",5,2022,01,04
11,A Christmas Stay in Barcelona,"We decided to stay in Barcelona with my family to celebrate Chrismas. We choose the Majestic for its great location and his iconic reputation. Our stay was superb from a to z, the staff was very kind and helpful, the restaurant and breakfast were more than perfect. We will be back for sure !! Thank you !",5,2022,01,03
11,Worn out apartments,"Good location and staff were friendly and helpful! The apartment were in a terrible state, with worn out chairs in the living room and a tacky sofa!
Good kitchen and laundry with comfortable beds. Will cost you €50 for a cleaner to clean the room, an expense that was not mentioned when I booked the apartment.",3,2021,12,31
11,Great historical hotel,"Stayed for one night. Booked a room via Leading Hotels of the World. Get a spacious room with a balcony and a city view. Hotel kindly provide me with complimentary bottle of wine and cookies. Since the main hotel restaurant Solc did not work during my stay, I had a dinner at lobby bar. In the morning I as a member of LHW had a complimentary breakfast. Before my departure to airport hotel staff kindly called a taxi for me.
I was pleased to stay at Majestic.",5,2021,12,27
11,Fabulous Hotel,"I was very lucky to stay at this hotel in a suite of rooms the beds are sumptuous, beautiful bathroom, real coffee machine. The hotel staff are friendly helpful one complaint from me the restaurant menu could have some chicken dishes available I realise at the time of my stay we had not long come out of lock down and menus have to be shortened. Ideal position for sight seeing and shopping.",5,2021,12,27
11,A wonderful experience,A very memorable and wonderful experience. Many thanks to their Conceirge staff Ms Ariadna for her extensive and invaluable help and advice on many occasions. Ms Ariadna is a very committed & dedicated staff of Majestic Hotel and a great asset to any organisation ,4,2021,12,24
11,Wonderful stay!,"We stayed at this property with a toddler and 3 adults and all of us had a great experience. The staff at the reception, door, breakfast, housekeeping...all of them were friendly and efficient. The rooms are beautiful and very comfortable.
We would definitely return.",5,2021,12,19
11,Almost perfect!,Just the right location with very friendly staff as well as nice rooms and amenities. The hotel is generous when it comes to supplying complimentary water and bathroom supplies. Feels like home...highly recommended! ,5,2021,12,06
11,So disappointed,We really expected a nice hotel. What a disappointment. We quickly learned why the window was painted. The view is if air conditioning vents. No light. The restaurant is not open--unexpected for a 5* hotel. No tables in the bar so we left and returned later. Under average bar food. Nice piano player.,3,2021,11,23
11,Non existent service,"I have always wanted to stay in this hotel so I booked it as a birthday treat for me and my husband. I emailed the hotel after booking with some queries, waited four days and got no reply. I then messaged the hotel via their Facebook page, it wasn’t opened so I emailed again. No response. Very disappointing for such a lovely hotel and it has totally ruined the joy of anticipation",1,2021,11,23
11,Just delightful. My new favourite hotel in Barcelona (Europe?),"The hotel is beautiful. Clean, stylish, large rooms with very high quality amenities (and great sheets). The staff was extraordinarily helpful and kind. I arrived and realised I had not brought an adaptor for my laptop (rookie error). I was thinking about contacting the desk and the maid knocked. I had only been in the room for a few minutes and she was checking to see if I was happy. I mentioned the adaptor and asked about ice and literally within 10 minutes both had appeared. I would never stay anywhere else in Barcelona. It is crazily well-located as well. Can't say enough good!! And it was very, very reasonable. I am not sure if I am supposed to state what I paid, but it was about half of what I would have expected to pay.",5,2021,11,17
11,Excellent stay in central Barcelona,"A very nice hotel, with excellent staff. We arrived at 12.30 having had an early morning start from Dubai. The receptionist quickly found us an available room and gave us an immediate check-in. Much appreciated! The breakfast buffet was excellent and the burgers in the bar were amazing. A particular benefit was the very efficient valet parking which enabled us to stay in the centre of the city, without worrying about the car.",5,2021,11,09
11,Book this hotel!  No regrets! NONE!,"Six Stars!  

Honestly, the room pictures do not do the hotel justice.  The rooms are wonderfully modern, the bathrooms are modern and chic, with a convenient nightlight that pops on should you need  to get up during the night.  I found the reception staff very efficient and patient.  The concierge (Emilio?) we consulted was a saint, taking a lot of time with us.  Believe me, the hotel reception can be very busy, so I admire the staff for maintaining a professional and friendly attitude.

The breakfast (we chose a room with breakfast and airport transfer  included) was one of the best I've ever had in a hotel.  The variety and quality of the buffet amazed us.  It was hard not to overeat.

Barcelona is a walking city.  The hotel is a 20 minute walk to the Sagrada Familia and 15-20 minutes to Las Rambla, and the Gothic neighborhood.  The Majestic is located on a wide boulevard with couturier shops (Pravda, Jimmy Choo, Burbury, etc)

We have just checked out of the hotel at 5 a.m.  We had booked a room with breakfast and airport transfer.  Again, the hotel floored us by giving us a bagged breakfast “picnic.”

I’d stay again in a heartbeat.",5,2021,11,02
11,Hotel Majestic Barcelona,The hotel was first class! The service excellent. The concierge was very helpful and the staff was superb. The restaurant’s were amazing and the bars were also.

11,GREAT HOTEL! BEST LOCATION AND AMAZING SERVICE,"Fine Hotel! Great Location! Amazing Terrace and very nice and friendly employees providing an excellent service!

11,Beautiful hotel and Perfect location,"We loved our stay and wished it could have been longer. We had a fantastic room and the staff couldn't have been nicer. Great location, walkable to most sights.Parking was free at this time and hotel may not have been crowded. There was plenty of staff, and everyone was very accommodating. Would definitely stay again.
",5,2021,09,30
11,"Beautiful hotel, unfriendly check in",Concierge was rather unfriendly during check in and checkout.  Hotel itself and the rooms are very nice and location is excellent. No need for concierge to start the stay at the hotel with a negative demeanor,3,2021,09,29
11,Great city and a great hotel.,"The staff are polite, friendly and very helpful. Rooms are very comfortable and beds and the bed was huge and very comfortable. Perfectly located with lots of great shops around. Breakfast has such a large selection. Certainly would stay here again. ",5,2021,09,29
11,My home in Barcelona,"The Majestic is my go-to place in Barcelona. The breakfast is one of the best in the world with a plethora of choices for every taste and products of quality. The staff are excellently trained, very helpful and always charming. The gum is well equipped and maintained. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, in particular the bed and they have real blackout curtains for proper sleep. Lastly the location is ideal on the gorgeous Paseig de Gracia, centrally located and easy to get everywhere on foot or by public transport. 

What’s not to like?",5,2021,09,29

Location was great, close to many fine shops and eating establishments. Housekeeping were friendly and professional. great place to plan a vacation.",5,2021,09,28
11,Fabulous!,The staff was friendly and the rooftop bar/restaurant is not to be missed. The location is right in the middle of the city so it is easy to access the various parts of the city. The property is very well maintained. Staff member Noellia was a breath of fresh air with her daily engagement and bright personality. She made me feel extra welcome. Highly recommended. ,5,2021,09,28
11,Very happy 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟,"Me and three friends booked an apartment at this hotel and we loved it. Good service and clean apartment. We asked for late check-out but it wasnt possible because someone booked the aparment after us, so we actually got a new room to stay in to checkout later. Amazing, saved my day. Would definitly visit again. Thank u for our stay🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟",5,2021,09,05
11,This place is wonderful!,"This is a true 5 star hotel!! 
Service, food and accommodations are all exceptional. 
Very professional staff
I give stars.
I liked the view ....nice ..also food was delicious.
Thank you soooo much and keep on",5,2021,09,01
11,An amazing 5-star luxury experience,"We decided on this hotel, over several other options in Barcelona, mainly based on the reputation of the Majestic Group as well as the rooftop terrace with pool and restaurant. 
We were not disappointed, and hugely enjoyed our spacious suite and the great service throughout. The staff is extremely friendly, experienced, and service minded. Especially Annabelle (rooftop bar) made our experience very special - thank you!
The checkout was unfortunately very time consuming but at the end of the day a minor thing since everything else was so good!",5,2021,08,31
11,"Very serious hotel accommodation - Lots of positive, very few negative","We stayed 6 nights during august 2021
Positive :
- Luxury hotel with refinements everywhere
- Very good breakfast with very diverse choice
- Clean from reception to rooftop, bedroom was 100% clean anywhere you look around
- Site if you delight to be in luxury part of town
- Parking was included and they park your car anytime

Not so positive :
- The pool on the roof top is more a big bath and it is very annoying to be in there with people taking drinks around (and look at you like being a monkey at the zoo). Better NOT have a pool rather than a ridiculously small like that.
- No sunbathing on the roof top.
- People at reception are a bit uptight.",4,2021,08,16
11,Excellent hotel!,"Fabulous hotel at best location! Attentive service by well-trained staff. Breakfast buffet excels expectations. The only downside: Quality of food, ordered with room service. But the hotel still worth every cent and highly recommended!",5,2021,08,15
11,Check in,Very helpful and friendly check in. We arrived early tired and they got us another room right away even though our one was not ready because the previous guests had not yet checked out and the room needed to be cleaned. My wife was very happy to get another option,5,2021,08,09
11,Marvelous Majestic,"Barcelona - Thank you, Majestic Hotel. You helped me enjoy my week more than I can say. Your hospitality is overwhelming and without you, Barcelona would not have been the same. Everyone was extremely helpful and I loved everything about the hotel. Service, location, food - everything ❣️❣️❣️Thank you again.",5,2021,08,01
11,Sterling service & superb location,"Wholeheartedly recommended. It's hard to beat this location. Shopping, restaurants, and two Gaudi architectural sites--all within steps of the hotel. The staff provided a warm welcome upon our arrival and provided helpful directions throughout our stay. Our room was spacious, quiet, comfortable, and spotlessly clean.  The rooftop bar/pool is a must see simply for the view and perhaps a light lunch. Top Notch!  ",5,2021,07,18
11,Palace treatment at regular prices,"Amazing stay. Great service, nice upgrade to a suite and best location for shopping or just enjoying Barcelona.
Make sure to visit the rooftop terrace, it has a fantastic view over Barcelona and great atmosphere.
Excellent prices during the pandemic",5,2021,07,17
11,Enjoyable Stay,"Overall we enjoyed our stay here.The service in all areas of the hotel was super,from the reception,the servers at  breakfast and housekeeping!  The location is ideal for exploring Barcelona. We had coffee at the roof bar and also enjoyed a delicious lunch there too.It would have been nice to have umbrellas on the rood for shade as it was too hot to really enjoy and relax while enjoying a coffee. Room service was quick and efficient The suite we had was not 5 star quality  in my opinion, as there was a plastic plant, a large stain in the carpet and very tired  ""motel""motif"" style furniture that was not very attractive or comfortable to sit on.Would stay again if the room was a nicer one",4,2021,07,12
11,Simply great!,"Stayed at the Majestic for a short Barcelona get away. Wonderful hotel, very attentive and friendly staff, without exception! Conveniently located in the best shopping district, where all the nice shops are. Junior suite was perfect, great a/c… Spectacular rooftop terrace and a tasteful breakfast.",5,2021,07,11
11,Spectacular,"World class experience. From staff to rooms to breakfast, everything was impecable. 

We had a celebration there and part of the success was the genuin care of the hotel team.

I can not think of a better hotel or location!",5,2021,07,05
11,"Spacious, clean, and lovely","Wonderful 2 bedroom apartment across the street from the hotel. Great location, clean, tasteful, yet all hotel amenities available. 

We enjoyed our stay. It felt like an upscale home with service and cleaning.",5,2021,06,21
11,Excellent experience,I would like to express my best feelings for this perfect hotel!! Very friendly- very human and excellent behaviour!!! All the personnel from the manager to everyone was the best !!! Thank you very much for everything!!! We love ❤️ To come again very soon !!!!💯❤️❤️!! Stay safe !!!,5,2021,04,13
11,The price is reduced but you have to pay extra to clean the room,"The price is reduced but i still paid 300 euro per day, For this price I was chocked when they told me to have the room cleaned we need to book it 24h in advance and it cost 45 euros. What do do when you stay 4 days and you run out of toilet paper the 3rd day?  Nice location, nice room, nice employees but disastrous hotel polity. I will not return unless they change this ridiculous policy",2,2021,04,04
11,Nice hotel perfect situation,I only wish I would have come to this wonderful hotel in somer other situation rather than with the Covid. We still enjoyed our stay and Barcelona. I would definitely come back when everything is back to normal.,5,2021,02,14
11,One of the best hotels in Europe,"I loved this hotel! The staff was amazing, the rooms comfortable and beautifully decorated. It felt like coming home every night!
The breakfasts were phenomenal, kudos to the pastry chef for their clever take on old favorites. I look forward to returning to Barcelona and staying at this true gem of hospitality.",5,2020,10,05
11,Great Staff and Location and roof top bar,"Great room, great location.  Staff were wonderful.   Brilliant roof terrace even in February.
Room had a balcony overlooking the main road but still was very quiet, breakfast was included and you could spend all day there",5,2020,05,21
11,Great Hotel,This Hotel is located in a safe area along the Passig de Gracia. It is a block from the Gaudi Apartments and within walking distance of Las Ramblas and not far from La Sagrada Familia. You can see the famous church from the rooftop of the hotel.,5,2020,04,23
11,Beautiful well-located hotel,"This hotel was the first of 4 different hotels we stayed in, in Barcelona, Sevilla, Granada, and Madrid.

Very friendly staff.  Mario in particular was very helpful.  We enjoyed the room, and the breakfast was topnotch.",5,2020,03,15
11,Love the ambiance,"Great hotel, fantastic rooms, super location and incredible art on the walls of the hotel. First I want to thank three people, front desk Mr Tim, professional and very friendly, Mr Edvin, so helpful and ready to serve as Mr Tim. In the bar, Geronimo, great waiter and super nice.
Room was clean and beautiful with nice art work, bathroom big and luxurious, buffet breakfast very good, fitness room had enough equipments and was clean. As I drink a lot of coffee in the morning a small negative thing was that you get only two capsules of coffee, if you want third, you have to pay. It is not the money, it is the thought as this is a luxury hotel.
Otherwise, great hotel.",5,2020,03,14
11,Wonderful - stay here if you can,"I could write an essay on how great this hotel is. We stayed for 3 nights on a last minute deal. Had a lovely room. View was lousy but room was great it was 641. Huge oval bathtub you could lay flat in. Loads of channels on the tv but don’t be fooled, almost all the english ones didn’t work at all. 
Staff extremely helpful.
Breakfast is SO worth it. We paid a few £ extra to have breakfast included. So glad we did. The choice is in incredible. My wife has a few allergies so asked for smoked salmon and avocado. They didn’t blink, no problem and it arrived fresh a couple of minutes later. No ifs or buts. Breakfast staff were excellent. 
They have a nice little spa on the top floor which you can book for up to an hour privately. It was lovely. Unfortunately neither of the two showers worked but it was still nice. 
There was only really one negative. They have a gorgeous roof terrace with some nice views. We were hoping to have a coffee up there after breakfast, get some sun and relax in peace. Problem was it didn’t open until 11. We were up there at 10.15 and asked if we could just sit out there. We didn’t need any service as we had our coffee but they wouldn’t let us until exactly 11. It’s no big deal but seemed a little daft to us.
If we come back to Barca this is going to be my first choice hotel. It’s so nice !! ",5,2020,03,12
11,A Marvelous Hotel in Barcelona,"We just loved staying at the Majestic.  Our room was spacious, the service excellent, and location perfect for walking and shopping.  The shower worked well and the free WiFi was very effective.  If we return to Barcelona again, we will definitely stay there again.  We were especially pleased with the assistance we received from Christina at the Front Desk and the concierge.  My only (small) complaint was that we were charged for the coffee pods after the first 3 days (we stayed 5 days).  Given the cost of the rooms, the pods should have been complimentary.",5,2020,03,12
11,Wonderful hotel,Great location can walk to mostly everything. This is a very old hotel which is in wonderful condition. Our room was just beautiful and the staff was even better. I would definitely recommend this hotel and if came back to this area of Barcelona  l would definitely stay here again.,5,2020,03,11
11,Perfectly located,"We went for Christmas and the Hotel was beautifully decorated. It is walking distance to nearly eveything we could think of doing like all the Gaudi things, including the city bus tour (stop is literally across the street). Will stay there again.",5,2020,03,06
11,Superb,"We (Family of four, two teen girls) stayed in the residence across the road, which has the apartments. It’s exceptional. We booked a two bed apartment, but were hit with a “Free Upgrade” when we arrived, to the two floor, four bedroom apartment which was amazing. The balcony was superb. All the staff were friendly and helpful. Location is great...surrounded by Gucci, Prada, Hugo Boss etc....we will definitely be back.",5,2020,02,19
11,Very comfortable stay ,"I travel for work, spend minimum time in the room and like things organized. Majestic met my expectations and made the stay very comfortable. Small things like slippers and water next to the bed or connected hairdryer in bathroom improved my satisfaction. ",5,2020,02,19
11,Royal treatment in Barcelona,"The hotel and service is truly majestic! The hotel is absolutely stunningly beautiful with its classic design. The lobby is of highest international standards and offers a perfect place for private meetings and rendezvous. The rooftop restaurant is lovely and a must-see spot. Last but not least, the service of Majestic is over the top! It’s professional, efficient, and extremely service oriented. We were treated like royalty and made our stay one that far exceeded expectations.",5,2020,02,03
11,Stunning,On the prettiest boulevard in Barcelona.  Amazing staff and beautifully finished rooms.  Our bed was perfect - better than our own at home.  Instead of chocolates of a night turn down a hand lotion instead.  Very nice touch.  Rooms were roomy and a good bathroom.  Shower heat was a little difficult to regulate.  The windows opened but our room facing the side street was a little noisy but our choice to have open for fresh air. Cleanliness and linen beautiful.  Breakfast was lovely and outdoor balcony stunning.  Centrally located and a short walk to Gothic Quarter and surrounded by high end shopping.  A must return location on our next adventure to Barcelona,5,2020,02,02
11,Excellent service,"This hotel is very luxurious and the service is exceptional. The front desk, bellhops, and concierge were all extremely friendly and helpful to guests. Recommendations from the concierge were excellent. The breakfast is awesome and spans multiple rooms. It is easy walking distance to the gothic quarter. I highly recommend this hotel in this price range.",5,2020,01,26
11,Fantastic!,"After a 12 hour of travel, the hotel was wonderful in having our room available for check in.  Nothing beats that type of service. The last thing I want to do is kill time waiting on a room after such a long day of travel on zero sleep. We were welcome with a nice fluffy bed and treats in the room. The employees were friendly and accommodating.  The hotel is located in a convenient location, having designer stores next door is dangerous for the wallet, though.  It was walking distance to La Sagrada and a short taxi ride to La Boqueria— close enough that we walked back.  Will stay here again! ",5,2020,01,18
11,Steel pieces in buffet breakfast! Worst communication skills ever. Concierge was helpful though.,"I had one of my worst stays in a supposedly 5 stars hotel. 
On check in, like any welcoming staff, they processed me with hospitality. However, during my first breakfast with them, I found steel pieces in their waffles! It was very disappointing but moreover it was really dangerous. It is very absurd that it was not monitored. I hope my bad experience stopped here, however upon checkout, they wanted to double charge me, and after explaining the issue with their invoice, the hotel reception staff responded rudely : “if it’s on the system you have to pay it” luckily one of his colleagues was smarter and thought with perspective that it’s stupid to be charged for two rooms when I have stayed in only one!! Again, I hoped it stopped here, however they charged my American Express in a wrong way and they did not know the refund procedure. I am yet to wait for the balance to go into my account, and I can only pray that it does! 
All in all, I will never recommend this hotel to anyone despite its nice location, however it’s not worth it at all.",1,2020,01,16
11,Location location location,"The only one thing positive about this hotel is location. People who gave this hotel more than one star, probably have nothing to compare with or they Have stakes in it.
Last year the same time, we stayed in a similar 5 star hotel just 2 blocks away and our experience was completely 360 degree the opposite . Here is some points why:
1- the room has a window looking at the wall next building. After complaining, they offered us three other rooms with the same window view. You have to open the window and stick you head out to see the sky.
2. We were given the keys at the front desk and left alone. No host took us to the room or showed us the amenities.
3. We were told that we have to buy pods for the Nespresso machine in the room.
4. House keeping did not clean the room till late afternoon.
5. The lobby closes at 10:00 pm every day. We were kicked out on one occasion.
6. There was no welcome fruit plate in the room on arrival.
Etc......
BTW, last year hotel offered exactly the opposite of what is mentioned above, in addition, they brought a piece of chocolate cake on my wife birthday. That made us feel the special personal touch.
We do not need an apology from the “management “ for the bad customer service as a response to this comment, but we want people to know what they are getting into  before they make reservation.",1,2020,01,15
11,Nice location and excellent service,"If you are in Barcelona and want to stay around passage de Garcia,  then this is the best hotel.  Location is nice, hotel is refreshed and to top all you will receive the best service ever.  We will never stay elsewhere when in town.",5,2020,01,08
11,gluten free,"the main reason we have chosen this hotel for our short stay in Barcelona was it claimed it was famous for its breakfasts which supposedly included gluten free options. however there were a few problems:
1.  Jan 04 there were no gluten free pastries at all. howevet hotel charged for beakfast as usual
2. cross contamination - i have seen guys taking gluten free pasties from the shelf with forceps contaminated with regular bread! no one pays attention for cross contamination!
3. our airline didint serve gluten free so we wanted to take away gluten free items to take them on board the plane. they told us to contact room service. the guy at room service periodically started speaking spanish which i dont know. it was also hard to explain to him what gluten free meal was all about
4. we had 2 bedrooms but they were not functional at all. there was no place to keep my overcoat for instance. hence there was a constant mess in the room -  it doesnt accomodate. 
5. my kids needed 2 separate bankets, so we asked to bring us 1 extra. during the last day of our stay we found it - they put it into the locker! in the meantime we kept asking for an exptra blanket so they gave it to us without sheets...we asked for sheets - they fetched them but took away the next day
6. room sevice took away one of the 2 keys i had from the room - i kept it right next to the entrance door to keep electricity swithced on
7. i have iphone XR  it appears it is not compatible with the hotel WIFI. it took them hoalf a day and cost me USD150 for international roaming before they had put down the unique serial number of my iphone and then they switched it on somehow>
8. the bathroom was a disfunctional as the rest of the room. the water taps are horrible - it is next to iossible to adjust normal temperature. the shower leaked and the drops were heared inside the rooms. BTW the rooms are noisy as they have poor windows which overlook de Gracia...
9. the only restaurant this hotel has doenst work for lunch. it is always closed in the daytme - so we had to eat in the bar. the bar was nice but it took forever to get what you asked for. every meal - at least 90 mins which we could have spent walking around the city. we needed gluten free so we didnt have too many options for dining around.

i wouldnt recomend staying there. for this kind of money you can easily find a more convenient and effective hotel",2,2020,01,05
11,Really bad service ,"We had a big family reunion and reserved 6 rooms at this hotel. 
The location was really great, as well as the beds! They were super comfortable. 
Now coming to the bad this.
The Spa!! Seriously!!! Thats a joke. There is no Spa!!! There is a private steam bath the size of a bathroom that you have to reserve in advance and a tiny outside pool in the middle of the terrace where there are constantly people!!! Unusable! 
The staff is just catastrophic! At the checkin there was a lady, I think Grace who was just incredibly aggressive and 0 nice! All the staff (room service, breakfast, lobby) barely spoke english and just useless! Forgot everything, mixed up orders, were super slow. 
At the lobby one afternoon, we were almost denied to sit because of some invisible waiting list!! (Hello! What is this, Jiro sushi??) there were like 5 available tables, and the girl at the lobby said they were reserved, for guests who were waiting somewhere..  where??? No one knows. Because we pretty much barged in and sat down paying no attention to the ridiculous comments the lobby girl. And guess what, we sat for 2 hours, no one came to the other 4 reserved tables??? 
The only person who was great, was a British (i believe) guy at the entrance, Partik, (i think) who was really 5 star! The rest of the staff mostly didnt speak english and didnt even try!  ",2,2020,01,03
11,Christmas 2019,"Our room was perfect with a gorgeous view of passeig de gracia. We were right in the heart of the busy city and loved every second of it! The staff was first class, super nice and always willing to help! 

If you want class with good service you won't go wrong choosing this property.",5,2020,01,03
11,Amazing hotel and fantastic service,"We stayed in the apartments across from the hotel with family. It is not cheap , but we loved the entire experience -- the view and the balcony were amazing The staff bent over backwards to provide service and the room was modern, clean and well appointed. Definitely made this trip to Barcelona special. We will be back",5,2019,12,28
11,World class ,"One of my favorite hotels anywhere in the world. 
Get a package that includes their breakfast - although that has slipped a bit since we last stayed. Service is impeccable. Some standard rooms are on the smaller side. ",5,2019,12,17
11,The most Majestic weekend!,"We were a team of 37 travelling to Barlcena for a Christmas Party. Nothing could have been too much trouble from the moment of booking through to our departure. The events team on the ground organised everything to perfection. Lucy ensured all our requirements (and we had lots!) were met and our expectations exceeded. The service and attention to detail was second to none. The catering and quality of food was superb. Very often mass catering fails to meet expectations but every course, appetisers and breakfast was delicious. Oscar and the f&b team were exceptionlly welcoming and accommodating, even when we ordered 70 Espresso Martini's!! Eva ensured we were well looked after upon our departure and we were sad to go. The quality of the hotel is 5* through and through. The rooms were very special, as was the roof top terrace which to go and sit on in December was a real treat! We sincerely hope we have the opportunity to come back one day. 
Marta, Lucy, Oscar and Eva, thank you do much from all of us!",5,2019,12,09
11,Exotic  hotel,"Majestic hotel is a marvelous and strategic location in Barcelona. The services was excellent and food was really remarkable and of  a lot of variety .  The  breakfast chef was patient and very welcoming . The concierge was very helpful and friendly especially Ardiana. Actually all hotels staff were friendly.

11,"Classic, stylish, luxury hotel","Stayed for only one night at this excellent hotel in the heart of Barcelona and would of stayed longer if not committed to a cruise.
Rooms are excellent, beautiful with all the amenities quality you would want.
The staff were excellent and the roof top bar had fantastic views, sitting there late in the evening with a glass of wine was a wonderful way to end a most enjoyable day in Barcelona 
On to breakfast- it was absolutely fabulous- what a choice of delightful quality produce and again excellent staff.
I know where I will be staying the next time I visit Barcelona ",5,2019,12,06
11,Majestic in name and service ,"Superb and majestic is all senses. Truly 5 star luxury. Not a wow lobby hotel , but a wow in service and hospitality. Rooms are big sized but lack a proper king bed. Had to make do with two queens stacked to each other. Beautiful toilets with his and hers in the executive category. My only gripe , is the temperature setting on the knobs. It would require the dexterity of a surgeon to get it right after a very hot and very cold burst ! The breakfast is one of the best we have come across in Europe. Location can’t be topped. ",5,2019,12,01
11,"Better then Excelent! Felipe, Celine, Jara and Miguel are the difference !","This hotel have the best services, breakfast and facilities in Barcelona.
But, much Better the for all the structure the hotel offer is the personal care the hotel offer.
You feel better then your home, just when you come in this hotel you will be able for understand how that is posible !",5,2019,11,30
11,Amazing 5 Star Apartment,"Incredibly spacious Apartment stayed in for several nights. Would move in. Great option for a family of four. Fantastic location. Has all of the amenities of home, full kitchen, refrigerator, wash machine and dryer, dining room and plenty of closet space.",5,2019,11,21
11,Hotel with a wow factor!,"I recently stayed here after an exhausting business conference. I enjoyed an enormous room with 2 balconies overlooking the main avenue. The upgraded room was luxurious but understated with 1.5 bathrooms, a living area and a sumptuous bedroom. 

Delightful coffee maker in the room, delicious tub for soaking, dynamic desk overlooking the balcony. Wine opener and high quality glasses in the room. Wow! This room is lovely and the service does not disappoint. Lovely touches like Devine bath products, live orchids in the room, pillows that mold to you and mattresses that embrace your body. 

It all adds up to a wonderful Barcelona experience. Come and enjoy it! ",5,2019,11,21
11,Great Location - Great Hotel,"Very friendly and helpful staff . Locate in the centre of Barcelona - walking distance to shops, restaurants, etc. The room was spacious and very comfortable (was on the 8th floor). Breakfast was excellent - huge variety including local produced food. The bed was comfortable and amenities in the room were excellent. Only 2 things stooped from getting a 5 - the shower was very difficult to get the right temperature and although there was a great coffee machine - there was no hot water or tea facilities - otherwise top hotel !!",4,2019,11,14
11,Amazing hotel,"This has got to be one of the best hotels in Barcelona. The room is spacious, luxurious, quiet and has a huge and comfortable bed. The bathroom is all glamour and marble. It's expensive of course but worth every penny.",5,2019,11,11
11,Very clean hotel and very nice staff,Hotel is in super location; the room was small but very clean- we had view of building next door 🤣.Communication problems with housekeeping -they do not speak English and we do not speak Spanish they kept giving us milk pods when we asked for coffee pods -we called and asked for coffee pods they sent room service coffee. The cost of room service is very very high-lots of places nearby for 25% cost. Made local phone calls through front desk she said no charge but they charged .5 Euro they removed charge when we told them it was said it was free. The concierge was lovely man but his hotel recommendations for Gaudiem a restaurant with cost of glass of cava 18 Euroand Fideuoa was 30 Euro ! Found another place called El Gulpo much cheaper and super tasty...The hotel staff are very attentive... super clean hotel!,4,2019,11,10
11,First class,Have just spent the most amazing weekend in a first class hotel. The staff have been amazing and the hotel is fabulous. Have been treated like a queen the whole time we have been here. The staff could not do enough for us. This hotel and its staff are first class I every way. Can not wait to come to come back. Thank majestic for a fallout stay. ,5,2019,11,09
11,Fabulous hotel located right in the heart of the city,"Our room is magnificent.  Great bed, terrific sunflower shower with great pressure.  Buffet breakfast, spa, people are really helpful and very nice.  Furnishings are excellent.    

Everything you'd want in a hotel.",5,2019,11,08
11,Like Home,"From the time of booking to when we arrive and checked-in, Pascal & Eva were most helpful and responsive - and upgraded us as the category we wanted were all sold out.  The room was spacious, well furnished, and had that ""homely"" feel even though it was a hotel.  The beds were comfortable and even though our room faced the main road and we were on the lower floor - it was not noisy or disturbing at all.
The buffet breakfast offerings were well selected - I could have it every day!   Stayed there in June 2018 - so this review is a bit late - but ….. 
The roof-top bar was small - but had great views of the surroundings and comfortable seats.  Night lights lit the hotel up very warmly, and as the name says ""Majestically"".  And - being the 100 year Anniversary last year - it's still a grand ole dame!",5,2019,11,06
11,Her Majesty Rules Here- Almost,"This was my third stay at the Majestic Hotel in Barcelona and quite frankly, not sure I would stay anyplace else in town. They wrote the book on customer service. From the arrangements made by Maria Rivera prior to arrival, to the consummate professional check in by Dyonne – the staff is on point and engaged. We had two rooms booked through the Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts program. The hotel upgraded us for all nine nights for both rooms. Got to know several staff members, as they took the time to get to know us and understand our needs to great detail. Mario and Ardiana at the concierge desk; Gerard, Carlo and Dyonne at the front desk; Christina in customer relations; Sara, Benjamin and Merel in the restaurant. All top-notch professionals. They were on the ball and extremely responsive. Breakfast is apparently rated the best in Europe and one experience validates that nomination over and over again.

A very interesting anecdote that demonstrates the hotel’s human and professional touch was when we saw a family walking in front of the hotel; One of the women in the group fell down and hurt herself. The bellman immediately helped her come inside the lobby of the hotel and attended to her as if the family were hotel guests. They made them all comfortable and the injured woman was attended to immediately by a group of staff members. We were on our way to an appointment, so not sure how the ordeal ended for the poor woman who was hurt, but the hotel staff and their humanity was on ample display.

The rooms while extremely elegant, are starting to show their age, so I hope the hotel pays attention to them and does not let them get too tired or dated. The spa services were the only things that I was not so impressed with. But otherwise, amazed by the sustained overall quality of the hotel and its staff!",4,2019,11,04
11,Classy Hotel in Every Way,"This beautiful, historic hotel is well located in the heart of Barcelona.  The rooms, while not large, are very well appointed and offer lovely amenities.  Beautiful robes, coffee/espresso machine and beautiful linens.  The staff is very friendly and incredibly helpful.  The bar area is comfortable and offers several dining options for a more casual meal.  The dining room has a very extensive array of breakfast items in adjacent rooms.
I didn’t have a chance to visit the spa this time, but several friends said it is lovely.  I so look forward to coming back to Barcelona to stay at the Majestic.",5,2019,11,03
11,Central Location,"Central location, short walk to shopping, and places to eat. Historic Hotel, despite age it has been tastefully upgraded. Nice city views from rooftop. Pool not very large but enough to beat the heat on rooftop with bar.",4,2019,11,02
11,Delightful hotel in central location,"Gorgeous hotel with excellent amenities. The gym is well equipped and also provides facilities for showering after a work out.  The spa had a good steam room and dry sauna with an experience shower. This is free for guests to use but booking essential as you will have sole use of that area once in there. They provide towels,robes,slippers and toiletries plus a lovely jug of much needed iced water! A great experience. The breakfast buffet is outstanding and the range of foods plus beautiful presentation is truly enjoyable, accommodating all tastes.  We just couldn’t do it all justice!! My only negative is unfortunately the beds. The mattress was quite uncomfortable and dipped in the middle even though it had a mattress topper on it. I am used to extremely comfortable hotel beds and this did not match the high standards elsewhere in the hotel. Hence my 4 star rating as I suffered with back ache every night unfortunately as a result of the mattress   
Otherwise a fantastic hotel and lovely staff.",4,2019,11,02
11,Great hotel in Great location,"Stayed for 4 nights and the location of the hotel was perfect. Demonstrations took place when we were in Barcelona but didn’t effect us at all.
Hotel is centrally locates and we could walk to all the sites we wished to visit.
Our room was on the small side but it was comfortable and had an excellent bathroom so didn’t complain.
Breakfast was excellent. All types of food generally well prepared. Only dislike was the apple juice made from concentrate. Cheap and nasty. 
We had dinner one night in the restaurant and the food and service were great.
Staff excellent and roof bar a real treat.
Happily stay again.
",5,2019,11,01
11,Service,"Better than good hotel!  Location is great, rooftop bar is wonderful, food is expensive. 
Having flown in from the US we booked room for two nights so that we could check in at 9:00AM. We were able to check in right away but didn’t get the room we requested.  While expensive I thought they would at least give us free breakfast the next morning but didn’t. Location was good but with limited time in Barcelona (boarding cruise ship the next day) the walk to many sites was impossible. Whether you stay at the hotel or not, you must visit the rooftop bar ",4,2019,10,31
11,Beautiful hotel in great location but worst view from a hotel room,"We stayed at this hotel for one night as part of a cruise package. We are members of LHW, however, since we booked through the cruise line, we were not able to take advantage of any of the perks of membership. The hotel was lovely with excellent service and an outstanding buffet breakfast. The concierge recommended a wonderful restaurant for dinner and was very helpful. The location is perfect with easy access to shops, Gaudi’s homes, Las Ramblas, etc. We had a drink on the rooftop bar which was beautiful and romantic. The room was nice although a little tight on space walking apby the bed. The only downside was that it was the worst view we have ever had in a hotel. We literally looked on to a small area with ugly pipes and walls. I think they would have been better off just closing up the window. We were only there for one night but were surprised to see this view. That is the only negative among many positive things about the hotel.",4,2019,10,31
11,The most historical hotel in Passeig de Gràcia ,"Luxury hotel, strategic location to all the historical sites.  Train and metro stations just 2 minutes walk away. The whole hotel smells of the Atelier fragrance and I just loved their award winning breakfast spread. ",5,2019,10,29
11,Best Hotel,"We loved our stay at the beautiful classic hotel. Our room was very comfortable and well lit. The staff could not have been more accommodating and the roof top lounge is not to miss for the food, the delicious drinks, and the views of Barcelona at night. L’Eixmple is a wonderful neighborhood to explore for the architecture, restaurants and shopping and The Majestic is in walking distance to all of it.",5,2019,10,18
11,"Beautiful hotel, friendly staff. I will definitely return. ","I was visiting Barcelona on a business trip and was lucky enough to stay at the Majestic hotel. It is a beautiful place to stay and my room (240) was fantastic. 

Although there were riots in Barcelona during our visit and some of them occurred outside the hotel due to its fantastic location in the centre of the city, the staff were amazing and kept us safe throughout our time at the Majestic. 

I look forward to returning in future. It was certainly a very memorable trip. 

",5,2019,10,16
11,Great location,"We stayed here as part of our tour. We had a spacious room on the first floor facing onto the shops (road noise was quite noticeable at times but thankfully it quietened down when we wanted to sleep). The room was well equipped and very comfortable. The only thing that would have been handy was USB points in the room for charging phones. 
The view from the rooftop bar is stunning as this hotel is so well located right in the heart of everything. 
I loved the breakfast, so many choices of sweet, savoury and hot food. It was impossible to just have one plateful!
",4,2019,10,13
11,"Great location, great service","I arrived very early but the gentleman who attended to my check in was able to get me a room ahead of time, very warm welcome and a great first impression. I had a deluxe room on the 2nd floor, large comfortable room but with a view of a wall ! They were full so there was no possibility to move. Breakfast is served in a large salon with different zones for 'Sweet' 'Salty' & 'Hot' ... it was quite confusing, probably a better idea on paper. However, great selection of everything you would want, well presented. 
I also had a Spa treatment with a very good therapist, first rate facial.
Low point - Our room wasn't made up and at 6pm we were still trying to get our room serviced .. it was an oversight but it's a hefty room rate so unimpressed with housekeeping. 
Great location, fantastic shopping with leading luxury brands on your doorstep. Spoilt for choice for restaurants and cafes  within walking distance to the hotel.",4,2019,10,11
11,Gorgeous hotel with the best-in-class service!,"I stayed at the Majestic Hotel & Spa Barcelona in September 2019 for five days for a business meeting, and it was a gorgeous place to call home!  My room was spacious, beautiful and luxurious in every way - the bed was so comfortable, I slept like a baby, and the rain shower and bath products left me feeling refreshed every morning.  My room also had a lovey balcony that I enjoyed every day.  This hotel also has a stunning rooftop bar, and I went there with my colleagues every night - the sunset view is amazing!  The breakfast, which is included, offered everything you could possible want - fresh fruits, pastries, hot food, tradition Spanish salads and appetizers, and a made-to-order egg and omelette station.  My colleagues and I looked forward to it every morning!  But, what really impressed me with this hotel was their impeccable service.  After an overnight flight from NY, I arrived at the hotel around 11am, several hours before check-in.  I was feeling sick, and just wanted to rest, and even though the hotel was at full capacity, they were able to quickly prepare a room for me and check me in so I could rest and recover.  This kind of accommodation and care is what sets great hotels apart.  They made the extra effort to take care of me, and I really appreciated that.  Although it was a business trip, I enjoyed every minute of my stay, and I will definitely be back! Thank you, Majestic Hotel!",5,2019,10,11
11,Expensive View,"50 Euros for a pitcher of Sangria is excessive , great views and good service can demand a premium for sure but I think the price for a pitcher of wine mixed with fruit juice at this rooftop bar is over the top.",2,2019,09,27
11,Fantastic ending for a wonderful trip!!,"We stayed at Majestic on our last night of an 18 day trip and loved every single aspect of it.  Location, staff, room, rooftop bar, breakfast, lobby level bar......all superb.  Will definitely stay here on our next trip to Barcelona and highly recommend.  Wish we could have stayed longer!!",5,2019,09,22
11,GREAT location,"just across the street from Casa Batlo, and a short walk to Casa Mila.
the hotel is lovely and friendly
the rooftop dining is a must you can see Sagrada Familia in the distance. 
reasonable walk to the gothic area and the Picasso museum.
the desk was very helpful in finding a place for an early dinner",5,2019,09,20
11,outstanding hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"I spent quite a bit of time researching hotels in Barcelona and came across the Majestic while doing a search through the American Express platinum program. This hotel shows up under their top tier (Fine hotels and resorts) with plenty of benefits if you use your AMEX card.  The price was reasonable; the location was perfect (within a 15 minute walking distance of nearly everything); the neighborhood is safe at all hours and filled with restaurants and cafes; the room was large; the bed was among the best at any hotel I've ever stayed at (we're going to buy the sheets they used on the bed because they were so comfortable); large bathroom; air conditioning was completely silent; and breakfast was included and it was excellent. The people working there were friendly and helpful -- highly professional staff.  We didn't get a chance to try the spa, but apparently the hotel is known for having a good one. This hotel gets my highest rating and strongest recommendation; and if we go back to Barcelona, we'll definitely be staying there again.",5,2019,09,17
11,Babymoon Success!!,"WOW! This hotel exceeded all expectations that my wife and I had during our babymoon.  The location is great, the rooms are wonderful and the breakfast is amazing! We still talk about how good the breakfast was at the Majestic.  My wife and I stayed at the Majestic recently for 4 nights for our babymoon and we had the best time. The staff is absolutely amazing and accommodating (Thank you for the excellent beach and dinner recommendations).  We were upgraded upon check-in to an amazing room overlooking the Passeig De Gracia and are looking forward to coming back with our little one. Thank you for the amazing service and hospitality!",5,2019,09,16
11,The rooftop!,"Beautiful hotel, great service, the rooms are spacious and well appointed. They have a rooftop bar with an incredible view and was a fabulous spot to watch the sunset. They also have an amazing breakfast buffet, I read somewhere that it was voted the best hotel breakfast in Spain and I can see why. There were so many choices and everything was great. Also a wonderful location.",5,2019,09,14
11,"Majestic, Just Like the Name","Fifth trip to Barcelona and finally stayed here. From check-in to check-out everything was perfect. We were given a room on the corner as requested. Beautiful room. Beautiful interiors throughout the hotel. Great view, surpassed only by the view from the 10th floor terrace. Staff is very good, but some of the ""kids"" need a bit of polish. Perfect location on Passeig de Gracia which is the start of the shopping area and a few minutes fron the north end of La Rambla. We rarely eat in hotel dining rooms and this trip was no exception so I cannot comment on the food. I stay in hotels about 46 weeks a year and the Majestic ranks as one of the best. Can't wait to go back to Barcelona and stay there again.",5,2019,09,13

11,Summer vacation,"We loved the hotel and its location. it is beautiful and the staff was amazing, everyone made us feel welcome and everyone had a smile and was willing to help in any way. The breakfast was very good with a great selection. It has a very nice bar next to the lobby and they also have a roof top terrace which opens at night. with a beautiful view and you can also order food and drink. The hotel is located on Passeig de Gracia on which you can find so many stores if you are looking to do shopping, but also close to a lot of attractions. Not to far from the Sagrada Familia, La Pedrera , Casa Batllo and many others. I was extremely happy with my selection of hotel. If you can get a room with a view of the main road with a balcony you have it made.",5,2019,09,05
11,Fantástico ,"Excelent hotel located in the heart of Barcelona with a fantastic service and smell!!!!
It’s not our first time in this hotel and it remains a must in Barcelona!
However I have some repairs about the breakfast (far away from the hotel’s standard and with employees not so friendly as those from the reception!). Some rooms have no view (literally a wall 2 m away). The price is very high for the quality! You pay the location.
Even so it will remain our hotel in Barcelona!",5,2019,09,04
11,Business trip,"Its a good hotel. It has perfect location. But their food could be better. 
Breakfast is very good it include alot of items but dinner and lunch is not so good. Could be better.

across the street is a bonus!  The restaurant, service, and rooms are the best.  I discovered
this remarkable hotel many years ago...and it is MY go to hotel in Barcelona.",5,2019,09,03
11,Everything you need!,"From the moment we pulled up to the Hotel, every employee we ran into , bent over  backwards to make sure everything was up to snuff.
We checked in at 1030 in the morning expecting to have to store our luggage and wait for a room.  Miraculously , they found us a room which was very clean, well furnished and layed out, albeit on the small side.  For the entire one night stay, we felt like the management was interested in us personally. Everyone was friendly and sported smiles all around.  The roof bar and restaurant was another surprise. The view, service , food and drink were all great.
I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Barcelona.
I left out the location, which is perfect for anyone who just wants to walk around.  All in all a super stay in a super establishment",5,2019,09,03

11,Hotel refused to refund my booking deposit due to British Airways' Pilot Strike,"Based on the reply from my Travel Agent, the hotel refused to refund one night of my paid accommodation as I need to check in one day later due to the BA's pilots strike.

This is due to unforeseen situation and is a force majeure, but the hotel management refused to refund one night of my upcoming stay at this hotel.  

I hope the hotel management can reconsider your decision on this refund matter.",3,2019,08,30
11,Very helpful Guest Relations Staff,"Ignasi Puig at the Majestic Hotel was very helpful. We were trying to secure Hop on and off Bus tickets and Ignasi offered to secure our tickets for us which was unexpected because we were not even staying at the hotel at that point! We walked in because we were staying across the street and simply needed a city map. He was very kind and generous. The hotel looks amazing and based on the service, we will definitely consider it for the future. Gracias Ignasi!",5,2019,08,23
11,Majestic but with some room for improvement,"I was traveling with my wife and two young children and opted to stay in a Majestic suite - a large suite, with a living room and sofa bed, and second half bathroom.  The package I booked included breakfast and luxury transfers from the airport.  

We were greeted at the airport and transported safely and swiftly in a nice Mercedes Viano van.  The greeting experience at the hotel was excellent - everything from our baggage collection and delivery to our room by the porter to how the front desk person led us straight to our room and conducted check in there. We had arrived at 7am on an international flight from NY and were able to check in early. We were very happy with the quality and spaciousness of our room. 

The breakfast buffet was good - however depending on timing, lines for the eggs line (omelettes etc.) could be quite long.  It was generally quite rapid or immediate to be seated. The service in the restaurant could be hit or miss depending on where you sat.

My wife booked tickets for several items like Sagrada Familia and Park Guell via the concierge. There was a mix up on the dates which was partly our fault but was still frustrating. When she raised the issue with the front desk, she was not treated properly. Recognizing the issue, the hotel manager Roman went out of his way to correct the situation. He organized a private driver to take us on a tour back to Park Guell and Sagrada Familia the next day.",4,2019,08,20
11,"Great location, great staff, tiny rooms!","The staff gets an A+ as does the location and the breakfasts, the amazing showers could be the best in the world!!  The spa is mediocre and the rooms are TINY!  This is our second time staying there and we would return!",4,2019,08,19
11,Wonderful ,We were here for four days with our family of eight in four rooms. Everything was perfect. The rooms were clean and lovely. The restaurant very good and the rooftop bar/pool was fun. The service was terrific and the views were gorgeous. We all ended our evenings at the rooftop bar. What a wonderful way to end the day. So beautiful!,5,2019,08,18
11,Poor checkin. Otherwise fine,Checking in took forever (over half an hour). We pre-booked a crib and that took 3 hours to come - even with checking in on it multiple times. The place was great once we were settled in - but a very rough start.,3,2019,08,18
11,Excellent short stay at The Majestic,"Spent a couple of days at the Majestic with my partner and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. All the staff, from the check in desk to the bars and restaurants were warm and helpful. 

Booked a junior suite, which was on the 8th floor. Decent size room with a view over the city towards the sea. 

Loved the roof top bar, which has amazing views of the city.

Location is perfect for all tourist attractions and good restaurants.

Would stay again.",5,2019,08,16
11,Magnificent location,"It was the level of opulence and location that drove us to this hotel. The staff showed high levels of professionalism upon arrival, the Door, and departure. The staff that checked us in were remarkable. The Staff remembered our name through our visit and provided recommendations to dinning within Barcelona and Madrid, our next destination. The rooms are quiet and common areas are inclusive. Admire the signature scent of the hotel. The pool and rooftop bar area is relatively small given it’s beauty. The breakfast served by the hotel should meet any dietary expectations. Plenty of great shopping, dining, and tourism near to this hotel. ",4,2019,08,15
11,Great Hotel! Great Staff! Great Location!,"This is a beautiful hotel and I definitely recommend it! The rooms are beautiful and the beds are very comfortable. Great bathroom too! They have an amazing breakfast buffet. What I liked the most is the friendly and helpful staff at the front desk and everyone speaks English! I mostly spoke to Elvira and Lucia and they were so kind and helpful They were always willing to give me directions or answer any questions. The hotel is in a great location in the midst of all the designer shops (Chanel, Gucci, Prada, etc). There is a metro station close by.  It also has a beautiful rooftop bar that we really enjoyed. I definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2019,08,12
11,We Loved Our Stay,"We had a wonderful visit to Barcelona this summer and this hotel was a big part of why. The rooms are large and beautiful, clean and comfortable. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The hotel is beautiful and has many amenities. Breakfast has a lot of options and the room is lovely. The hotel is located in a great spot just a short walk from Las Ramblas and from two Gaudi houses. Our favorite feature is the rooftop bar. We ate dinner there one night and it was good, and we visited every other night too! Great views and great wait staff.",5,2019,08,10
11,Beautiful hotel in center of city,"Stayed here after a cruise and couldn’t be more delighted . Our travel agent loves the hotels that are part of the leading hotels organization. Everything is top notch . From check in to departure . We had an early check in and we were upgraded to a suite . Had everything . Located on the Main Street in the city . Can walk to everything . Didn’t have tickets for La Familia Segrada ( you should do that in advance Skip the line ones ) and the concierge was able to get us tickets . 
Try the rooftop bistro for drinks and tapas . Beautiful view . Breakfast is included and is fabulous . Anything you want . We had dinner at the hotel and were not impressed. Pricy and not great . Try the local restaurants in the area for great paella.
Make sure to spend some time at the Marcato . Wonderful local experience and great food . 
Beautiful city . Enjoy !",5,2019,08,08
11,"Good hotel, great location.","Stayed 3 nights in early June 2019.  Room was very nice and the breakfasts were very good.  Rooftop bar is expensive (overpriced?), noisy and smoky (even cigars) so we could not enjoy this and left.  Lobby area offers nothing special but once you go outside there is lots to do nearby.  ",4,2019,08,07
11,Nice location,"Hotel could use a dash of updating but overall very clean, great customer service, delightful breakfast and amazing location. We stayed and they accommodated everything that we ask for. I was exhausted after our travels and they gave us a nice, quiet room away from other guests. The view wasn’t the best but it was exactly what I requested. Finally good sleep",5,2019,08,06
11,Absolutely best choice in Barcelona ,"It’s my 7th time staying here. It really became my home. Everything is perfect: atmosphere, fragrance, breakfast, restaurant on the room. The service is outstanding. In my one of the best worlds hotels. ",5,2019,08,04
11,Amazing 😍,This hotel is amazing. I liked the reception and other hotel staff. Service everywhere in the hotel was great. Rooftop bar is great. They are open late for drinks. The swimming pool is very small. Maybe better for kids but really not for adults. There is really no pool deck to hangout. There are a couple lounge chairs but it's really just bar stools and tables set up for drinks and food. Staff at the rooftop bar is not as nice as the rest and are very slow. Exercise room is great. We didn't try the lobby bar as we spent most time at the rooftop bar,4,2019,08,02
11,Great hotel ,"Really great hotel centrally located to all
The attractions . Lovely roof pool and bar 
Comfortable room and friendly staff good amnesties would def recommend 
Great views of the city from the pool
Area hot tub are with pool also ",5,2019,07,26
11,"Great hotel, great location","My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights before taking a Mediterranean cruise and it was fantastic.  Centrally located and easy to get around Barcelona.  Really wonderful room, and great service.  A highlight you don't want to miss is the rooftop bar and grill with wonderful views of the city.  We highly recommend this hotel for your visit to Barcelona.",5,2019,07,26
11,Wonderful Hotel,"The Majestic Hotel in Barcelona is a wonderful place to stay. Their service is excellent. I am so happy that the concierge were able to book a doctor appointment for me at Barraquer hospital. I was able to see my doctor & resolve my issue before I head back home. The concierge drafted & sent emails, called, & once they confirmed the appointment they left a letter in my bedroom. The people who work at the hotel are all friendly & are eager to help. The level of excitement they have to serve you is phenomenal. Their breakfast is good and all of the waiters and chefs are keen to service you. Room service is excellent, they are quick to assist. If & when I order food whether it’s from the hotel or outside & I call room service to provide drinks or missing sauces: it reaches on time! This kind of service in other hotels usually requires time & you would usually finish your food before it reaches to your room. Overall, the people who work at the hotel are always smiling & welcoming. I think what the hotel need to work on is housekeeping as fixing the bed & the bathroom only is unfinished work. It is like passing but with very low grade. Things can be left messy & not properly organized. I remember I have used their glasses to drink water & left it on my night-stand, the housekeeping left it there & kept the dirty glasses. I remember I smudged my lipstick on the glasses just to mark this for the housekeeping as dirty. I have never did this in any of the hotels that I stayed in! The plates, spoons, cups, in the rooms have not been replaced after they have been consumed. My table is empty & I find it annoying. I know if I talked to the housekeeping or the reception they would resolve it but honestly I do not have time. The hotel should know better. Moreover, the location of the hotel is great as it is in the heart of the city. That being said, I do recommend that you stay at this wonderful hotel!",4,2019,07,25
11,Nice hotel,"A very well run hotel. Staff was helpful and efficient. Location was right on the main shopping street and a straight shot to the sea. Nice clean spacious rooms, great AC, nice bar on the roof and an excellent spa. We were there 4 days and will definitely stay there next trip.",5,2019,07,20
11,Best choice hotel at the exclisive Barcelona shopping mile- just nice!,"This hotel was a recommendation from a good friend that writes for exclusive travelling magazines in Mexico. When I arrived it more than expected met what was promised. Very nice was the salutation i my room with a nice local bottle of wine, some home made cookies and some fruit and a beautiful postcard of the hotel with a hand-written salutation.
Very special then  was the bar on the top roof of the hotel. You need to find your way to get there but once you found it you have a breath-taking view to the Sagrada familia and other nice spots of the city.
Nice also that you have all the exclusive shops along the street of the hotel. 
And then the breakfast at the next morning: all the local specialities of the region, fresh fruit, freshly prepared scrambled eggs or any other egg dish you like and more. The atmosphere i that beautiful breakfast room is also breathtaking. And the good surprise in the end: the cost per night for this very exclusive hotel was much lower than expected. This is a place I defenitely want to come back again and without doubts can recommend.",5,2019,07,14
11,"Majestic Hotel & Spa Barcelona, pay for the best and receive what they want.!","If you are looking to pay more than € 500 per night and stand in line for breakfast like in a two star hotel, this is the hotel you are looking for!
but if you want a luxury hotel, it's not this one !!!
for me it should not cost more than € 255 a night, the employees are very good, the management very limited.",2,2019,07,14
11,"Great location, great service","Location, location, location- being on Passeig de Gràcia is an obvious choice near well-known shops and a range of choices when it comes to restaurant. But, more interestingly, it is walking distance from the Born district, La Boqueria, Barri Gotic and a block away from Rambla Catalunya for more eating and shopping choices. 

The rooms are not big, but they are more than comfortable. The aircon is cold ( a plus this time this year)! The sheets are crisp ( though pillows are a tad soft for my neck issues), and the shower pressure is amazing! 

Another great feature of the hotel is it’s must-visit rooftop where you get a great view of the Casa Batlo and Sagrada Familia in the distance, while sipping a cava and listening to live lounge music at night. It’s quite a treat! It can busy but guests of the hotel are given priority.

Special mention to the service of the staff. Everyone is warm and efficient! 
We will definitely return!",5,2019,07,13
11,Spanish Elegance,"When booking a bundled trip and choosing a new hotel, you always have some reservations (pun intended). We have all had our share of disappointments with packages that were reasonably priced, but underwhelming.

I am pleased to say this was not the case with the Majestic. Everything exceeded my expectations. The location on Passeig de Gracia was perfect. Two streets from La Padrera, two streets from Casa Milà and a 15 minute walk from La Sagrada Familia, make this is Ground Zero for Gaudi fans.

Additionally, the customer service, comfortable and beautifully appointed rooms, hip roof-top bar, Spa and well-equipped (although small) fitness room make this an all-inclusive jewel.

Finally, I was pleasantly no more than one mile from any of the numerous Tapas spots on my curated list 🙂

I highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2019,07,06
11,Amazing Service,Absolutely amazing service from front desk to bell staff to concierge to bar and restaurant team.   Special shout out to Elvira at front desk who handled our group exceptionally well.   We got lucky and had a great room with balcony front and center.   The rooms are well appointed with luxury bathrooms and incredibly comfortable beds.   Great location with easy access to everything.  Highly recommend this property,5,2019,07,06
11,"Magnificent hotel, one awful room.","After a cruise, my family spent two nights in this wonderful hotel. We booked two Junior Suites for my children and grandchildren, and one DELUXE EXECUTIVE VIEW ROOM for my wife and I. We all loved the friendly and efficient staff and my kids were awed by their suites. The included breakfast was the best such buffet that I have ever experienced in Europe. This is a great place to stay. BUT, my otherwise lovely room had no shower. To be precise no separate shower. My $563.00 room had a hand shower in a tub. I asked for a room with a shower and we were switched to a small room with one tiny window. I was told that there would be a commensurate adjustment in the rate. The total bill for the three rooms was $4,601.56 for the two nights. The adjustment for the awful room (with a nice shower) was 50 Euros per night. Rushing to pay the bill and get to the airport, I did not check the bill carefully. My advice is to stay in this great hotel and examine your bill very carefully.",4,2019,07,05
11,Staff is great Rooms are not ,"Definitely not 5 star when the room has half a window and smells like mildew
Not satisfied 
Staff is trying their best but why sell sub standard rooms that smell of mildew, have a 7” wide window, and minuscule closets???
And upgraded room is parking lot view!!!!
I do not recommend this hotel.... let’s see if the management changes my mind ",2,2019,07,04
11,Beautiful spot for a night or two,"This is a lovely hotel. We had a great room and the staff was excellent. Wonderful breakfast! Great location if you want to be right in the middle of the shopping district, but it was a little too much activity for us. Fun for one or two nights but not for a long stay.",5,2019,07,04
11,Deluxe room booked through FHR,No words needed. This is the window in our room of a Deluxe room booked through American Express Fine Resorts and hotels. Dirty walls and looks to be garbage chute. This is what $400/night gets you in July in Barcelona. Not impressed. Great breakfast. Rooms clean. However no water in room which has been standard in all of our hotels   On this trip abroad. ,3,2019,07,03
11,Majestic for vacation and wedding,"I visited this marvelous hotel as site inspection for destination weddings. And I had the opportunity to stay 4 nights there. This is the best hotel I experienced in Barcelona. Till now I have the smell of its Majestic spa collection and the odor in the whole hotel. 
If you want to be treated like royal then it is Majestic. Located in the downtown, easy to reach any point, excellent service, mouth watering cuisine, friendly staff, amazing interior with masterpieces of art in the hall. 
The atmosphere is so elegant and cool at the same time. 

Perfect hotel for vacation and stunning venue for weddings with private catering service that can be used for outside. 

The only hotel in Barcelona with royal rooms that are completely privately located on a separate floor with huge terrace, Butler and joining rooms.

11,Why is this hotel part of Amex FHR?,"Heads up to my fellow Amex FHR peeps: here's what $400+ a night gets you when booking a ""Deluxe"" room through Amex: a smashing view of the trash chute and a dirty, rust stained wall. All that's missing are the iron bars. 

PS the walls are paper thin so expect to hear anything your neighbor is saying above a whisper...over the last 4+ hours (It's presently 4:15 a.m. here) I've learned more about the couple in the adjoining room than most people I've known for 30+ years.  Who needs sleep when the wackos next door provide non stop entertainment?

Buyer beware!",1,2019,07,02
11,Great location & a very nice hotel,"We stayed there from the 20th to the 23 of June on the hotel apartments which is on the other side of the street facing the hotel 
But we had 2 problems 1st the apartments are just looking on the back side of another building but this wasn't an issue as we are staying out the majority of the time, they put the amenities shampoo,shower gel ..only the 1st day of your stay, the front desk was helpful all of the time but you have to call them early to collect your luggage since they have one bell captain serving the hotel & the apartments!
The good thing about this hotel it is away from the pedrara & casa batillo only 2mins 
& all the brand shops are just located on that street",4,2019,07,02
11,"Some Good, Some Not","The Majestic Hotel is quite beautiful and is located well enough to easily go anywhere you want in Barcelona. We stayed in one of their apartments and were a little disappointed in the size and quality. The hotel lobby and common areas, including the bar and restaurants are quite elegant and high end, the apartment however was cheaply furnished and small. The master bedroom barely fit a queen size bed and it was difficult to walk around both sides of the bed. Only one bathroom and had a single sink and was cramped. Ditto for the second bedroom with twin beds. The kitchen was a decent size and offered a washer and dryer which we appreciated. Also has a lovely terrace with table and chairs with rooftop views. However the living area had a scratched up coffee table and ratty area rug which we were surprised by. However, the front desk staff was lovely and offered me some assistance when I arrived jet lagged and not feeling well. Additionally, the bell staff was wonderful about cabs and baggage help.  I can’t say I recommend the apartment but would absolutely try the hotel again. ",4,2019,06,29
11,"Excellent location,, but overpriced for quality of rooms and service","We stayed one night in a standard room 
the hotel is perfectly located (and have access to a private garage) on one of the main pedestrian street  Passeig de Gracia.
the room we had was quite small with a very low ceiling (maybe 2,20) which made it even smaller (15sqm? 
the hotel is a 5 stars hotel and proposing such a room is not really matching international standards
the interior looks a bit old or old fashion but the bathroom was spacious enough
there are so many rooms in the hotel that it is difficult to find its way.
the breakfast is nice especially with its veranda outside but could be presenting a larger choice of products.. especially local products 
the pool area is nice but wiht a very small pool",4,2019,06,25
11,Best option so far in Barcelona,"Much better than W and Abac hotels we tried before.

Executive room was large enough with a baby and a fantastic huge terrace (room 738). Furniture is luxurious and bathroom is really great, with excellent amenities in good quantity (not the tiny soap you ll get at the W).
Breakfast is really great. Excellent quality of the jamon ibérico and all the other products.
Staff always available and attentive. 
Service was well above par: they came to fetch us at the bar downstairs as soon as a table was available at the bar upstairs (try this at w hotel). Chef saved some gluten free products for me (knowing I am gluten intolerant). Quick to get a taxi, Very good room service offer.
We also like the location.",5,2019,06,19
11,Overpriced and overrated ,"This is our second visit to this hotel... unfortunately probably our last! We last visited in 2014. The positives are the location and the rooms which are clean with comfortable beds, We opted for a junior suite. 

This is unfortunately where the positives end. 

Firstly the balconies have a rail that isn’t particularly high. There are also a light on the floor which is hazardous. After a miss step this proved quite dangerous, so we didn’t venture out again which was a shame as it has a great view.

Our room safe was faulty, I was carrying expensive jewellery so was imperative I had somewhere safe to store it. After numerous calls to reception no one came to fix it.

Breakfast was average at best, although I believe it has a reputation for being very good. We were disappointed with the selection. It certainly doesn’t cater for a British palate. English breakfast tea was dreadful. 

The roof bar. This was terribly overpriced. Sure it’s a great place to watch the sunset. We ate and drank there on two of our three nights because it was convenient. On hindsight we probably should have found somewhere else. The menu was lack lustre, the food shockingly poor and tasteless and the price was eye watering expensive! I certainly wouldn’t recommend any one to go except for the view! Such a shame! My son had to run over to Burger King after his dinner which says it all really!

I’m sorry I can’t write a more favourable review as the staff have been great mostly. I just think there are better hotels to stay for the price one pays. 

The plate of food below was €28! 

",2,2019,06,17
11,Very nice place; we book through Amex fine hotels and very glad we did ,"We had a very good experience with our children in this hotel. We had two rooms, one for us and one for the kids. The hotel is a very good quality. It came with breakfast through the American Express fine hotels. Breakfast was very nice seeing you and there was an omelette  station and nice bread and fruits and pretty much anything else you could ask for. Also good location within Barcelona.  Very good service and the employees were great - concierge etc. ",5,2019,06,16
11,Not worth the money,The first criteria I have for a hotel is the temperature of the room. My husband and I were sweating every night and I don't usually get warm. The thermostat on the wall seemed merely to be a wall decoration. The spa is a very abbreviated spa with none of the amenities I would expect for the prices that you have to pay. The  positives of the hotel were a wonderful breakfast with many fresh choices at multiple stations and the rooftop bar with great views of the city.  The hotel is centrally located so you can walk to most attractions of Barcelona. The staff were always friendly and helpful.,3,2019,06,14
11,"Very expensive, but top quality","

Nice hotel and great staff.  Always helpful.  Expensive, but no compromises.  Quality in everything, food, room amenities, service.  Great location.  We had a glitch with our room and staff made sure all was fixed as soon as possible.  Nothing was too much trouble",5,2019,06,12
11,Perfect location,"If you want to be close to everything, this is the hotel for you. Nice rooms, comfortable and clean. Beautiful buffet breakfast and stunning views from the rooftop bar, which also has great cocktails and tapas.  If you like boutique shopping, this hotel will be a perfect choice for you.",4,2019,06,08
11,Hmm..not all as it seems,"We traveled here for my wife's 50th birthday staying for 3 nights/4 days.  

The positives for this place are its location and roof top bar, but you can get other properties for less costs. 

Onto the negatives:

The room we were given was supposed to be a view of the whole of Passeig de Gracia, instead we received a view of the crossroads intersection from a recessed balcony.  After asking at reception we did receive a different room, but in the same location on a higher level which was very disappointing. 

The incidental costs of this hotel are not to be underestimated. 

A shot of Greygoose vodka at the bar is 22€, a mixer a further 7€.  Even Absolut Vodka is 11€ a shot. 

A simple continental breakfast is 34€.  

Spa treatments are more than triple you would pay elsewhere.

You get the picture.

Don't even try and speak to the one-man concierge. A front desk that is too busy, inefficient and lacking in urgency of service.

We have family who live in Barcelona, and after an evening out we decided to take them to see the views at the rooftop bar and have a final drink together. The rooftop bar closes at 2am, yet we were blocked from going up there at 1:40am as they were ""closing soon"".  

On checkout, we reviewed the bill (we were asked twice if we were sure we wanted to do this), and lo and behold we had been charged double for our drinks, which had to be corrected.

For the cost of the hotel, it offers utterly disrespectful and poor service.

We had a great weekend in Barcelona, let down by this overpriced, outdated, old-thinking, arrogant environment.  

The Majestic Hotel Barcelona has the opportunity to be so much better, but fails spectacularly at the basics.  

Had it not been my wife's birthday, and not wanted to create a scene to ruin her weekend, I would have asked for a complete refund.",1,2019,06,05

Price was reasonable

11,Lovely,"Stayed for 7 nights May 2019. Check in and out was smooth. Room was clean, fair size and serviced impeccably every day. Great location. Breakfast was outstanding. Pool is on the Terrace and super tiny - it is also where they serve lunch/dinner etc so I would not use it. More of a water feature. Service up on the terrace was slow and the hostess and staff seemed a little harried. Gym was good enough for my needs. Piano music at the bar on the main level was lovely as well.",4,2019,05,30
11,Sophisticated Hotel,"Lovely hotel with attentive and obliging staff.  Breakfast, as everyone says, is amazing - so much choice and all prepared to a high standard.  We were in a side room and the view, over a car park, wasn't attractive.  We were disappointed that the roof terrace bar and pool were closed for some reason.",5,2019,05,30
11,Great hotel in Barcelona. ,"Had a very nice 4 night stay at the Majestic Hotel.

Accompanied friends that were attending a medical conference and found the hotel to be very welcoming and comfortable. 

We got the Romantic package and received a bottle of cava & desert, really nice in room breakfast the next morning plus a tapas testing in the lounge.

Room was very nice. 

The staff was exceptional. Both with our needs at the hotel but with dinner and tour reservations as well.

Highly recommended. ",5,2019,05,29
11,Advance warning - restaurant closed for whole of August ,"This review is to try and help others so they don’t fall into the same issue I have had. 

I booked this place over others as the restaurant is meant to be amazing - the plan was to have our wedding anniversary night in the hotel, dine in the restaurant and finish with drinks on the rooftop overlooking Barcelona.  

However the hotel (after taking my booking) have notified me the restaurant is closed for the entirety of August !!! I can’t understand how this is possible in peak season ... 

To compound matters I am now being told there is a no refund policy.  

This was not made clear to me on booking - so to others thinking of booking in August I hope this helps you before you book. 

Still don’t know how a 5 star hotel which prides itself on its restaurant can shut for an entire month ... ",2,2019,05,24
11,A relax from busy life,"I enjoyed my stay very much, food good, very clean, lovely staff except for a staff member on the reception through communication was coming across very harsh. I just wanted to visit the hairdresser I said forget it. Disappointed

11,Lovely Service and Excellent Breakfast,"My niece and I stayed at this hotel and was very much satisfied with everything!  The staff is very professional and friendly.  All it takes is eye contact and they are at your service...we love this about the Majestic.  The breakfast is delicious.  The breakfast and lounge area, no matter how many guest, is always neat and clean.  Our room and bathroom was very nice.  We did not want for anything at the Majestics. The staff appears to really want to assist the guests and makes an effort to ensure everyone is comfortable.    We will return to the hotel!",5,2019,05,21

11,Wonderful Stay in Barcelona,We stayed at the Hotel Majestic before a cruise and it was a perfect choice.  Hotel staff were warm and welcoming.  From check in to check out everything was handled efficiently and professionally.  Would definitely recommend this hotel.,5,2019,05,16
11,Gem in Barcelona,"While on a recent trip to Barcelona, I had the good fortune to stay at the Majestic...what a nice surprise This is a very well appointed hotel in the upscale shopping district in Barcelona but a 15 minute to the Rambla Ian’s other tourist sights.  The section of town is extremely safe and surrounded by numerous tapa and late night restaurants.  The rooms at the Majestic are clean, well appointed and modern while maintaining the charm of a grand historic hotel.  The food is worth mentioning and the breakfast buffer is on e of the best in town.  I will definitely stay at the Majestic upon my next visit to Barcelona",5,2019,05,12
11,Great Luxury Hotel/Location/Rooftop/Breakfast/Staff,"We booked 2 rooms/2 nites as post-script to Athens-Barcelona Cruise. Hotel location is great for ""walking families"":  25 min walk to Familia Sagrada, 15 min walk to La Rambla + 5 min walk to the ""Tour of Barcelona"" Bus Stops for the 2 largest tour co's.  

Rooftop bar view to Sagrada + beach is great. Staff was VERY attentive and helpful.  The Breakfast Buffet is one of best ever (Seabourn Cruise ship competitive). 

Room 721 is top corner balcony with w/ 180 degree view in La Rambla + Olympic Stadium Hill direction.  Room 733 is massive sundeck balcony w/ view to Sagrada over privacy hedge.  

Not an inexpensive stay, but well worth it in the Luxury Hotel realm!!!",5,2019,05,08

11,Central Location  Helpful staff  ,We recently visited the Majestic Hotel.  The hotel is centrally located in Barcelona.  The hotel is in the middle of the shopping district and also a short trip to the Sagrada Familia.  Compared to other locations in Europe I found Barcelona a very easy city to navigate.  Easy taxi rides (no Uber download mytaxi ap) bikes and electric scooters are available.  The hotel is beautiful and the morning buffet is first class.  The hotel also helped us rent a Mini Cooper and suggested sister hotels up the coast in Tossa de Mar and Calella.  We leave in a day so I will give an update in a separate post on these hotels.  If you are new to Europe Barcelona might be a good starting point as it is a 6 hour train ride to Paris and also allows access to North Africa and Portugal.  Everyone in this city seems to know English.  Also if you want an old world feel Sitges is a short 40 minute bus ride or better yet rent scooters and take the coast road.,5,2019,05,03
11,Great location ,"The hotel’s location was difficult to beat. It’s easy to access all the shopping places. It’s convenient enough to get round to most places of interest.
The services at the front desk were ok but nothing to remember but the porter team was great. More human touch is needed to make a hotel great. And it must comes from service minded staffs. The room’s and lobby’s ambiance were a bit dull. The room is clean and has a good size although the wardrobe was tiny. It’s not exactly cheap. The amenities were good and the facilities were 5 Stars although their room’s fridge didn’t work well. The breakfast was very good, tasty and interesting.
I had mix feelings about this hotel. Probably I was spoiled too much recently by other hotels we visited. ",3,2019,04,24
11,Carlos to the rescue!,"I arrived at the hotel without my luggage courtesy of the worst airline ever Vueling and spent the day trying to contact the airline to get an update on my luggage, nobody works at Vueling it seems, no one answers the phone, no one mans the on line chat, receives emails etc! In desperation I contacted concierge the next day and Carlos took charge! Only due to his persistence during the day trying every number etc available did he get some traction on my bag and managed to get it to Barcelona! Thank you so much for assistance Carlos you are a champion!",5,2019,04,24

Arrived from a long flight and were greeted by a very pleasant and professional young woman who arranged for us to have early access to our room. Room was fairly large by European standards and very clean. Location is upscale and central. Lovely linens and nice bath. Our stay included breakfast which is probably the most impressive we've ever seen; they had everything and all was prepared very nicely, my husband said his croissant was as fresh as from a cafe in Paris. Impressed all around.",5,2019,04,18

Public areas are like old times, piano plays in the afternoon, breakfast is yummy including those fantastic spanish hams and cold cuts, and some so nice waiters who take care of all guests, even suggesting what to do in Barcelona.
Of course, nearly 80% of staff are there since plenty years ago; special mention to Mr Juan, Security Chief, whose smile brightens ur day everytime u find him.",5,2019,04,11
11,First class in all ways,"Ideal location, superb staff, excellent dining and breakfast, well appointed room,
attention to detail with supporting house keeping, and a general feeling of welcome.
The Majestic is a must stay for a visit to Barcelona. 
Do not think about it.....do it!!",5,2019,04,05
11,No Room Insipte Of Confirmed Booking!!!!!!,"We booked for 5nights: double for first 2 nights and triple room for next 3 nights, as our daughter was joining us. I reconfirmed the same by email 1 week prior to arrival and on check in. However, on the 3rd day we were told triple room was not available. Instead we were given another double room (number 226) which had no window and the ac was not working, and so was not usable. After a lot of complaints we were shifted to another 2 connecting double rooms. The next day we were told that we could shift to a triple room, or we could continue to stay in these rooms and there will no extra charge. Though this was not what we booked, we accepted to continue in the same rooms as we were tired of moving every day. On morning of checkout I informed the reception and was told that there was no dues to be paid. However, to my astonishment, as I was leaving the hotel in the afternoon, I was told that I have to Pay Euro350 for the additional room. When I protested, I was told that I have to wait for the manager who was not available at that time. My taxi was waiting at the door and it was getting late for my flight. I was allowed to go after my travel agent spoke to them and said that he will take responsibility. 
In summary, I was not given a triple room inspite of having a confirmed booking. I adjusted to what was available. Instead of rewarding me, the hotel tried to charge me extra for a mistake on their part. 
I wrote in these comments in the feedback to the hotel, but received no satisfactory explanation  reply regarding why the extra charge. Only that they will offer me complimentary upgrade in my next visit. I will never stay in this hotel after this unpleasant experience resulting from their unprofessional behaviour nor will I recommend to anyone. Avoid at all cost as many other hotels offer better value for your money.",1,2019,04,05
11,Nice hotel /good service but with cold shower in the morning,"Great location and service in the hotel. I was still disappointed:
1. Top Floor/swimming pool closed.
2. I had to take a cold shower on my second morning - no hot water.
3. I made an arrangement with the conciërge for an event at the hotel and late they cancelled again despite earlier promises.

11,Amazing location! Gorgeous hotel!,"Hotel is ""majestic"" and a classic beauty!  Located on Paseo de Grasi (sp?) one of the premier streets in Barcelona.  Near tons of restaurants and shopping galore!  Staff very helpful and friendly offering a smile when coming in and out, maps and directions of course and even moved our room without issue when construction on 10th floor by pool was an issue. We had a lovely room with decent view of city and balcony.  Room was what we would expect from a European non - chain hotel - not huge or super modern but had adequate storage, comfy bed, robes, slippers and a great big tub!  So easy to get around from this hotel...we walked everywhere!  We would certainly go back to the Majestic!",4,2019,04,02
11,An amazing hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"From the minute I arrived in the country the hotel went out of their way to look after me early check up graded my room and the staff were so friendly they make you feel like one of the family....
I would recommend this hotel to everyone who is visiting this amazing city...",5,2019,03,31
11,Definitely full marks,It’s not hard to see why this special hotel in Barcelona gets full marks. The service starts the moment you enter and doesn’t stop. All staff are professional and friendly and then of course the hotel itself is just magnificent. A perfect location. The building itself?  Majestic!  ,5,2019,03,30
11,Majestic apartments,"This hotel is smack in the middle of loads of shops and restaurants-plus grocery store and pharmacy are also steps away. Everyone we have encountered at the hotel has been lovely and gone above and beyond to be kind, welcoming and helpful. They are all super-cheerful and friendly as well. 
We are staying in the apartments across the street from the main hotel, so I cant speak to the hotel rooms, but the apartment is great. All of the services and support of staying in a hotel with all of the space and conveniences of an apartment. The MBR is a little loud from street noise, but the proximity to everything makes up for it-I think. We have a full kitchen plus laundry which is amazing for traveling with kids. We would definitely stay here again. ",5,2019,03,25
11,surpassed expectations!,"We are a difficult family with unusual dietary needs, due to very severe food allergies.  Prior to traveling anywhere, I always send an email ahead to the General Manager, explaining our situation.  

Before arriving at the Majestic, I received an email stating that every one of our dietary needs would be met and not to worry about anything.  
 
Within an hour of checking in, Karim ER RAMY (butler at the Majestic) came to our room to verbally review all food requirements.  He assured us that he would send an email to all dining establishments within the hotel , so that everyone would be aware of our situation.   For our entire stay, every place where we ordered our food -- whether it was Room Service or one of the restaurants -- responded with a smile and ""We received the email,"" and then continued to prepare safe food for my family to consume.

What an outstanding asset Karim is to this hotel!

I must add, however, that the hotel is wonderful, in a perfect location, and all the staff were outstanding -- helpful, warm, accommodating, and ready to help in any way possible.

We usually choose 5 star chain hotels, and I was a bit hesitant when booking the Majestic instead of the usual, well known 5 star hotel just down the block.   In summary, we intend to return to Barcelona and will ONLY stay at the Majestic.   
A truly wonderful vacation experience.",5,2019,03,25
11,A world class customer experience delivered by outstanding employees,I have stayed in many great hotels over the years that have left memorable impressions for different reasons. This one is without any doubt the one on the top of the list in terms of the ability to make guests feel confortable and welcome consistently accross all their employee groups. I should also mention the breakfast which is fantastic - even for at 5* hotel.,5,2019,03,25
11,"Excellent Service, Quite & Great Location","It was an amazing stay, the rooms are small, but it doesn’t matter if you find an amazing and fast service, nice breakfast and great location. Bottom of line, they make you feel very comfortable and you will feel the 100 years tradition of this building. Expensive but extremely recommended.",5,2019,03,20
11,The best service period!,I have been to several hotels and the one thing that makes the difference is always the service.  I can safely say the at the majestic hotel here in Barcelona the service is second to none! My wife had a birthday and they send a bottle to the room. They are super accommodating with every single aspect of your stay. We had a breakfast in the room it was superb.! We are extremely happy with our stay and I will recommend this hotel to anyone who come to visit Barcelona.  I am sure they will do great by them as well.,5,2019,03,19
11,"Service, Luxury & Location","Perfectly located, wonderfully staffed and comfortable in every way. A great starting point to explore Barcelona. The rooftop bar offers phenomenal views and well-crafted views. This is my forever-hotel in Barcelona.",5,2019,03,19
11,Simple fanrastic,"I spent there 4 night during a conference. I loved the place, because it is:
- stylish, elegant and it has a special atmosphere
City center location, just walking distance from La Ramblas. Train station 50 m - direct access to AP, for around 8 Euros or less. Taxi is about 40 Euros.
They do provide free wifi, with a good speed.
BF is simple unbeatable:
- wide variety of foods for every taste and diet
The hotel staff is great, polite and helpfull.
Good location for families and business as well.

11,Wow! Classic Luxury Style with Fresh Modern Clean Details,"Hotels in Barcelona rarely cease to impress me, such a dynamic, trendy and competitive market for the industry, never afraid to execute the most daring modern architecture or interior design.

The Majestic Hotel, however, is styled with a traditional look of refined luxury and elegance.  Which made me half-assume it would be dated, old, and ageing poorly.  I was so wrong!  The Majestic feels fresh, modern and impeccably clean!  Sparkling clean and luxurious!  The room was very tastefully decorated with all space used efficiently and creatively; the bed linens and comfort were excellent.

For travelers looking for a look and style of classic luxury in the center of Barcelona's luxurious shopping avenues, museums and restaurants, the Majestic is an excellent choice and is excellent value-for-money.  A similar quality hotel in other European capitals would cost twice the price.",5,2019,03,14
11,Happy hour on the most famous rooftop of Barcelona,"Cocktail and tapas, overlooking Barcelona. can't get any better!
Excellent service, very tasty tapas. Magnificent view of the city.

Location is absolutely ideal for anything you want to do or see in Barca
Rooms are spacious and well equipped
The Breakfast is Divine, traditional Catalan style 
Staff is well trained, attentive and lovely",5,2019,03,04
11,Perfect central location ,"This hotel is top notch.  It’s situated in the heart of Barcelona adjacent to all the great shopping.  It’s right across the street from Casa Batlló (which is unfortunately under construction currently).

The breakfast is delicious!  It’s buffet style with 3 convenient international stations.  The coffee service is generous and prompt.  They are very careful to accommodate dietary restrictions.  Sharon was especially helpful and made sure that my needs were well taken care of.

There is a cozy bar that serves a delicious burger.  The staff are extremely courteous and attentive.

Our room was spacious but didn’t provide a good view.

One thing that was hard for me to get used to is keeping the card key in the light switch placard to turn in the lights.  Hairdryers are provided. You must keep your thumb on the button at all times or it stops.  

The fitness facility is small and there is only small selection of equipment.  There are a couple of treadmills, an elliptical, 2 odd looking spin bikes and a machine for weights with limited options.  They do have two full sets of free weights and two step benches.  There are amenities such as toothpaste/ toothbrush, razors and deodorant located in the fitness facility.",5,2019,02,26
11,Training,"Very nice hotel,  excellent service, serviceable team wen you want something.

11,Amazing experience,"We stayed at the Majestic hotel in a Junior  suite room that had a balcony facing the main lively road. Which is highly recommended. 
We had excellent service from the moment we checked in till we checked out. Staff extremely friendly and helpful in particular Marcel who went out of his way in order to help us with advice and recommendation. He has excellent knowledge of restaurant choices and excursions.

11,"Pretty close to perfect, I highly recommend this hotel!!","I was pleasantly surprised from the moment we checked into this hotel until we checked out. The hotel is centrally located in Barcelona, yet you would never know from inside, it is very quiet. The staff is very professional, attentive and helpful throughout the entire stay. We were made to feel welcome at all times. Our room was just what I would expect from a European hotel, small but perfectly sized; enough space for two with no issues at all. I do need to add here, our shower had the most amazing water pressure I have ever had in my life! We stayed in room 234 and it was truly a wonderful shower, I really do miss this!! The room service was great, it arrived promptly, was the right temperature, staff was professional and accommodating. We did not use the spa but the spa menu looked amazing and I would highly recommend checking it out if given the opportunity. We did not use the hotel restaurant. If I come back to Barcelona I would definitely stay at Majestic Hotel & Spa again and I highly recommend this property for all!",5,2019,02,02
11,Near perfect.,"On a busy street of Barcelona , actually right in the center of , this very nice hotel .
Room size is average but large enough for two . Bathroom large. 
Breakfast is fantastic with self service areas that will satisfy even the more difficult customer . 
I have not used any of the services that this hotel has such as the massage center but anything I requested or anybody I met from staff in this hotel is not only extremely friendly they will do anything to help a customer fast and everything is done with a smile .
Nice hotel with perfect staff.
If there are things I can fault this hotel on , I would urgently ask them to  take care of room windows  and the aging bed ( of course I can only judge the bed o had in my room ) ",4,2019,01,28
11,"Wonderful hotel, great staff, shame about roof top terrace",Great location near many Gaudi museums and designer shops. The staff were very attentive throughout the whole stay. A shame the rooftop terrace was closed for refurbishment. Also the internal layout is very confusing - not easy to get to your room. ,4,2019,01,18
11,Good but not great,"Stayed here for one night. The roof terrace was closed and I was put in a slightly tired room with twin beds rather than a double, looking out on to an uninteresting side-road. Layout of the hotel was confusing in places (the signage isn’t that good). Had some food there which was nice, but nothing too special.  The gym was small but reasonable well equipped, although it could do with an air freshener. My view is that 300 euro it was overpriced for what it was. ",3,2019,01,18

11,Absolutely perfect ,"Stayed here 2 nights prior to boarding a Viking Ocean Cruise. 

The hotel is in a wonderful location, in the heart of the city’s finest shopping. 

We stayed in the 2nd floor, which included a lovely glassed in terrace, complete with a table and chairs. 
The king size bed is extremely comfortable, the oversized tub a pleasure that was enjoyed both nights.

The buffet breakfast is a sight to behold! Everything beautifully presented, with many savory and sweet choices offered, as well as delicious cappuccino. It is one of the finest breakfast buffets I’ve experienced.

I absolutely give this hotel an excellent rating, and recommend them highly.",5,2019,01,05

11,Extra mile,"This Hotel certainly went the extra mile to acknowledge our wedding anniversary, there was a display on our bed made of fresh red rose petals in the shape of a heart, which was very beautiful. Also our anniversary was acknowledged in the dining room when at the end of our dinner we were given two glasses of champagne and a dessert with a lit candle - very thoughtful. The hotel was spotlessly clean, our bedroom was very large and comfortable and all the staff were very professional and extremely helpful. Breakfast was a sight to behold so much choice and of a good quality too.",5,2018,12,24
11,The „one and only rooftop terrace“ in the city of Barcelona „ with a panoramic view all over“ !!,"As a long - stay guest of the Majestic Hotel Barcelona, I have visited - at different times - alone or in company with friends, the roof top terrace of the Majestic for the fantastic panoramic view of the city - in the distance  - the Mediterranean with the ships  /  mountains, to enjoy creative personal ( ! ) Cocktails and excellent gourmet food.
I could possibly use the excellent service of Linda, Lotte from Nederland, Henriett, Marina the Catalan Lady, Natalia from Ukraine and the red haired Trainee lady - with the Special sunglasses - Anett, Adri the Filipino service waiter and Trainee Tobias from Nederland ! The service of the mentioned (!) Service people was friendly & competent - really excellent !  I have read other reviews that report negative experiences. This certainly does not apply to the aforementioned international service staff. Other - No Service - oriented staff are unfortunately also in the Majestic, well - no motivated staff - are, as I know by my world - wide business & private Travel - experience, unfortunately also in 5 Star and + hotels. 
My recommendation: 
Guests of the Majestic roof terrace should simply contact the ""Friendly & professionally qualified - who exercise their activity with enthusiasm, then the visit becomes an everlasting memory  - or guest opt for a return visit !!

11,Superior Hotel Majestic / Great Hotel Service / Excellent Room & Service,Great lobby and front desk staff. Hotel rooms are superb. Rooftop swimming pool relatively small and limited (after the hotel is celebrating their 100 anniversary). Centrally located. Hotel restaurant very specialized. Convenient to walk around to various famous and interesting locations.,5,2018,12,20
11,Wonderful hotel very friendly staff,Just spent 6 nights here and we have had a great time. The hotel is an excellent location within the city to explore all the  prime sites. Everything about the hotel is 5 star but what really makes it is the very friendly and helpful staff from the moment we arrived and the greeting  from “Cristina” on reception who went out of her way explaining the location in relation to key places to visit. Then the 2 Dutch waitresses in the bar area who always had a smile and were very helpful. The breakfast is probably has the best quality selection of any hotel we have stayed at which we were always greeted with a smile and very attentive service. Don’t forget the view from the level 10 bar 👍👍,5,2018,12,19
11,What a wonderful world! Majestic stay!,"Imagine the convenience of being in the city center, but in a relaxing ambience which reminds you an oasis....That is what I felt when I stayed on this hotel. Gorgeous breakfast room, breathtaking views of the roof top and with a really friendly staff. 
Superb!",5,2018,12,12
11,5-Star hotel with exceptional service and in perfect location!!!!,"My family and I enjoyed a fabulous week long stay at this 5-star hotel!!! I highly recommend this hotel for anyone vacationing in Barcelona. First, the service was exceptional. Everyone was extremely attentive to our needs. The manager allowed us to check in several hours early due to the early arrival of our flight from the U.S.  And he accommodated us with 2 balcony, city-view rooms. WOW!!!  We were extremely grateful for this!!! Second, the location in the heart of the city can not be beat. We were in walking distance of dining, shopping, the metro, and even the pick up locations for our excursion tours. Third, the views from the rooftop pool and lounge are outstanding. It is just the perfect place to unwind and take in the city all at once. And finally, as far as helpful tips, they offer free WiFi during your stay. The service is fast and reliable, and you are not limited to the number of connected devices. They also provide 2 complimentary outlet adapters in each room. So, there is no need to buy extra adapters if you’re coming from the U.S.. Each room also has 2 robes, 2 sets of slippers, and an umbrella to use during your stay. So no need to pack these heavy items in your luggage. In a nutshell, this hotel’s 5-star rating is well deserved and I definitely will stay here again on my next trip to Barcelona!!!!  It is simply. MAJESTIC!!!! :0)",5,2018,12,10
11,Whoever runs this place should be ashamed ,"I stayed here at the end of September/beginning of October. It has take me so long to write a review because I was waiting for the GM to call me, as I was told he would. Out of respect, I didn’t want to post my review until after I spoke to the GM. But he obviously didn’t care enough to follow up. That should tell you something. 

This hotel experience was horrible from start to finish. We waited 30 mins to an hour to check in. We STOOD in line like we were waiting to check in at the Caesar’s Palace in Vegas. My friend and I complained but no one cared. A better hotel would have (aside from having the check on staffed properly to avoid such a line in the first place) escorted us to the lobby or bar and offered coffee or a drink while we waited. 45 minutes later the front desk agent could care less about our long wait. And of course, our room wasn’t ready yet. 

One night I called to order room service. I ordered a chicken salad wrap. I learned that it was pre-made when I asked them to remove tomatoes and they said the wraps are made in advance. I didn’t order anything else. About 45 minutes later I called for my order and was told it was on its way. 20-30 minutes later I called again and it still was not ready even though previously it was supposed to be on its way. I was told that they would make it that second. I reminded them it was pre-made. After 4-5 calls to room service I told them I didn’t even want to wrap anymore. It was beyond my bedtime at that point. They brought it anyway. easily 1.5 hours (maybe 2) after I ordered it. it was like warm. And disgusting. there is NO excuse in any hotel let alone a “5 star” hotel (and I wonder who gave them the 5 star accreditation) to take hours to deliver a single pre-made wrap. 

Oh, there were also NO spa appointments available at anytime. This was annoying because the only reason I book the Majestic in the first place was because it was on the American Express list and if book with AmEx one of the benefits is a significant spa credit which is obviously meaningless when you cant get a damn appointment. I heard a few other guests at the hotel complaining about this as well. 

The breakfast buffet was so filthy and not at all maintained throughout the course of the several hours long brunch. I lost my appetite. I’ve attached a few pictures which really doesn’t even do it justice. It was filthy and unappetizing. Many items they just simply ran out of and didn’t seem to care about replenishing. 

There was at least one other incident that I can’t even remember right now. It was honestly the worst hotel ever. I’ve stayed in hostels with better service. 

Although management was already aware of my concerns throughout my stay, I spoke to yet another manager during check out. He seemed somewhat interested and I think comped some items on my bill. But honestly, these screw ups are more than getting something for free. At that time I was told that the GM or owner would definitely 100% be in touch with me. I said I didn’t really care to ever talk to anyone at the hotel again but they basically begged me under the guise that the GM “will sincerely want to hear my concerns to make the hotel better.” So I left all of my contact information. And I never heard another word. Disgraceful. 

I could go on and on but I think I’ve said enough. This place is an embarrassment. Stay somewhere, anywhere else. ",2,2018,12,08

11,Wonderful hotel,I had a wonderful experience with my family in November 2018. This hotel could not do enough for us. Concierge was wonderful and very accommodating. The restaurant served the best breakfasts I have ever had on vacations. The rooms were big and clean and the staff kept the entire hotel immaculate. ,5,2018,12,04
11,"Location, staff, and breakfast takes this hotel to the top!","Barcelona is a beautiful city with a lot of lodging options.  The number of choices can be dizzying with a variety of price ranges.  I was very excited when I found out that I could book the Majestic Hotel and Spa via my CC to get an excellent price.

We got to the hotel early (10 am) on the day of arrival to check-in.  Early check-in was 12 PM but there was a room ready.  I was informed that I can get a room upgrade if I was willing to wait which I was.  Since I had a tour booked at 11:00 am, I left my luggage with the staff and informed them I will be back after the tour.  I already felt very welcome just from this interaction.  Everyone went out of their way to make sure that we knew the stay was going to be special.

Not knowing Barcelona, I was a bit concerned that the hotel was a bit out of the center of the city.  However, the location turns out to be the ideal location for what we wanted to do in Barcelona.  There is a subway/train station close by (3 min walk) that allowed us to go everywhere we wanted to go.  In fact, we took the train from the airport to the hotel and were easily at the hotel within 35 minutes from terminal 2.  There are also several bus stops close by.  There is a multitude of of restaurants including one of my favorite (La Paradeta) just a short 5 minute walk.  You are also close to Casa Batlo which you get to see lit up in various colors during the night.

The room I had on the second floor was superb and very comfortable.  It had a big bathroom with separate tub and shower room.  We didn't have a street view but had a view overlooking the inner courtyard.  It wasn't pretty but it let plenty of light into the room.  

A hotel is only as good as its staff and in this case, the breakfast is also spectacular.  My stay included the breakfast which makes for an incredible feast every morning before our day starts.  There are enough pictures about the breakfast that I'm not going to describe it.  Even after 3 days, I could still find new items to wow me. Needless to say, my wife and I usually leave the hotel to start our day in Barcelona more than satisfied.  In fact, we skipped eating a full meal for lunch because of the incredible breakfast.  

About the only negative I could think of was the inconsistency of the turn-down service.  It seemed that on the first 2 nights, they forgot that there were two people staying in the room so they only turned down one side of the bed.  That was very strange and was corrected the subsequent nights.

My conclusion is that the Majestic Hotel and Spa easily passes the test for a luxury hotel.  The incredible staff and the central location easily makes the hotel an easy recommendation.",5,2018,12,02

11,5 nights of heaven at the Majestic,My family of 4 stayed at the Majestic Residence over Thanksgiving break and we had a truly amazing experience!. The staff greeted us upon arrival and checked us in immediately. Roberto brought our bags across the street to our residence and showed us around the enormous apartment. Our 2 bedroom/2 bath had a good sized kitchen with a washer/dry and a large sitting room with balcony. We were very comfortable staying here and especially loved Martin at the Rooftop Bar! The sunset views were gorgeous and the atmosphere very welcoming. We enjoyed drinks and dessert after dinner in the hotel bar and especially loved the Nutella crepe! Thanks for an amazing stay the Hotel Majestic! Did I mention the awesome location too!?! We highly recommend Hotel Majestic!,5,2018,11,27

11,Majestic Hotel 5 Stars Above Any Hotel Visited In The World - Our Return Visit,"Since my first review, my husband and I have returned to the Majestic Hotel three years in a row!

Why, you might ask?  I have wanted to receive the extraordinary accommodations and service no other hotel has been able to attain.  We have stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in Las Vegas, the Acqualina Resort and Spa in Sunny Isles Beach, Florida.  None of these hotels can compare to Majestic.

First, let me start with my first contact with Javier, our first Butler, via WhatsApp with an inquiry for my November pre-cruise cocktail party.  Javier referred me to Olivier Thellier, Majestic Food and Beverage Director, who responded to my inquiry in a manner I have become accustomed with promptness and outstanding service.  Mr. Thellier arranged the hotel venue where over 30 Cruise Critic Roll Call members would gather for the first time to meet one another face to face prior to our 13 night Italy and Adriatic cruise.  The party was absolutely fabulous thanks to Olivier and Karim, our butler.

Have I not mentioned our butler, Karim?  Through Oscar Martin's dedication to butler excellence, we were provided with butler services from Karim.  My husband and I were unsure of Karim since Javier had provided butler services beyond any other butler services we had received.  This including Celebrity Cruise line butler services while cruising over eight times in their Penthouse suite.  Javier, our first Majestic butler, is the standard by which we measure all butler services received to date.

Karim greeted us with passion to to which we had received from Javier.  I must say you never forget your first experiences of anything in life, thus Javier is someone very special.  

Karim made sure my cocktail guests were taken care of and in fact my husband and I were able to introduce Karim to our nephew and his wife who had moved to Barcelona last year.  Karim has continued to be responsive to our every need, including providing my favorite ""Chocolate Amatller Barcelona"" almonds.

So all of the above was provided pre-cruise Nov 8-10.

On our return ""home"", that is to the Majestic Hotel post cruise, we were not required to wait for the afternoon check-in.  It was around 10 am when were again greeted by Karim.  We did feel we had returned home.

While awaiting our room, we were also greeted by Mr. Pascal Billard, Director General and General Manager.  It was so nice to see him again.  After all on our first visit's departure, he had walked my husband and I to our transfer car (provided by the hotel) as we said good bye to Barcelona and our fabulous hotel accommodations. Suite 905 is our suite.

Lastly, I must let all of you know that are reading this review, the Majestic Hotel's breakfast buffet is #1 in THE WORLD.  The breakfast buffet has been rated THE BEST.

This year Majestic Hotel (1918 to 2018) celebrates its 100 year anniversary.  It has undergone several renovations, all to enhance their accommodations and services.

Mr. Pascal Billard and his dedicated management team and staff are to be congratulated.  The hotel surely provides ""Royalty"" accommodations and service.

Thank you very much for your continued ""Royalty"" accommodations and service .

11,Absolute luxury supassing  many of the great hotels in large cities,"From check in to check out the staff of the hotel goes beyond expectations to make the stay special,  Front desk, concierge, dining room staff, and housekeeping were all  polite, professional, attentive, and made every effort to be sure our stay was special,  We were there for 5 nights in beautiful  very deluxe accommodations and could have stayed longer.  Location is great and easy to get to all the important sights.  .The day starts at on a very high note with the unbelievable breakfast buffet that caters to all tastes,",5,2018,11,23
11,It’s Majestic ,"District landmark hotel which doesn’t need an introduction. Immaculate rooms and service. Breakfast was so good it’s difficult to describe. Wait for a deal, and book in advance. This luxury can be yours for less than you think.",5,2018,11,23
11,Bravo Chef! SOLC is an exclusive Restaurant,"...What is Kilómetro zero?

11,One night stay,"A good hotel in the heart of high end shopping, check in was smooth and staff delightful.
Bedroom was comfortable however a little annoying not to have a separate shower, as usual not enough in the way of shower gel etc. The hotel must think only one person is staying in the room!
Hotels should take account that many couples shower evening & morning and one shower gel is not enough
We ate in the bar that evening which was good with a good selection, service was excellent.
Breakfast was very good however very very busy which probably you can’t do much about, not much space to move around in the restaurant due to it being full.
Would certainly use this hotel again if in the area.",4,2018,11,21
11,Scam liars,If I could give this a hotel a 0 I would I stayed there aug 11 and 12 not by choice only because a so called friend as of now recommended it they said they were giving a great room big nice clean and a wonderful view🤬🤬🤬🤮🤮horrible everything the room was really old and smelly the view was a old building that was getting construction and on the side of the building my room looked out to all people’s clothes from widows and plastic hanging from the buildings believe it or not it next to Gucci and all the others what a scam they then charge me for 3 nights when I only stayed 2 which I have proof went to a real gorgeous hotel that they care hotel de arts which is stunning on the beach gorgeous clean amazing views majestic is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in don’t let the location fool u when u check in they care less about if ur happy or not very pathetic people how I was treated still waiting for my money such liars doing anything to not give back what they owe stay at the beach de arts which is also the marriot and ritz gorgeous rooms and infinity pool don’t waste 5 cents at the majestic u will hate it,1,2018,11,19
11,A first class 5-star hotel,"My wife and I spent two nights at the Majestic Hotel. The accommodations were first class.
Our room was large and very well laid out. The bathroom was huge, clean, and bright.
The staff were attentive and helpful. Concierge Mario is tops at his position, always smiling and patient while he attended to our needs, whether it was for city directions, or a bagged breakfast for our very early airport departure.
All the staff were welcoming and efficient.
SOLC, the hotel restaurant, was equally first class in all respects.",5,2018,11,16
11,Great classy hotel,"The hotel has everything that 5 star hotel is expected to have. Great service, great rooms, amazing location. Prices are again as expected for a 5 star hotel in the heart of Barcelona. 
The only disappointing thing was the in-room dining food. It wasn’t so good. 
Other then that we had a lovely time. ",5,2018,11,15
11,Magnificent Grand Hotel,"Stayed here during its 100th Anniversary. Beautiful 
Hotel, excellent location, accommodating staff. No 
problems with early check in. Beautiful suite. Expensive. Breakfast is 37Euro! Would come back.
Concierge was very helpful.",5,2018,11,12
11,Gem of a Hotel,"My friends and I stayed in the apartments across the road. Fabulous location and really reasonable price. 
The apartment was a generous size, two rooms, two bathrooms and a large living area. 
We had full use of and access to all the facilities in the hotel. The rooftop bar is a must! 
We ate in the main bar on the first night, food was fab. Service was good. Staff are friendly and helpful. 
I would highly recommend this hotel for comfort & location ",5,2018,11,12
11,MARVELOUS ,"Exceptional service, location, attractiveness, security and cleanliness. Front desk staff and concierge personnel were outstanding - professional, responsive, knowledgeable, cooperative and charming. A visit to Barcelona is meaningful and memorable- that much more so as the result of a stay at the Majestic!!",5,2018,11,11
11,Always stay here when in Barcelona,"This hotel is very located. Everything is nearby or easily accessible by bus, taxi or subway. Excellent breakfast. Room clean and updated.  Staff is pleasant and speaks English. Concierge is very knowledgeable. Recommended ",5,2018,11,09
11,"The Spa, the rooftop and the deluxe rooms, exceptional","European travel is always a long haul coming to Hawaii.  After a very long flight the warmth and professionalism of Andre's welcome was greatly appreciated.  Although the room was not ready, we were met with a kindness and warm from all the staff.  From the staff at the lounge serving coffee to the kind and attentive staff at the rooftop bar.   The Spa staff was exceptional and the deep tissue massage was over the top.  Be certain to try the shower and steam experience.   The hotel is centrally located and walking distance from many areas of interest.   The breakfast buffet is not to be missed under any circumstances.  One of the most diverse and tasty breakfast experiences of any Leading Hotels thus far in my travels.",5,2018,11,05
11,Perfect location,"The Majestic is in a perfect location on Passeig de Gracia, similar to staying on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.  We wanted a suite, and the ""Junior Suite"" with view of Passeig de Gracia was truly a suite.  Many hotels list junior suites, which are actually one room with a sitting area, but this was actually a suite with a separate living room , beautifully decorated, heavy French doors separating the rooms, wonderful light and views in both directions on Passeig de Gracia.  We also enjoyed the breakfast, which is in a beautiful area with frescoes, comfortable seating, and a large selection of delicious food.  The breakfast is well worth it.  We want to thank Ariadna at the front desk concierge area, who was a pleasure to speak with, and she is very charming and professional and helped us with reservations.  The only negative is that the lobby tends to be quite busy, presumably with the cruise related business.  So the lobby feels more like a four star hotel.  Our junior suite, view, the location, breakfast and service all are five stars.   ",5,2018,11,03
11,Ideally located ,"You can’t have a better location than this property. Located on the main shopping street and close to most attractions. 
Excellent and friendly staff and service. Good breakfast. Excellent WiFi. 
The only downside is that it is getting a bit tired so it may be time for some renovation. 
Didn’t try the restaurants nor the gym so cannot comment on those. ",4,2018,11,02
11,Splendid!,"Second time here so it’s no coincidence: this marvelous hotel really makes you feel welcomed. Apart from the luxurious facility the staff will come out of their way to assist and pamper you. 
We had a beautiful suite which accommodated our family of four and had a nice balcony. 
Breakfast is considered as one of the best in the continent and justly so. 
Definitely my place to stay in Barca",5,2018,11,02
11,Stayed for one night after a cruise,"We were put up at the Majestic Hotel following a cruise.  The location is great, right in the middle of the city and where everyone wants to go.  The hotel was celebrating its 100 year anniversary.  It is well kept but part of it is showing its age.   As a cruise customer, we had the deluxe room purchased via the cruise line.  I found out after checking in that deluxe at this location means the lowest category--and we had exactly that.  The room was small, the furniture was mismatched and old (not antique) and the beds were not much to say anything nice about.  I went back to reservations after seeing our traveling companion’s room which was much nicer and larger but was told there was nothing they would do for me as we had the category of room that was paid for.
 We had two twin beds pushed together. My wife's bed sloped so much that while rolling over during the night she fell out of bed and hit her head on the nightstand.  She still has a spot that is sore from the event.  There was a nice breakfast the next morning.  We ate and checked out for the airport.  I have stayed in many hotels, but the room at this location was a disappointment.  I did have a great view of the fire escape.  Apparently they have nice rooms--we just did not have one of them.  I would not stay here again in the same category.",4,2018,10,31
11,Hotel search,"We are very pleased with our stay at the magestic hotel the only advise I have is make sure the bellman puts all your laugage in the car / taxi I trusted it was done and went on our cruise withought an important peace left behind , when back I received no help until I involved a manager which I did after several phone calls with no results,  in one of my conversations with the phone rep she uncaringly suggested  I go to the hotel and look for my lost bag (that  would have cost us about € 100 round trip) needles to say this is when I asked for a manager .. after many hours of waiting at the airport, when the hotel delivered my bag I was surprised not to even find a we are sorry courtesy note  for all my troubles.... My final words are : the location the food and the hotel are superb and exceptional and located in the best part of town , just make sure all your language gets put into your limousine/ taxi service before you leave !",5,2018,10,31
11,great location and fabulous roof-top bar,"Recently stayed at the Majestic Hotel in Barcelona.  I have to say the location is probably the best you are going to get in the city in terms of walking to shops and restaurants.  The upscale shopping is right out the front door and excellent restaurants all with in short walking distances. The Hop-On/Off bus was also located right outside the front of the hotel for sightseeing so I would give this hotel a 5 regarding location.  The hotel itself was very crowded and busy for the 3 nights we stayed and so service was not top notch as one would expect from this hotel.  The hotel itself was beautiful decorated on the inside blending the old with the modern.  My particular room (232) was probably the worst room in the hotel and I think the reason I was given this room because I checked in very late and the hotel was full and this was probably the last room they had.  Our travel agent had noted that my check in would be late and had booked these rooms months in advance. I was also a single traveler.  Two people could not have stayed in this room.  I paid extra for this room as I wanted a street view of the city, however it was located on the 2nd floor and there was nothing to see outside, and it was noisy all night long every night.  The room was so tiny that I had to put my suitcases against the front door at night just to move around, and then move them when I wanted to go out.  I looked on the back of the door where to go for emergency where the plans were the my floor.  My room was probably used as a linen closet at one time being it was so small compared to the other rooms. On the inside the location contributed to being the number 1 worst room.  Outside the split level floor were a set of stone stairs that you had to walk up/down to go to the elevator which was very close.  It was also very noisy when people were checking in/out  slamming their baggage up/down the stairs located outside my room. My other friends rooms (which they paid less) had beautiful rooms that were much larger and there rooms were rooms looked over a small courtyard, which was very quiet.  It as also very quite in the hallway because there were no split levels.  The breakfast was outstanding (included with our room) and the room was again beautifully decorated and the roof-top bar is a must.  The view from this bar of the city was breath taking, however there was a wait and was not given a priority even though we were staying at the hotel.  Rating..location a 5, hotel decor a 4, and service a 3.  My room a flat zero.",4,2018,10,30
11,A Majestic Hotel,"This hotel is well located in an expansive city. The rooms were well appointed, even if on the small side. The food was tasty as we ate dinner there one evening. They served one of the most interesting ice cream desserts I've ever ordered. Our room was in the front of the hotel overlooking the main street. As Virtuoso travelers, I was hoping for a better upgrade, but was satisfied by the room I received. Our view overlooked the city! The breakfast was included in our rate. The breakfast buffet was absolutely the best breakfast buffet I have had at any hotel in Europe. It was super with so many options, both hot and cold. I look forward to returning to Barcelona and staying at the Majestic!",5,2018,10,29
11,Neither Gaudi nor Gaudy,"A lovely and modern place to stay along Barcelona’s Champs Elysees, the Majestic fits in well with the surroundings, has well-appointed and comfortable rooms (if some are a tad tight), a helpful and pleasant staff, modern amenities, a sumptuous breakfast, and a rooftop pool and bar/restaurant that, while a bit small, is a delight with fetching views of a beautiful city. It is well located in terms of both walkability and availability to and of many attractions and local offerings, while also a reasonable taxi ride away from the rest in this spread-out City. The staff and Concierges are informative, eager and pleasant, and the public spaces are modern though comfortably welcoming. We didn’t find it particularly luxurious, but neither is our house: the Majestic made quite a fine home away from home in this terriffic city.",4,2018,10,27
11,If you can stay at the Majestic Hotel,"Majestic Hotel is not on the reasonable side for cost. I will stay again and perhaps ask for a couple more amenities.  We did have breakfast included and a nice credit for food. It is a lovely, gracious hotel.  Our room was large, quite and very nice. The breakfast was a buffet and had everything you can imagine for breakfast---even Champagne.  We had a late dinner in the bar one night and it was excellent.
Staff must be mentioned--they are wonderful, helpful, friendly and go beyond the extra step to assist you.
The location is perfect for walking, shopping and dining.
If it is in your budget--make it your hotel--you will not regret the decision.",5,2018,10,25
11,"A lovely Palace, truely Majestic","Staying at the Majestic Hotel was an excellent choice. We could walk to two Guadi spots, sample restaurants and enjoy a great view of the city.  The service was excellent and the room comfortable.  We especially enjoyed a drink and snack on the top terrace overlooking the city.",5,2018,10,18
11,Beautiful hotel but small rooms for the money...,"We stayed here one night after a cruise that ended in Barcelona.  We chose this hotel because of its location and it’s part of the Virtuoso family.  
Its a beautiful old hotel, clearly historic and elegant but we were disappointed in the room size.  This is not a cheap hotel and the room was quite small and rather plain in decor.  The bathroom was quite nice, good size, large shower, but the bedroom itself was quite small with really not much of a view.  We travel a lot all over the world and have done a lot in Europe and even some of the older grander hotels we have stayed in had decent size rooms.  We did not stay in one of the lower category rooms either.  
Would we stay here again? Yes, for the location....but next time we go back to Barcelona, we will probably look for another hotel in same location with a bit larger room if we are going to spend that kind of money.",3,2018,10,14
11,Spain before our cruise,"This is an exceptional hotel.  I have stayed in Barcelona before at another very expensive hotel and this one was an upgrade.  The room was upgraded to a suite for free and which included heated towel racks and slipped layer out for bed time.  Normally not our things, but it was the little things all done extremely well that made our stay great.  Try the breakfast buffet, fresh honey comb and more Spanish style food along with some American classics.",5,2018,10,10
11,Best location in Barcelona,"The hotel is located at Passeig de Gràcia one of the major avenues in Barcelona and one of its most important shopping and business areas. The best shopping is just few steps from the hotel. We arrived bit early and they didn’t give us our room until the exact check in time ( 3 pm). The lobby was crowded as everyone was waiting for their room. We booked a two bed room apartment and to our shock it was in a separate building and we should across the street to go to the apartment. The other building has no lobby or reception but it was very clean and you enter the building with your room key. I was so happy when I saw the apartment. Man, it’s so huge! The biggest hotel accommodation I have ever stayed in. Soooo spacious. It has balconies overlook the Passeig de Gràcia. Gucci, Chanel and Dior boutique can be seen from the living room. The kitchen is modern and fully equipped. Highly recommended for a family with teenagers. There is a nice cafe at the roof of the hotel main building but bit pricy. The hotel’s swimming pool is so small...It’s little bit bigger than a jacuzzi.  ",5,2018,10,09
11,AMAZING / GREAT LOCATION,"Was here just for one night after finishing a Mediterranean cruise - should’ve stayed another night or two.  Beautiful 5 star hotel, great location with numerous high end shops and plenty of restaurants all around you. The rooftop bar is an amazing place to see the city while having a cocktail and conversation. On the high end of $$$$. My only quirk was the layout and maneuvering luggage up and down stairs.",4,2018,10,08
11,Five days in Barcelona,My wife and two adult kids stayed at the Majestic in one of the Apartments across the street from the main hotel. We had a two bedroom two bath apartment. The place was beautiful and very comfortable. The service was great. I would stay there again.,5,2018,10,06
11,Fantastic!,"My husband and I were fortunate enough to win this holiday and we have had the best time!
From arriving at the hotel to departing. Everyone is so courteous and friendly. I couldn’t thank everyone enough.
I only wish there was tea in the rooms as I’m not a coffee drinker but I didn’t mind too much as I could order it. The shower is to die for. Speakers in the bathroom so you have music on whilst you bathe!
Everything you could imagine at breakfast! Didn’t have to queue at all for a table. You weren’t rushed at all.
The rooms are so sound proof that you can’t hear the hustle of the roads unless you open the doors.
We had an executive suite which I highly recommend. Such wonderful views.
I could go on. Just book it and experience it!",5,2018,10,05
11,Fine Hotel in Barcelona ,"Used my Amex to book this hotel.  Truly outstanding.   Great location. Easy access to walk or inexpensive Taxi ride to all the best parts of Barcelona.  Fabulous breakfast which was included with the Amex booking and spa credit.   The rooftop bar must be the best in the city.  Saturday afternoon they had a DJ and the place was happening.  Quieter the last few nights but a great place to take in the view and have a few cocktails.  One of the finest hotels we have ever stayed in.  Hotel has class,style and charm.  If you are looking for a true pampering, stay at the Majestic. ",5,2018,10,03
11,Simply stunning hotel!,"This hotel is 5+ all the time.  The hotel is beautiful and in a great location next to a lot of high end shopping.  The hotel staff is amazing and works to make sure your every need is being met day in and out.  We spent 4 magnificant days here with friends and I would come back to Barcelona just to stay at this hotel again.  The rooms are so comfortable that you just do not want to leave and the breakfast buffet is amazing.  Highly, highly recommend staying here when in Barcelona.",5,2018,10,03
11,Wonderful Rooftop for sunset/evening viewing,"Of all the rooftop recommendations, we liked the Majestic the best.  The sunset was spectacular, the drinks were top notch, and we met a wonderful person from Sweden while we were there.  Definitely recommend it for rooftop viewing of Barcelona.",5,2018,10,02
11,Beautiful Hotel,"Loved this hotel!!! Great location, impeccable service, lovely rooms and an over the top rooftop bar and pool!! Gorgeous view of Barcelona! Breakfast buffet was just amazing!! Everything you had ever thought of for breakfast!!!",5,2018,10,02
11,A true 5 star hotel,"I am extremely picky and this hotel more than exceeded my expectations! We stayed there for 4 nights, we all wish it had been longer!  This place was value for money.  We were going to stay at the Ritz Carlton but decided not to as we had our older children with us so we needed two rooms.  Well, I feel this hotel was just as nice as the Ritz.  The staff is excellent in all areas.  It is extremely clean and in a great neighborhood.  You walk out the door and Chanel and Gucci are right next door. It's a great mix for all level of shoppers in this neighborhood.  The roof top bar is fun and the food is pretty good.  Our room was VERY spacious (more than enough room for two tall people and 4 pieces of luggage).  I highly recommend you staying here.  When we go back to Barcelona, we'll definitely stay here again!",5,2018,09,30
11,wow!   Great hotel and great service,"We were at the majestic for 7 nights on our 25th wedding anniversary.   Everything about this hotel was perfect.   The location is ideal for seeing the whole city.   The hotel is old world but totally redone to modern standards.   As soon as we checked in Enetz Arzak took us to see our room and make sure our entire trip was perfect.   The rooftop pool and deck is great for drinks and the great view.   We especially thought the housekeeping staff did a terrific job each day and night on our room.   But during our whole stay we never saw any of the housekeeping staff.   They were like invisible but did a great job.   Also the beds and pillows were very very comfortable.   Lastly make sure you meet the concierge Angle who has worked at the hotel for 45 years.   

thanks majestic hotel for a great time.",5,2018,09,30
11,Great stay,"This hotel is the pure essence of what a 5 star should be. I cannot praise the staff enough, everyone went that extra mile that makes for a great stay. A special word for Angel the concierge that helped us out in a very professional manner. The lobby bar staff, we got freshly made ice tea, but really every single member of staff deserve praise. We decided to spend a day in la Rocca village outlet, and the concierge on duty gave us discount vouchers and on top of that arranged free comfortable transfer to and from the village. We were even greeted upon arrival there and brought to the lounge.
The room was spacious and comfortable , the bathroom also, spotless clean. The hotel is grandiose and it really makes your stay special.
Well done ! We will most certainly be back",5,2018,09,30
11,Perfect location,"Spent three nights here as part of a vacation with my 20 something daughters.  We had two rooms and at check in they upgraded mine to get the attached room to my girls.  Service was excellent, warmly greeted and concierge helpful. This hotel is a grande dame and not at all trendy Barcelona, but its location makes up for it.  Rooms are nicely furnished and well equipped.  Perfect for what we needed.  ",4,2018,09,27
11,"Wonderful Hotel, Central Location","We really enjoyed our 2 night stay at the Majestic in Barcelona.  We received a very kind welcome from the GM, Mr. Billard along with the rest of the staff.  The property is lovely with great amenities in a fantastic location - just a block from Gaudi's Casa Battlo.   Our room was very comfortable with a lovely view.  Also since we arrived on a very warm day, what a perfect way to shake the jet lag by enjoying the lovely roof deck and small pool.  Also note, breakfast is wonderful.  The room is lovely and the choices and selections are outstanding.",5,2018,09,21
11,Comfort at a sublime location,"Great location smack in the city centre, elegant professional staff, cosy rooftop with a dj and a fabulous breakfast with plenty of healthy options. Only downside is the rooftop pool which is hilariously minuscule... rather an oversized 'bath' than a 'pool'. If you're into serious swimming, there's the 50m Olympic piscina Sant Jordi at 8 minutes by taxi/Uber.",5,2018,09,19
11,Fabulous ,The Majestic lives up to its reputation. The location is perfect in the middle of the Passeig Gràcia . On check in we were upgraded to a much bigger room overlooking  Passeig Gràcia. The staff were friendly and extremely helpful. We loved the roof top bar . Would definitely return! ,5,2018,09,18
11,Extremely Disappointed,"Hotel felt like a bait and switch.  The first room was horrible and was nothing like the photo of the room booked.  And although promised an upgrade as a member of the Fine Hotels program, the hotel did not do so until I provided evidence such rooms were still available, despite the hotel's statements to the contrart.  The next room, while much bigger, had terrible noise problems from the elevator lobby area and room next door.  

Hotel also nickels and dimes guests by, for example, charging for the Nespresso coffee pods in the room (Why advertise the coffee machines in room and not provide coffee free of charge?).  

Breakfast was nice quality, but it did not change at all from day to day and became boring very quickly.  

Staff members were a mixed bag.  Some friendly but others just downright rude.  The guy who works as a server in the bar was extremely inattentive and abrupt.

The pool was closed a good part of the time I was there during warm May days.

The massage was top notch, however.

Will be staying elsewhere on the next trip to Barcelona.",2,2018,09,17
11,Outstanding we vote number 1 in Barcelona!,Happy 100th Birthday Majestic ! That alone should be an indication of the level of service and accommodations you will experience here. First the location outstanding and dare I say next to the Chanel  boutique. The ambience old world with sophistication yet updated to meet the changing times. Everyone is very helpful in every way possible.  They must know when we leave the room for breakfast because when we returned our room had been serviced.The rooftop bar voted in the top ten of the world lives up to its reputation. The breakfast is unbelievable have you ever seen a buffet with bees wax dripping fresh honey? Simply out of this world. We spent time last year in Barcelona and of course this year and will return next year it has quickly become one of our favorite cities and staying at the grand Majestic is the icing on the cake.,5,2018,09,16
11,Wonderful,"Top notch service and accommodations. The staff was warm and welcoming and bent over backwards to anticipate your every need. 

The location was ideal. The roof top bar offered wonderful views of the city. We walked/biked everywhere by choice.  

On a side note...best tapas in Barcelona at Quimet y quimet. Do not miss it. Well worth the wait!",5,2018,09,16
11,"High quality hotel, great location.","We had a lovely stay at the Hotel Majestic.  The staff was very helpful.  My husband got ill and the concierge called a doctor in to see him.  They assisted us in a trip to the hospital. So very grateful that were were staying in a hotel with a knowledgeable concierge.  The room, while small was comfortable for the two of us and the bathroom (and especially the shower) was terrific.  I felt very cared for during our stay!  Thank you!",5,2018,09,12
11,Wonderful stay at Hotel Majestic,"My wife and I are newlyweds and we found that Hotel Majestic had a wonderful and friendly staff who gave suggestions, and advice on where to go and what to do in Barcelona.  Clean and luxurious facilities filled with amenities and a comfortable room that is cozy with the softest bedding ever.  Thank you Hotel Majestic.",5,2018,09,08
11,Greatly Overpriced,$800 for a medium size room with very limited closet space and few drawers.  Significant street noise.  Booked through American Express and was told I received an  upgraded room.  Clean and in a good location but way too expensive.,1,2018,09,06
11,Better than Ever!!,"I wrote a review one year ago - I am in charge of a large medical meeting in Barcelona and we stay at the Majestic because of its location and its great reputation.  Once again, it is in the best of the best category -- great location, great service, and they attend to every detail.  If you are looking for luxury in Barcelona, look no further -- you will be glad you stayed at the Majestic.",5,2018,09,04
11,Quick and easy,Needed a one night stay somewhere with my family of 5 I’m Barcelona the night before going back home. They offered us an across the street apartment since we had 3 kids and they are technically not allowed to put 5 in a room. (Always wonder if that’s true or not).  We stayed in AirBnB for 2 weeeks so one night of luxury actually sounded pretty good. My kids hung and ate at the small rooftop pool with amazing views of Barcelona all around them. The one night with pool tab for the family probably cost me 3 nights of the AirBnB but it was worth it.  They told us they would charge us 50 Euros for an extra bed but they never brought it. We did find it on the bill though so we got them to remove it. ,4,2018,09,02
11,Fantastic,"We spent 4 nights with our one and a half year old son and could not find any faults with the hotel. We were upgraded to a larger room upon check in and the room was equipped with a baby cot and a range of baby supplies. Service was excellent throughout our stay. The location directly on Passeig de Gracia is also excellent  as it is walking distance to most attractions, with many restaurants nearby. 

Great hotel, highly recommended! ",5,2018,08,31
11,Probably the best hotel in Barcelona,"Prime, central location among major boutiques, attentive personnel, clean, cozy, comfort - Majestic has it all. Valet parking adds additional comfort. Had a wonderful massage at the spa. Breakfast is a real feast, one of the best we ever experienced. Definitely a place to come back again.",5,2018,08,30
11,Faultless 5 star luxury and service. ,"We stayed here in 2014 and loved it so came back on our next visit to Barcelona to experience the most amazing friendly service from unbelievable staff. The location is unbeatable for the city , on the equivalent to London’s Bond Street with the very best designer shops in walking distance and all of Goudis houses , Sagrada Familia and Park Guell within walking distance. The breakfast buffet is as good as any you will experience and the rooftop cocktail bar and pool are the envy of all hotels , the rooms are lovely . I must say a special thank you all the staff who do everything to make your stay amazing . ",5,2018,08,29
11,Great stay,Our stay in the Majestic was amazing. The service is top notch and you cant beat the location. Our room was very clean and conformable. We enjoyed the amenities including the lobby bar and restaurants. Check out the rooftop pool and cocktail bar with beautiful views of the city.,5,2018,08,28
11,5-star luxury at its finest,"I just can't say enough good about this hotel. This is my second time staying here and it was as good as the first time. From the spectacular views from the rooftop bar and swimming pool, to the exceptional service at the front door and desk, to the out of this world breakfast, this is truly the finest hotel I have ever stayed in.",5,2018,08,27
11,Review for the rooftop bar ,"On our way back to our hotel we decided to go for a quick drink before calling it a night! We have always walked past this hotel and I’ve always been interested in trying out their rooftop bar! Upon entering the hotel we asked the door host if it was okay for non guest to use the rooftop bar and he happily told us we could use it and showed us the way up, which was a relief as I thought they’d be a little bit intimidating or snotty but that definitely wasn’t the case at all, we even had a laugh upon conversation :) the staff at the rooftop bar were very attentive and staff that was walking by too always had a smile on their faces which makes them approachable :) the cocktails were delicious! And loved the olives and nuts that came with the drinks too! That was a bonus for me :) so next time I find myself in Barcelona I’ll definitely be visiting the rooftop bar again! Hey, I might even look into booking a room here :) ",4,2018,08,26
11,It is in name as it is in experience - great stay ,"We found this place on our last visit to Barcelona. We happened to look up one day whilst walking and noticed people on the roof top where we discovered the best rooftop bar with views of all of Barcelona including Sagrada.

Breakfast bar was one of the best we have experienced. 

Our room was a little compact compared to some of the other hotels but as usual the team of staff made it a real pleasure each day. 

Rooftop pool, bar and lounge is key benefit. 

It’s situated in the middle of a beautiful shopping precinct. 

Clean, lavish and wonderfully looked after the hotel was a wonderful place to stay. 

",5,2018,08,25
11,Get pampered! The best roof top and all over service in Barcelona ....,"Old but updated glamour, a rooftop with one of the best views of the city, and the service is impeccable. The rooms are spacious and the house keeping is folding your pyjamas and putting out the slippers for you every night...And the location is prime",5,2018,08,24
11,Excellent at Multiple Levels!,"My family stayed at the Majestic for three nights.  We enjoyed it immensely.  We had a larger room with a sleep sofa in a separate area of the room which our two kids shared.  The room itself was quite lovely.  It was comfortable, clean and quiet.  I personally thought the rain shower in the bathroom was excellent.  

The hotel was very well located and close to many shops, cafes and several of the Gaudi buildings we had come to see.  It was a reasonable walk (downhill) to the main plaza and La Rambla.  But we did not have to go that far for good food or walking. The many side and parallel streets to the hotel were loaded with places to eat and relax.

I would like to recognize the staff for excellent service.  From our time walking in very early one morning till our departure, they were very nice, helpful and accommodating.  They also acknowledged my birthday before we left by sending a great bottle of Cava to the room.  Nice touch that was greatly appreciated!

My only very minor issue, and it really was not much of an issue, is that the pool on the roof is smaller than it might appear in the picture.  It is more of a dunking pool and not a real swimming pool. Important from a child looking to take a swim perspective.  Also important because if you are going to the roof to look at the spectacular views that are there, you might be thinking about taking a swim.  It is pretty toasty in the afternoon on the roof deck.  It is very nice.  But toasty.

The Majestic is not inexpensive.  But you get what you pay for.  In this case, an excellent hotel in a great location with a very good staff.  It helped make our trip to Barcelona a great success.  We would definitely recomend and would stay there again.",5,2018,08,24
11,Family Trip,"We stayed at this hotel for 6 night as part of our family vacation in Spain. The property is great and recently renovated.  The Junior Suite has decent size for a family of 2 kids. The sofa bed was comfortable and the baby crib was readily available. 
We liked the breakfast and roof top which had a small but cute swimming pool with a bar. The food overall was great whether in the Room or restaurants. 
We did have an unusual incident where a stranger followed my wife into the hotel and into the elevator. When we notified security, they found the individual and let him go rather than report him to police. That was disappointing as it was a traumatizing situation for my wife. The elevators have a Room card reader installed but it’s not operational as of yet.  The hotel management subsequently tried to reassure us that security would be increased in the property.  The staff took our concerns seriously and did alert the police after we insisted on the matter. 
There was an error with the checkout where my credit card we charged 2x for the same amounts. I had to call and notify the hotel and after 2 days of looking into the matter, the double charge was credit back to my card.
Overall, I would have rated the hotel Very Good if it was not for those 2 incidents.",3,2018,08,19
11,WORLD-CLASS HOTEL AND STAFF!!!,"My wife and I stayed at the Majestic Hotel and Spa on our first trip to Barcelona. We were blown away by the staff’s friendliness, professionalism, willingness to go out of their way to help in every way possible, and world class service!!! Having stayed in many 5-Star hotels, we can absolutely say that this hotel was not only a luxurious, beautiful 5-Star hotel, but also a world class hotel in a perfect central location!!! Our concierge was phenomenal and one of the best we have ever encountered! Mario helped plan the most romantic dinner for our 5th wedding anniversary and laid out our trip perfectly! Ariadna was not only a phenomenal concierge but a kind-hearted, fantastic human being that not only helped plan our stay in Barcelona perfectly, but also took a sincere interest in our baby girl that just started walking back home (while we were away) and always asked about her progress. She even went out of her way to help secure the best accommodations for us in our next stop (Madrid) through her connections at the hotel we were planned to stay at! Needless to say, we will definitely be staying at the Majestic Hotel, and only this exceptional hotel, in our return trips to Barcelona!!!",5,2018,08,15
11,Mrs Bhikha,We stayed in this hotel for 5 days and it was so lovely and friendly. The staff were extra nice and very helpful. It was 5 star 💫 clean and luxury. The roof top bar was very pretty at night and also had great views day and night.. if I can to Barcelona again I wouldn’t stay anywhere but here..,5,2018,08,10
11,Luxury and Location,"We stayed at the Majestic from July 31 to August 3 in a Junior Suite facing the Passeig Gracias.

Doorman and Checkin:  Excellent.  We had hired a car/driver from the airport after a direct flight from Chicago.  (This turned out perfect as a taxi strike had tied up roads) We were immediately greeted and our name forwarded to the front desk.  Check-in was quick and the room we reserved was ready for our slightly early arrival.

Exterior and Lobby:  Excellent.  The exterior appearance is luxurious and gracious.  The interior lobby is simply grand in a traditional fashion with fantastic art.  It is a spotless hotel that looks perfect in its upkeep.  There is a small army of friendly team members who are very happy to help with any question and seemed to recognize us within 30 seconds of our arrival.

Room:  Wonderful.  Spacious and perfectly maintained.  The view over the Passeig Gracias and further in the distance the Olympic torch was inspiring.  Our Guest Service manager who took us upstairs explained the room functions etc. in perfect fashion and was followed instantly by our luggage.  The process was smooth, professional, and efficient.  While the temperature outside was close to setting a new all time high, the air conditioning was silently working to perfection.

Lounge and Restaurant:  We had a drink in the lounge followed by a perfect meal in the restaurant on our first night.  We can highly recommend both.

Overall:  This is truly a five star property that knows exactly what to do to keep that rating.  From the second we arrived to departure, the team was obviously proud of what they have accomplished and were wonderful to interact with during our stay.   The building and facilities are delightfully designed, decorated, and maintained.",5,2018,08,08
11,Magic,"It’s a perfect five star hotel. The staff, the room, the concierge, everything was satisfied. At a perfect city spot, with excellent restaurants around. The breakfast was delicious. Generally we had a great time in Barcelona.",5,2018,08,08
11,Top of comfort,"Never been in such a comfortable place. So soft carpets, wonderful large beds, great breakfast and kind staff. Highly recommended (if you can afford... it is not cheap, but the quality compensates the price)",5,2018,08,06
11,The Place to Stay,"Location, location, location!   On the Paseo de Gracia, diametrically across from Casa Batllo!   This fantastic luxury hotel is the perfect place to stay in the city.
Our check in was very smooth and the staff are excellent.   The lobby is beautiful and similar to other fine hotels has a signature scent throughout the hotel.
Our executive view room was large and had a king bed as well as a sleeper sofa that doubled as a bed for our son at night.   The bed was very comfortable and the linens exuded luxury.    The bathroom is well sized.    The fixtures appeared modern and everything worked properly.
The only meal I ate at the hotel was breakfast - as you will have read in other reviews, this is quite the experience and not to be missed.   The range and variety is amazing.
The hotel always appeared to be very clean.

Two points of improvement - 
1. the airconditioning in the room could be stronger, Barcelona was hot in July and we had to have maintenance clean out the filter, which helped.
2. I would have liked for the room to leave us bottles of water daily as other fine hotels do.

That being said, this is a wonderful hotel and I will be back next year!
",5,2018,08,04
11,Luxury,"Majestic hotel was on our previous visit to Barcelona. Very luxurious. Right on Passeig the Gracias, which you have all the main luxury boutiques like Chanel and Louis Vuitton. Walking distance to major venues in Barrcelona.",5,2018,08,04
11,Amazing location,"The hotel is in the heart of Barcelona shopping area. Lovely and friendly staff. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. Children friendly. Lovely pool and spa   Breakfast was delicious. If I were to go back to Barcelona, would definitely stay here again A++++
",5,2018,07,29
11,Hotel and Spa Carla,"I highly recommend this hotel, the attention and service is the best. The room, bathroom, mini bar was super excellent. Think twice and choose this hotel for staying at barcelona. Very near from interesting places.",5,2018,07,29
11,Fourth Time Not a Charm!,"I have reviewed the Majestic in the past and had always loved (and recommended) this hotel.  What I realize now is that there is a great disparity between rooms, which alters the overall comfort of the visit, and...with so many interns now working at reception and as waitstaff....the personalized relationship with experienced staff members has also diminished.  We always knew the staff well and felt they were extremely accommodating.  This changed.  Frankly, some of the hotel rooms are in dire need of updating. I know some rooms are fabulous, as I've stayed in those previously.  However, in the room one of us had on this trip, there was a comfy bed with down pillows with a small balcony.  Another one of us had a room with no balcony and it was dreary at best.  In our room, the bed was hard as a rock and the pillows were lumpy. There was no duvet on the bed either.  Needless to say, it wasn't our best hotel experience.  In addition, the lighting is poor in the bathroom and much of the furniture is old and marred. They need to redo this and update it accordingly.  Although the breakfast is still one of our favorite hotel breakfasts, these other factors have made me rethink the Majestic.",4,2018,07,27
11,best hotel in Barcelona,"One of the best hotels in Barcelona. Located in the heart of the city within walking distance to major attractions. It is very convenient to shop while living in this hotel, all the major shops are also very close. good breakfast.",5,2018,07,27
11,Loved This Hotel. Best Location,We have the best time at this hotel! The location is the best! Service is 10 stars. I would go again. We stayed in the penthouse and the view was amazing over looking the city. Drinks are really good.,5,2018,07,26
11,Best apartment ever,"Because I travel for business, I prefer to stay in apartments not hotel rooms on vacation. The Majestic Residences offer the best of both worlds. Spacious, well-appointed apartment with complete kitchens, washer/dryer, outdoor terrace, excellent a/c, secure, and the benefit of daily housekeeping and room service. Also, access to all the hotel has to offer, including concierge services, gym, spa, etc. My family enjoyed every minute at the Majestic, and found every member of the staff to be first-rate. Special thanks to Alvaro at the front desk who went above and beyond to make us feel especially welcome.",5,2018,07,17
11,Perfect stay,"We loved staying at the Majestic hotel. We had a beautiful view of the city, incredibly comfortable bed, and amazing food. Our favorite thing was the breakfast that was included each morning! They offered everything you could want and I can not wait to go back.",5,2018,07,16
11,A Majestic experience,"In English, the word majestic means ""having majesty; stately & grand.""  In Barcelona, the Majestic Hotel and Spa embodies all of those qualities. From the moment we arrived (on Sant Jordi's Day) we were treated royally. About the bellmen, front desk personnel, housekeepers, and the wait staff we have only praise. We were made to feel genuinely welcome at this spectacular hotel during our three nights there. The location was also perfect, in the heart of the city. We had requested an early check-in, but due to high occupancy the evening before, our room was not ready. We checked our luggage with the bellman and left to explore the city. On our return to the hotel, our luggage had already been taken to our room (suite!). Our suite was exquisite and we enjoyed the beautiful views from our balcony overlooking Passeig de Gracia, the best street in Barcelona, in addition to those from the roof top pool/bar area. Breakfast featured anything you could imagine for breakfast and we thoroughly enjoyed dinner in their Restaurant SOLC. There were also numerous restaurants very close to the hotel. We will choose the Majestic again and again whenever our travels take us to Barcelona.",5,2018,07,16
11,majestic hotel,Great hotel with excellent staff. Nice area for shopping and restaurants. Terrific patio views from 10th floor. Breakfast is excellent. Helpful concierge. Quiet. Art in building is very interesting. Would come again.,4,2018,07,15
11,Terrace and more ,"Views all over the city and nice drinks and ambience. 5 J ham slicer on site. Not cheap but worth the visit. When visiting at night please expect some waiting list. 
Great profesional multilingual attention ",4,2018,07,14
11,Gorgeous hotel,"Stayed in the hotel on multi occasions recently. Very conveniently located on the main street, but a bit far from the walking street and old town. Since it is an old building, rooms have quite many different layouts. Some are quite spacious, some are quite cramp, barely enough to move. Refreshing water is provided during check-in.

The hotel provides a small bottle of perfume for guests to sprinkle on their bedding before going to bed. Other amenities are well stocked. Still water is provided every night to the room. I visited the rooftop pool side bar, which is quite windy at times, but have a great panoramic view of the city.

Breakfast is top notch. Very nice interior. The garden terrace is even better. Though limited choice of hot dishes, other dishes complement the shortcoming. Service is however, requires brushing up and needs to be improved.

Reception and concierge service is, on the other hand very good and considerate. All in all a very nice hotel that deserve high rating.",4,2018,07,13
11,Great location but a disappointment,"I know that when arriving early at a hotel, there is no right ro an early check-in. However , after 24 hours of flying, we had no choice about our arrival time. I knew that the hotel was likely to be pretty full and was prepared to wait.
 Well run hotels go out of their way to help guests who arrive early, by reallocating rooms, ensuring that housekeeping focus on badly rooms etc.
 The Majestic staff made the right noises but failed the test. Basically , no one cared.

The Majestic has 2 things really going for it. A great location and  roof top bar, with views to die for.

Apart from that, it is apparent that this is hotel used by cruise lines for their passengers and that is a real killer of atmosphere. It is not a friendly, boutique hotel but a corporate service provider.

I normally give generous reviews but I struggled here and it wasn't just the dismal check in. The balcony room was very small for the rate charged, the TV had no sound, the breakfast option was only an expensive buffet.

We had 4 nights in Barcelona and I'm glad that we only spent 2 at the Majestic.",3,2018,07,12
11,Relaxing and plush,Stayed for 2 nights after a Mediterranean cruise with family. Excellent rooms and wonderful breakfast. Highly recommend this hotel for the location to all the must see Gaudi architecture. Beware of pick pockets in Barcelona but we didn’t have any problems with that. Visit La Pedrera and La Segrada Famillia but buy tickets online to avoid the que. ,5,2018,07,11
11,Centrally located GEM,"The Majestic Hotel was suggested by a close friend of mine who is from Barcelona.  Could not have had a better suggestion.  The Majestic is located in the center of the city near all the best Shopping.  Our rooms were updated with all the modern amenities but still had the traditional feel.  Would recommend the Majestic for all types of travel, business, vacation, and family trips.",5,2018,07,09
11,Great location.  Love the rooftop!  Great staff.,"Great location. We made extensive use of the rooftop!  Staff were incredibly helpful and had excellent recommendations for food.  We stayed in an apartment across the street so just know that room services can take some time - however, our unit was pretty large and nicely appointed with a quiet deck.",5,2018,07,09
11,Center of Barcelona and Gaudi,"The Hotel is a block from 2 Gaudi masterpieces.  It is on a easy walking street and the Hotel Staff is amazing!
They can and will arrange tours recommend neighborhood restaurants.  The hotel caters to it's guests to the minute detail. By far one of the best breakfast buffets I've ever encountered and the view of the city from the rooftop pool and bar is amazing. Staying at the Majestic will enhance your visit to Barcelona!",5,2018,07,09
11,Best service and a great hotel!,"We really enjoyed our time in the Majestic hotel. The rooftop terrace is beautifull and the staff in the hotel is very friendly. Espcially Maaike from the breakfast made us feel so welcome and she gave us many tips about what to do in Barcelona. The hotel is located in the most beautifull street of Barcelona and close to everything needed. 

This was our first time in Majestic but not the last one. We are lookinf forward to come back!",4,2018,07,09
11,Outstanding hotel,Excellent location. Staff are friendly and speak English but are extremely patient if you are trying to converse in Spanish even if it has been quite a while since trying to speak it. The brunch is spectacular and sets the tone for the entire day. It is an easy walk to the Rival or Gothic sections. Wonderful places to eat and drink throughout the day and evening. An excellent experience.,5,2018,07,08
11,"Not enough time, love this hotel","Located in the Center of everything, steps to the Rambla, this hotel was a gem.  My only regret is not being able to stay longer.  Truly helpful service, great recommendations of where to go given the abbreviated schedule.  The room was elegant, spacious, wonderful balcony with spectacular views both day and night.  Great shopping, restaurants nearby.  Next time will spend more time there - great place to stay in Barcelona.",5,2018,07,06
11,As the name says: Majestic,"This hotel is amazing. Located near Casa Mila and Casa Batlo, to mention a few great marvels of Barcelona, this hotel offers the charm of an old building with the commodities of modern life. Their staff is well trained, they were very helpful with us, especially Andrei, and the girl from Honduras at the breakfast area. Also, their concierge is spot on. We had the best dining experience in Barcelona thanks to them.
The room was beautiful. The bed was heaven, the pillows were out of this world and the attention to detail in every single thing in our room was impeccable. They let us a note and a couple of perfumes by the pillows. Also, a small side of fine chocolate.
The breakfast, even though is an extra in some cases, it is worth it. There are so many things to eat, but their ""pan tomate"" is the best you could have in Barcelona. 
I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,07,05
11,Extremely nice,"My wife and I stayed at the Majestic following a long cruise, just before we returned to the US.  This is an extremely nice hotel near high-end shopping and the famous Gaudi house, and just a short walk to the Rambla.  The room was very comfortable, while slightly odd being on two levels with closets up two steps from the rest of the room.  The bath was very luxurious appointed with marble.  We especially liked the breakfast, which was very extensive and included cook to order items.  Finally, the concierge was outstanding, helping us with reservations to the Picasso Museum and the Sagrada Familia and offering two great recommendations for dinner.  
All around excellent.",5,2018,07,05
11,A Majestic Experience in Barcelona,"This hotel did not disappoint! It’s a Charming hotel in a great location, surrounded by world class shopping and dining. We very much enjoyed happy hour on the rooftop for sunset cocktails. Our junior suite ticked every box on the list, from a comfortable bed to the well designed bathroom, we loved staying in this hotel. It was comfortable, stylish and comparatively priced for the area. We will no doubt be back to stay at the Majestic on our next visit to Barcelona! ",5,2018,07,02
11,Luxury hotel in the heart of Barcelona great location and spa!,"We booked through the Amex platinum travel desk and while our complimentary room upgrade was not available due to the high season I guess, the staff from the doorman to the bell hops to the front desk were all extremely welcoming, courteous and helpful. We were given a fantastic restaurant recommendation when we arrived for some early tapas and the place was great. Great room (carpet was a little worn) and the best shower water pressure of any hotel I have ever stayed in hands down! Fantastic spa treatments and great rooftop bar. Top notch 5 star gourmet breakfast spread. Presentation was exquisite. Greatly enjoyed for our pre cruise stay in Barcelona.",4,2018,07,02
11,Not a “leading hotel”,We have stayed all over Europe in the leading hotels and this one needs to be removed. American Express Platinum needs to remove this hotel as well. This is just an “ok” place to stay. We were very disappointed after wrapping up our holiday at this hotel. There are too many things to go over on why this place doesn’t belong in the leading hotels. If your looking for a 4-5star hotel in Barcelona there has to be better options.,2,2018,07,02
11,Gorgeous Hotel in the center of the city!,"Beautiful hotel with nice rooftop bar and lounge with nightly DJ, though it would have been nice to be told upon checking in the rooftop was closed for a private party. The pool is small and more like a plunge pool. The food was good, but nothing extraordinary. The staff was fantastic, though they were unable to locate a pair of shoes I left in the room which was disappointing.",4,2018,06,28
11,Good but expensive,"A collection of good, and not so good.  Checking was unsatisfactory-had early checkin privileges through AMEX(if available), and it took almost 6 hours to get into a room.  Several trips to front desk to ask were met with surly responses.  Finally Bar staff went to Guest Services Manager and he Quickly got us into a room. Total unsatisfactory experience. Otherwise room was great, food was great, all other staff was super.
Pricey, but we knew that going in.  Location is great.  Would stay again-if pre-registered.",4,2018,06,26
11,Her Majesty the Majestic,"The Four Season’s of Espana. From the pleasant fragrance of the almost non existent lobby to the pleasant demeanor or the front of house personnel, this joint is top notch. A front manager escorts you to your well anointed room and gives you the rundown of all of the amenities. Remember, no tipping in Spain. We were given #740 which is a quiet room with a private balcony. Beautiful. Deep tub with shower, fluffy towels, Nespresso machine with pods, soft Egyptian cotton sheets, flat screen t.v., and a welcome bottle of Cava. Bravo. The hotel boasts a rooftop pool but it’s not really a pool. Maybe one lane. Adjoining is a rooftop lounge with made to order tapas with and AMAZING panoramic view.",5,2018,06,23
11,Luxury ,"Stayed here for 1 night on our way back from Ibiza and our next day flight to New Jersey.  The hotel was beautiful.  We had a great room with a enclosed balcony overlooking Passeig de Gracia.  The hotel staff was exceptional, very friendly and accommodating. The concierge made dinner reservations for a nice restaurant. It was a great choice.  I wished I had more time but will be back again. The location was great, right in the heart of everything.  The only downside was we were there on Sunday and all the fine stores and restaurants were closed.  Our breakfast was included and was excellent.  The room was elegantly appointed with nice linens and tableware. The selection of foods and service was superb. ",5,2018,06,20
11,Excellent location and service!!,"From the moment we arrived, everything was excellent. You really can't get a better location--the Passeig de Gracia is a beautiful, tree-line wide promenade with lovely shops, restaurants, and amazing Gaudi architecture. It is a great base from which to tour the different sections of the city. The front desk staff was very friendly and accommodating. We booked with Amex Platinum, and they usually give an upgrade if available. They weren't able to give us an upgraded room, so they gave us a separate room for our 19-yr-old son (we were both very happy!). Both rooms were ready early. The rooms are modern and well-appointed, as were the bathrooms. The beds were extremely comfortable, as were the slippers ;-). The concierge provided good advice, too. The breakfast buffet (which was included with the Amex reservation) had something to suit any appetite, and the service was wonderful. Don't miss the rooftop bar with amazing views of the city. Wish we had more than a weekend to spend there!",5,2018,06,19
11,AMAZING HOTEL,"We recently stayed at the Majestic as a family and were extremely impressed with the service and quality of the hotel. Every aspect of the hotel was wonderful, including the beautiful accommodations, amazing breakfast, work out facility and the roof top pool and bar. We looked forward to ending our day with a cocktail on the rooftop or just lounging by the pool. The location was just as excellent as the staff. We would definitely recommend the Majestic for a couple or a family. It was first class all the way and such a treat for us all! ",5,2018,06,18
11,The staff here are amazing,"The hotel is wonderful to stay at, with large rooms and beautiful views of the streetscape and awesome amenities. I would suggest getting a room with a little terrace balcony. 

We had a spa voucher included in our stay, which my partner thoroughly enjoyed and afterwards there was a lovely couples retreat room with a sauna, steam room and showers for us both.

The staff were the absolute highlight of the stay. I had my wallet stolen whilst out in the city, and they helped me re-arrange our trip (including calling car companies for us as my licence was stolen along with it) and guided me through what needed to be done with the police etc. They also offered to assist with some money in the short-term, which luckily I didn't require. I didn't end up getting my wallet back, but I felt a lot better with the level of empathy displayed by the concierge, reception and all staff at the hotel.

The rooftop bar/pool is a wonderful area and the staff up there were brilliant!

I would definitely stay again, and recommend it to anyone looking for decent accomodation in Barcelona.",5,2018,06,18
11,Best of the Best,"The Majestic is located perfectly. Easy walking distance to many of the Gaudi sites.
The hotel itself is beautiful and the staff couldn't be more helpful.  Our room didn't have a nice view, but that was of no consequence, because so little time was spent in the room.The room itself was perfect.
The breakfast was excellent.",5,2018,06,18
11,Amazing hotel...," Just stayed here for 3 wonderful nights. The service is as good as you're going to get. The hotel is beautiful and very well maintained.. we stayed in a junior suite on the 6th floor and it was worth the expense. The room was spacious and the furnishings, linens, amenities and view were spectacular.. although the roof top bar was busy it was spectacular again with excellent service..( it's not about the small pool.. unless you have kids who might enjoy it) The mangers and staff know how to run this hotel.. very personalized service with 275 rooms..wow..
Would highly recommend spending a few extra dollars to stay in this hotel in beautiful Barcelona..",5,2018,06,18
11,"Fantastic location, staff and rooms","Stayed her with husband and teens. Convenient location and beautiful shops nearby. Walk to several off the must famous Gaudi creations.
Don't skip the breakfast that's included with your stay... it's fantastic and offers everything you could want and will tempt even those of us who are ""only coffee"" in the morning.
Gracious staff, seamless housekeeping...could not recommend more.

11,Wonderful Hotel,"My husband and I have just spent a fantastic 4 nights at this lovely hotel. From the attention on arrival, to the extremely comfortable room, everything was great. The rooftop bar has fantastic views over the city and is a very enjoyable place to spend an hour or two, watching the world go by. We would love to come back again.",5,2018,06,13
11,Another lovely visit,"From check in to comfort of bed and room to breakfast to check out all was wonderful.
I had the opportunity to visit the spa for a manicure & pedicure and once again was very happy with professionalism and service. Highly recommend hotel and spa.",5,2018,06,12
11,Nice Hotel in the great area,"I stayed in Majestic hotel for 3 nights and I loved it. The hotel is in a great area where luxurious stores are, yet there are nice coffee shops and restaurants nearby.
The hotel is only 10 minutes away from Rambla.
We stayed in executive room on the 4th floor facing backyard away from noisy Main Street.
The room was very spacious and comfortable. 
I highly recommend this hotel to travellers however is very pricy.

11,Old Fashioned Elegance,"This is an old building with all that that implies. The rooms are varied and not a bit like todays standard, but they are a decent size, some very so, and have all that you need or want. What we found superlative was the service, another old fashioned quality. OK it’s not cheap but you definitely get what you pay for. Go!",5,2018,06,11
11,Cool Rooftop Pool and Great Service,"We stayed at Majestic Hotel & Spa for a few nights before a cruise. Location is convenient without being in the middle of noisy Ramblas. Decor is gorgeous in a traditional style and every staff member was friendly and accommodating. We arrived a few hours before official check-in not expecting a room, pleasantly surprised when we were told our room was ready immediately during busy season! Room was large and comfy with a huge marble bathroom and separate toilet closet. Food service was great too. We enjoyed the delicious breakfast buffet daily, check out the beautiful glass side room that looks like a greenhouse! Also had tapas at the rooftop pool, pricey but very nice.Group dinner at the restaurant was fabulous with great selection of tapas and multicourse dinner. I highly recommend Majestic in Barcelona!",5,2018,06,11
11,Not a 5star hotel,"We just checked in but I am already totally disappointed. This is anything but a 5 star hotel. There is a hole in my bath suit. Housekeeping lady brought a tiny bottle of still water, probably enough to fill one glass, and when I asked if I can have more (hello, June in Barcelona) said we need to buy it. Honestly?
Also they have the most uncomfortable pillows I have even encountered. Glad we are only here for 2 nights.",2,2018,06,08
11,Outstanding accommodations and service,"We had an exceptional stay at the Hotel Majestic in Barcelona. It was our first visit to Barcelona and when we return, we will definitely stay at the Majestic again.  The hotel is located in a very prestigious area in Barcelona with numerous restaurants, world class shops, and a variety of tourist sites within a short walking distance.  The hotel has a beautiful Terrace pool and bar on top of the hotel to spend your free time.  The fitness center was well appointed and the staff was incredibly attentive to every guest.  I will highly recommend the Majestic to our friends from the US.  ",5,2018,06,07
11,Excellent location in Barcelona,We had beautiful room that had small terrace. Not excellent view but the rooftop view at the bar more than made up for it. One of best views in Barcelona. Hotel staff very helpful and polite. All spoke english well.,5,2018,06,04
11,Great Barcelona Hotel,"We stayed at the Majestic Hotel for 4 nights in May 2018.  The room was fabulous, very large with every amenity you could want.  The staff was fabulous, and very attentive to anything we needed.  They even recommended great restaurants.  They were so helpful with everything.  location is perfect for Goudi houses and other interesting sites.  Will definitely go back next year!!",5,2018,06,04
11,Truely a 5 star romancing hotel,"Upon arrival we felt welcomed. Explaining ammenities, potential tours or advance ticket purchases. Etc....whilst the bags were sent to our room.
Room had Nespresso coffee machine, complimentary water, turn down the bed at night, slippers, etc... On my wife’s birthday the management organised Champange and chocolates, which made this a special surprise for us both.",5,2018,06,04
11,Great apero,"We stopped by for a drink and late lunch. Service, food and drinks were up to standards. Nice cosy interior. Very polite, friendly and attentive staff. A little bit pricy though. But worth every penny. ",5,2018,06,04
11,One perfect night stay,"Staff is professional and friendly. The room we asked was exactly how we expected it to be. Room was very comfortable. 
We are member of LHW but didn't get an upgrade! Perhaps because we only stayed one night?
Location is perfect and breakfast excellent!
Nothing more to say. It's worth your money.",5,2018,06,03
11,Amazing Hotel in amazing location!,Can’t say enough about Majestic Hotel! Superb rooms and the service was impeccable. From housekeeping to concierge to restaurant . Will definitely be back! Location was great - got to all points of the city easily . Thank you to the Majestic team for a great stay!,5,2018,06,03
11,Great Hotel.  Well worth the stay,"We stayed at Majestic Hotel & Spa Barcelona for two nights last week.  The booking to stay was made after a visit two years ago for drinks on the rooftop bar, which has amazing views of the city, as well as the Cathedral,

We could not have been happier.  The stay was terrific.  We head a room overlooking the intersection, which could have been a street noise problem, but this was not the case.  The doors are well soundproofed and quiet nights were enjoyed.  The bed and bathroom were excellent as well.

The rooftop bar was excellent once again, with fine service from all.  Breakfast is also very good.

All staff were very good.  The ladies who cleaned the room were just lovely (didn't catch their names, sorry) and seemed to enjoy their work very much.  A special vote of congratulations should go to Christina, on the front desk.  Christina, who is a trainee, was most helpful with my minor computer problems but also gave us the names of excellent restaurants to visit nearby.  Well done Christina.  She has a very bright future at this lovely establishment.

We will return...",5,2018,06,02
11,Beautiful hotel in great position,We spent 4 nights in the hotel and found everything to be great. Front desk staff very helpful in particular Dyonne and Manu. Breakfast was excellent with many choices. Large room and bathroom. The rooftop is lovely to relax and have a drink taking in the view of Barcelona. Would not hesitate to come back.,5,2018,06,01
11,Alas only here for one night,"This is an excellent hotel. As I live 40km I don’t usually stay in Barna hotels unless I have an evening event with a client. This place is excellent not least because it seems to not to break the accounting purse strings. So long as that’s the case, I’ll stay here thank you very much. An excellent bed, nice size room, excellent shower and bathroom and lovely staff. ",5,2018,05,28
11,"Very good room , didn’t like the restaurant food",This hotel had a very nice room. They have been redone very well. The staff also did a good job making us feel welcome. The one thing we didn’t care for was the food in there restaurant. Not much of a menu and what we got was high priced and not good.,4,2018,05,27
11,Stunningly Beautiful Hotel ,"This is certainly a 5* hotel! Prime location when visiting Barcelona. (Chanel and Dior next door!)

On arrival, the doormen were friendly and helpful. Check in was quick and easy. 

This might sound like an odd one, but the smell of the hotel was amazing! So clean and fresh, everywhere! 

The bedroom was lovely. Comfy bed, lined curtains (ensured no light came in), mini bar, safe, shoe polish kit etc.  
The bathroom included a walk-in shower with large shower head and separate toilet. Dressing gowns, slippers, usual toiletries etc.

My partner forgot his toothbrush, so I managed to ask the maid on duty if they had one. She was extremely helpful and efficient in dealing with our request. 

On the evening, we had a drink at the rooftop bar. The sights were amazing. A bit chilly in February, so staff kindly brought us a cosy blanket and a fire pit to keep warm.
Drinks were served with nibbles.

A couple of things to mention...
On a few occasions we waited 20-30 minutes to be served a drink even though we were the only ones there at the time. Another 20-30 minutes to have the drinks brought over. And then €18 for each drink.

Breakfast was nice. Good selection. I would like to see ‘v’ for vegetarian on the labels, and I’m sure others would like to know about gluten, dairy, allergens etc.
€30 each, is also pretty expensive!

Would have no doubt at all in recommending this hotel. As my title states - STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL! 

",5,2018,05,24
11,First Class .. with a few hic cups.,"Location:  Very good -- easy to get to all major attractions by walking, public transportation or short taxi ride; plenty of food options around hotel.

Room:  Stayed in ""executive"" room facing Valencia.  Traffic noise could be loud (we were on the second floor) but window insulation was excellent.  Some wear showing in the room, i.e. stain on coffee table and worn off paint on the closets.

Overall ambiance:  Were luxurious -- good quality linens, high quality public spaces

Breakfast: FABULOUS!!  Setting was upscale, very large selection of foods, service very good.

Staff:  Friendly and accommodating

Roof terrace bar:  Very nice for sunset drink  

-  One problem we had was that we returned to the room one day at 3 pm to find the room had not yet been cleaned.  We called front desk and they sent someone immediately but that's not the kind of issue you would expect at this level of hotel.",5,2018,05,20
11,Almost Amazing Stay,"We spent 5 nights at this hotel and with a few exceptions this was an amazing stay. The hotel is well appointed and in a great location. Well positioned for public transport, food, bars and shopping. 
The rooms are spacious and comfortable however there were some small issues with torn curtains which I found surprising for this level of hotel. The rooftop bar is a must visit, however because this bar is so amazing this makes the rooftop pool something to avoid. Too many people around to relax in the pool which is right in the center of the bar.
The main issue we had at this hotel was a run in with one member of the team. We asked for our room to be serviced as we left our room one day. We returned many hours later to see that this was not done. I called housekeeping to ask again for a service. I received a call a few minutes later from the housekeeping manager advising that this was not done as we had a “Do Not Disturb” sign on the door (for which we didn’t). I advised that this was not the case however the manager continued to argue with me. Why the manager insisted on arguing with me and suggesting I was lying has left me with only frustrated feelings towards the hotel. The customer relations manager did try to repair the situation, however I doubt I will return.",4,2018,05,19
11,Can't get any better then this,"We stayed at The Majestic for 6 nights last week and felt very much at home from check in to check out.  The hotel is beautiful, the staff wonderful. Breakfast buffet held us over till dinner everyday. The location of The Majestic is perfect, we were able to walk to everything we wanted to see. Alvaro at the front desk turned us on to the best Tapas restaurant in the world, great staff and wonderful food 2 blocks from the hotel. You can't go wrong staying at this hotel 5 star all the way.",5,2018,05,18
11,Wonderful!,"Beautiful 100 year old hotel, enjoyed a fabulous two night stay post cruise. Early check in was available at 10am, wow. Every staff member I met was friendly, helpful and courteous, from doorman to front desk to bellman to concierge to all food and beverage servers, etc. Loved rooftop bar/restaurant, lobby bar/restaurant, room service, food and service great everywhere. Small room but very comfortable and nicely appointed, with window doors that opened onto balcony. Top quality bed linens and towels!  Air conditioning did not work even after two service calls but front desk clerk and manager made it all OK with a nice discount, which they offered, I didn't even ask. Location perfect for sightseeing and high end shopping. Look forward to returning to the Majestic Hotel again.",5,2018,05,17
11,Majestic Stay at the Majestic Hotel & Spa,We arrived late in the evening and received excellent service when we checked in.  We then had a great glass of wine with some tapas in the hotel bar.  The next morning we enjoyed the brunch that had an amazing assortment of food.  The concierge arranged a wonderful walking tour with an outstanding guide who took us to the Picasso Museum who shared with us her passion about this artist.  This gorgeous hotel is situated on the beautiful Paseo de Gràcia!  A wonderful stay!!,5,2018,05,17
11,Sumptuous,"I stayed here 2 nights this May. Everything was great, but I especially appreciated that they gave me an early check in. Very gracious and helpful.  Loved the location. Everything in Barcelona is in walking distance. Shopping is incredible.  Do try the restaurant Solc if your schedule permits.",5,2018,05,15
11,Magical,"The Majestic Hotel was incredible! We were so touched by the genuine kindness of the staff, and blown away by the quality of the food and the luxury of the establishment overall!
Our flight was delayed so we arrived around midnight, and immediately the 24/7 reception staff empathized with our fatigue and hunger so they accompanied us to a beautiful large room with a balcony and a view and the concierge recommended a fantastic tapas place just a block away that was still open. After the quick dinner we came back to the hotel bar, and even though it was closing time the manager still accommodated us with a couple of whiskeys and she was just so kind. Our initial disappointment with the flight company instantly dissipated once we were inside the hotel doors.
The next morning we experienced the breakfast, which I must say might have been the best breakfast I have ever had! It had absolutely everything, and the service was warm and welcoming too. And the terrace! Incredible spot to lounge and soak in the sun with a view of the whole city and some cocktails. 
The rest of the stay we were always delighted to say hello to all the staff in the lobby, who was always ready to help us with anything we asked - also seeing the housekeepers take care of our room was great, they were so nice and quick! 
We were super sad to leave, but we'll be back and for longer! Can't imagine a better place to stay for a perfect Barcelona vacation, be it for location or food or service...no wonder the Majestic has been going strong for a 100 years!",5,2018,05,13
11,Beautiful Hotel with wonderful staff. Unlucky with the room!,"This is without a doubt a beautiful Hotel and very well located. The staff were excellent without exception. Unfortunately we had problems with our room. My advise would be don’t accept a room with 51 at the end of it, as it adjoins a stairwell which is used by staff and we were disturbed with noise from the door banging from 6am. Also these particular rooms (in a corner and next to the lift) seem to be close to ducting for the ventilation system so you will hear quite a bit of rumbling and humming at times.",4,2018,05,13
11,Celebrating 100 Years ,"We arrived and there was no reservation made by our cruise company.  The manager, Mario Montero, was so helpful and straitened everything out and put us in a very nice room.  Furthermore he has helped us with dinner reservations and recommendations.  We have had nothing but great service at Majestic Hotel and highly recommend it as your place to stay when in Barcelona.
",5,2018,05,11
11,Absolutely amazing!!!,"Decided to visit Barcelona for a few days with my husband - neither of us had visited before. Only a 25minute taxi ride from the airport (most of it was waiting in the city traffic) and cost approx 25Euros. First impression of the hotel was sheer luxury (with an amazing smell...sounds stupid, but it did!!). Staff were very helpful, friendly and 5* attentive. We were shown to our room, which had been upgraded by the hotel (thank you :) to a suite with a view of the bustling streets below (excellent windows as when closed you can't hear a thing!). Room was tastefully decorated, clean and had the most comfy bed ever. The rooftop terrace gave you amazing views of the city. We didn't try the small pool, we decided to sit and sample the delights on offer while soaking in the sun and views. Service here was great too. The breakfast was fit for royalty - anything and everything was available....and more! We dined in the restaurant for the last night, which we were told had only just opened a few weeks earlier. The concept is all food is sourced locally....on entering the restaurant, we were explained where the food is sourced and given a sample of local peas which were picked that day from a local market - a simple idea, but very tasty and a nice gesture to invite you to the menu, which is all locally sourced. The staff were very knowledgable and extremely polite and helpful - each dish was explained - it was all delicious, we were so glad we made the decision to dine here. All in all, we couldn't fault this hotel in any way - it provided us with a sanctuary when we'd had enough of sightseeing and walking the busy street. One other member of staff I have to mention was Mr Williams (British gentleman with parents from North Wales) on the Front Desk - wonderful service received! Thank you Majestic, you were amazing!!!",5,2018,05,06
11,Not the luxury experience I paid for.,"While this hotel was a beautiful hotel, it was certainly not the value I paid for.  I booked a high end room on a private floor, and was very disappointed.  The room was small, I asked repeatedly to be changed and then on the last day they offered to change.  The rooftop had a beautiful view but the staff made us feel like they really did not need people there.  Finally it was very obvious that the room next to us was smoking.  I was very disappointed.   Very expensive overall.",4,2018,05,06
11,Awesome Stay,Just returned from Barcelona and the Majestic Hotel. I did a lot of research prior to departing and I am extremely happy with my selection of hotels. A perfect location in between two of Gaudí’s amazing houses. Lots of shopping and sites within walking distance. The rooftop has great views. The staff was very friendly. Room was nice and not dated. Highly recommend! ,5,2018,05,05
11,Lovely apartment.,"The hotel owns two apartment buildings where guests can stay instead of getting a hotel room  I recently stayed in two different apartments with my husband and son. The building we stayed in is right across the Paseo de Gracia from the hotel.  For our first three nights, we stayed in a spacious two bedroom, two bath which included a washer/dryer and a good sized kitchen.  It was very comfortable. Then, after a visit to Granada, we returned for one night and, much to our delight, were upgraded to a duplex four bedroom with a large terrace.  It was amazing!!  We chose a rate that included a wonderful breakfast buffet which is served in the first floor restaurant of the hotel.  We also ate at the bar, which was easy and relaxed.  And we had lunch one day at the rooftop bar, which was nice although it did seem like the area right by the pool maybe needed a bit more shade. The location of the hotel is very convenient. The service was excellent. I felt that it was a very good value.",5,2018,05,02
11,Excellent Experience,Love the hotel! Everything from the staff to the rooms to the rooftop lounge to the spa are first class. Deserves its 5 star rating. Highly recommend staying at his magnificent hotel...truly a majestic experience.,5,2018,05,02
11,A - 5 STAR Hotel,"This was our first trip to Barcelona and when I booked my trip through American Airlines, they gave me several choices for a hotel and this looked like the best one.  Well, it was the most unbelievable hotel we have ever stayed in.  It was centrally located and walking distance to restaurants, shops and the off on bus.  We stayed at the hotel for 4 days and then went on a cruise and then stayed another day after our cruise and several people in the hotel remembered we were on a cruise and asked us how it was and what we did.  When we travel, we will be looking to stay at a Majestic Hotel.",5,2018,05,02
11,Good Hotel 😊,"Good Hotel 😊
Close to the beach ☀️
Friendly staff , good breakfast , good cofee 👍🏻
Nice rooms with good beeds .
Okey pool and fitness senter 😄💥💪🏼
Little noice frome the highway , but what can we expect in the city ☺️",4,2018,05,01
11,More than you expect,"This hotel was sublime to stay at, everyday there were surprises like perfume in the good night pack or lovely linen for items left on the desk. This is a 5 star hotel that delivers service and style. The breakfast is definitely the best in Barcelona ",5,2018,04,30
11,Try to avoid high season,"It’s my third time in this hotel within last 6 months. I like the location. Hotel is just perfectly situated in the very centre of the city, providing excellent access to all major points of interest.
I opt for this hotel also due to high level of service, I enjoyed during my previous visits.
Now, what a disappointment it was for this particular stay.
Front desk was incompetent, it took almost half an hour just to find my reservation. It was followed by a misunderstanding as concerns method of payment and finished by the choice of substandard room (much smaller then others, squeezed somewhere in the corner ...). So far, I even had no idea, that the hotel posses accommodation of such low standard.
After some additional effort from my side, the room was eventually changed for the room of expected standard.
The lesson:
- try to avoid this hotel in high season. When visiting in the time of unrest last year, I was treated like the most welcome client, while in the time of normal tourist traffic you are just one more obtrusive tourist, bothering this noble institution by its presence.
- try to avoid reservation via any internet application (in my case it was booking.com) as it apparently creates difficulties for the front desk and puts you immediately to a position of “second grade” client.",4,2018,04,29
11,Excellent location in Barcelona ,"Second time we stayed in Barcelona and this hotel has a much better location. Easy to walk to wherever you want. Shopping on the Passeig de Gràcia or find nice cafes on the nearby side streets. The hotel is very nice, the breakfast that was included with our room was excellent. Our room was very nice although we did not have a view. It actually was very quiet as opposed to overlooking the streets which are quite noisy. We would stay here again. ",4,2018,04,25
11,This is the place to stay,We loved that we could almost get to anywhere walking ... it’s walking distance to great site seeing... awesome restaurants and bars and great night life ... there’s also a metro stop close by ... and they have great prices   ,5,2018,04,23
11,Incredible hotel,This is a first rate amazingly lovely hotel in a terrific location in Barcelona. The reservations dept had made a small error in our booking and when we arrived they offered us an upgrade and complimentary  spa services. The food is excellent and the roof bar offers a marvelous view of the city,5,2018,04,22
11,Luxury at every turn,"Centrally located in a high energy neighborhood.  A block away from Gaudi's La Padrera (Casa Mila) and Casa Batlo.  A stone's throw from high end retail.  Great concierge service, spacious rooms, and a terrific rooftop pool and bar with great views of Barcelona from the sea to Montjiuc and everything in between!",5,2018,04,18
11,The Majestic Deserves 10 Stars!!,"We stayed at the Masjestic 3 years ago and made it a point to return for 4 days this year after a cruise. It remains one of my all-time favorite hotels, and is certainly one of the best in Europe. EVERYTHING is perfect. Seriously. The wait staff are friendly and attentive. The rooms are beautiful. The buffet breakfast is extensive. Even room service is magnificent. We made a great room picnic on a very rainy day with the hummus, cucumber salad, wine, and cheese we got in the hotel. We spent a little bit of time on the beautiful rooftop bar, despite a rather blustery day. The servers up there were great sports, considering how cold it was.

The hotel's absolute best asset, however, is its concierge staff. Angel and Tim are easy to work with and make good suggestions. However, THE BEST CONCIERGE IN THE WORLD IS FERNANDO. Seriously. I always felt he was genuinely interested in helping us out. He made absolutely perfect recommendations for museums, experiences, and restaurants. He always said hi and waved if he saw us walking by. I know he greatly enhanced our experience. Make sure you work with him if you stay at the Majestic.

I am glad we got to return to the hotel. It is in a great location and a truly remarkable place.",5,2018,04,17
11,Great Stay!,A Great stay at this wonderful hotel. Situated in a great part of this great city. Surround by fantastic upmarket shops and many awesome eating places. The hotel is extremely well staffed with an excellent breakfast this is a top rated hotel. Great rooms very well serviced. A great stay.,5,2018,04,15
11,Amazing Rooftop,"One of my most favorite things to do in Barcelona is to visit the rooftop of the Majestic Hotel.  It's a great place to relax while taking in the view of the city and enjoying a glass of wine or sangria after a day of sightseeing or shopping.  Limited menu, but still very delicious.",5,2018,04,10
11,Apartment life at a beautiful hotel,"Our family of four chose to stay in one of the apartments which are a part of the Majestic Hotel.  The apartment was perfect for our family: two bedrooms, two bathrooms, kitchen, living area.  We also enjoyed walking across the street the the lobby of the Majestic and starting our evening with a cocktail.  The hotel is beautiful and perfectly located near all the fancy shops and many restaurants.",5,2018,04,10
11,Our Piece of Paradise,"Well ! If you are looking to get away from it all and visit a beautiful city . Look no further than Barcelona Spain. Beautiful weather , beautiful people  and amazing foods. This destination will check all of the boxes on any bucket list or dream you may have.This is definately a romantic destination, a city that will make you fall in love all over again. You'll need a minimum of 10 days to see it all . Spain,  is just so beautiful overall but Barcelona by the sea ist's majical.",5,2018,04,09
11,A night for the champions league match,Booked last minute with my family to go for one night for the football match. Although it was last minute but the hotel exceeded my expectations. Great location since we won’t be there for a long time we needed the flexibility and time. Rooms are good too. Staff very friendly and attentive. Would definitely visit again.,5,2018,04,09
11,Great Service and Location,We stayed 2 nights in one of the 2 BR residences across the street from the hotel. Location is great next to the Gaudi monuments and great shopping. The staff couldn't be better. The Front desk staff esp the door men were very helpful and always gracious. The Concierge was a little uptight giving 1 sentence answers and not overly helpful just adequate. But the rest was great. Will definitely recommend,5,2018,04,08
11,Great Hotel,"Our lovely stay in Barcelona was made even better by the outstanding service, food and concierge advice that we experienced at the Majestic. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2018,04,08
11,"Great location, within walking distance to las rambles","Very happy with stay. Stayed 5 nights in March 2018, loved everything about this. Buffet and restaurant brilliant. Loved the outdoor area in restaurant too. Service great. Only thing I could complain about was that the gym was small but indicative of a hotel gym I suppose.Great roof top bar - book as it gets very busy. Spa good too, had a massage and was very happy with it.Piano bar has a nice atmosphere too.",5,2018,04,07
11,Love the Hotel,"Centrally located near the historic Gaudi building and a few minutes walk to Las Ramblas. Staff and rooms are 5 stars.  Their breakfast buffet is not your typical.  Champagne  or mimosas are included with both cooked to order eggs, a large selection of Iberian hams, gourmet salami and cheeses, fruit and salad bar, and various breads and pastries.  

We would highly recommend this hotel and would come back.  ",5,2018,04,04
11,Roof top bar ,"We had a great time at the roof top bar, the service was quick and attentive 
The views of the city from there are amazing 
It is not necessary to stay at the hotel to be able to go to the roof yop bar but you have a purchase a drink to be able to stay there",5,2018,04,01
11,Grand Dame of Barcelona,"Really loved this hotel, from its convenient location near the uptown boutiques and hip eateries in Passatge de la Concepció to the lovely rooftop bar and plunge pool, great breakfast selection and cool cream and marble decor and very comfortable bed. This is a fine, confidently run, comfortable hotel with a friendly and helpful team at the front desk and behind the scenes - we very much look forward to coming back again.",5,2018,03,31
11,Great place for a drink & a small bite. ,"Me and my son visited the bar del majestic in the afternoon for a small bite and a glass of wine. We sat at the bar where the bartender, I believe his name was Albert, advised us on the wines and gave us the oppertunity to taste different onces. Which was Very kind! With the second round the intern Levy helped and advised us really well, and was just like the other waiter, very friendly and helpfull. I would definitely recommend this bar if you want to enjoy lovely wines and relax in a  nice environment.",5,2018,03,30
11,Decent hotel at a prime location ,"We stayed here for 5 nights for a conference. Location is superb and service is good. The room is small but sufficient. However there are many areas for improvement, eg the glasses in the room are not very clean, the toilet paper holder is broken etc. Compared to the MO few doors down the road, this hotel is reasonably priced. I will come back if I need a hotel with good location. ",4,2018,03,29
11,Outstanding hotel in Barcelona ,"This hotel has an ideal location, in walking distance to most sightseeing destinations and in the heart of the shopping district. The staff is professional, friendly and knowledgeable, the breakfast is outstanding and the rooftop bar a lovely way to end the day. Can’t wait to be back!",5,2018,03,28
11,"Top notch service, beautiful rooms...","Location is perfect, hotel is very clean, security is very tight (felt safe), everything you would want in an upscale hotel.... Only disappointment is the prices at the bar(very overpriced)... Very expensive. If your not one for cocktails, then you will be completely satisfied.",4,2018,03,25
11,Beautiful historical hotel in the heart of L'Eixample district,"We stayed 6 nights in this gorgeous hotel on the famous Passeig de Gracia (Barcelona's Champs-Elysees) being pampered with turn down service, fluffy bathrobes and slippers.  The hotel is celebrating their centennial so they have had 100 years to hone their excellent service skills! It sits among very high end stores (think Gucci, Prada & Louise Vuitton) and the neighborhood is very walkable and safe...perfect for an after dinner stroll!   The rooftop bar offers incredible 360 degree views!  We stayed in a deluxe room that was incredibly comfortable.  My husband enjoyed the free Espresso each morning to get him started.  Would love to come back and stay here again! ",5,2018,03,22
11,One of the best,"Honestly, I cannot praise this hotel enough. It was absolutely stunning and in a prime location. You can see the Sagrada Familia from the rooftop, as well as other landmarks, and I would go as far as saying that the view from the rooftop is better than the view from the Passion Tower. The staff were friendly, polite and very welcoming. The rooms were spotless and the decor was beautiful. If I ever return to Barcelona I would not hesitate staying here again.",5,2018,03,21
11,Might try something else next time,"After taking the train from Madrid with my 3 children I “checked into” the Majestic Hotel only to find out they did not have my reservation.  I showed them my email confirmation and they said I had cancelled which I did not.  I panicked.  They did, however, have the apartment that we booked available and showed me to my room (after abt 20 mins) while they figured it out.  I spent the next 30 mins on the phone with American Airlines (not fun) through which I booked the hotel and they confirmed that I did in fact have a reservation. The next day the manager called, it was their oversight and offered breakfast for the inconvenience and I gladly accepted.  It was very nice.  

The apartment was very spacious for myself and three teens.  Not exactly well decorated, but spacious and nicely located across the street from the hotel.  We liked the rooftop pool and cafe.  Not sure I’d stay there again as the apartment was lacking the character that I imagine the hotel rooms have. ",4,2018,03,15
11,Our Amazing Stay,"We stayed at this beautiful 2 nights in March and just fell in love with the hotel. From the first encounter with the bellmen, to chec-in, to room service, to breakfast service, everything was excellent. Staff is very polite and very helpful. We were treated with the highest level of service and they even set up for our 1-year old a little robe and slippers. That was such a beautiful little detail that made our day. Breakfast is fantastic and they have a fantastic room service menu available 24 hours. The location of the hotel is just perfect! it is right on Passeig de Gracia, walkable distance to all attractions, shops and restaurants. Thank you for an amazing stay!",5,2018,03,15
11,5 Star delight,"3 nights at the Hotel Majestic was not enough. Amazing room, even though it did not face the street. Clean, well appointed. Centrally located. Excellent Buffet breakfast with super variety. Unfortunately, the weather was to cool in the evening to enjoy the roof top bar. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. 
",5,2018,03,12
11,Amazing Hotel!,"I have traveled all around the world and I have rarely found a hotel whose physical beauty is matched by its friendly, courteous, and knowledgeable staff. If you are looking for a place to stay in Barcelona there is no other place that you should stay. Even if you were to pay twice as much for a room it would never be nicer than here. The shower is the best shower I have ever had in my life. The concierge listen to what we were looking for and made perfect recommendations. The roof deck offers one of the most spectacular views of the city. The location cannot be beat. With some of the world's most exclusive stores right outside the front door, you can also shop on a budget near by. The senior manager, Eva, was warm like a hostess in a private home. I just can't say enough good things about this hotel.",5,2018,03,11
11,Best hotel I’ve stayed in,"I stayed here on the 6th/9th of March at the residence across the street in a 2 bed apartment, I’ve stayed at a couple of places in Barcelona but this is by far the best .we were travelling as a family of 4 and the apartment was a home away from home . All the other hotels I’ve stayed in at Barcelona seem to be very poorly sound proofed so I never got a good nights sleep but no such problem here , the beds are also great . The apartment had a full kitchen which is handy when your traveling with a family. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will be staying here next year when we come back . Thank you to everyone at the majestic",5,2018,03,10
11,Over The Top!!,"This hotel is very awesome. Our 1st floor room had a breakfast nook that overlooked the street. Really incredible listening to the beat of the city 24hrs. The noise didn’t bother us. Beds were firm and comfortable. The hotel is celebrating their centennial this year. The rooftop bar views (with a small pool) were stunning and even more spectacular as the  sun was setting . Sagrada Familia and Montjuic views from the roof, to us, were untouchable. Staff was very responsive to any of our requests. Try the Argentine veal and Salmon at their fantastic restaurant. The hotel is situated close to most landmarks except for the ones that are close to the harbor/beach areas like Montjuic. The street that it on reminds me of  NYC’s Fifth Ave with all of the fashion houses and more , well represented. To Fernando, Roberto, Pierre, Geronimo , Elliott and all of the incredible staff whose names we don’t remember(sorry) , kudos and thanks for a great stay. All of you are tremendous assets to this company. ",5,2018,03,07
11,Nicest staff in all of Europe!,"The Majestic is ideally located, with all of the major sites 10-30 minutes' walking distance. The metro is also nearby. 

Although the hotel was fully booked, the room was very quiet. The bed was comfortable, and extra blankets were provided. 

What really makes this hotel stand out, however, is the quality of the staff: professional, efficient, and extremely kind. Having stayed at many hotels in Europe and elsewhere, I can say the Majestic sets the gold standard for the staff! 

The only disappointing element is that the quality of the restaurant does not match that of the hotel. Still, there are many other lunch and dinner options nearby. 

I hope to return soon to the Majestic.",5,2018,03,05
11,concierge desk,the hotel staff is great  Mario could not be more helpful for recommendations    5 star staff for a 5 star hotel    in addition the spa was great albeit a little overpriced   location food  rooftop bar all great ,5,2018,03,04
11,"Terrifc staff, wonderful location, fabulous rooms and services","I spent last week at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and stayed at the Majestic. It was a wonderful experience that exceed my expectations and other hotels I've stayed at in the area.  

When I arrived early on Monday they offered the gym to shower/change and stored my luggage until the room was ready mid-morning (normal check in times are after 3 pm). The room I had a comfortable bed, first-class furnishings and good sized bathroom/tub/shower area. 

They only negative with the experience was the WiFi in my room. It would frequently come to a near stop with speeds in the 1-2 Mbps range max. Expectation going forward is > 50 Mbps in all rooms.  For that reason I dropped what would have been 5 stars to 4.  That's a must for luxury hotels.",4,2018,03,03
11,Majestic Stay,"We had received a very good deal and decide to stay there. A luxury prestige hotel with excellent bed comfort of sleep at high levels even though smaller than other rooms the feeling of luxury and safety was amazing
Good location Bus station outside",4,2018,02,27
11,"New renovated, tiny rooms without bidet, without bathtub, no dinner available","Doesn't the name of the hotel sounds great? This hotel is located in the city center of Barcelona. The hotel is displaying that it is a 5 Star Gran Lujo / grand de luxe hotel.

And now are my expectations starting depending on the level of this hotel category.

Parking in front of the hotel:

This is almost impossible because of no space. You cannot park your car in front of the hotel.

Check In:

It was not done professional. Although the name of the guests for the booked room were mentioned in the booking confirmation and although we needed to present the passports the receptionist asked me if this lady also wanted to share the room with me?

We got irritated. Was it only because she was sitting during the check in procedure on an arm chair?

Then -opposite of the name in the confirmed booking reservation -the hotel pass was written under the name of the partner..

Then one of the staff members has brought us to our room and have informed us about the facilities.

The room itself was very tiny. The window was covered with curtains to hide the ugly view at the patio.

In the middle of the room was a kingsize bed. If you want to pass you need to be careful because there was only a tiny gap of 30 cm (!!!) to the wooden wall with a lot of mirrors.

The bathroom itself has not offered a bidet or even a bathtub. In the shower room is no seat and no grabrails.

A big flat screen TV with enough channels was offered. 

From the house each of us got a bottle of mineral water with 0,2 l contents!

Now we wanted to have dinner in the hotel restaurant. And the big negative surprise: 

You cannot get dinner in the restaurant! It is not open at evenings!

To be honest: This is a no go that a 5 Star luxury hotel with a luxury restaurant is not open for dinner!

Next morning we went down to the restaurant in the 1.st floor to have our breakfast.

The design is perfect, the service was also good and even the choice of cold cut was good except that none of the staff has refilled empty plates. 

Then I had my accident! I stood up and want to go the the main restaurant and ran directly into the glass door. What was the reason? These sliding doors have an automatic system fixed overhead the doors. 

The system was not working!!

The doors had no buttons that you can see at once there is a glass door!

I hurt my head. 

There was not a try to ask me for a compensation as a gesture. Opposite two different staff members ask me for my room number. But this was only to write a report about this incident.

Check Out: 
It was done fast. There was no question about satisfaction of our stay. 

My personal individual rating:

Service: 3 points
Quality of breakfast (dinner not available): 4 points
Location: 4 points
Room: 2-3 points
Check In: 2 points
Check Out: 2-3 points
Doormen: 4 points
Price and value for money: 2 points",3,2018,02,26
11,Wonderful Hotel,"This was our first visit to Barcelona.  The Majestic was recommended by some friends.   We stayed 5 days and had a super time.   The hotel is in easy walking distance to almost all the key sites and located in the top fashion district.   Those that were a bit further afield, we merely took the Hop on Hop Off bus that stops nearby the hotel.  The staff was wonderful, friendly and extremely helpful.   Love the rooftop bar - the view is incomparable!!!    We definitely highly recommend the Majestic.  It’s a great place for the price!!!",5,2018,02,20
11,Prime Hotel in Prime Location,"The service and amenities in this hotel were top notch that included vials of French cologne.  They even loaned me a wheel chair to take off premises for as long as our stay there.  The view from the rooftop lounge is spectacular and the food was excellent - we hated to leave our comfortable sofa. I couldn't get enough of the bountiful breakfast buffet with all the Iberico ham I could eat!  We had dinner in their fine dining restaurant and it was delicious.

The location is in the heart of the best stores such has Cartier and walking distance to Las Ramblas.",5,2018,02,14
11,Average,"Quite expensive for the experience in the hotel. The hotel was just renovated, but it still feels quite old and looks a bit cheap. The room was big with a nice view, but the couch was very dusty and the bathroom was not clean. ",3,2018,02,14
11,Apartments are a bit dated but comfortable.,"We have stayed in this hotel previously. Although the Apartments in the hotel are a little dated, we've found it very comfortable and spacious. It is located on one of the main roads of Barcelona. There's a Hop-on-Hop-off stop, shopping, restaurants, Casa Battlo, etc nearby. ",3,2018,02,04
11,The Marvelous Majestic!,"Coming in for a few days to enjoy Barcelona before departing on a Mediteranean cruise was a wonderful idea but staying at the Majestic Hotel & Spa, was to experience a simply marvelous & historic ""Grand Hotel""! It's centrally located for shopping & touring the City with warm & welcoming staff who excelled from Registration to Housekeeping. A Rooftop Bar offers amazing views of the City and the modest, rooftop pool there too is a lovely spot to relax in the sun. Note: the Bar closed earlier in the evening than we expected, but it may have been the time of year (end Oct/Nov). Rooms & Beds are very comfortable with well appointed Baths, large towels, robes and offer a bathtub and shower w/overhead ""rain"" head & a hand held spray. Every effort was made throughout our stay to ensure we were comfortable, had dinner RSVPs, informative sightseeing opportunities & tour directions. The Hotel's staff also very efficiently solved the logisitcal problem of getting us to our cruise ship on time the morning of the Nov. Peace March with TV camera crews directly outside the Hotel. FYI, the roof top Bar was a perfect spot for an overview of all the excitement on the Boulevard & streets below.  Looking forward to our next visit and a longer stay!",5,2018,01,30
11,Weekend Getaway,"My mother, a friend, and I stayed at the Majestic Hotel for 3 nights in mid January. Our room, a junior suite, was spacious and well-appointed, although we did not spend too much time in it as we were busy exploring Barcelona. We had a lovely view of the Passeig de Gracia and a small balcony to walk out on. The location is unbeatable and a small price to pay for some ambient city noises at night. The concierge was exceedingly helpful with booking different attractions and giving excellent dinner recommendations. I also had a facial at the Majestic Spa and was pleased with both the treatment and the service there. Altogether the staff, location, and amenities made Majestic Hotel the perfect location for our weekend away.",5,2018,01,29
11,"Excellent Location,Poor Wiew","The hotels location is perfect,howewer the city wiew which ı paid for a exclusive room does not deserve the money.
The hotel stuff is also very gentile.
We paid for exclusive room instead of delux room for our 11 years  old daughter to stay with us.The sofa she slept is the worst bad she ever slept in her life she said.:(
They do not put even a tooth brush in an exclusive  room.
",5,2018,01,21
11,majestuoso,"Stunning hotel. Stayed in a suite which was comfortable, clean and roomy. Loved the toiletries, breakfast was awesome as were the staff (especially Kara who was a delight). A perfect location for any trip to Barcelona, why would you want to stay anywhere elese. The roof top bar was fantastic.",5,2018,01,21
11,Stopover in Barcelona,"We stayed for one night at the Majestic Hotel as we arrived from the Balearic islands and were then flying on the next day from Barcelona to India. 

We booked the roon through Fine hotels and recieved a complimentary upgrade which was well appreciated since it was the first night of our honeymoon. 

We arrived at the hotel and were welcomed by the bell staff which were great, following a efficient check-in process we were then taken to our room which, by city standard, was spacious. We went up to the rooftop bar for a quick drink and enjoyed the views up there, a must as it is truly beautiful. Following this we popped down to the lobby bar for a late lunch which was good and the service was very friendly. 

After a dinner we came back to the bar again joined with 2 friends living in Barcelona for a nightcap and we were again exceptionally well take care of by a tall young lady who I unfortunately can't remember the name of, however, she was there as a part of her university degree from Lausanne, if I am not mistaken. Hats off to her for the professional demenour and attitude, she made us feel very well taken care of! 

The next morning after a very nice breakfast, check-out was done swiftly and efficiently again by the great staff. 

We shall return!  ",5,2018,01,20

11,2nd visit,"This was my 2nd visit to Majestic. Great hotel. Very charming, good service, good food. Best neighborhood in the town. Blocks nearby are great places to walk by. Fitness hall is ok. 
You cannot miss.  When you book, try higher floors",5,2018,01,16
11,Fantastic cityscape views from the rooftop bar,"We visited the rooftop bar for drinks after an afternoon's sightseeing in the city centre. We had to wait for around 20 minutes to be seated in the rooftop area, which is obviously in big demand in the early evening. The drinks menu was not cheap - we paid 45 Euros for a nice bottle of red - but the breathtaking views of well worth the premium prices.

You can see right across the city from the rooftop terrace, either across to the Sagrada Familia or down the beautiful Passeig de Gracia. It's a very pleasant place to while away an hour over cocktails as the sun goes down.

The staff are very polite and friendly, and the atmosphere is very pleasant.",5,2018,01,14
11,wonderful hotel and experience in Barcelona,"My husband, son and I stayed at the Majestic Hotel and Spa's apartments which are right across the street from the hotel.  Everything about our stay was wonderful.  The location is perfect! The staff were very attentive and so helpful.  The concierge, Angel, arranged dinner reservations and made terrific suggestions.  The rooftop bar is amazing....it was cold during our stay but they provided blankets and heat lamps so we could enjoy the amazing views.....one night when it was a balmy 60 degree night, we thought the bar was open till 8 but it stopped serving at 7:30, we said it was our last night in Barcelona and asked if we could have our last drink.....they were so nice and obliged.  

Our room was great, a very well appointed two bedroom 2 bath.  We ran into some problems with the washer the night before we were leaving and they brought in another washing machine and hooked it up within an hour.  When that somehow broke after a wash cycle and we couldn't get the door open, their maintenance men came right away (like in 10 minutes) and pried open the door and put our clothes in the dryer.  We were going out to dinner so they came back twice while we were out to make sure our clothes were dried when we came home.

The bar on the main level is terrific, great drinks and appetizers...we couldn't get enough of the chips and nuts!!  My new favorite drink is their Vespertini.  Overall, a wonderful experience and if we should happen to travel back to Barcelona or have the opportunity to make recommendations to others, Majestic will be the hotel of choice!  Thank you for a great experience in Barcelona.",5,2018,01,13
11,Most Majestic Hotel I’ve visited in a long time,"I was there three nights ago and did not want to leave. My family went for a last stop on vacation after a cruise and I was in love with the location and beauty of this hotel. The architecture is a dream and the service is really fantastic, from the moment you walk in you feel welcome and the staff is extremely friendly. The location is excellent right in the heart of Paseo de Gracia with luxury shopping and dining on every corner.
The rooms are amazing , comfortable and spacious and have all the amenities of a five star hotel.
Close to subway stations and very peaceful location and quiet at night. 
Excellent hotel for a relaxing stay at a wonderful city!
I will definitely go back someday and stay at this dreamy hotel. ",5,2018,01,13
11,One of the best luxury hotels I've visited!,"I stayed here during my first visit to Barcelona in 2014 and simply fell in love and naturally this was my first choice when I travelled to Barcelona this time as well. 
We booked an executive room for more space since we needed a crib for our 10-month old and the hotel is super child-friendly by the way. They have specially designed toddler size bath robes and bathroom slippers!! How cute!
The only complain if any at all was that they changed their toiletries brand. Previously all their toiletries were by Bvlgari and now it's by some Spa thingie but I didn't really like the fragrance but it was no biggie since we brought some of our own toiletries for the trip anyway. They also provided us a special kids toiletries pack that had all the essentials for the little one.
Location was perfect for us since we usually go to BArcelona for food and shopping only. Even if we wanted to get a little touristy, the hotel is a 10 minute walk away from Plaza Catalunya where you can purchase the hop-on-hop-off bus tickets and wander around the whole of Barcelona. 
There are also attractions just walking distance from the hotel - Gaudi's Casa Batllo and La Pedrera. Also, all major shopping (both luxury and high street) is all located along Paseig De Gracia so perfect location overall.
Oh and plenty of cafes and restaurants to try ANY type of food in this area.",5,2018,01,08
11,Nearly Perfect,"Our recent stay for two nights was wonderful.  We booked a junior suite, facing the Paseo de Gracia.  It was very spacious and had plainly been recently remodeled, in superb, understated style and top quality materials.  The room was simply beautiful.  We had the included breakfast, which is a feast with staggering variety of choices, all delicious -- among the best we've ever had at any hotel, anywhere.  The service from everyone at the hotel is exemplary and delivered with grace and enthusiasm.  Tim, the concierge, gave us excellent advice on restaurants (which we needed, because some familiar haunts were closed for a holiday).  The only flaw I can think of was that the shower door needs some kind of rubber stop to keep it from clanging shut in a way that threatens (but didn't actually result in) broken glass.  My son's room was also beautifully executed, but on the small side -- the increment for the junior suite was well worth it.  We've always stayed at the Majestic on visits to Barcelona -- and I can't imagine going somewhere else.",5,2018,01,08
11,Simply perfect!,"We stayed at the Majestic for 2 nights in December. The Hotel is simply perfect! Charming and modern at the same time. We were upgraded from a triple room to a junior suite. The room was big and beautifully decorated. The hotel smells a great perfurm and is very clean. Sleep quality is very good. Location couldn't be better, walking distance to most attractions, nice restaurants and shops. And staff always ready to help in any request. Breakfast was excellent with a lot of choices. What could I ask more?",5,2018,01,08
11,Not the best,"We stayed for a weekend in December
The location of the hotel is great, easy walking distance to all the main sites.
The concierge was excellent, super recommendations for dinner and sites, very knowledgeable!
We booked a standard city view room, and unfortunately the room smelt very very damp, we kept the window open whenever we weren’t in the room otherwise it really smelt.
The bathroom was very unclean, after a long day walking in the cold I was looking forward to a soak In the bath. Unfortunately running the bath dislodged an awful lot of mould from around the tap and edges leaving it floating in the bath.
We might not have booked a fancy room but in a hotel of this calibre I really expect a clean room with a bit more than one coffee each, regardless of the standard of room.
We didn’t book breakfast, and quite frankly I was outraged by the price of the hotels breakfast, there are some yummy cafes all close where we had breakfast every morning for less than 10Euro ",3,2018,01,05
11,Short stay,"The staff were quite friendly & helping. Clean and good facilities.The hotel's location is great! In the center of the city, walking distance from almost everything. However quite pricey, I would even say overpriced!",4,2018,01,04
11,Majestic,"Stayed here in late November and loved the location. Easy walking to most everything. The first night tho, we were in a room where we could feel and hear the construction going on in the adjacent building. A quick conversation w/the front desk and we were graciously moved to another location and a nicer room, if that was possible.  Enetz Arzak, Guest Relations Manager, couldn't have been more professional and kind in correcting our displeasure. Definitely would stay at this hotel when in Barcelona. Beds are comfy, the size of the room adequate and the bathrooms luxurious.",5,2017,12,28
11,Wonderful hotel,"We stayed at the Majestic for 3 nights prior to a cruise. The hotel could not be better. The room was magnificent. It was large, had a king size bed, and was tastefully decorated. Staff was friendly and helpful. Only problem was that the hotel restaurant, which I understand is amazing, was closed for renovations. This is a very romantic hotel in a great location.",5,2017,12,27
11,Really Majestic ,"This hotel is 100 year old in 2018 and looks like it’s only about 15years old. The staff are amazing, service is impeccable, a few hotels could learn a thing or two from the majestic.

It’s decor sure doesn’t look 100 years old as the hotel has been refurbished and brought to the 21st century.

The bathrooms, one of the most sensitive things for me, was just great!

It’s right in the center of everything, from shopping to eating to sightseeing.

A great place to stay",5,2017,12,27
11,"The Spectacular Majestic Hotel, Barcelona","Upon arrival at the beautiful Majestic Hotel an Spa, you are greeted by the gracious doorman who meets your taxi and handles everything from that point on.  The clerk at the desk advises us that the accommodations, which I had booked online about a month prior, were available, and we were upgraded to a lovely suite on a corner.  There were two of us and had booked rooms overlooking Paseo de Gracia as close to each other as possible.  Suite was great, but let me say that only one of the suite rooms overlooked Paseo de Gracia, and the other the side of a building, so for one of us, the view was very disappointing. 
 We went to the lovely lobby and enjoyed a glass of wine before heading out to have a small bite to eat.  The service was impeccable.  Breakfast was included, and we had many choices,  Very good.
Let me mention that you could purchase transportation from the airport, but I felt it was overly expensive, thus we booked with Sun Transfers, and were pleasantly surprised at their efficiency even tho we were held up in the luggage area for around 45 minutes and Sun Transfers didn't know we were there for sure, but they were awaiting us upon our departure from the arrival hall..
The lounge on the top of the hotel allow you a 360 degree view of Barcelona.  Altho it was somewhat cold, we enjoyed cocktails there before going out for dinner.  They had the heat lamps which were quite adequate (We were there the first couple of days of December.)  It is a must to visit.
Upon our departure to our ship, we called for a bellman to pick up the luggage and order a taxi.  Our departure took less than 10 minutes.  Very efficient.",5,2017,12,26
11,"Very nice hotel, great location","My family and I had a very enjoyable stay at the hotel.  We had originally booked the apartment (for a family of 4 with 2 young kids) which is located at a separate building.  When we were checking in, the manager offered us 2 adjoining rooms at the hotel itself which we happily accepted.  The rooms are nicely furnished and spacious.

The location of the hotel is fantastic.  It's just a stone's throw away from attractions like the Casa Batllo and right in the middle of the shopping district.  There are many good eateries all within walking distance from the hotel.

Just one point of drawback were the beds which are quite soft.  But apart from that, we enjoyed our stay very much and would certainly return to Majestic when next in Barcelona.",5,2017,12,25
11,Excellent establishment,"This hotel shines both through its quality and its employees.

The hotel is a classical palace hotel,bit has been fully updated recently. It is very central and allows you to get around Barcelona easily, either by foot, taxi or metro. The restaurants are in walking distance if you wish to not eat at the hotel. The rooms are nice and clean, the bathrooms are new and also very clean; the cleaning staff does their job well. Our room had a desk big enough to work on several hours. The wifi works very well, this was one on the original reasons I chose this hotel since I needed a reliable and fast connection.

We did not have dinner at the hotel and regretted it, we did have an afternoon and evening snacks and they were very good.

The breakfast is to die for! This IMO is what sets hotels apart, their breakfast, and this one hit it spot on. The quality, diversity and quantity (of choices) are unbelievable. I have rarely had this in other 5 star hotels. It makes you start your day with a smile, do not miss their breakfast!

I unfortunately did not have time to try out the spa, I did use the sky bar (separate review) which was great.

Last but not least, the staff. They are very professional, polite and human. In some 5 star hotels the staff is snobby but not in this one, they are very good (my family was in the hotel and restaurant business). We were reallg delited with the staff, they are always ready and willing to help, no fake smiles, they don't wait/expect tips like in some places so you don't feel like a walking wallet.

One person that really out-shined the others is a young man in the lobby named Guillem. He really went that extra mile to make our stay perfect; if you need something he's the guy to go to, a great person and employee.

I really had a great stay here and would stay again without a doubt.",5,2017,12,24
11,Top notch in its class,"Nice rooms,great central location. Staff was helpful and accommodating. The hotel lobby bar was comfortable and the rooftop bar had excellent views of the city. The concierge made excellent suggestions for dinner.",5,2017,12,21
11,Great location to visit Barcelona,"Very convenient location and helpful staff.  The roof top bar was open air with beautiful views of the city, a little cold for us to stay longer than a few minutes. Our room was just average, no charm, but had all the amenities needed to be comfortable.  The tub shower was very confusing, need instructions on how to operate the tub/shower fixtures, changing from shower overhead to handheld and the temperature was all one, so you had to guess if you were getting hot or cold water with just one small turn.  Just as we got it warm, it turned cold, then hot...possible from neighboring rooms. Cold floors, had to put towels down to walk on them barefoot.  Nice location to catch the hop-on hop-off bus for a great tour of the area.  The breakfast buffet was average and the area was very noisy when we were there.  Kids were running around the tables and some people had dogs with them. We are not used to dogs allowed in restaurants.",4,2017,12,21
11,Good hotel,"Our stay here was excellent.
Lovely staff and ecellent breakfast.
Would love yo stay here again.
Clean confortable rooms with all the amenities.

11,This is luxury.,"If you are looking for a well located, fancy, beautiful hotel, this is the one. Two blocks away from La Pedrera and other touristic locations, right on Paseo de Gracia, one of the most beautiful and biggest avenues in Barcelona, surrounded by designer stores and fine restaurants, you are walking distance to almost everything.
The hotel is fantastic. Excellent food (the breakfast buffet is espectacular), awesome and comfortable accommodations and kind staff. Super expensive, but it is worthy. The smell at this hotel is unforgettable, loved it, ha!",5,2017,12,15
11,Good value for luxury hotel,"We had stayed in both the Majestic and the Serras while in Barcelona.

Both had very nice rooftop bars, both had nicely appointed rooms at equivalent sizes. The Serras was in a better location for walking the town in my opinion while the Majestic is right next to the Gaudi houses. And the Majestic, being bigger, had more options for dining.

Overall I would rate them equivalent except in two areas. First, the Serras is a much smaller hotel so it has a more intimate feel. Second, our hotel bill from the Majestic for equivalent dining/room size/etc was about half of the Serras. In other words, we felt the Majestic was a very good value.

You can't go wrong with either hotel imo. Just be aware of our experience on cost delta and the fact that the Majestic is a much larger hotel.",5,2017,12,15
11,Loved the experience!,"The hotel has great rooms, friendly staff, and excellent location (in the heart of the city).
The tour with our guide Ton-David Jover was excellent! He is very knowledgeable, knows very well the history of Barcelona,very friendly and pleasant. Loved every moment of our tour!!!",5,2017,12,13
11,Love it!!!!,"Great service and great staff as this is one of the best hotel we have found so fare we will be back and enjoy all the facilities that this hotel offer 

Good location and very friendly staff 

Recommended for everyone",5,2017,12,10
11,Lovely friendly Hotel,"What a great location this Hotel has... right in the middle of the city, it is ideal. It is very tastefully decorated right down to the beautiful hallways with stunning vases and sculptures! One of the things i loved the most about it was the gorgeous smell everywhere!
The Restaurant was lovely, with a beautiful semi outside area with water features. Very friendly helpful staff and nothing was too much trouble. Meal wise we only ate breakfast at the Hotel but it was delicious... such a wide choice, and so fresh.
We were put in a small room to start with which was a bit cramped and was right in the middle so had no view but were then upgraded to a very nice room which was much more spacious... More coffee pods in the rooms would be nice (free) but that's not a big problem... Very friendly staff on reception and entrance too who always welcomed us back each day so nicely",4,2017,12,07
11,Wonderful start to our Honeymoon,"We spent the first week of our honeymoon staying in this hotel and the staff certainly went out of their way to make our stay special, memorable, and comfortable. After all of the wedding craziness, this was a wonderful place to retreat and relax. We loved the roof-top bar for drinks and tapas and the spa gave wonderful massages. It was the perfect location for us to explore the city.",5,2017,12,05
11,In a word MAJESTIC ,The. Majestic Hotel lives up to its name and then some. It has to be the best hotel in Barcelona. Everything is done with a warm friendly touch. Every member of the staff is concerned about the guest's happiness. I'm looking forward to staying at the Majestic when I return to Barcelona. ,5,2017,12,03
11,The perfect business stay an amazing location ,"I had the pleasure to stay at the Majestic Hotel during the IBTM Exhibition and definitely the experience was amazing. The associates were very helpful and professional in their approach, all attentive when I was in lobby or trying to get a taxi at the entrance.
The amenities are the Atelier Cologne which a fresh and elegant brand that I just discovered during my stay.
The room was clean and bed comfortable and I enjoyed daily turn down service with little surprises on my pillows.... the bathroom has an amazing huge bathtub and rain showers.

The location is magnificent, right in Passeig de Gràcia in front of Casa Batlló...

",5,2017,12,02
11,Perfect location for Gaudi viewing,"This is quite a large, business hotel, so service, amenities, staff are all good; it is located directly across the street from the Casa Balata and two blocks down from Villa Pedrata....on a lovely wide boulevard.  ",4,2017,12,01
11,perfect weekend in barcelona,"We spent 4 nights at the Majestic Hotel In November. Our upgraded room was beautiful with a small balcony overlooking the street on a high floor. The breakfast was among  the best I have  seen at a hotel. With selections for any palate which were constantly refreshed, The staff at all levels was incredibly attentive and helpful. 
The gym was well furnished and immaculate.  The location was perfect for exploring and shopping in the city.",5,2017,11,27
11,Perfect,"I loved everything about this hotel: our amazing Junior Suite with two balconies, the excellent gym, the rooftop bar with sunset views, the perfect location, and the friendly and efficiently staff.

There are many cheaper places to stay in Barcelona, but probably no better. I can't wait to stay here again!",5,2017,11,27
11,A descriptive name for a great hotel--Majestic,"On any metric you may have for a great hotel, this one delivers!  The location is excellent--one one of the best streets in Barcelona and minutes away from two nice Gaudi properties-the museum and the apartments.  It is close to the Cathedral, las Ramblas, the Market and the Gothic section. The exterior is beautiful, eye catching and well maintained.  The front desk staff is friendly, efficient, helpful and intelligent (they did a wonderful job of getting us a room quickly when we arrived on an early flight--despite the fact the hotel had been fully booked the previous night).  The bell staff is super efficient.  Our double room was attractive, soundproof, well designed and clean beyond any expectation--the small balcony is a good opportunity to see the city and test the weather.  The bathroom is very well designed and sleek.  The bath and room amenities are excellent.

We were very pleased with the great bar area on the lobby level--comfortable with a very efficient staff.  The bar on the top floor has a great look and feel as well as a big patio with beautiful views of the city.  The wonderful breakfast area is not only beautiful, but it has one  of the best buffets we have ever experienced.  It has great selections to meet any dietary requirements and a top notch hot breakfast option of omelets, and quiches.

Our 4 nights here were a real pleasure.  We will definitely consider this an option on our next visit to this amazing city.",5,2017,11,24
11,Gem in the middle of the city,Fabulous location and the Staff all went our of their way to make our stay even more enjoyable.  Every restaurant that the concierge sent us to was better than the last.  Breakfast was included and was a vast selection on items and food stations covering every possible desire.,4,2017,11,23
11,Ideal location,Lovely 2 night stay at the Majestic Hotel in Barcelona. We received an upgrade on our room upon checking in and loved the suite overlooking lively Paseo de Gracia. We thoroughly enjoyed the rooftop bar with unbelievable views of the city. Everyone at the front desk was extremely helpful and welcoming. We can’t wait to return!,5,2017,11,21
11,It just gets better and better ! ,"I do not often review Hotels, but having stayed here many times I thought it appropriate to review such an amazing experience. The staff are faultless , rooms great , and the position spot on . The Catalonian people could not be more friendly and welcoming.
I shall certainly be spending more time here. Thoroughly recommend this hotel.

Graham UK .  ",5,2017,11,14
11,Fantastic Staff,"I have been to many hotels that do an adequate job. The Majestic Hotel I feel went above and beyond. From the smile of the doormen to the efficiency of check in. Our room was spotless (and I check corners). The Staff were all just fantastic. Our room package came with breakfast....You have never had a more beautiful or elaborate breakfast. It was better than most restaurants. The concierge recommendations were spot on. Apparently they have this reputation because the locals approved that this was a fantastic place. It is very well situated in the city to get anyplace you need to go.
For what we paid and what we received I think it was an amazing choice.",5,2017,11,13
11,Leading Hotel ,"An amazing hotel witch  is more than a grand hotel , perfect located. The stuff  and service is more than friendly and the rooms are like the hotel ... perfect . 
You have to see the stairways and the view from the roofbar . After several stays in barcelona, majestic is my new favorite. 
Thank you Anna Tomas ",5,2017,11,11
11,Most beautiful hotel and best service in Spain!,"There are no words to deceive the beauty around every turn at The Majestic. Between the architecture and the decor in the suites along with the amazing customer service day and night, our stay was magical and majestic! 

Also one of the very best for breakfast options in all of Spain! We loved every moment and look forward to our next stay in Barcelona! ",5,2017,11,10
11,Splendid!,"Simply one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in👍. Top quality through and through. Upgrade your room somewhat and maybe be lucky and get a winter garden like I did! Fantastic room, bed, bathroom - just PERFECT. Really great breakfast and very nice bar area. Try the too floor facilities too!

Cannot wait to get back here...

11,Perfect Stay,The Majestic Hotel is ideally situated for almost all activities in the city whether they be for business or leisure. The rooms are well appointed and spotless besides being of good size. The welcome by the porters and the reception desk was warm and efficient. The ground floor bar makes for an ideal meeting place and although we did not eat in the hotel restaurant there are numerous choices for dinner in the immediate vicinity. We would certainly return and by the way the rooms re not too pricey for the standard offered.,5,2017,11,09
11,A Great Hotel,This is a very great hotel with outstanding rooms in a very central location. The staff are very friendly and helpful. They are also very capable and efficient. The breakfasts are just magnificent with a wide variety of options,5,2017,11,08
11,Great shower,"A high quality hotel with friendly staff and a nice feel. The rooms were well appointed and clean. The bathroom was excellent with an amazing shower that throws masses of water at you from above, very refreshing. My non-city view room was very quiet and the bed was comfortable. ",5,2017,11,08
11,One of the best hotels in Barcelona,"My wife and I stayed here on a recent trip to Barcelona with friends.   The hotel is located in a very popular area , with most sites being walking distance.  There are plenty of stores and restaurants in the immediate surrounding area.  The staff is very friendly.  They have a breakfast buffet that was really good.  The rooms are small, which is common in Europe, but they are very comfortable.  The bed and pillows are wonderful!  There is a great rooftop bar, that has beautiful views of the city.  Especially at night.  Very beautiful hotel.  I strongly suggest to stay here when visiting Barcelona.  ",5,2017,11,07
11,The only place to stay,"Will admit I am super picky when it comes to hotels. I researched where to stay in Barcelona for weeks until finally settling on the Majestic. I read a few reviews where people stated they come back to Barcelona just to stay there. Pretty big claim so had to see for myself. WOW hands down my favorite hotel in the world. From the second we checked in the level of service, attention to detail and overall vibe in the hotel is phenomenal. When you get off the elevator for your floor you are bathed in the most magical smell on the planet as they have their own scent that carries through the hotel. The rooms are lush and have every amenity you need. The rooftop pool view is fabulous only wish we could have enjoyed it but it rained two of the days. Loved the bartender Jorge (George) who was so much fun. Location wise the hotel is surrounded by all of the top shops and restaurants. We stayed in October which is breast cancer awareness month and the hotel was bathed in pink. Classy. I will only stay at this hotel and can’t wait to return very soon. Can’t review any of the food since we were busy dining out so will make sure to cover that next time. Enjoy! ",5,2017,11,05
11,Barcelona's grand hotel,"Travelled regularly to Barcelona, stayed at the Majestic for the first time. Hotel is located at my favorite location in the middle of Passeig Gracia which provides easy access to all interesting sites of the city. 

The hotel entrance is very grande, and they have this nice smell in the lobby. My room was small but well appointed. Main travel purpose was business and this hotel provides for everything you need:

- Efficient staff to check-in and additional requests
- Lobby lounge for quick coffee and bites
- Fast and free wifi
- Excellent bedding and cleaning of the rooms

The unique selling point of this hotel is their rooftop bar, very lively atmosphere during the evening and even with a small dipping pool.

This hotel provides value for money, highly recommended",5,2017,11,05
11,Best in Barca,"Love this hotel - have stayed here often and it's my go to. Some of the rooms are very small but service is great, food, staff are all top notch. Location is also perfect. Dont miss the roof pool and bar for amazing views of the city. BCN is one of my favorite destinations.",5,2017,11,05
11,Elegant Luxury Hotel,"Staff excellent and concierge very helpful.
Rooftop beautifull views of the city.  The rooftop bar and food incredible excellent .  Breakfast Buffet superb will all  types of eggs made to order, european breads, yogurt , all european spanish cold cuts,.
Definite a 5+ Hotel. Will return and recommend to my friends.

11,Beware of the cruise ships,"This is once legendary Barcelona business hotel that has found a lucrative market hosting passenger arrivals for the cruise ships.   It is a five star property but you will be miserable if you get caught in a check in time with a cruise ship group (with everything that implies) as we found ourselves.     Although we were traveling on our own, we were shuttled away from the main front check in to a side room that the hotel has set up to deal when the hoards of passengers arrive en mass.   Since the cruise ships return every week, their passengers are given priorities while you fend for yourself in a hideously long line unfitting for a five star property.  We had to wait til 3 pm for check in while all the cruise passengers were given the early available rooms despite our American Express preferred request for early check in.  We love this hotel, the rooms are dated but well kept, the breakfasts are outstanding, the personnel (when not dealing with large tour groups) are well trained and gracious.    However, by aiming their hotel to the cruise market, hotel management has made this property unattractive to the individual traveler.",2,2017,10,28
11,Fantastic location & beautiful building ,"I came here with my elderly parents and sister for a family break. We had a lovely time and the staff were very accommodating.
The cleaners would clean our room twice a day which was fantastic. 
Lovely rooftop bar and views of the city but shame it closes so early in winter! ",4,2017,10,28
11,Terrible,"We were due to travel at the start of October and booked and paid in advance. Sadly we were struck by disaster when firstly a well known airline cancelled our flights and then another airline who we booked alternative flights with went bankrupt and cancelled our flights 4 days before travel.  It was impossible to get flights on the dates we had the hotel booked!

We contacted the hotel to see our options and were told we had paid and that was that no refund, no change of dates nothing. I couldn’t speak to a manager or anyone in reservations as they were on strike and the hotel refused several requests to supply a cancellation invoice so we could claim on our travel insurance.

Terrible service, we would have happily rearranged by a few days when we could get flights but we will never stay at this hotel. What did they expect us to do when we couldn’t fly? They asked me to provide proof of all the cancelled flights which I promptly emailed and even then they wouldn’t even let us change by one day to get an alternative flight from another airport.  I fully understand their policy however I have never known a company be so inflexible and to not provide a cancellation/no show invoice leaves us in limbo as we can’t claim a refund through insurers either. Very poor communication",1,2017,10,26
11,A Work / Pleasure Trip,"I had to travel to Barcelona for a work event mid September. I decided to bring my wife along and her sister. We looked at a number of options and came across the Majestic Hotel and their apartment rentals.

We have never been to Barcelona before so we  didn't know what to expect, but we were completely satisfied with this hotel and our apartment option.

Even though the apartments are located across the street from the hotel it didn't make you feel like you weren't part of the hotel. We utilized the restaurants as well as the fabulous roof bar every evening.

The apartments were clean, modern, secure, and full of features you would want to have during your stay, such as a full kitchen, washer and dryer in the apartment, two full baths, and enough room for three to four people comfortably. 

Also the hotel is located perfectly for shopping, for which my wife took full advantage of while I was at work.

The staff of the hotel was exceptional. From check in to check out, recommendations of where to go and  places to eat,  they were all very helpful.

If we ever have an opportunity return to Barcelona I would most certainly visit the Majestic Hotel again.

11,Beautiful hotel. Wonderful location.,Great location. Lots of upscale shopping. Very close to both Gaudi apartments. Staff was very friendly & attentive. The rooftop was amazing! 360 degree views of the city! Little gifts of perfume & chocolate left daily. The room was beautiful. On a very busy street but with the windows closed you barely heard anything.,5,2017,10,23
11,A home away from home (with a fabulous spa!),"The hotel is in a good location, they have a great staff, the rooms are very comfortable....and then there is the spa!  Loved it!  My massage and facial were heavenly!  The spa is located next to the rooftop lounge so you can relax outside and enjoy a view of the city after your treatments.

Note - The pool is a small dipping pool so do not expect to swim laps.",5,2017,10,22
11,Mighty Majestic,"What a wonderful hotel! The staff was exceptional, after a long flight from Texas, they were so accommodating and let us check in early where we could go to bed. It was in a great location centrally location. Loved the balcony's where you could go out at night and see all the hustle and bustle of Barcelona. It truly is a 5 star hotel. The rooms and bathroom was so nice and at night the put house slippers out for you beside the bed. Great view from the top of hotel with pool a great place to go have a drink. I definitely would stay there again if travels take me to Barcelona again.",5,2017,10,22
11,Magnificent Majestic,"The Majestic is a beautiful hotel and very centrally located.  As expected, the staff is very professional, courteous, helpful, and friendly.  I've already made a reservation for a return trip in February.  The rooftop bar offers not only tapas and drinks, but a stunning view of Barcelona.  I'm already looking forward to going back.",5,2017,10,21
11,Good place,"The hotel is very nice, polite and friendly staff and very clean. We had rooms in the main hotel which were very nice and 2 apartments. The apartments are situated across the road so you do feel apart and very separate to the actual hotel. The apartment room sizes are huge and ideal for families or groups of mates but no where near as nice as the actual hotel rooms. The spa is nice but very very small and always booked, so pre book. Breakfast was great. The walk in to town is nice, but isn’t on the doorstep, probably a cab ride home if you’re under the influence. Overall good though & recommended.",4,2017,10,21
11,"The best !! Seriously,, amazing !!","We book several 4 and 5 star hotel in our 5 week trip in Europe and Morocco ,,, this especial one ,was the best treat ,amenities ,service,food !! They did amazing job and for sure would be a must in our next trip to Barcelona !!! Congratulations to the staff and the management !! ",5,2017,10,20
11,"Beautiful hotel, Excellent location and really helpful staff","We recently stayed at the Majestic Hotel for our friends 50th birthday. The hotel is located at the high end shopping of Barcelona but within walking distance to the main La Ramblas, Gothic Quarter and many cultural sites like Sagrada Familia and Casa Mila. 

The reception and lounge areas were very comfortable and inviting and the rooms were clean and modern. All the staff we spoke with were very friendly from the staff on the roof top terrace to the staff in the spa and at reception who very always willing to help. 

Unfortunately we did not have breakfast at the hotel but there are many cafes close by which serve a good breakfast. We would definitely come back here again not just to the Majestic but to Barcelona, there is so much to see and do in such a beautiful city.",5,2017,10,20
11,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful experience","We were at the hotel for the 2nd time, and it was even better than I remembered from last year.  The lobby is a busy, active spot, but the staff always has time for you.  The lobby bar has quiet corners, a nice selection of bar food, and a good selection of drinks.

The 10th floor bar that surrounds the swimming pool is The Place to be at sunset. It can be a bit windy, but the view is worth it.  There are more food selections than at the lobby bar. The seafood tapas are excellent.

We only had breakfast in the main dining room.  It is a cheerful place and the buffet has a good selection.

Our room didn't have a view, but it was spacious enough for several chairs.  After a busy day, it was nice to unwind there with some wine and cheese.

The hotel is on a busy street, suitable for walking, with lots of nearby shops and places to eat - all price ranges.",5,2017,10,20
11,Excellent location and staff!,"Our family stayed here for 3 nights. Centrally located.  Staff and service is top notch!  We were in a cab returning with the kids and the bellman noticed/remembered us and told us to wait so he could go fetch some umbrellas so we wouldn't get wet in the rain.  Rooms are spotless, clean and new looking.  Beds and pillows were very comfortable.  They have a turndown service at night. Pool/patio on the rooftop is clean and cozy.  Superior service mall around.  Breakfast was fantastic with lots of options. ",5,2017,10,19
11,Lovely Hotel & Excellent Service,"The hotel is beautiful and luxurious. The staff are extremely courteous & helpful! They made our wedding anniversary trip there very special. The rooms are spacious. The food & drinks at the roof top bar/pool area were delicious! 100% recommend, will stay again! Thanks",5,2017,10,17
11,Bedrooms need an upgrade,"The common areas of this hotel are majestic. We spent Christmas 2016 here, as a group of seven, and enjoyed being able to gather in the lounge and walk to all the great nearby restaurants. As overnight guests though, we were surprised by how jaded the guest corridors were, and then by our room. Breaks in the wallpaper were obvious and the bed wasn't fluffy and inviting. Also, the top in-room TV channels they offer are Arabic, followed by local ones. ",3,2017,10,15
11,Perfect stay,"We decided to book this hotel for our first Barcelona experience. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful. The room was beyond our expectations. The location is great: away from Las Ramblas, but not too far so you can easily walk everywhere you want to go. 

We absolutely recommend!",5,2017,10,14
11,A Beautiful Property,"The Majestic Hotel is located very centrally on the Paseo des Gracia.  
This is a gorgeous hotel with beautiful immaculate rooms, many with balconies looking at the Paseo de Gracia to one side and the mountains to the other.  
They have a roof top deck with a bar, restaurant and pool that overlooks the entire city of Barcelona.  There is a lovely SPA on the same level at the roof deck. We booked a Signature rate which included a free SPA service.  The service was wonderful.  Breakfast was a full elegant buffet including cooked to order eggs,  yoghurt served in glass jars as well as champagne among countless other items.
The service at the hotel was excellent.  I would highly recommend staying at the Majestic.",5,2017,10,13
11,Close to perfection,"Very well situated on a large avenue, close to a few Gaudi's buildings and not far from the old town, this traditional high-end hotels is close to perfection: very professional and friendly service, excellent comfort and cleanliness, nice atmosphere, outstanding breakfast, top terrasse with a bar and a nice view over the city ... what else can you ask for? Yes, maybe a larger swimming pool.
",5,2017,10,13
11,Spa retreat,"I treated myself to a facial and massage here during my visit to Barcelona. I walked in and they gave me the appointment for the following day starting at 1300 hours telling me that was the earliest available which I accepted. As I was leaving she offered me a hydrotherapy session for 11:30 which I accepted. That night I sent an email cancelling the hydrotherapy realizing I was only interested in the facial and massage. I arrived at 1230 to fill out paperwork and my specialist took me right away and midway through my treatment she said she’ll have to incorporate my next service into my next session since I arrived late. I told her I was early and that my appointment wasn’t until 1300 to which she said no. It was at 1200. 
Apparently the receptionist was able to give me an earlier appointment without telling me. So now my services were rushed unnecessarily. 
The receptionist there on the day of my services was also there the previous day and knew I was never given new times and offered an apology. 
The facial was great. The massage could’ve been better. I’m unfamiliar with the forearm technique and more pressure could’ve been applied but I keep thinking it’ll gradually get stronger which it never did.",3,2017,10,12
11,Stunning,This hotel in a great location in Barcelona is beautiful. The staff and ambience are impeccable.  It is very well appointed with decor and design.  We felt very comfortable and safe in this stunningly beautiful hotel.  The roof top bar and restaurant are a must with a view of the entire city and good food.,5,2017,10,11
11,Total comfort,"The service was outstanding and friendly in this comfortable 5 star hotel.  It's location made it easy to walk to the old town and visit many of the attractions in this wonderful city.
The roof top bar is a must, and the breakfast buffer is one of the most complete (and tasty) we have experienced. ",5,2017,10,11
11,Luxury Hotel with Unbeatable Location,"The Majestic is fortunate to be situated in the heart of Barcelona's best shopping, with countless good restaurants and sightseeing within easy walking distance. Very upscale area.  Staff offer excellent service in every department.  Special recognition to the room attendants who restored our room to order, provided extra pillows moments after they were requested, and in general did an amazing job. While we were there a one-day general strike meant that some employees had difficulty getting to work.  You'd never know there was a glitch, though I noticed the people on duty when we left that morning were the same ones who welcomed us back with smiles ten hours later.  Outstanding, generous breakfast buffet. Lovely rooftop for relaxing.  The downside is that rooms are kind of cramped (even though we supposedly had an upgrade), the bed wasn't particularly comfortable and the shower was a poor design that sent water all over the floor. No bathtub. Good hotel facilities including spa, great concierges are compensation for room shortcomings.",4,2017,10,07
11,Well located and great staff,"This is a quality hotel in the centre of the city. Staff are outstanding.
Basic rooms are small, given the price, with poor storage for 2 travellers.
Highlight is the rooftop where you have views over the whole city as you dine on quality tapas or a regular menu.",4,2017,10,07
11,Good choice!!,"We landed in Barcelona without a hotel booking - crazy us!! And made last minute decision and picked Majestic. Indeed a fantastic choice. Located centrally in the heart of the city. The hotel is beautiful. Loved the room. The hotel is surrounded by great restaurants and great shops. 
Staffs are professional and very helpful. Barcelona is majestic!

11,5 Day stop along the way,Stayed five nights in this fantastic hotel while touring the town and the staff ensured we were well taken care of. The SPA is a definite must do while there as well as the roof top bar and grille which has some of the best views in the town. Would definitely stay again if back in Barcelona.,5,2017,10,03
11,Slow check in,Don't plan on getting in your room early no matter what they promise. It's beautiful and the staff is really nice. The rooftop bar has awesome tapas and a large selection of drinks. The spa also has many services but no manicure. ,4,2017,10,03
11,While on a walking tour,"I leaned over to my girlfriend and said look how majestic that building is then we got closer and saw it was called the majestic hotel.
Ha ha moment 
Loved the building located on passieg de Gracia.
Didn't get to seethe inside but if it's as nice as the outside.....",4,2017,10,02
11,Lovely hotel in Great Location,"Spent 4 nights here with my husband on our first trip to Barcelona and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Location cannot be beat - we walked everywhere and were within a couple of blocks of major Gaudi sites, La Pedrera and Casa Battlo. The concierge was helpful with information and restaurant reservations. The bedroom and bathroom were large and the bed was very comfortable. Quiet despite being on busy Passeig De Gracia. We enjoyed cocktails at the wonderful rooftop bar with a gorgeous view of the city. Would definitely recommend and would stay here again.",4,2017,10,02
11,Early evening drink at the roof top bar,"We had a guided tour of Barcelona during the day time and our guide told us that if you go into the lobby and ask to go to the roof top bar for a drink they generally let you. 
We went up to the roof and were greeted by a lovely waitress who asked us to wait a minute whilst she found us a table. we enjoyed a lovely glass of white wine each and delicious olives stuffed with anchovies. A wonderful place to see Barcelona from the roof and a great start to an evening out.",5,2017,10,02
11,"""VIP"" Treatment, fabulous hotel, outstanding service!!!","From the moment we arrived, to the morning we departed, we felt like VIP's.  Unwound in the spa after an overnight flight...the perfect solution for two weary, jet-lagged travelers embarking on their 17th wedding anniversary vacation!  Enjoyed cocktails at the rooftop terrace bar and took in the cosmopolitan Barcelona sights from the sky high view!  What a selection the daily breakfast buffet offered, could not wait to wake up early to enjoy the savory treats!  There was a selection for everyone's tastebuds and dietary restrictions, with flavorful coffee to please all!  The staff at the Majestic went out of their way to make sure we were happy in every way.  Upon our arrival the hotel's Director General, Pascal introduced himself and welcomed us to the Majestic.   The room was well-appointed along with a very comfortable bed and linens to match in addition to the marble bath featuring luxury products and inviting robes and towels.  You may decide to select this hotel because of its fantastic location on the Passeig de Gracia, but you will be truly pleased with all it has to offer above and beyond its location.  Highly recommend this hotel, and plan to visit again.  A big THANK YOU to the staff at the Majestic for making this occasion quite memorable!",5,2017,09,30
11,A good luxury hotel.,"My wife and I traveled with a group to Barcelona in September and everything was just right at the Majestic. Service, rooms, bed and bathroom were very good. The hotel just seemed to be lacking that something special. Predictably good, but not extra special.",4,2017,09,28
11,Wow,"This hotel is outstanding. The service is exceptional from the moment you step out of your taxi. The room was beautiful and the bed exceptionally comfortable. We also enjoyed the roof top terrace / bar. The hotel offered a great selection at breakfast. Unfortunately we had to leave. Our taxi driver said there is only one Majestic. He was right!

I would definitely stay again.",5,2017,09,24
11,"Beautiful hotel, great service ","Had a lovely stay here during the holiday season. Had 12 family members, ages 10-70, and everyone was very happy at the hotel. Service and food were good. Rooms very nice. Location outstanding. Enjoyed the spa as well though the language barrier there was a little challenging. ",5,2017,09,23
11,Best Bath in Barcelona !!!,"Overall a great Barcelona Hotel. The decor throughout the public areas is quite grand  with plenty of pleasant staff to assist you in every way, but probably the more important is the guest areas. I loved the corridor lighting and decor with always a pleasant perfumed smell. The room itself was large and well thought out with nice little touches such as a travel adapter, coffee machine, and soap of a decent size and quantity. As for the bath, loved it, could nearly swim in the thing ! Breakfast was lovely set on the first floor but seeming to have a garden sun room attached, all very pleasant. Try the roof top for lunch or dinner or just a drink with great views over the City. The Hotel is in a great central position with shortish walks to all main attractions. Plenty of restaurants nearby if you want to eat out one evening. This is no way a budget hotel so be prepared to pay and enjoy.",5,2017,09,23
11,excellent hotel with great concierge,"Hotel room was very nice. Rooftop bar has great view of city.

Concierge was very helpful with shopping and food recommendations.

We had a problem with noisy young people above us the first night, making noise multiple times at odd early hours.  The hotel handled the issue appropriately, upgrading and moving our room.

Every service we utilized in the hotel was good.I'm certain the that we had another day and the opportunity to use the spa it would have been great. This is a first rate property.",5,2017,09,22
11,Majestic experience,"This hotel is impeccable. The rooms are a generous size and the bathrooms are very spacious--very rare for Europe. The hotel is bright, immaculate and beautifully decorated. It is a pricey hotel but it truly lives up to its five-star ranking in all aspects. 

We stayed in the Passeig de Gracia suite with a street view. The bed was very comfortable, there was a pull-out couch for our daughter. At night, we could slide pocket doors that closed off our part of the room from where the couch is, allowing for privacy.

The location is ideal, situated in the core of the city--you can walk to all the main attractions and terrific restaurants.

The breakfast buffet is superb! So many delectable items to choose from. The rooftop terrace is beautiful with its stunning panoramic view of this magnificent city. We enjoyed drinks and some caesar salads. 

The personnel are so friendly and helpful and do everything they can to add to the comfort and pleasure of your stay. The concierge staff were terrific at giving us pointers and resto recommendations. 

The only thing I wish is that they had a bigger pool on the roof. It's tiny, more like two bathtubs. They used the space to maximize terrace seating.

Would visit Barcelona again just to stay at this hotel!",5,2017,09,22
11,Beautiful hotel in a beautiful city,"Wow.  What a great hotel.  From the moment we entered, the staff could not have been more attentive.  A beautiful pool/bar on the roof deck with majestic views of the city.  Our rooms was spacious and well-appointed.  The concierge was very informative and helped us plan our stay in Barcelona.  A great place to stay",5,2017,09,19
11,In the heart of things,"Stayed at Majestic after a 7 day cruise of the Riviera. Hotel exceeded our expectations. Location is perfect for all the Guadi spots, great shopping, and excellent restaurants. Hotel rooftop is a must and breakfast is fabulous. Our room was spacious and very up to date. Add in the service and its 5 star for sure.",5,2017,09,18
11,Comfortable stay and professional staff ,"We stayed in junior suite facing pas. de Grassia. Class, comfortable and clean room with marbled good size bathroom. You feel you are in 5 stars hotel by room, service and professional staff. The hotel entrance on pass de Grassia (major avenue in Barcelona with many luxury brand shops like chanel, LV, gucci…etc are few steps from hotel. 10 minutes walk to las ramblas and shopping.  Rooms were sound-proof externally and between rooms. Excellent concierge service with staff helped us for trips and dinning arrangements. I'm surprised that nearby claris hotel is ranked #16 and majestic hotel #46 as we did stayed in claris and left (prematurely) and moved to majestic. Big difference in favor for majestic by all parameters (room, comfort, service,staff, professionalism…). ",5,2017,09,15
11,Excellent experience,What an excellent hotel. Beautiful room with view. Roof terrace is exceptional. Chefs tapas plate with cava for lunch really nice and looks beautiful. Staff in hotel all very nice. Especially the Dutch guy from room service.  They all want to feel you very special. We will come back! ,5,2017,09,15
11,Hotel Majestic,"Just got back from staying at the Hotel Majestic & Spa in Barcelona, Spain.  I can't say enough about the hotel and its staff - first class all the way.  Beautiful hotel (we stayed in an apartment - 2 bedrooms with a full kitchen - and couldn't have been more happy), fantastic location.  HIGHLY recommend this wonderful hotel.",5,2017,09,13
11,Great Hotel in a Great City,I was in charge of a large medical congress in Barcelona several weeks ago at the CCIB convention center. I chose not to stay close to there because we wanted to be close to the downtown area. We stayed at the Majestic and i am glad i did -- great hotel on a great street in a great city.  The staff was helpful and so professional.  This is where I will be staying the next time i am in Barcelona.,5,2017,09,11
11,Excellent Penthouse,"We loved our week in Barcelona at this hotel. We were greeted by Syrin at the front desk. She was perfect in welcoming us and checking on us throughout the week. Jorge was an excellent mixologist at the bar and Bruno was perfect all week as our butler. He thought of everything! When we return to Barcelona, we will stay here again, just to see everyone. They made us feel welcome; like family. And, they meant it!!",5,2017,09,11
11,Pesadilla Argentina,"Very good Hotel in Barcelona. Located in the heart of the city,  in Paseo de Gracia. The staff is excellent and the service very well trained, and fast to respond.  The rooms and bath excellent the linens of the bed also Great. Always full be sure to make a reservation",5,2017,09,10
11,"Perfect hotel, great experience!","The hotel is impeccable. 
The rooms are big and comfortable. The concierge and the staff is helpful, they are willing to  help you if you have any question o problem.
The central location of the hotel is superb, it is situated on the best shopping street, so you can have great shopping experience in Barcelona.
The hotel has excellent gym, offering perfect possibility for workout after hard day :)",5,2017,09,10
11,Outstanding experience,"We stayed at Hotel Majestica Residence for our stay in Barcelona.  The hotel and the residence were impeccable.  The hotel staff were extremely helpful and friendly.  The concierge was able to work their magic to attain a group of 10 last minute reservations at various restaurants, and the rooftop bar at the hotel was always able to accommodate our party.  The central location of the hotel was superb as well.  A subway stop a two minute walk away, gets you to the beach in 3 subway stops, or you can take a taxi from the taxi stand just outside the hotel.  I highly recommend this hotel for group trips, business travelers, couples and families.  Just make sure it is in your price point.",5,2017,09,05
11,Wonderful stay for family in apartment,"Traveling as a family of four, we booked one of the two bedroom apartments located across the street from the hotel.    We couldn't have been happier with the apartment.   It was very new, clean, modern, spacious, quiet and comfortable.   There were two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a full kitchen with a full size washer and full size separate dryer (unusual for Europe).   Our booking included breakfast at the hotel, which was a luxurious treat with a huge selection of options and attentive, efficient service.   In fact, everyone we interacted with at the hotel was friendly and helpful.    The location was very good in the luxury shopping district with many dining options and the subway nearby.    Highly recommended.

My only wish would have been for a larger bed in the master (the bed appeared to be the equivalent of an American queen).    They did add a rollaway bed for us which made this a non-issue.",5,2017,09,05
11,Service experince,"The rooms are great, well groomed and the ambiance welcoming. The food is good and they have a great gym for those who like to work out. The staff are friendly and willing to help and wake you at 3:30 am if you have an early morning flight as I had. There are great shopping malls nearby for the shoppers.",5,2017,09,04
11,An outstanding experience,We stayed here for 3 nights prior to a Seabourn cruise August 2-5 and the overall experience was excellent with early room availability through to brilliant and friendly service from all but particularly Rafael in Concierge and Lucie in El Bar del Majestic.If we return to Barcelona this is the only hotel we will stay in.,5,2017,09,02
11,Excellent hotel with very nice staff,"This was a very good hotel with very good breakfast buffet, rooms are luxurious, very clean with all the needed amenities 
Located in a very nice area for both food and shopping,
Very close to diagonal metro station which connects you to many places in the city,
This will be my favorite hotel in Barcelona  ",5,2017,09,02
11,Heavenly,"We had booked a room at the ABac boutique hotel but their A/C failed so during our cruise they kindly notified us and arranged for a lovely room at the same cost at the Majestic. They also sent wine and cheese to our room - cudos to ABac for their thoughtfulness and customer service.

What a serendipitous change! We did, however, arrive 12 hours after the horrific terrorist rampage and didn't know what to expect since the hotel was only 3 blocks from where the rampage started. Surprisingly, the hotel was business as usual.  These wonderful people were determined to carry on and make us feel so welcome despite being in shock. We took time to show our support at the various memorials.

The hotel was perfectly central and just up from Las Ramblas and the main shopping areas.  The awesome Segrada Familia cathedral was a 20 minute walk. The hotel reception is open but not too large, with excellent staff.  The hallways are beautifully designed with lovely lighting.  Our deluxe room was surprisingly spacious, with a nice hallway leading into the bedroom area. The bathroom was fairly small but done up nicely. The bed was large and very comfortable with beautiful soft linens. The room was quite quiet given we had an interior room. It was decorated in lovely cream and yellow colours.

Two highlights for us were the fantastic rooftop bar and pool, and the breakfasts.  The bar and pool are very well staffed and have an outstanding view of the city. We enjoyed the fresh pressed juices. A lovely place for drinks, a light meal or a dip in the small pool. The 'continental breakfast ' was one of the nicest and most diverse I've ever had! A large spread including hot and cold selections, made to order eggs, pastries, fruit, cheeses, local meats, and even champagne and orange juice. Truly lovely.  A third highlight was the extremely pleasant and helpful staff - they did everything to make us feel truly welcome.

We cannot wait to return!",5,2017,09,02
11,"Beautiful hotel, perfectly situated, with faultless service","From the moment our driver picked us up and told us we were staying in one of the best hotels in Barcelona I was looking forward to it and I think he was right. It's a spectacular building on a fabulous street. Ideally located for the metro, tour bus and within walking distance of many main sights.
The hotel itself was flawless in my opinion. Lovely well appointed room, bed, linen etc. 
The staff were all faultless in their service. We ordered a bar meal one evening and our seating area was swiftly turned into a dining space...nothing was too much trouble. 
The roof terrace and pool overlooking the city have a spectacular view of Sagrada Familia. We will be returning to Barcelona and we will definitely be staying here again!",5,2017,09,01
11,Magnifeco at the Majestic!,What an incredible experience! Bravo to the visionaries who have maintained and built on the legacy of this property. The food and service are exceptional. Special thanks to concierge Syrian and Fabio at the rooftop bar. We will be back!,5,2017,08,30
11,Vacation in Barcelona ,One of the best hotels I visited this year. The location is ideal very close to the metro walking distance to Rambla the staff everywhere in the hotel are excellent the room is very comfortable the 10th floor terrace and bar are beautiful except the pool which is small. I highly recommend this hotel for a family vacation in Barcelona ,5,2017,08,30
11,Beautiful hotel,"Majestic is right at the heart of barcelona and is a beautiful hotel, we always book a suite but this time booked a junior suite and loved it, everything is right outside the hotel, brands, shopping centres, etc. concierge was very knowledgeable and with her recommendations we had the best tapas in Barcelona for dinner twice!! I would highly recommend this beautiful hotel.",5,2017,08,30
11,Not what I expected for a 5 Star...,"Starting with the positive the staff was very nice, helpful and pleasant. During our stay we used the pool area and the interns on staff were very helpful getting us towels, drinks and taking our pictures. They also gave us great suggestions on which tour sites to check out. 

As for our deluxe room I was NOT AT ALL IMPRESSED. After our workout, we went up to shower and got burned with steaming hot water as the plumbing system was messed up. We waited 45 mins to jump back in and only had super cold water so we took quick showers. I got stuck with no water with soap all over my body. I had to wait another 30 mins to shower because we only had brown water coming out. Needless to say we missed one of your tours due to these issues. The next day one of the bars in the shower broke off as I was holding on to get up after a bubble bath. Room service took forever for anything we ordered. When we raised these issues during check out the staff didn't seem to care or be bother to ask if we wanted to speak with a manager. Was definitely disappointed and WILL NOT RETURN.

The airport transfers are NOT INCLUDED and ridiculous overpriced coming from a New Yorker. Bus transfers and Taxi's are less than $35 euros so take that in a heartbeat.

As for location its perfect just not what I expected from a 5 star hotel. 

Food and drinks are super expensive. We bought sodas and snacks from the local market. Coca cola 1 Euro - hotel charges 7 Euros.",3,2017,08,28
11,"Location, location, location!",A beautiful hotel right on Paseo de Gracia in the heart of Barcelona. Situated in between two of Gaudi's masterpieces and only a short walk to Sagrada Familia Catherdral. The deluxe room was of generous size and the bed was a very comfortable king. The lobby bar and tapas restaurant had wonderfully comfortable seating and good service. The buffet breakfast was outstanding with both European and American favorites. Please don't miss the rooftop bar and pool which has great views and is just a cool place to hang out! We would not hesitate to stay at the Majestic again on our next trip to Barcelona!,5,2017,08,28
11,Lovely short stay prior to joining a cruise,"Very well situated hotel right in the heart of Barcelona and all the sights easily walkable. Luxury hotel, rooms very well appointed, public spaces spacious and inviting. Food very good, both at dinner and breakfast. Breakfast choice extensive. Staff efficient and friendly.",4,2017,08,28
11,Beautiful 5 Star Hotel ,Spectacular hotel.  We stayed for two nights and room was very nice.  The staff at the hotel was amazing and always accomodating.  The roof top terrace has a great bar and has beautiful sites at night.  Highly recommend this hotel. ,5,2017,08,28
11,Great city hotel,"Visiting our son in Barcelona we chose the Grand because it is well located and we were not disappointed.  All the main sights of Barcelona are easy to get to, many within an easy walk.  We went for the basic level of room but it had everything we wanted, a comfortable bed and a powerful shower.  We overlooked a side street and so were not troubled by the noise of the city.  The rooftop pool is only really big enough for a refreshing dip, not really a swimming pool but we passed a few hours enjoying drink and a cool off in the pool.  Breakfast was very busy, there was a fairly extensive buffet as well as an egg station cooking omelettes, fried eggs etc to order.  A good city hotel.",4,2017,08,23
11,Last Minute Choice and I am so glad we made it,"Our trip to Barcelona was rescued by this wonderful luxury hotel. We had booked an apartment which turned out to be a disaster, so when I wandered into the lobby of this hotel I was really touched that they were willing to have the concierge make a dinner reservation for us and also to help in several other ways. I managed to leave the apartment and we moved into two adjoining rooms at the Majestic. The rooms were great. The service superb and friendly and really knowledgeable and helpful. The concierges were all excellent and never made us feel like we were asking too much. The breakfast was huge and expansive and opulent and was a highlight of the day. That bar on the roof, next to the tiny pool has an amazing view and the friendly staffers were great in bringing us either an espresso or a glass of champagne. And you could not get a better location, smack dab in the middle of the Passege de Gracia and close to all of the Gaudi buildings.  I would and will certainly return to this fine hotel.",5,2017,08,22
11,"""Majic"" of the Hotel Majestic","The location of the Hotel Majestic is superb for walking to La Sagrada Familia and the Gaudi apartments. The boulevard in front of the hotel reminded me of the Champs Elysee in that the location was superb. The walk to La Sagrada is about 20-25 minutes but it is flat, though one must zig zag to get to the cross walks. The Gaudi Apartments are about a block away.
The rooms are spacious and tastefully decorated, though if you are bothered by street noise, you may want a more quiet room at the back. Street noise continues throughout the night. The bathroom is a bit dated in that one must be a contortionist to get out of the tub. It is a bit high and I'm surprised they don't have warning signs for people to use the grab bars. The separation of the toilet/bidet area from the bathroom is a nice touch for those sharing a room.
The staff at the Majestic is the most courteous, congenial and helpful I have ever encountered, from the bell men to the check-in clerk, business center staff and concierge. I believe their names were David, Christina (sp?) Oliver and I am sorry I did not get the name of the concierge who came to our rescue as we stood in line somewhat impatiently.
It would be nice if hotels would start putting two luggage racks/room, especially since most of us travel w/ fairly sizeable pieces of luggage and carry-ons!",5,2017,08,22
11,Worth the Expense,"We stayed at the apartments across the street.  This was the rare occasion where the apartment was better than the pictures.  Everything was new and very clean.  Our flight arrived in the morning, so we knew the rooms would not be ready.  On the basement level there was a spacious restroom where we freshened up and changed clothes.  We dropped our bags at the front desk and went to the rooftop for a light lunch with drinks.  The front desk sent a text when the rooms were ready.  We had breakfast each morning at the buffet and were impressed with the service and broad selection.  We ended each night on the rooftop.  A Hop-on-Hop-Off bus stop is a block away.There is a nice (but inexpensive) wine store called Cellar on the block.  Also on the block is a restaurant called Citrus which looks fancy but is surprisingly affordable.

We did not order room service.  We were only there for three days so we declined daily housekeeping.  (They provided a load of towels at the start.)  If we came back again we would make better use of the kitchen, which was fully stocked with glassware, plates and pans.  There were a few grocery stores within walking distance.  We washed a load of laundry.  It was easy to get a taxi because they line up across the street.  

We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it -- especially if you are traveling with a group or family.",5,2017,08,22
11,Mrs Robinson,"We recently had 4 nights here pre and post our cruise. The staff both on Reception and on duty in the rooftop bar were brilliant. Nothing was too much trouble and the service was both friendly and very professional . There were Security delays at the airport and both our cruise line and the hotel suggested that an extra hour should be allowed for check in. Whilst we had made private arrangements for a car transfer the hotel reception staff contacted the company on our behalf and changed the arrangements . They followed this up not only by emailing me confirmation but by also putting a hard copy under our room door. Great service. 
At the rooftop bar we had wonderful tapas, gin and tonics and great conversations with our waiter who was from Bogota,Columbia. We would definitely stay again. Not cheap but in a fantastic position for shops and sights.",5,2017,08,21
11,Hotel,"We stayed for a 10 day period, with 2 rooms.  The rooms were fabulous - up to date, clean, and very comfortable.  All our requests were honored by the wonderful staff.  The cleaning service and concierge were very polite and always helpful.  Would recommend this hotel to any family.  Location is also one of the best.",5,2017,08,19
11,Barcelona in style ,"It's a Great location, service and rooms. Elegant hotel, great breakfast. Also a Roof top bar and views! Very close to the best shops and we can walk everywhere. Very multicultural so if you prefer less mix maybe not the ideal one. But for us is Just Perfect! I met a lovely lady from Uruguay. ",5,2017,08,14
11,Authentic food and memorable stay ever...,"It was my first visit to Barcelona,Really enjoy the authentic taste of Spanish Paella and other Catalan traditional food items.There are many historic buildings and monuments.Stay is majestic hotel really worth full and the spa is also nice.The picturesque beauty of the hotel and Barcelona always in my good old memories.",5,2017,08,13
11,Amazing Experience - Luxurious Base for Your Visit to Barcelona,"We used the hotel for a business trip to Barcelona.Since we were hosting a group of journalists, nothing could be left to chance and the hotel and its staff did not disappoint. the service was first class - especially in arranging a gala dinner for the guests - the rooms were excellent too. The hotel itself is ideally located for shopping, dining out and visiting the sights, with two of the city's landmark Gaudi buildings almost on its doorstep. I'd go back any time for business or pleasure!",5,2017,08,11
11,The best place to be.,"Beautiful hotel,the location you can't ask for any better.If you are a shopper that's the place to be. The hotel is located in the middle of all upscale stores.
As soon as you pull in to the hotel,someone will great you and help you with the luggage. The staff is very friendly. Lots of great restaurants near by. And the advantage is that you don't need to take a taxi,everything is walking distance .
If you ever go to Barcelona that's the place to stay.",5,2017,08,09
11,Great Location for a short trip to Barcelona,"As I had never been to Barcelona, I was recommended to stay in the main city center instead of the marina and was recommended to stay in this hotel by friend. Spent 3 nights here and I could not have been happier with the location. There are loads of restaurants and bars near by and all the main shops are located close by too. The hotel is grand and the bell boy and reception staff are welcoming. They have a fantastic rooftop bar and pool area (although its a splash pool rather than anything you can swim in), but the views of Barcelona are amazing from up there. So these were the good things about the hotel, however, there were several things that made doubt whether this was a true top 5* hotel.

We were given a deluxe room and on first entry the smell of the room was terrible. It smelled of damp and cigarettes. This was probably due to the HVAC system had not being cleaned in the room. The room was also ALOT smaller than what we expected. And we would not have said anything but for the fact, we had 2 other rooms of the exact room category for the same price that were ALOT bigger and had balconies. The room did have a bigger bathroom but to be honest I think it is more important that the room is large and the bathroom small.....just my own thoughts. There were also several signs the room was dated and in need of maintenance (although the general decor of the room was good). So with this in mind we requested that we change the room. However, the room they gave us had the same smell and had twin beds and not a double bed and was the same size as our initial room. They said that a team had come to fix the air conditioning and the smell was to be sorted as no other rooms were available. To their credit they managed to improve the smell but not eliminate it. Then the safe broke down and it took them 2 hours to get this sorted. Added to this, the reason we were in Barcelona was to celebrate my father in laws 60th bday. We had requested a cake and champagne to be brought up to the roof top bar and had confirmed this 3 times with the staff. This was meant to be a small surprise for my father in law but when he walked into his room (which smelled better and was far larger) the cake and champagne was placed on his table. The concierge team were apologetic and did remove the cake from our bill but on the flip side the surprise was blown due to some poor internal communication.",4,2017,08,08
11,Treat Yourself,"Great hotel.  Its located in the middle of the high end shopping distriict - which is not my thing, however, there are some advantages.  You away from the hustle and bustle of things, but yet a short walk from some Gaudi building and nightlife.  Staff is extremely helpful and friendly, and the hotel is well built.  Highlight is rooftop bar/pool, which can get crowded quickly due to small size, as well as an off the chain breakfast buffet.  would highly recommend.",5,2017,08,05
11," Susanna  made sure that everything worked out for us.","Was very impressed from the moment we pulled up in the shuttle. 

They had someone that greeted us at the curb took our bags in and they checked us into a concierge type of check in ( room around the way) from the main area. From there a person explained our room and every detail and Susanna  made sure that everything worked out for us. She made sure that our stay was special. 

I was very impressed with the rooftop deck and the pool area and it was very busy at midnight and just wonderful. 

I was able to book this on Expedia with my flight and so I believe I got a very good rate . 

I've been to a lot of hotels and traveled often and I would say this is been one of the best hotels I've been to and it's walking distance to everywhere and I especially love the marble bathroom with the deep tub. 

If there was just one tiny thing that I would have preferred it might have been an expresso machine in the room that made -- real dark strong coffee -- instead of the automatic one that they have in there but that seems to be a typical thing everywhere. I would surely stay there again and it made Barcelona even nicer. 

Oh there was a man at the Rooftop area that allowed people in and out and very tall and slender... he was quite arrogant and unfriendly. Yet, Marissa was a hostess up there on the rooftop... and she was very nice. And David which was a bag man , was very nice too.",5,2017,08,03
11,Great Service & Central Location,"We spent 5 night at the Majestic in June, and booked one of the Majestic Residences (directly across Passieg de Gracia from the hotel).  Two bedrooms, two full baths, a ktichen, dining/living room, balconies, laundry - we had it all.  It would be hard to find better service or amenities than this.  The hotel is centrally located, and we walked to many attractions & restaurants (including La Sagrada Familia, La Pedrera and Las Ramblas).  The hotel has a very nice spa, and a rooftop lounge with a great view.  The full breakfast at the hotel is delicious and has choices for everyone, but it is on the expensive side (we did not include this in our visit, but chose to eat there once for the experience).  We would surely stay here again on a future trip to Barcelona!",5,2017,08,03
11,Best part of our trip to Barcelona,"This hotel is amazing!  The staff are friendly, the rooms are beautiful, and the breakfast is delicious!!!  It was our favorite part of the time we spent in Barcelona.  Highly recommend for anyone wanting a luxury hotel in the city.",5,2017,07,31
11,beautiful Hotel,"Hotel is beautiful. Location is perfect. Rooftop bar/pool was great and relaxing.
We changed rooms as initial room was tiny. #262. We changed to #263 and was just enough bigger to make the difference. No one would be happy in #262. Breakfast buffet was amazing. Staff great.",4,2017,07,28
11,Great hotel,"Wonderful service and lovely rooms. Recommend upgrading since standard rooms run quite small. Staff is excellent.
Location is excellent. Walking distance to most attractions. 
Beautiful view from the rooftop.",5,2017,07,25
11,Beautiful & Centrally located hotel,"Great location, Beautiful hotel. From the minute you are greeted at the front door to the minute you check out service is top notch.
Rooftop terrace and pool are beautiful & the view is breathtaking.

The rooms are a nice size.The bathrooms are large and the heated towel racks are a treat.

Their soap and hair products are very nice and smell good too.

The doorman greets you in his top hat
and tails and has a cab waiting for you instantly.

This is a great hotel to book and its proximity to surrounding shops and places of interest makes it very easy to walk if you choose.",5,2017,07,25
11,Couldn't ask for more!,"Great location, European size rooms, but what stood out was the extremely good and friendly service.  Be it at breakfast or 2am on the roof top bar, the level of service was truly exceptional.

Although an established hotel, rooms were fresh and pleasantly decorated - a good balance between modern facilities and charming environment.",5,2017,07,21
11,Gorgeous renovation of a glorious hotel,"We stayed for 2 nights and celebrated a big birthday, which the hotel honored meaningfully and delightfully. Our junior suite was elegant, plush and quiet on the 7th floor. We had a light dinner on the rooftop and the 5Jotas ham, carved tableside, was fabulous along with a bottle of rosé cava.  We have stayed at other supposedly good hotels in Barcelona, including the nearby Claris and the modernist Fuster, and they do not even come close to the elegance, comfort, spaciousness and service of the Majestic. Breakfasts were delicious and the buffet had many interesting items, reflecting the tastes of the hotel´s international clientele. We have found our new favorite hotel in Barcelona and will recommend it to family and friends.",5,2017,07,21
11,Does not live up to the 5 star standard,"Unfortunately this hotel looks good on the outside but does not live up to the 5 star standard, rooms very small as you would expect in Barcelona cupboard space for 2 items to hang & bed not the most comfortable, the bar area at the top was great with a fabulous view",3,2017,07,20
11,"Wonderful location,excellent hotel,perfect stay","We stayed at THE Mitsis  MAJESTIC Hotel for a week in June- our second visit  
The hotel is on the main Passeig de GRacia ,a bustling colourful street opposite Gaudi's Casa Batlo -and though in the midst of an area full of sites ,shops and restaurants the hotel is a comfortable,quiet haven in a wonderful location-and always easy to return to in the middle of the day or in the evening-The roof garden is outstanding with breathtaking views restful seating and tasty, snacky menu and bar with background music and lovely service..  
The hotel is exquisitely and tastefully furnished  ,rooms and bathrooms very spacious and comfortable with all amenities one  can think of for a luxurious stay .
Breakfast room is  charming and food really excellent as is the service.
The rooms are spotlessly clean ,no trays left in the corridors and chambermaids clean room as soon as you leave it for breakfast and disappear when you return -It is well worth taking a room with a view on a high floor.
All the staff in this hotel are specially friendly and  professional and there is a lovely atmosphere which pervades.It is managed by Mr. Pascal Billard who personally checked on us every day and made sure everything was fine during our stay  - a very nice touch.
Also have to mention Lucia a kind and smiling guest relations manager who was very attentive and caring throughout our stay - as were the concierge and all the staff at the hotel.
The hotel is perfect in every way - we shall definitely return on our next visit to 
Barcelona.",5,2017,07,20
11,very nice but not 5 star,"Recently stayed at the hotel for 4 nights.  Absolutely great location.  The hotel feels like a business hotel although it seemed just the opposite by the guests we observed.  The hotel is very lovely but you feel like you could be anywhere.  The check-in and concierge area is very confusing.  When we arrived we were shuttled around to the side for additional check-in area.  The concierge and other check in area are together but they wear different colored jackets.  Some of the people do both jobs.  The hallways on the floors were beautiful and well decorated.  Our room was very large but uninteresting.  The long,narrow, drain in the shower was blocked and water went all over the floor.  It was hard to understand how it had just become blocked.  They did sent maintenance up right away to fix. The swimming pool bar area was great but very hard to get a seat.  Beautiful views of city!  Breakfast was very mediocre.  The area to choose your buffet food was very congested and staff rushing around to refill.  Most of the pastries I saw at nearby places looked much better.  Fruit was constantly empty.  The only time I observed a good selection was the morning we were leaving at 7am.",4,2017,07,18
11,not as good as mandarin oriental,"it didnt had variety in breakfast , not good room views, just really great staff - especially the maids and staff in the breakfast room, the lobby area smells so nice . it has a bad tempered receptionist and no good welcome program you recieve in arrival",3,2017,07,17
11,Honeymoon,"This is the nicest hotel we have ever stayed in!! We thought we would treat ourselves to a 5* hotel for the last couple of nights of our honey moon and it was fantastic! They treated us so well, gave us champagne when we arrived to celebrate our honeymoon, the room was lovely and the bed was the comfiest! The staff were really friendly and liked to make sure we were very happy. The views from the roof top pool are just incredible. 
The spa therapists were very friendly and great at what they do. We had a fantastic treatment from them followed by prosecco and chocolates. 
Thank you for a fantastic honeymoon. ",5,2017,07,17
11,"Really, really wanted to give 5-stars","Really, really wanted to give 5 stars.  Amazing location.  My suite overlooking the main street was lovely, with a lovely bathroom and view.  My kids' room overlooking an inner set of walls/windows was nice except for the view (which at this price point is kind of outrageous...but it's a city and you pay for location).  The roof top pool/bar is not a family friendly space.  It is a restaurant with a small pool that would be awkward to swim in per se.  And you can't go for drinks...you must sit down at a table...annoying.  Breakfast...great selection...but not a relaxing environment.  Hotel caters to large groups of tourists making the atmosphere a bit hectic

So why 3 stars?  We had several issues issues over and over with the concierge, the front desk, and the pool restaurant in terms of service which happened over and over again.  So much so that management sent gifts to our room and comp'ed one of our nights.  Nice yes...but shouldn't have to happen.  At this price point, I should never have to worry about poor service to the point where a room has to be refunded...the right thing for management to do, but still...not 5 star DivaFamily rated.",3,2017,07,16
11,Great Visit,"My wife and I spent four nights at the Majestic in our first trip to Barcelona. It is a wonderful hotel with a great location. Our room was clean and spacious, and the service was very attentive. We looked forward to each morning's breakfast as it was fantastic. I highly recommend the Majestic. ",5,2017,07,13
11,A gem of a hotel ,"A fantastic hotel with really great staff - especially the maids and staff in the breakfast room, the lobby area smells so nice and is the same scent of the shower gel in your room. 

Rooms are spacious and my room on the second floor had the most powerful shower I have ever used - it was the best! Plenty of plugs however none next to your bed.

Location very close to Passeig de Gracia for transport around the city and also for trains out to the coast. Plenty of high end shopping in the area Chanel is just next door. A brisk 15 minute walk to the Sagrada Familia. 

You should definitely head up to the 10th floor and see the view. ",5,2017,07,13
11,"Wow, what a hotel!  The service, the room, and the food! Wow!","The Majestic Hotel has a luxury feel and the location is spot on, where you can hop on public transporation and be at your destination within minutes! We were greeted warmly by the staff that offered warm towels and a cold libation!  Later, at the top floor restaurant, we ate some of the finest cuisine that Europe has to offer. A MUST stay hotel!",5,2017,07,12
11,A MUST WHEN IN BARCELONA,"We split our stay in Barcelona - Hotel Arts (which I've also reviewed) and this place. My goodness this place was beautiful. We were greeted and looked after from the moment the taxi dropped us off. Check in was friendly, in fact we were upgraded to a junior suite. We were shown to our room and where the amenities were - safe/tea and coffee etc. The room was stunning overlooking Passeig des Gracia with a tiny balcony. Fantastic location. It was clean, neat, modern bathroom, comfy bed. I wasn't complaining - I just loved it. We were treated to a beautiful spanish wine with cheese and crackers - a great touch. I wish I was staying here longer - maybe next time! And I would definitely come here again. They have a rooftop bar and pool and the view is stunning - a view of Barcelona. Had a great time sitting out here enjoying the food, drinks and view. Staff were friendly, knowledgeable and always greeted you. Breakfast was a full on spread and so creatively done. High quality breakfast. From the greetings, room, kindness, treat, upgrade - it's these things that make your stay that little bit special. A must when in Barcelona",5,2017,07,09
11,"Very Nice, but Not Perfect","The hotel is nice, but didn't compare to other 5 star hotels I have stayed at. We had a suite and a deluxe room. Our room was big, as was the bathroom. It was very nice. The bed was quite comfortable. The breakfast was fabulous. The location is good, but it is quite a walk to the water and old part of town. I did not mind this. The windows were not as sound proof as one would expect for a hotel of this caliber. The not perfect part is due to the following. We arrived on a very early flight and did not expect our rooms to be ready. I did expect them to be ready by 3:00. After a bit of hassle, we got into the suite and were assured that the other room on the same floor would be ready shortly. I felt as if we were forgotten and had I not searched out the manager, we would have waited a long time. Unfortunately, I did not go with my adult children to that room until the last day when I was SHOCKED to see the view, or lack there of! It was looking into the center of the building with galvanized pipes. When I made my way around that floor, I realized most of the interior doors were staff rooms. I could even see broom handles leaning up on the window across from the room. We mentioned our disappointment at check our and they did give us a 100 euro credit. Not much considering we had paid $1400/ night for 2 rooms. My other complaint was with the concierge. We asked for a reservation for a nice dinner near the water. When we arrived, it was an open air tent facing a parking lot with the water on the other side of that. Even our taxi driver shook his head. 
The roof top bar is a lovely view and the service was good.",4,2017,07,06
11,Several issues here -- and I am about three hours in.,"So I just got to my room -- I am here for three nights and I will try updating as I go along. This hotel is hugely overpriced for the level of service provided. This is not unusual in Europe from the ""old guard"" hotels which rely on their historical aura to draw in tourists looking for something authentic. Immediate issues:
1. Just a comically inefficient check in desk/staff -- not friendly, not proactive (um -- give me a bite to eat and some coffee after a long flight if you can't deliver my room to me at check in time?), were late
2. I'm staying in what they call a junior suite. It's a really mediocre room and furnishings.

Again, while these issues are not life-threatening to say the least, they suggest a hotel that is priced way above what is appropriate. At a different price, you might put up with some of this. At this price, you want world-class. You are paying for the location and the historical aura. I will be in Barcelona frequently in the coming months/years, and I am here on business, so the simple answer may be to avoid the place like the plague if you are here for meetings and want something that is efficient and just works. 

P.S. for those of you who might go to the gym, apparently it's on another elevator bank, which involves traipsing back and forth across the tourist-filled lobby in your gym clothes.",1,2017,07,05
11,Our Favorite Barcelona Hotel,We visit Barcelona once a year and we always stay at the Majestic because of it's prime location and attentive service and rooftop bar. The rooms are very comfortable and vary greatly. The location is what sells this location.,5,2017,06,30
11,"Since the Rennovations, its been AWESOME",This hotel is in one of the best locations in Barcelona and has one of the best hotel teams in the world. The rooftop bar is absolutely fantastic and they even let me bring my own bottle from my suite. Looking forward to coming again and keep up the good work.,5,2017,06,30
11,Extraordinary Service,"We checked into this extraordinary hotel earlier today and I cannot emphasize enough the excellence in service we have received in the short time we have been here. The property is absolutely stunning, the location superb and everyone has been beyond gracious and attentive. We booked this hotel thru our American Express Platinum  card travel service and could not be more pleased that we chose the perfect hotel to explore the beauty of Barcelona! Our suite was ready by 1:00 pm, the room is absolutely beautiful and we could not be happier with the amenities, the cuisine and the wonderful staff!",5,2017,06,28
11,Exquisite Hotel in Excellent Location,"The Hotel Majestic is outstanding in every way possible.  The staff are professional, efficient and helpful.  The property is absolutely beautiful, clean, and well-located.  Every time we walked through the hotel doors we were glad we had chosen it for our five-day stay.  The area is upscale, and my daughter and I felt very safe and comfortable there.  Exceptional breakfast buffet--fantastic selection, fresh, and very high quality.  Our room, #823, was quiet with a lovely view of Paseo de Gracia and Casa Batllo.  Comfortable twin beds with high quality linens.   Even the turn-down service was special.  Wonderful experience! Perfect hotel! Highly recommend.",5,2017,06,27
11,Great hotel of Barcelona ,"Nice hotel on Paseig de Gracia. Been here a several times, and enjoyed each time. 

I understood that this is a family owned hotel, and is as good, if not better than the branded neighboring hotels. 

Staff are great and friendly. Hotel entrance and lobby is great, with many interesting characters to watch. 

Rooms are nice and updated. Proper lighting matters to me, especially in older hotels, and hotel has one of the best illumination for rooms. Beds are dreamily comfortable, this is a real 5 star room. 

The breakfast rooms has to be one of my favorite ones anywhere. Nice breads, jams, spreads, cold cuts, you name it. 

Location is also unbeatable. You can walk everywhere from La Sagrada Familia to the Barrío Gotico. 

I look forward to returning to Barcelona so I can visit this hotel again. ",5,2017,06,27
11,Excellent Hotel,"Staff was top notch everyone spoke English, Concierge walked me to local hair dresser so I would not get lost, fantastic Breakfast buffet and  AMAZING location!!  If you want a Hotel that you can walk to everything upscale and enjoy Barcelona, this is a must stay!",5,2017,06,24
11,Beautiful hotel,Overall this hotel was very nice. It is a beautiful space with a wonderful rooftop bar. We were pleased with our stay except for the fact that our room had 2 twin beds pushed together. There was nothing holding them together. When I would sit near the middle they would separate. This did not make for a romantic get away. The cleaning staff was wonderful and efficient. Overall a great place just wished the bed was better.,4,2017,06,22
11,Amazing stay at the Majestic Hotel at Barcelona,"Beautiful stunning facility ,large rooms, nice lobby and great amenities .Centrally located at Psg de Gracias ,hotel staff were wonderful also and very helpful in car rental , restaurants reservation and more.The breakfast is one of the best in the city . The view from the top roof pool is incredible . Highly recommended we stayed for 4 nights , 2 adults and 2 young adults ages (22) and (18) we will be back .",5,2017,06,20
11,5 star,Great Stay in a Beautiful city. Central to everything! Fantastic service from hotel staff all round and the rooms were just gorgeous! The hotel is 1 minute away from the metro/subway and the rooftop bar offer spectacular views of Barcelona. Short and cheap ride from the airport too,5,2017,06,19
11,Cheryl Ian and Matilda ,"We were fortunate enough to stay in this five star luxury boutique hotel for a few nights in June .Everything about our stay was perfect and we would strongly recommend anyone to stay here. We arrived at the hotel very early due to an early flight , the hotel held our luggage and made the facilities of the hotel available to us , they called us to say our room was ready just after mid day which we appreciated .The staff in all areas of the hotel were  professional and polite and nothing was too much trouble . We stayed in a very spacious family room with a superb bathroom with a wonderful view of the amazing Passeig de Gracia , with the hotel adjoining Chanel and housing all the high end designer shops and fabulous restaurants . You must try breakfast at the hotel , in a beautiful light and airy dining room , it is like being in an exquisite delicatessen, everything you could wish for , all beautifully presented ,and freshly prepared and omelettes and cooked breakfasts made to your individual taste ..The piece  de resistance  though  ,has to be the roof top terrace and pool bar which boasts a spectacular panoramic view of the city of Barcelona ( including a birds eye view of some  of the famous Gaudi buildings and the Cathedral). The Majestic Hotel is a wonderful place to relax by the pool and take in the wonderful city of Barcelona. thank you  Majestic Hotel for your perfect hospitality , we can't wait to return . ",5,2017,06,18
11,Nice property ruined by poor service,"Unfortunately, we had a disappointing overall experience at this hotel. I booked this through the Amex Platinum Fine Hotel and Resorts program. We booked three rooms for five days (including a junior suite) for a family vacation (elderly parents and a baby). Summarizing our experience below:

Positive:
1) The hotel is in a convenient, central location
2) Breakfast was solid with lots of variety
3) Rooms were clean and housekeeping did an excellent, discreet job (no carts around, etc)
4) Nice rooftop view
5) Hotel lobby and common areas are lovely (rooms are fine)
6) Most staff were quite nice or fine
7) The hotel accommodated us for an early check in for two rooms (but the third was past 3), which was helpful with an extremely tired baby
8) Good value. This hotel is billed as 5 stars and ultra luxurious. It's not really. It's very nice, but If you've stayed at luxury hotels before, this is not really as high end. But the price reflects that, so it's perfectly acceptable.

Negative:
1) Arrival: Even though we were given an early check in, the process was awful (as many customers have noted). We had requested an 11am/noon check in through Amex. We got closer to 2. We understand this isn't a guarantee and were happy with any early check in because our baby was extremely tired. However, once we did get our rooms, it took almost an hour to get our bags and the crib we requested. My sister had to track down the bags (they even went to look in the baggage room themselves) and at the end of it all, the bags were still at the front desk (3 hours from initial check in). Hunting down our own luggage is not an experience I wish to repeat at a ""5-star"" hotel. On top of that, we had to BEG for the crib. Literally asked 5 times (and had also asked in advance). And to wrap up the experience, when one of the bell hops was ""helping"" us, he completely turned away to try to help a group of older German men (who by the way were very nice and did not ask to interrupt). We had to enlist someone else. The whole thing was unpleasant and chaotic.

2) It's troublesome, but bottom line this hotel appeared to treat you better if you are older and/or Caucasian. We had many examples of staff ignoring us to better service folks who fit that bill. From examples ranging from the lady at the omelette line jumping to the person BEHIND us in line to get his order, to the rooftop saying they were ""closed"" when they let the people right in before (coincidentally my husband, who is Caucasian came up and said something, and they agreed to seat us), to the arrival fiasco. Many examples in the same vein. I was surprised and disappointed. We spent a lot of money, more than most of those folks, but it shouldn't matter anyway. The staff should treat all customers with respect. This isn't the 1940s and it isn't a common experience (at least in my experience as an American Indian female).

I asked to speak with the general manager and chatted with someone whose name I don't recall (not sure if he was the general manager). He was apologetic and confirmed that it wasn't the culture or mission of the hotel. He asked what he could do, and I said we didn't want anything, but we hoped his staff would treat others better in the future.

I will call Amex and also give them this feedback, they shouldn't be recommending this hotel. We won't be returning to this hotel. There are several wonderful options in the same range, it's not worth the poor service. Accommodations should enrich your vacation, not put a cloud over it.
",2,2017,06,16
11,Perfect location; amazing service,"The hotel is located in an ideal spot for foodies and shoppers.  Everything is either a short walk or $10-12 euro taxi ride.  The rooms aren't huge but they are very well designed and they have everything you might need, except a Iron and table.  

The staff was extremely helpful and VERY nice.  They always helped us get taxis and helped us communicate the address to the drivers. 

The free breakfast is expansive and has a lot of options, including  Iberico ham!

I would definitely go back, it's expensive but worth it.",5,2017,06,16
11,The best,"One of the best hotel in Barcelona, great rooms and service and the breakfast is really good. Also, the location is amazing as it is located in the center of Barcelona. 
I highly recommend this hotel..",5,2017,06,15
11,It Deserves to be the Majestic!,"We were booked into the Majestic for three nights as part of a pre-cruise package with Seabourn. It was a terrific experience. The hotel is located in the heart of Barcelona - within walking distance of La Rambla and a block each way from two significant Gaudi buildings. Lots of bars and Tapas joints nearby.
   The room was on the smallish side but was well furnished and the bed was comfortable. I love a big breakfast and was astonished and delighted at the offerings provided by the Majestic. Don't skip breakfast! And, have at least a drink at the rooftop bar.
   All the Concierges were very helpful in providing directions, making dinner reservations, and explaining the somewhat convoluted (for me, anyway) underground system.",5,2017,06,12
11,And then the trip to the hospital ,"We were already in love with this hotel, which is situation perfectly in the city, when an emergency happened.  I woke up in pain (I am very healthy and a runner) and it would come and go repeatedly. After spending more than two hours trying to decide if I could make a planned excursion, we went to the concierge, Susana, for help.  She sent us to our room and immediately called the ambulance services.  When they came, she accompanied them upstairs in case translations were needed for me.  And they were needed.  After ten minutes the ambulance servers suggested that I had a kidney stone problem and that I should go to a hospital.  Susana arranged a private car service (no cost) and then continued to stay with us for the next four hours as x-rays, scans and other tests were done.  She went so far and above any service that one should ever expect.  And then, after we went and got the drugs I needed, she sent up some chocolates, water and a hand written note to let us know she was thinking of us.  People complain about thread count and other useless information in their reviews and don's focus on the importance of customer service in difficult times.  Hotel Majestic, and Susana as our example, did such perfect and wonderful service when we needed it most.  And this morning, the day after we left and said goodbye to her, she sent us two emails - one making sure we were okay and thanking for staying at the hotel and another one with the hospital records in English for my insurance company.  We love the hotel and we love Susana more.  

Please stay there.",5,2017,06,12
11,Nice hotel but...,"For a five stars grand lux we would expect a little bit more. The room we had (712) has only 2 little windows were you can see nothing but the wall in front...the shower has no mixer tap, so it is very hard to get the right temperature...
Nevertheless the staff is really friendly, the breakfast buffet is tasty and the bar on the roof of the hotel is very nice.",4,2017,06,10
11,Great location and amazing butler service. ,"The hotel is in a great location; the views of the city from the roof top bar are great ; and the breakfast buffet is amazing, one of the best we have ever had. We were lucky enough to have a suite, and I can't say enough great things about the butler service, particularly Bruno and Fernando. We would definitely stay there again!",5,2017,06,10
11,"Great Spa, very professional","I was given a voucher for the Spa at the hotel as a present. When I finally got around to booking the appointment, my voucher was out of date as I had left it so long. However, I contacted the Spa and they happily extended the voucher so that I could enjoy my present.

When I arrived at the Spa, I was greeted by very friendly, attentive and professional staff. The masseuse was very skilful and the massage was extremely relaxing. 

As I mentioned before, the massage was given to me as a present. I would never have thought I would be having a massage at a five star hotel in Barcelona. I have since bought vouchers for the Spa for other people. It really is super nice for a special occasion.",5,2017,06,09
11,"Good view, bad service","The view is amazing and seating area very nice. The service is not good at all. We waited 10 min for someone to take our drink order and even reminding them. Then another 10 min for the drinks, it was not busy. But area is good and cozy. Next time, I would look at other places first, just because of the lack of service. ",3,2017,06,08
11,Pure luxury stay with a roof top pool with the price of the stay!,The roof top is where to go if you have time to luxuriate and are done wit the spa. It is absolutely amazing. The pool is so refreshing on a hot day and then to have the view too is just majestic! The gym is wonderful and the staff are beyond belief nice and go ut of their way to make sure everything is perfect. Loved this Hotel!!!!,5,2017,06,08
11,Nice brunch,"I was there for the Sunday Brunch for my friend's birthday on the 1/F. We had a great time, buffet is fresh and there many choices. Hot dishes buffet wasn't a lot of choices but the sushi/seafood/appetizers buffet was so delicious that it makes up for it. The dessert buffet? A killer! I recommend the chocolate praline cake and the bounty... #foodgasm. The waiter we had was extremely nice, his nice and professional behavior really gave us a great time. However, it is raining today and we were told by the staff that we could still have a look at the terrace but we needed to keep our bill ticket to show it on the 10/F. Once there, it was raining so bad that it was closed and there was a sofa on the corridor and what looks like the bar for the terrace. We sat on the sofa to see where we were going next as it is raining and we can't visit the city. Suddenly a waiter came to us and said that if we are not ordering drinks, we must leave. I said that we were told by staff from the restaurant downstairs that we could come to the terrace and chill providing we keep our receipt. She said no the terrace is closed so we have to leave cuz we are not drinking. I felt very upset as 1/ the sofa we were sitting at was on the corridor, it doesn't look like a bar and it looks more like a place to rest if there is a line to do for the terrace. 2/having spent 177€ at their restaurant and the restaurant staff told us we could chill at the terrace, I think her behavior was inappropriate 3/there was nobody on this floor waiting to be sitted on the sofa. I'd understand if she wanted to give the sofa to a customer but there was nobody!!!! 4/for someone working in F&B, she could tell us in a gentle and smiling way but instead was giving us the unhappy look. ",4,2017,06,04
11,A great stay in a great city,"We have just returned from a four-night stay at the Majestic Hotel & Spa. The location was fantastic. The room we had was very spacious on the 7th floor and there was a lot of room for our 13 month old to wander around. Although it faced a car park the space in the room was more important to us. 
The staff were exceptional and very friendly. Our little one loved all the attention given. The concierge team made great recommendations and helped us make reservations and book tickets. 
The rooftop terrace on the 10th floor has stunning views of this grand city and the pool although not huge is the perfect spot to cool off. Morning is a great time to spend up there as it's nice and quiet. 
We didn't visit any of the restaurants or the spa so can't comment on them. 
Having read a few of the reviews about the rooms near the lift being noisy I was a bit anxious when we were placed next to it but the rooms are very well insulated so we didn't hear any noise from outside the room. 
Although not the cheapest of options I felt it was money well spent and if looking for a comfortable luxurious stay, I would highly recommend Majestic Hotel & Spa. 
Thank you to the team at Hotel Majestic & Spa for making our stay memorable. ",5,2017,06,04
11,Truly Amazing,"Terrific location, this beautiful hotel is simply stunning!  The rooms are outstanding clean, beautifully designed, staff are incredible, the concierge attending to all my needs.  I stayed here recently, and would highly recommend it to all.",5,2017,06,04
11,Just perfect ,"From the moment we arrived at this beautiful hotel with its unique scent, I knew it was going to be a wonderful holiday. Perfect location, gorgeous accommodation. Just wonderful. Barcelona is amazing and to top it off; we stayed at the Majestic. Take a look at our wonderful spacious terrace in the centre of the city 👌",5,2017,06,03
11,"Great location, beautiful hotel","We stayed 3 nights at this property and were delighted with our experience. Starting from check-in, the staff were ever so accommodating and professional. Loved how beautiful the hallways were, lovely colors and vibe. We had a 2 room suite with small balconies. Although not huge, it was very comfortable. Good location for shopping and restaurants, easy walk to the old city. Breakfast room has an indoor and outdoor area and great selection of breakfast choices. The rooftop terrace was over the top gorgeous with a wonderful staff. We certainly would return to this hotel on the Passeig de Gracia.",5,2017,06,01
11,"Good location, traditional luxury, comfortable, pleasant staff","We enjoyed our two-night stay in the Majestic, well-located at the N end of Passeig de Gracia (Barcelona’s answer to the Champs Elysées) and close to some of the iconic Gaudi buildings, hi-end retail therapy and many of the city’s top restaurants.  It’s not the best base for a visit focussed on the old city but there’s no ideal location in sprawling Barcelona.

The décor is a comfortable blend of traditional and contemporary but there are too many mirrors for our taste.  A big irritant for us was the noisy music played in all the public spaces, including in the restaurant - even at breakfast! - and in the rooftop pool/bar area.

Our room - in the least expensive category - was small with limited storage but acceptable for a short stay.  There was (almost literally) no view.  The marble bathroom (shower-only) was well-equipped and unusually elegant.  We never mastered the light switches and the safe is awkwardly placed for short people.

All the staff we met were pleasant and efficient (although we did get confusing advice on one matter, admittedly from a trainee).  WiFi is free, fast and simple to use.  Other extras are expensive, particularly by local standards.

Breakfast is a well-stocked buffet with eggs cooked to order and attentive service.  However, the restaurant has poor acoustics and is overcrowded at times, so it can be a noisy and congested experience.

Given the relatively high price for the room and everything else, we consider the Majestic less than average value-for-money.  And its operating model is less traditional than we expected.  But it’s a well-managed and well-located five-star property and its popularity is understandable.

Tip - Barcelona isn't short of good restaurants but we found the nearby Tragaluz about the best experience we recall from several visits.",4,2017,06,01
11,Majestic!,"Simply one of the nicest hotels in the world. The hotel, the rooms, the staff and the location are excellent. The hotel is located in the heart of Barcelona, across the Street from Gaudy's famous Casa Botllo. It is close to  the higher end boutiques for those interested in shopping. As well as being close to many fantastic restaurants. The rooftop bar has an amazing view of the entire City. ",5,2017,06,01
11,Charming and comfortable hotel in great location,"Lovely old-style hotel on Passeig de Gracia, near La Pedrera and the Metro.  Comfortable rooms, nice staff and a lovely breakfast buffet.  Rooms are small but very nice, with lovely bathrooms.  There are also apartments across the street which I would try on my next trip.",5,2017,05,31
11,"Very nice old school hotel, great location","Lovely old school style hotel with a fantastic roof terrace. Staff were excellent and good quality food. Great location in the heart of the city. We did feel the room was a little tired. The first room we were given had a terrible outlook, quite literally looking into the external fire escape, you might want to check when booking your room. Overall it's a lovely hotel and we really enjoyed our stay.",4,2017,05,30
11,"Superb service, excellent location","This was my second time at the Majestic, where I just came back from a business trip (six nights at the hotel). From the gracious greeting and early morning check-in at 8 a.m. with access to my room at no extra cost (!!) to check-out, the service could not have been better. My room was generously sized, quiet, and meticulously clean; I loved the shower. The staff gave helpful suggestions for transportation, and even helped my friend who was staying elsewhere plan a trip to Madrid (it was very late at night and there were no other customers at the desk). The breakfast was amazing, and the restaurant staff was attentive. I sat in the lounge with clients, and was not pressured to buy food or drinks. The excellent location, just steps away from shopping and the important Gaudi buildings, made getting out for the quick break easy and pleasant. I highly recommend the Majestic Hotel to those whose budget allows them to stay in luxurious accommodations.",5,2017,05,28

11,Beautiful Gracious Luxurious,"This hotel takes its reputation very seriously. It is beautifully situated in the heart of stylish Barcelona and minutes within walking distance to the OLD TOWN BARRIO GOTHI. The staff right from the welcome smiles and the concierge are warm and very very helpful. We were given a lovely upgrade to a good room.. great coffee at the NESPRESSO machine in our room.. superb chocolates and some champagne upon our arrival. 
The food is excellent and the rooftop views of the city among the best you can have. 
The SAGRADA FAMILIA and the sea are on view and the bar is crowded every evening due to its popularity. 
The spa is famous although I did not use it.
This is an expensive hotel but worth it for special occasions. 
In all, a very good experience. ",4,2017,05,27
11,Mixed Reviews,"I really did like this place, but it was the staff who really brought the feel of it down. Employees are the first people to greet you in a hotel and really start the pace for how the rest of your trip will be. You really need to have a lot of patience when dealing with the front desk staff. There was an incident I had with the hotel, and instead of taking responsibility and apologizing, the employees became very hostile and tried to place the blame on me. They didn't offer anything in return for the issues they had caused -- a few of which were my card being frozen for 2 days, being told we had a noon check in time and not being placed until 3pm, and some issues with the company we booked with. I'm not saying I expected anything, but at such a nice hotel you think they would want to resolve this issue with as much ease as possible and at least offer something as an apology (even though they couldn't do something as simple as that). The rest of the trip was great once we were all in our room though. The views from the rooftop bar/pool are panoramic, with views of the Sagrada Familia, great locations, the complimentary breakfast is delicious, and the rooms are very spacious and comfortable. I really enjoyed it besides the rude staff, so as much as I would like to return and say stay here...don't.",3,2017,05,25
11,It is Majestic,"I had a three night stay at the hotel and it definitely met all my expectations. I was given a free upgrade to a suit which was, in my opinion pretty good. Size of room was good, amenities excellent and it included a four-poster bed. The roof top bar is great...it can get very busy but they do ensure hotel residents get priority. Service throughout the hotel is also very good and to a high standard. Breakfast was good and included champagne but if its not included in your room rate may cost you an eye watering 57euros per person. The majestic is excellent for a city break since it is located centrally with easy access to most points around the city.",5,2017,05,24
11,"Lovely property, well-located","We stayed for one night during a recent business trip. The common areas are tastefully and luxuriously done. Our spacious room was classically decorated with a beautiful marble bath. The bathroom had a double vanity, shower, separate tub and separate toilet area. The rooftop bar, which was very busy due to the auto show and Formula One race, was a perfect place to see the city and have a sunset cocktail. I think the location of this hotel is fantastic - many attractions are within easy walking distance to the hotel including lots of notable Gaudi architecture and luxury shopping (Chanel is right downstairs!). The included breakfast was tasty and had abundant options, though I found the room slightly lackluster. ",5,2017,05,22
11,Wonderful hotel in a great location!,"Truly a five-star experience!  Right in the middle of the shopping district, walking distance to multiple landmarks and attractions and the metro.  Perfect base of operations for touring the city.  Everyone we dealt with was courteous, friendly and spoke English.  Many also spoke German.  All were willing to help me practice my bad Castilliano, even to teach me some Catalan.

We got a basic room on the fourth floor.  It was spotless, the service faultless, and quite satisfactory.  We had requested a room on the Passeig de Gracia, but in the interests of an early check-in, we took a corner room (could still see down the street in one direction and down the cross street of course).  The room had blackout curtains and the street noise was not loud enough to be disturbing.  The mattress and pillows were wonderfully comfortable and we slept very well every night.

The shower was equipped with a huge ""drench"" head in addition to a wand.  Awesome!  It felt like standing in the rain.  The water was soft enough I didn't want to stop.  A full range of designer-quality toiletries was provided and refreshed as needed:  Shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, soap, and a small vial of cologne.  The hotel offered to provide toothbrushes and other items upon request.

While there, we ate in all four venues on site.  Everything was marvelous.  The breakfast buffet was fantastic!  A full English breakfast was available including eggs to order. And French toast and pancakes.  And a full continental breakfast with ""I don't know how many"" jams, meats, cheeses, breads. And foccacia, gourmet tidbits of all types, cereals, cava, juices, water, tea, coffee.  No mater what their tastes, I'm sure anyone could find something to satisfy!  

The hotel also offers a Halal menu with multiple items for those who desire it, for room service and at the main restaurants.

There is a great bar and lounge on the roof.  This immediately became our favourite place to relax and unwind with a signature Sangria and tapas after touring.  The rooftop pool is shallow and fairly small: I did not see anyone use it, but the lounge chairs around the deck were usually occupied.

Congierge service was all that I could ask for.  They arranged excursions and advised on the best way to do, well, ""anything.""  I used them multiple times and was always delighted with their arrangements and suggestions.

We did not visit the spa.

All in all our stay was as close to perfect as I could have expected.  If I have neglected anything, It's only because I forgot to mention it. The prices for on-site food and drinks were high, but that is to be expected from a five-star venue.",5,2017,05,22
11,Medium Experience for a High Price,"We stayed for three nights at the Majestic in our fourth city in Spain. The hotel is gorgeous from the outside ( See photo). The hotel is located in a very high end area - it sits atop Chanel. The surrounding area felt very international consumerist. Those who prefer more local boutique shopping may have to wander further.

The room - we were given what we believe was the smallest room in the hotel. We were on the 4th floor and also adjacent to the elevator. If you stay here, ask to be put further away from the elevator because it woke us in the morning. There was only 3 feet between both sides of the bed and the wall. The view from the room on the small balcony was gorgeous however. I can't speak to other rooms in the hotel but we were very displeased with the cramped mess of the tiny bathroom and room. Not much room for luggage and bags, etc. 

We enjoyed the breakfast buffet. Great selection of berries, eggs, vegetables, etc to accompany a healthy lifestyle. Would have liked to see a smoothie bar that we saw in other places in Spain. 

Service - Bellmen and concierge were great. They helped us secure delicious reservations. The waiter in the breakfast restaurant was delightful. The maid however by 4 PM on the second day had not come to clean our room so I had to call. Also... do they offer turn down service or not? This does not seem to be standard. ",3,2017,05,22
11,World Class Hotel,"My husband and I recently stayed in the Majestic for our last night after a 2 1/2 week trip through Spain and Portugal.  We couldn't possibly have ended our trip better.  The property is ideally situated far enough away from La Rambla to be quiet and peaceful, but within easy walking distance.  It is in arguably the nicest neighborhood to Barcelona, home to Louis Vuitton, Prada, Gucci, and just about any other high-end brand you can name.  More importantly, the hotel was just lovely.  We were upgraded to a suite, which was a rare luxury.  There is a very nice bar on the first floor, but perhaps our favorite venue was the rooftop bar which had really excellent food but also a stunning 360 view of the city and the Mediterranean.  We felt spoiled from the moment we checked in until the moment we (sadly) checked out.  I absolutely plan to stay there again.",5,2017,05,20
11,Great Hotel and location and even BETTER upgrade!,"We booked this hotel pre-cruise for two nights and were thrilled to find that we had been upgraded from a suite to the PENTHOUSE upon arrival!  Great service, even BETTER location.....concierge and front desk were very helpful....Chilled champagne and snacks awaiting us in our room....what more could you ask for?

Oh yeah.....a balcony overlooking one of THE most famous streets in Barcelona...complete with hot tub, lounge chairs, sitting area AND firepit!

Nothing bad to say about our stay here....only complaint was the buffet breakfast.....not worth the price....but honestly, we are now SPOILED and will have to book the Penthouse for our next trip to Barcelona as we are not going to be happy with anything else!

Thanks to the staff at this amazingly beautiful hotel!",5,2017,05,19
11,A splurge-worthy hotel in Barcelona,"My wife and I spent four nights recently in one of the Majestic's junior suites, having decided that a room-splurge would be in order at the end of our trip. We were very happy with our decision--the hotel has an excellent location with a welcoming, helpful and efficient staff, and our very comfortable room was very nicely sized and appointed, extremely quiet and spotlessly clean. Breakfasts were excellent, as was the one dinner we had in the Majestic's fine-dining restaurant. We had a couple of well-prepared light meals in the roof-top bar, which offers a gorgeous view of the city. We'd be happy to return to this hotel.",5,2017,05,19
11,A wonderful stay in Barcelona,I booked the Majestic for a few nights prior to joining a Silversea cruise out of Barcelona. I usually stay at the Arts Hotel by the water but I really wanted to dine at the 3-star Lasarte which was a short stroll from the Majestic.  I decided it was time I stayed in town.   I was really happy I chose to stay here.  It is a classic hotel with exceptional service.  The location is wonderful and everything is walkable.  I would highly recommend this property to those who have never stayed in Barcelona before.  The rooms were understated luxury but very comfortable.   The spa was lovely although to access the spa you walk through the catering area for the roof top bar.  My treatment was very good and relaxing.  It is not the most luxurious setting but the treatments were lovely.  The clientele in the hotel restaurant and bar seemed really international and I had a great stay.,5,2017,05,19
11,Room was close But well appointed! Comfortable yet tight!,"The Majestic Hotel in Barcelona, Spain reminds one of past years of splendor. Elegantly appointed lobby and public spaces with a bar second to none. The rooftop bar is one ☝️ of the most sought stops in the whole of the city. Bustling service staff--a line of locals and the ever present tourist seeking an outside table away from the crowd. We had 2 days to spend here and enjoyed every moment. Will be back here again in August 2017.",5,2017,05,17
11,Wonderful stay,"Just came back from a wonderful break in Barcelona made perfect by staying at this hotel. It was very clean of course, the staff and service were all wonderful and friendly. The best thing about this hotel is the location! It is probably the best located in Barcelona! And the Sunday brunch is a must if you're around!! We were very well catered for during our stay especially with a baby! ",5,2017,05,17
11,Fantastic,Beautiful hotel ! Classic but very well kept! Service was impecable! We highly recommend it! Will certainly stay again! Location is perfect! Breakfast buffet was delicious! The rooftop terrace has magnificent views and nice cocktails! ,5,2017,05,17
11,"Grand Hotel in centre city, Barcelona","Awesome Five Star hotel in the center of Barcelona. Everything was absolutely fantastic. Hotel location was perfect.  Room was bright, clean and well appointed. Rooftop bar and food service is added bonus. I felt like a dignitary during my stay at the Majestic and cannot say enough about the great welcoming attitude and service of the staff. Majestic gets my strongest ***** rating.",5,2017,05,16
11,Great hotel,"We found the location perfect, close to train, bus and markets.  Staff was super friendly and extremely helpful. The food at the hotel was delicious (both room service and roof top lunch). Roof deck has nice views, although pretty crowded during weekends.  Large bathroom and our room had a cut balcony (not standard, had to request that) Super comfy bed too.",5,2017,05,16
11,Wonderful stay in 5 star hotel,"We stayed at the Majestic for 5 nights in April. A beautiful hotel in the centre of the city. Within walking distance to attractions, shopping, tapas bars and fine dining. The room was immaculate. There's a nice selection of hot and cold foods at breakfast buffet. Loved the homemade yogurt! 

I cannot say enough about the exceptional service. The staff were very helpful, polite and went out of their way to ensure our needs were met. Complimentary champagne was sent to our room for my husband's birthday celebration. A nice touch! 

Thank you to Manuel & Emma at front desk reception and Andrea, server at breakfast buffet for their impeccable service.

Would not hesitate to stay here on our next trip to Barcelona.",5,2017,05,14
11,Barcelona visit,"A beautiful hotel with excellent service. Enjoyed our second stay and hope to return for a third.  

Breakfast buffet has a really nice selection and worth including in your stay. Rooms are spacious and service is as expected for this level of hotel. 

Internet access included helps plan the day. Concierge was very helpful with reservations. ",5,2017,05,13
11,Beautiful hotel,"Beautiful hotel, attentive staff, amazing rooftop bar.
We had a huge room w a patio. Very clean and comfortable. Our friends had a tiny room and only paid 20$ less than we did. We booked on an external site and paid 20$ extra for an upgrade. What a difference in room size play out door area. Well worth it if given the option. Hotel is walking distance to most sites with lots of cafes and restaurants near by. 
Neighborhood is safe and in upscale shopping district. For me, this wasn't really a plus as I can shop in all the same stores in the USA. Visit the old  gothic section for more authentic shopping.",5,2017,05,10
11,"Great hotel, fantastic location","We loved staying here, we stayed one night in the apartments across the street from the hotel (wonderfully spacious and with balconies) and two nights in the actual hotel.

Staff was wonderful, food was great and service impeccable. The location was unbeatable.

Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,05,09
11,No premium experience,"Spent 2 nights in the Majestic hotel, for a weekend stay in Barcelona. Found the hotel too expensive for the quality, as in particular the beds were disappointing and the room was noisy, getting in a lot of noise from the corridor. Upon checking in an envelope with tickets for some events was not presented. Bathroom is fine, wifi is fast. For the breakfast we used the cafetaria across the street, as Euro 38 per person is also rather steeo.",3,2017,05,09
11,Wonderful weekend,"Just returned from a memorable weekend in Barcelona staying at one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed in. The Majestic Hotel and Spa was truly a fabulous hotel, spotlessly clean room, marble bathroom with fantastic power shower and of course the friendly staff who were always polite and couldn't do enough for us. The attention to detail was excellent such as the turn-down service each night and the lovely samples of perfume for myself and my daughter were gratefully received. We didn't have time to use the spa facilities but the hotel is in a great location for sight seeing and shopping. We booked this through Expedia and got excellent value for money, I will be recommending this hotel to family and friends without doubt.",5,2017,05,08
11,Amazing Stay,"The best hotel in Barcelona, located in the most amazing and beautiful area Paseo de Gràcia, which contains lots of shops and restaurants and also the most famous 2 monuments in the world ""The Pedrera-Casa Milia"" and the other Gaudi's masterpiece ""Casa Batllo"". The hotel is very nice, huge reception nice staffs. The room was wide with a beautiful, neat white marble bathroom. We didn't have the chance to try the food in the hotel because we were leaving early and eating out. The hotel contains a breathtaking rooftop with a bar and a small pool and couches. You can also see the Sagrada familia from a distance. If you ever visited Barcelona, I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,05,02
11,The Best !!!!!,"My family and I stayed here for over one week.  The location is perfect, amazing and clean rooms, excellent service, wonderful food in the restaurant, a huge breakfast buffet and a really nice relaxing stay!! This is the nicest hotel in the city and we will return.  Thank you!  ",5,2017,04,30

11,Numero Uno for everything.,"Premier location for seeing and doing everything in Barcelona.Staff were excellent especially Carlos at the Concierge desk.Walk to the very best shopping and food in the city.Get your tickets to La Sagreda on line and early.Roof top pool and bar offer the best views of all of Barcelona.Room was a bit tight,but had everything you need.Complimentary Cava with champagne glasses and Iberian ham was unexpected and appreciated.",5,2017,04,26
11,Impeccable service,"Perfect hotel for both business or leisure travellers. The hotel is located in the heart of the city in between luxury shops and close to tourist attractions. I was attending a conference at the hotel. We received impeccable service from the conference staff as well at the staff in the breakfast restaurant. Thanks to Cristina and Isabella. 

My only draw back as a gym enthusiast is that the gym is a bit small. Otherwise my stay was great and I would return to this hotel. ",4,2017,04,23
11,SUPERB - OUTSTANDING SERVICE,"I stayed in the suite, the balcony is to die for indoor/outdoor at the same time. Overlooking central barcelona. Roof terrace worth jumping off. All staff amazing especially Juan from the bar 👌🏽. Me and my wife thoroughly enjoyed every moment. I even saw bloody ed sheera.

Flawless.",5,2017,04,23
11,"A great experience, center of the city!","The rooms, service was excellent.  Breakfast spread was huge. It is conveniently located at the centre of the city, near the metro, through which all the tourist attractions are easily accessible. They were courteous enough to take care of my baggage for a day even after I had checked out. Overall, a great stay!",5,2017,04,19
11,Excellence,"We stayed at the Majestic 4 nights in late March. We had a fantastic time. From the moment you walk in, the beautiful aroma embraces you. One is  treated with great care. Check- in was flawless. A hotel staff walked us into our room and took the time to explain the various features of the room.  The room was a good size and the bathroom quite large with beautiful marble décor and stocked with plenty of bath products by Atelier.  The turndown service included hotel staff leaving a little sample of Atelier cologne by your pillow ( a different scent every night), which was a special touch. The wifi was top notch and included with the room.  One of the areas we liked most was the roof patio by the pool. Great sangrias and wonderful views of the city including La Sacrada Familia. A marvelous  way to enjoy the Barcelona sun. The hotel is centrally located near some of the Gaudi houses and other tourist attractions, including the Barcelona City tour bus. If we have opportunity to return to Barcelona, we will be staying at the Majestic Hotel.",5,2017,04,19
11,Easy for shopping,"Hotel is suitable for shoppers, along the main shopping road. If you want to go la rambla, just follow the main road outside the hotel and walk straight all the way. Rooms are small but comfortable. Breakfast is below average but they have a lot of cheese available.",4,2017,04,18
11,Excellent service,"Stayed at the hotel with my family, excellent services specially from house keeping . The rooms are spacious, friendly staff, super comfortable.Thank you to all Majestic Hotel team. Will definitely be back. Perfect location for shopping.",5,2017,04,17
11,Stunning views from the roof-top bar,"A perfect spot for cocktails on a warm summer night in Barcelona. Being a roof-top bar the prices are a little on the higher side, although the night views of the city make up for it ten fold. A friend and I ordered a cocktail each and then a bottle of wine to follow. The service was great and out glasses were kept topped up without us having to lift a finger.
A great, relaxed atmosphere, highly recommended.",4,2017,04,17
11,A very nice surprise!,"We visited very frequently Barcelona and stayed always in the very nice mandarin oriental hotel. This time we tried for the first time Majestic hotel, and were very surprised. The hotel has a lot of charms and has a very high quote price/quality!
Already by arrival guests are very welcome, and this until departure. The rooms are very clean and comfortable and the breakfast is fantastic! We already booked a room for our next stay in September !",5,2017,04,17
11,One of the best Barcelona’ sight view is here!,"To begin with, it’s not the first time I’ve been to Barcelona. I always go there to improve my Spanish (Si, hablo muy poco español). This time I aimed at living in a hotel with the most posh public and the best view of BCN (actually, I wanted everything from the category The Most…).
Travelling is all about taking in new sights, exploring different cultures and feeling like you’re somewhere completely different… and if you manage to stay at Majestic Hotel and Spa in Barcelona like I did, you’ll also feel like you’ve stepped back in time!
As soon as I stepped into the hotel, I was treated like royalty. We were welcomed with an afternoon tea at the lobby lounge along with their signature cocktails before checking in as I was taken into our room.
They also all have living rooms, perfect for a family trip or for a girls weekend. If the rooms here don’t scream luxury to you, you need to tell me what you do for a living!
While this may nоt ѕоund еxtrеmеlу аmаzing, thе rооm I gоt wаѕ actually ԛuitе niсе аѕ it саmе with an extensive tеrrасе with a vеrу niсе соuсh. Nevertheless the period I stayed аt Majestic Hоtеl Barcelona, I totally lоvеd thе tеrrасе.
I can’t have a true Sassy review unless we check out the Spa. This relaxing spa is based on a Scottish Tea room and also has treatments based around this theme. They have a wide variety of treatments ranging from Lavender and Rosemary-based facials to soothing massages, and the therapists know how to ease away all those knots before a night out on the town.
The rооftор pool with views оf Pаѕѕеig de Grасiа iѕ a vеrу niсе touch, but thе рооl iѕ ѕmаll аnd nоt hеаtеd. But I still loved it, the staff had no problem making special request breakfast for me each day, when I go back to Barcelona this is where I will stay, and I would highly recommend it.
Fabulous stay, hotel staff couldn’t have been more courteous and helpful. The rooftop bar has amazing views. Great breakfast including champagne and smoked salmon!",5,2017,04,17
11,Beautiful and centrally located,The hotel is walking distance to casa battlo and casa mila.  There's a taxi stand right outside.  The breakfast selection is great and room is comfortable.   There are many stores for shopping nearby.  Taxi to hospital de sant pau costs about 7 euros.  The hospital complex by Lluís Domènech i Montaner was beautiful and not crowded.  ,5,2017,04,15
11,Very nice hotel,"It was a very pleasant stay at this luxury hotel. everthing was perfect from start to end. Would recommend it anytime. Service, location of the hotel and the detail orientation of the staff. Only the interieur was a little bit outdated but it did not bother us at all (even though we got an upgrade).",5,2017,04,15
11,Item missing from safe spoiled an otherwise good break,"Excellent location right next to Chanel.   Rooms small but comfortable 

Good breakfast with lots of choises

Rooftop bar magical

Unfortunately I left my Smythson card wallet  in the safe.  A quick phone call and they located it for me however they only posted back the cards not the wallet. 

It's taken months of emails and phone calls but am getting nowhere.  Not helped by hotel constantly changing their story. Insurance Company haven't even given me the courtesy of a reply.  

Hotel could have easily resolved this and for that reason I won't be returning",2,2017,04,14
11,High level of service,"Very nice hotel. High level service. The best breakfast that We ever eat!!! Also SPA is not bed. Location are brillant! Highly recomend! We stay in Junior suite.No noise from street at all. Room was clean, every day towles changing, water, parfum.",5,2017,04,13
11,Visiting step-son in Barcelona,"If you are seeking a 5-star Hotel that is impeccably clean, takes great pride in their  outstanding customer service and is centrally located in the hustle and bustle of Barcelona, then this is your spot! If you stay on the concierge level, the exceptional and very extensive variety of the highest quality food  served is beyond an amazing treat.  The outdoor top deck for late night cocktails is quite romantic too.  All of this makes up for the size of the room....however, very nicely appointed.",5,2017,04,10
11,Beautiful,Very nice location and well worth the money spent. The food is great. We can't wait to return for our next visit. The staff is great and very attentive.  Concierge was very helpful with dinner suggestions.,5,2017,04,10
11,Wonderful experience ,"Having booked a mini suite and being fortunate enough to be upgraded I can honestly say this is a super hotel. 
Staff were great and the room was lovely. 
The little touches really made the difference - they saw my birthday cards on the sideboard and sent up a complimentary bottle of fizz !!! 
It is conveniently situated in a quality area within walking distance of all the major attractions. 
Highly recommended !!

11,very very poor rooms & service,We stayed for 4 nights from 22 march to 26 march. We were 3 families travelling together and we had 3 room. All of our rooms was at first floor. The size of the one of the rooms was very very small which was completely fulled with the queen bed. I havent seen this size before even in european cities which size of rooms are smaller normally comparing far east hotels. Indeed the another terrible point was the view of all 3 rooms. The view was like prison and the neighborhood area looks like slum area of city. Another point was the personnel of the hotel specially the reception guys. They were very tough and agressive and most of the times they mannered impolitely. The only possitive point of this hotel was location of the hotel which was at passage de gracia and had a good access to major touristic attraction. However if you like to enjoy your stay from beautiful barcelona i dont recommend this hotel .,1,2017,04,07
11,Good location but a very small room,"A classy and expensive hotel located centrally in the shopping areas, the room equiped with nice rain shower and big enough space, equip with most 5 star aminities however the hotel room feel very tiny as there is only one window and most of the room face a wall and big pipes which make it even more depressing. The hotel try to digitize most information into the tv, and the concierge is useless in a way, the service is also not prompt enough, at times you call for house keeping and no one pick up. They dont give water daily, they also dont gove tooth brush daily, or even laundry bag daily. During winter and spring the roof top pool and bar close at 8pm. With the price and part of the leading hotel chain, it didnt live up to the billing. ",1,2017,04,07
11,This hotel is a calammity,"Booked this hotel for the last leg of our amazing european tour just to relax for the last nights before our flight back home. We went to our 350 US$ extreamly TINY room to unload our luggage and then went quickly to the roof bar for some well deserved refreshments. We went to the bar just to find a big crowded so we left that idea and went to rest to our TINY room. Bad idea! Lot of noise in the corredor during the day so no posible to rest. We went to the frontdesk to book some restaurants and we found and endless line of people waiting to check in or to find some restaurants. I asked for the manager to talk about all these problems and a rude guy who introduced himself as the Front Desk Manager wasn t very helpful. Doesn’t matter. Never again. Do yourselves a big favour and look somewhere else in Barcelona.
",1,2017,04,05
11,Great staff but very overpriced,Stayed here last weekend and it was extremely overpriced (a coke was €6.25 and very ordinary bar food /burger €17).  We had a room that had a view of a wall but decided not to change as we were only there 2 nights and despite requesting a twin room several times we had to call reception because there was a double bed in the room when we finally got into it having waited a significant amount for the room to become available. Given the amount one is paying you would expect a far better standard.  The only positive is that the majority of staff were very friendly especially at the roof bar   - which is amazing  but closes at 8pm every night!  The concierge was also very helpful and recommended an amazing restaurant.,3,2017,04,03
11,"Good Hotel, Great roof top bar","This is a very good city centre hotel with every amenity.
The views from the roof top bar are exceptional.
The bar menu is very good & reasonably priced.
The rooms are very good especially if you get one wit ha balcony and the staff are very friendly.",5,2017,03,29

11,The Majestic in Barcelona ,"Great location.   Close to great restaurants, shops, architectural wonders, la Ramba, Gothic quarter, all within a few steps or blocks. Hotel is exceptional in every way imaginable.  Rooms, Service , food and drinks. Barcelona is amazing and so is The Majestic.",5,2017,03,25
11,Lovely hotel and the quality lived up to its reputation,"The hotel is of the highest standard, coupled with the location, it is a perfect top quality choice for central Barcelona.
This is a city centre hotel in an older and elegant building - décor of high standard and taste - bear in mind that because it is central, the rooms are good sized but not huge and the pool on the roof terrace is a small one.
So far as dining is concerned, I ate breakfast, lunch and dinner at the hotel and in every instance the service and food was faultless.
This is the only place I will stay on my next Barcelona visit.",5,2017,03,22
11,After Cruise stop,"We departed the Viking Star after a trans-Atlantic cruise and spent two nights at the Majestic.  This is the oldest hotel in Barcelona, but has been renovated in a spectacular fashion.  The rooms are very clean and comfortable and the terrace bar is exceptional.  The location is in the middle of a grand shopping area and two of Guadi's buildings are within two blocks.  The Las Ramblas area is a very short taxi ride away.  A very nice way to end a great cruise.",5,2017,03,21
11,Fantastic private apartments,"Great hotel with great apartments close to the main street with great atmosphere, we close to La Rambla, not far from stadium, you could take a taxi anyway. Great clean rooms in apartment, only I could recommend. ",5,2017,03,19
11,Great Hotel and Killer Location,"We stayed here for spring break. The room was very nice, but they didn't put chocolate on my pillow at night (their only downfall)! Every one of the staff members was super friendly and had very good English. Breakfast buffet was good, and their lattes were awesome!

The hotel is in an awesome location for luxury shopping. You are right next to Chanel, Burberry, Dior, etc. It's great!",4,2017,03,19
11,Great location and staff.,"Meeting our HS-aged son in BCN for a few days, and this was a perfect location and hotel for us.  Very friendly and helpful staff in all areas.  Clean, comfortable and spacious suite. Very nice breakfast buffet and space.  Small, but clean and decently-equipped gym.  Beautiful rooftop deck with small pool, great bar adn views for sunrise/sunset.",5,2017,03,19
11,Nice,"The staff here are very welcoming and friendly. Our room was nice, clean and comfortable. The rooftop terrace is beautiful, my only complaint is that it isn't open past 8:00. It just seems a little strange as it would be a lovely place for dinner or drinks with the view it has. The hotel bar is lovely, the food has been wonderful. The location is perfect. Great hotel!
",4,2017,03,18
11,Majestic Hotel and Spa ,"The hotel was amazing start to finish! The hotel is a beautiful blend of classic, elegant, and luxurious with all the modern luxuries anyone could ask for when away from home. 
We had a beautiful spacious one bedroom, two bathroom suite with a large walk in closet. 
The common areas such as the lobby, the dining room and the rooftop bar were beautifully appointed while still being welcoming, The buffet breakfast was outstanding! 
The location of the Majestic couldn't be better! Right in the heart of fashionable Eixample. It is beautiful walking neighborhood and only a short cab ride to the beach area.
I can't say enough about the warm, gracious, and professional staff. Everyone at the hotel made us feel important and welcome throughout our stay.
I would return to the Majestic any time!!
Truly a class act!!!",5,2017,03,17
11,Spring break ,"Just spent a week here in Barcelona. The hotel has been a very pleasant experience. The personnel is top notch, classy and friendly. The large concierge department is unparalleled. The room, a junior suite, nice but on the small side. Nice room nevertheless, facing el paseo de gracia. ",5,2017,03,16
11,Majestic Majestic,"The moment I walked in the main door I adored this hotel.  The aroma of Atelier Cologne is beautiful (the hotel's signature scent that is also used in its bath amenities).

Everything about this hotel is top class.  Staff members are professional yet approachable, and nothing was ever too much trouble for them.

Loved the decor, a nice balance between classic and contemporary.  The rooftop pool is a great addition, and the atmosphere there was lively for afternoon cocktails.

Every city has one truly fabulous hotel, and this is Barcelona's.",5,2017,03,13
11,best hotel,"Unbeatable location close to everything the tourist bus passing by
Excellent room met all requirements for a great team helps any question or request
Excellent breakfast is a little expensive but very good
What more is needed?",5,2017,03,13
11,good location,"We stayed at the residencies of this hotel, at the opposite the street of the hotel.
the appartments are well furnished. it is also possible to make use of the facilities of the hotel.
the pool is very small on top of the hotel.
the price of the hotel / residencies is over the top.",3,2017,03,13
11,Great Hotel,We stayed here when we came to visit daughter abroad. Hotel in great location. Staff was great. Rooms were clean and roof top bar and pool awesome. Spa was good could be bigger. Would definitely stay here again,5,2017,03,09
11,Amazing stay,"We loved the majestic , it was centrally located .
The staff was very nice and helpful 
The rooms were clean and very comfortable 
When we checked in after flying during the night we were so surprised that they were able to give us both our rooms immediately, that meant so much to us .
We would definitely recommend it to all our friends",4,2017,03,07
11,Fantastic - Elegant Hotel and Old School Service,Visited for a family celebration. The staff gave a room upgrade and the suite we had was amazing. The hotel is lovely - it's had a makeover but retains old school charm. Rooms were very well kitted out. The roof top is a winner - classy and funky hangout and great to sit and drink during the day or night. Location is great - much better than being on the Ramblas or harbour. Tried the Mandarin for breakfast and thought it was soulless and bland in comparison. Highly recommended.,5,2017,03,06
11,Great way to spend the last days of summer ,"We chose the Majestic more for its location than on its own merits but I'm very glad we did. 
From start to finish our experience was excellent. The staff were great, the advice from the concierge on which restaurants to choose & what time was best to arrive for the best experience was invaluable and the hotels facilities were excellent. 
Our room had a small terrace which gave us chance to catch the morning sun but the roof top terrace and bar was the ideal place to spend the afternoon looking at the city down below and enjoying great food and cocktails and a dip in the pool. 

Barcelona is definitely a city worth revisiting and the Majestic would be the perfect base again. ",5,2017,03,05
11,Not So Majestic at The Majestic,"The hotel does indeed have a Majestic decor, so if that's your type of thing, you'll have a blast. That being said, we were there with two kids and when they ran around the lobby they got reprimanded by a staff member. It's a bit weird they present themselves as a family-friendly property but they aren't really acting as such. 

Moreover, upon checkout I discovered to my surprise, the hotel was charging us an additional 100 euros a night for the extra baby-beds that never even made it to our room. They only agreed to take the charges off after a long and quite exhausting argument with a manager.

So as far as hospitality and politeness, I am afraid it's a C. (As in I won't see you again).

Room: the room was nice and pretty big with a giant walk-in closet (a personal favorite in my pre-kiddies days) and a beautiful, marble-clad bathroom. However, though we repeatedly asked for it, both when making the reservation (via phone) and after check in, they gave us a room with a view to the building next door. Again, C. (B for the bathroom though).

Food: the breakfast gets an A. And I am cheap on those (former college professor with a flare for nice hotels). Breakfast like the Majestic's is rare. On display was: a variety of fruits, cold cuts, warm servings of eggs, pancakes, sausage etc., breads of all walks of life, champagne, cheeses and spreads, different fish, assortment of deserts and even vegetables and pickles. My foodie hubby, the numero uno critique of restaurants, was appreciative at this buffet. 

Pool and spa: ok so guys the roof top pool is the size of a tub. That's a D ( as in this thing Doesn't qualify as a pool). 

Bottom line grade: a B hotel on the The O scale with A + pricing. ",3,2017,03,01
11,Pedicure and Body massage ,"Very polite staff with English as a second language. Experienced and knowledgeable in the art of massage. The environment is quiet, music and lighting create a well balanced ambience to relax both the body and mind. For a pedicure ask for Simona, a Juventus supporter, a soccer fan, a great conversationalist that makes the service all worthwhile. ",5,2017,02,25
11,Excellent Stay,"Having been in Barcelona on several occasions this was my first time staying at this fine hotel.  
The location is excellent,  the roof top pool and bar area is super cool.
This trip was for business so I didn't have much to to use all of the facilities but those that did were well up to standard. 
The room was compact, but a great view made up for it.

I would recommend this hotel for both business or pleasure ",4,2017,02,25
11,Feel like a welcome resident of Barcelona!,"We stayed in one of the residences / apartment units linked to The Majestic. The property is actually across the street. The units are very spacious, clean and come complete with washer/dryer, kitchen, living room, bedroom, & bathroom. Our only note is not the quietest unit, but, if you are like us you can fix that problem with a free app on your phone :) The private feeling of the unit makes you feel like a resident !!!",5,2017,02,21
11,I loved this hotel!,"We only stayed 4 nights, before heading out on a cruise. I could have stayed much much longer

we stayed in a big corner-type suite, with our 2 children sharing the sofa bed. the suite was huge, comfy, attractive.
The location was perfect, easy walking distance to hundreds of restaurants and great shopping.
loved the rooftop pool and bar - if you can get a 'table' it was a lovely space to have a family meal when we were tired and just off the plane.
amazing breakfast buffet, crowded but outstanding food
lovely service from the concierge, who helped us with sending some luggage to the UK so we didn't need to take it on our cruise (too much shopping!)

I would definitely stay here again",5,2017,02,20
11,Fabulous Hotel,"Stayed here for a city break.From arriving the staff were so lovely and helpful.Gave tips on where to eat locally,helped book table at restaurants,nothing too much trouble.
Our room was clean,luxurious,very quiet as requested and the rain shower is superb.Beds super comfortable.Every attention to detail made.Gym is just fine.My son enjoyed it there.Roof terrace is relaxing to sit in the sun and enjoy views of city.
The staff make the place as always friendly courteous and smiling.
Maid service as one would expect and really very happy with our stay.
Great location and always easy to get a taxi or easy to walk everywhere from here.
We were allowed to have a late check out as well for no extra cost.
Thank you Hotel Majestic!!",5,2017,02,20
11,"Very Noisy place ""cant sleep""","In fact the hotel decoration was very nice modern and clean, however the hotel located in the directly on the main road close to the city center. Uncomfortable at all if you was to have good sleep at night. It is worth to say that this hotel is the most expensive hotel, without informing the guests that there is a daily city tax charged by each guest counted on daily basis excluding the room charge, which I personally call it cheating!!! 
for 4 guest with 11 nights we were charged around 500 euro as city tax excluding the 8500 euro changes for 2 double rooms and additional 1000 euro for breakfast. I will not repeat this visit again big👎🏻",1,2017,02,17
11,Patek Phillipe Retailers Spain and Portugal,"Very well located hotel nearby prestigious fashion and luxury brands, excellent service and profesional service...makes your stay a nice experience.I would recommend this hotel without any doubt.
Tip: Their cocktails are great at majestic bar!!",4,2017,02,15
11,Great hotel in the heart of Barcelona ,"We loved the location of the Majestic. Great area with restaurants, shops and attractions in the area. Staff was nice and friendly. Helped us with storing bikes we rented for a couple of days. Fabulous way to see lots of the city by the way. So much fun and it's a neat way to feel more like a local and cover more ground. The breakfast buffet was nice every morning, and we especially loved sitting outside by the succulent wall and water feature. The rooftop pool and bar offers spectacular views of the city as well and is a fun place to have a drink or two while soaking up some rays. Would definitely recommend this spot to any travelers. The rooms were nice and comfortable too. ",5,2017,02,15
11,Business Trip,"Great hotel very high  standards. As you would expect every where was clean. Drinks in the hotel bar were very expensive, more than I would expect for a city location. Although a very short trip the location appeared to be very good.",5,2017,02,15
11,Is this hotel good? Yes. Can some things be improved? Certainly.,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Majestic Hotel this past weekend. We decided on a quick weekend trip to Barcelona, and this was available through Amex's 'Fine Hotels and Resorts'. This system is great, and advertised complimentary upgrade when available. 

Upon checkin, we were taken to our room, which, to be fair, is rather akin to a closet. It's absolutely tiny, and has pretty much a bed and nothing else. The bathroom is comparably huge! I was not happy with this room; and was informed that this room was in fact an upgraded room from what I booked! Apparently the 'standard' rooms don't have a view, and my upgrade afforded me a view.

I must say that the guest relations manager handled this amazingly. She immediately changed my room without hesitation, and without any questions asked. Perhaps I was ambitious to expect a huge upgrade, but either way, the room we were upgraded to was absolutely wonderful. It was spacious, clean, and on a higher floor.

Additionally, when we returned for the night, there was a hand-written note with some cheese and wine as an apology! We certainly weren't expecting this as -- to be honest -- this is complimentary, not mandatory. For this, the hotel receives massive points in the 'service' category. 

For the sake of simplification, I'll summarise the rest of the review in PROS and CONS

PROS
Wonderfully huge room with terrace. This is considered an 'executive' room, and I would definitely recommend booking it. 
Amazing marble bathroom with luxurious bath (and accessories) - this was my girlfriend's highlight!
Relatively comfortable bed - we found the bed adequate, but not amazing. The bedding was slightly thin, but the pillows were very comfortable
Amazingly fast internet - this should be standard at high-end hotels, but amazingly, appears the exception rather than the norm. If high-speed internet is a requirement for you, you'll be absolutely fine here.
In-room nespresso machine (although only two capsules provided per day! I think you need to pay if you use more?!)
Very good, professional spa (my girlfriend used the Amex voucher and thoroughly enjoyed it)
Friendly, attentive staff
Great breakfast with a decent selection of pastries, cold meats, fruit, etc. If it's included, it's great, but I'm not sure it's worth €34 per person (if you have to pay!)
Excellent location if you're wanting to see the sights of Barcelona. Walking distance to several of the major attractions, and lots of shops etc around the hotel.

CONS
The room is a little worn, and needs some attention. There are scuff marks everywhere, and it just looks a little tired. 
The reading light on one side of the bed flickered consistently, even when all the lights were turned off. This was very frustrating as I am a light sleeper and this kept bugging me.
The light to the fridge in the minibar was faulty and would not turn off. This meant that there was quite a lot of light coming through the cupboard.
The doors / walls adjacent to the hallway are VERY thin. We were woken up every night by people arriving back to the hotel. I don't think they were necessarily loud, the rooms just weren't very well insulated. We couldn't hear any adjacent rooms, just the noise from the hallway.
The extractor fan in the bathroom did not work.
The air conditioning did not work effectively. It was either far too hot, or far too cold.

That's about it. Overall, I think the hotel is a solid 4/5 rating. There are some niggles that stop it from being a 5, but I cannot fault the service of the staff. With just a few minor improvements this could be the best hotel in the city.",4,2017,02,13
11,Majestic hotel barcelona ,"Second time i stay at the Majestic . Great hotel,  great location.Very nice staff. Beautiful view from the terrace . Food is also very good . Surely when i will go again to barcelona i will stay again at the Majestic and i recommend it to my friends and family. ",5,2017,02,09
11,Mr.,"Once again visited Barcelona and stay
At one of my preferred hotel,Majestic 
As usual everything is allways perfect
from the ambient to the Excellent service
Location is one of the best area of the
Beautiful city.
Hope to go back soon",5,2017,02,04
11,Amazing Sunday Brunch!,"If you want a quite special treat, do not miss the Majestic's Sunday Brunch. A luxurious experience! Delicacies and drinks of all type and range, all included (no additional cost to pay). Very, very recommendable.",5,2017,02,03
11,Utterly Fabulous just gorgeous,"Wow this hotel is just pure luxury and class we absolutely loved our stay here from the moment we arrived.
Have been to Barcelona many times and we really enjoy it everytime.
The hotel is conveniently located to the Rambla and is very central making your stay hassle free it's restaurant is excellent offering exceptional food and has a great variety of dishes something to suit everyone.
The spa is out of this world and the rooms are large comfortable and provide everything you need for a good stay.
Beds are extra comfy with top quality bedding rooms are spotless .
Thankyou for an exceptional stay",5,2017,02,01
11,Great hotel - expensive but worth it,We loved this place. It's a five star building with first class service and superior rooms. Excellent location and our room has a view of the Gaudi building across the street (ok and down a bit). HIGHLY recommended.,5,2017,02,01
11,Deluxe hotel in a great location.....,"Impressed with the location of the Majestic which is within circa 20 minutes of Sagrade Familia and La Ramble,  with Casa Batllo within a few hundred yards. The hotel is certainly premium but lost a star from me as my room was rather narrow with no view, and too hot with an air conditioning system that seemed to make little impact. I found breakfast too a little disappointing with lukewarm ""hot"" options and a rather limited choice. All of my criticisms are in the context of this being a five star hotel so are a little harsh given my overall experience was a positive one.",4,2017,02,01
11,First Time visitor to Barcelona,"We actually stayed in the Majestic Residence across the road but had full use of all the hotel amenities. The location was fantastic and the appartment was very clean and had everything you need (washing machine, dryer, full kitchen etc) The residence was very safe and quiet. We ate in the hotel bar on two separate occasions and the food and service was very good, The hotel staff were very helpful and were able to recommend restaurants when asked. We would definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking for a top end experience. We had room 42 which had a street view that looked over the main street which was quite delightful. You can also see La Pedrera from the Balcony.",5,2017,01,31
11,Nice but could be better ,"They have really good pictures and service. Room nice, but lit bit old. Carpet was not very nice. The same with towels. Needs refreshment. Apperol in bar was not good. Better to eat somewhere else. Breakfast was nice. ",4,2017,01,29
11,Elegant hotel ,"Elegant hotel with very nice smelling everywhere , great breakfast, excellent location near many brand stores , 
nice spa and swimming pool with wonderful views on the roof. 
Every thing is available in this hotel the laundry ,coffee ,chocolate,nuts and iron.
They serve a testy clairs in barcelona.",5,2017,01,27
11,Perfect stay,"The hotel's great location on the Gracia, the outstanding views from the roof and the obliging service by the front staff make this hotel a perfect place to explore Barcelona from. Rooms are not huge but a very comfortable huge bed was provided.",5,2017,01,23
11,Outstanding,As we booked through Amex fine resorts program we received a double upgrade to a deluxe room with a balcony. Service all around is top notch. Breakfast was lovely. They have 24/7 concierge service which was immensely helpful to us.  Room was large and beautifully appointed. Great location. Would strongly recommend this hotel. Very attentive to guests.,5,2017,01,22
11,Nothing last forever,"Once again.. i stayed at this classic catalonian hotel... but seeing the service given for last 2/3 times.. definately im picking somewhere else next ocasion like Monument or Hotel Omm. there,s no urgency at all, because service looks like getting worst every single day. 
For what you pay its doesnt make sense at all getting this normal treat. Years ago we could feel local n happy people attending guest needs... nowadays... it looks like they dont care anynore about their regular guests. Good luck in your future, im staying at a different property x sure",2,2017,01,19
11,Short break in January 2017,"We have stayed for two nights and enjoyed our stay very much. Unbeatable location and very good service are two main reasons we liked our stay, probably the best choice of many hotels in the great city.",5,2017,01,18
11,Majestic Luxury,"I chose this hotel for a birthday treat for myself.  A close friend and I rented a room, but it turned out to be the apartments across the street.  While I don't remember reading that the rooms were not in the hotel proper, it turned out fine.  We were still on the main strip and had access to all the amenities.   This was the most expensive couple of days I have ever had.  This is a luxury hotel surrounded by expensive shopping options.  However, there is a more reasonable shopping and eatery areas at the end of the main drag. We went to the spa and I received an ok massage and nail appt.  I later went down to the to the end of the street and found a cheaper better massage and nail place.  ",4,2017,01,18
11,Miss,"This was one of the best hotels
I ever stayed at. Very friendly staff, amazing location with easy access to transportation and in the middle of the city. Shopping and site seeing is nearby and the area is very safe. ",5,2017,01,16
11,Spa?,"Very good location  in the heart of Barcelona, very friendly staff....however...the room is quite small and for sleeping onlyyyyyy ...spa ?????? Where is it ???? No space at all ....very old non maintained sauna and extremely small outdoor pool with bathroom size.. 
The breakfast is very good and very expensive....
I don't know what to advise....
Good luck ...",3,2017,01,16
11,Great Hotel,"This is my 5th trip to Barcelona. It's a lovely city and this is a great hotel in every regard, but I experienced the best service I can remember. I was there for 4 days. I definitely want to stay there again.
",5,2017,01,12
11,Do it in style,"Had a lovely New Year break at this luxurious hotel. The staff are very attentive and special praise goes to the reception staff who are very helpful and informative.
The rooms cover most needs and the bathroom is fully equipped with towelling robes and slippers, hairdryer, toiletries etc. We found the hotel very quiet despite being centrally located.
The only gripe I have is the tea/coffee aspect in the room which is available although not to our taste, maybe that is just the British in us. We never ate at the hotel as the food was not for us although we did go to Caffe di Francesco on the opposite corner of the hotel for drinks and toast. Beware if asking for toast the price (3.30 euros) is for two rounds of bread. Don't make the same mistake as ourselves in ordering four and getting eight rounds. There are indoor and outdoor seating areas.
The hotel is in the perfect location with Casa Battlo, La Pedrera, La Ramblas and Sagrada Familia all within a 10-15 minute walk. It is approximately a 20 minute walk downhill a gentle hill, all on one level, to the sea front.
Access to and within the hotel is more than adequate, cannot vouch for the bathroom facilities as this is not within our remit. If required, ask and specify your needs.",5,2017,01,12
11,Wedd anniversary ,"Great hotel, very good location, spa is to small ( rooms and waiting area) but very good on massage and facial , beautiful views from the terrace , short cocktail list ...
Very large variety on Breakfast.",4,2017,01,09
11,À plaisant stay ,We were well received from the moment we arrived until we left. The service was good in all areas from the room which was clean and agreeable as well as the front desk who were always cheerful and helpful. The food was well prepared and we would be happy to return. The hotel is in a great location and the concierge gave us good advice on restaurants ,5,2017,01,08
11,Best Location and Concierge!!,"We LOVED the Majestic! We went for 5 nights around Christmas.  We stayed in a one-bedroom suite because we have a 3-yr old daughter.  It was amazing space!
The best thing of all was the concierge...every restaurant they recommended was fantastic!  They were so helpful...they even spent a whole day trying to find me a cooking class...but they were all sold out.  I can't say enough wonderful things about this hotel - especially the location.  We only took a taxi twice our whole visit.  The Majestic made our stay so relaxed and memorable!!!  Thank you!!",5,2017,01,06
11,Fantastic Hotel,"Directly by entering the hotel Majestic everyone extremely helpful and accurate. The atmosphere overall is warm and welcoming. The room perfectly equipped. The restaurant  and lobby bar have great quality.  The roof top lounge gives a fine view over the city. Great coffee and drinks. The location in the hart of thecity of Barcelona is perfect .
The History and admosphere in the hotel superb. Go and relax. ",5,2017,01,06
11,"Excellent location, great service","Booked a junior suite, passeig de gracias view for a week. We were there for the holiday season, just got back. The hotel was beautifully decorated. Had a nice gift on arrival (cava and galletas). 

1. Location is 5/5. On one of the corners along Passeig de gracia, a block from Casa Battlo to the left and 2 blocks to Casa Mila to the right. Shopping everywhere (chanel, gucci, rimowa etc). A small grocery a block to the back and to the right.

2. Room 4.5/5 - Large junior suite, do suggest the view. The suite has 2 mini balconies (can't sit comfortably, but standing only), quiet even overlooking the passeig. There's 2 rooms which is separated by a sliding door, 1 sofa bed, study desk and a chair in room # 1,  the master bedroom has a very comfortable bed and the opening to the master bath and shower, with separate toilet. Some minor peeves - hair dryer is attached to the wall and the shower drain is not as effective. Nevertheless, the atelier brand of amenities is top notch. They also have extra toothbrushes, shoe shine if needed. Has a mini bar - bottled water is 3 euros each. Opt for turn down since they do supply you with water.

3. Service 5/5 - Excellent.  From the bellboy, security, concierge down to housekeeping was excellent. Tried in room dining and loved their version of patatas braves and croquettes. Had lunch and dinner at the bar (sangria, vegetarian burger and nonnas tapas were flavorful). Breakfast spread was amazing. Prices tend to be high (37 euros each) so I would not suggest breakfast unless you had a good deal or it was included in your room.

Tips -  For breakfast - like Amattler/Faborito which has 5 euro breakfast and coffee deals. Their chocolate drink is amazing. It is beside the case battlo. 

There are cheap tapas to the left of the hotel. 

We avoided Las Ramblas, enjoyed Sagrada, Battlo, skipped Mila, went to MNAC at Montjuic and  went to Monserrat for a day trip, Andorra for an overnight trip (yup). We used their car service (minimum 3 hours).

They speak Catalan, not castillano but most of the staff spoke English. Did practice and learned some words, they were happy to oblige.

Do not miss their rooftop bar, wonderful views (except of George Clooney). 

Overall, we had a blast and would highly recommend this hotel. 5/5",5,2017,01,04
11,brunch at the majestic,"we had brunch at the majestic on sunday before christmas ;it was to die for 
our hostess angela was so great and she manage to find us a table for that sunday and my lord it was to die for
little verrines  where delicious so the rest ,we had champagne and our hostess was very présent so can't wait to go back

11,Exactly what we wanted,"Had a fantastic experience at the Majestic hotel this past December. The place is beautiful and spotless. Upon arrival we were greeted by friendly doormen, and after a little wait, we were taken to our rooms. The hotel was spotless and had a wonderful scent. The rooms are exactly what we were hoping for. Amazing beds and linen, a TV with tons of channels, not to mention a marble bathroom with the works! The location is great as well. It's not too busy, which makes taxi pick up easy, and it is walking distance to some fantastic restaurants and shops. My only regret was not having the breakfast at the Majestic, which is apparently to die for! Oh well, I guess we'll have to visit again!",5,2017,01,04
11,Excellent ,"Excellent hotel and extremely friendly staff! They provide a complementary prayer mat for Muslims. Very kind gesture! 
It's located in a very convenient location next to many international brands! Will recommend this hotel to everyone visiting Barcelona ",5,2017,01,01
11,great location superb breakfast fine staff very comfortable rooms highly recomend,"this hotel has been around  for a long time. i just love it! I have been there many times and always know i will be served greatly and sleep in comfy beds. the spa is very good even though the treatment rooms can be confining.  the decor is classical but always neat, neutral and cosy. the piano bar offers great choices of food and drinks. there is a small roof bar that appeals to a more modern taste. it has good views of the paseo de gracia. i love the fact that i can walk everywhere from my hotel. i used to stay at hotels on the beach but it was always annoying to feel i was in a factory for tourists and to have to take a taxi to go anywhere but the beach. the roof pool is a toy. that is the only negative.",5,2016,12,31
11,Go to the roof top bar great spot,Loved this hotel and rooftop bar a great late night spot highly recommend. On the main strip and there is a bar locally which is worth visiting. Loud music great wines and cocktails. DJ and pool. Visit at night romantic fun spot overlooking the city.,5,2016,12,31
11,"A very, very nice hotel",We spend 5 days in Barcelona at the hotel Majestic. My wife and my two kids. Christmas time in this wonderful and cosmopolitan city. And Majestic and it's staff made are time even more unique. Majestic is a truly five star hotel at a perfect location. Fulfills all the requirements for a comfortable stay. Many thanks to Christina at the reception and the other polite and helpful staff.,5,2016,12,30
11,Great brunch and friendly staff,We try to book the Sunday brunch each time we are in Barcelona. It is very good and well worth the price of 65 EUR as drinks are included. Yes Champagne as well. The quality of food is great so come hungry.,5,2016,12,29
11,"Excellent massages, and wonderful rooftop terrace to relax on before or after!","The staff at the hotel majestic spa was so helpful and accommodating, I can't say enough about them! We booked our massages the same day we received them, and they were really helpful and efficient at getting us set up.

Their masseuses are very good at their jobs - incredibly professional, and skilled at understanding the body and its tension points. I thought my 60 minute massage there was one of the best I ever had! Definitely worth the $125 (as someone who has visited spas all over the world, I can say this price is a steal!).

We arrived 30 minutes before our massages scheduled times because we thought they might have a lounge or jacuzzi to enjoy beforehand, like many spas do. They don't actually, as this spa is quite small, but the hotel does have a fabulous rooftop with views of the whole city, which you can enjoy before or after your services. We had a glass of cava (overpriced at 6 euro each, but worth it for the views) while we relaxed in the sun before the spa receptionist came out to tell us she was ready for us. 

This was the perfect way to spend our last day on vacation! We felt so relaxed, I was so glad we did this. Definitely highly recommend! ",5,2016,12,28
11,"Nice hotel, small rooms","We stayed here 4 nights in December. It s not cheep but a nice hotel in the centre of Barcelona. Downside was that rooms are quite small, and breakfast is euro 37 per person. How many bread rolls  can you eat in the morning? We went out to a street cafe just across the road every morning and had a great and much cheaper brekkie.",4,2016,12,27
11,Amazing!!! ,"My husband and I stayed at the Majestic in Barcelona for 4 nights and had a true 5 star experience.  The concierge was super helpful as were the doorman and any other staff member we interacted with.  The hotel was in a wonderful location walking distance to many main sites in the city.  The hotel was pristine, from the lobby to our room to the amazing roof top bar/restaurant. The rooftop has a great vibe and views day and night with a small swimming pool.  We also used the gym and it was nicely appointed and clean.  We had room service breakfast each morning and it was delicious and timely.  I would highly recommend this hotel to any of my friends and family who are going to Barcelona.  ",5,2016,12,22
11,"Amazing hotel, unforgettable experience","Amazing hotel, the hotel staff is professional and kind, great location, good breakfast, the food in the lobby and in the restaurant is very tasty

 it was an unforgettable experience

11,Very Majestic ,"We stayed for our wedding anniversary from 25th-30th November in a deluxe Paseo de Gracia room. The room was small yet beautifully appointed with a little walk out balcony which made it perfect. The hotel itself is summed up by its name' Majestic '. The staff are excellent, we enjoyed the buffet breakfast and the rooftop bar. The hotel is in a great location for shopping but also easy walking distance to many major sights.
Superb stay, highly recommend.",5,2016,12,13
11,Delightful,"I had just 36 hours to take in Barcelona during a business trip, and it was a peak-season weekend with FC Barcelona playing Madrid and the holidays in full swing. The Majestic staff, particularly deputy manager Fernando, ensured that my time there was perfect. Their authentic and thoughtful service was unparalleled. Wonderful location near Gaudi's Casa Battlo and spectacular views from the 10th floor rooftop bar and pool. Truly wonderful.",5,2016,12,11
11,Lovely hotel close to shops and tourist sights,"Great hotel, first class service, comfortable room , a beautiful roof terrace with great views over the city and in addition nearby attractions and downtown restaurants and shops.
Expensive room rates However IT is Barcelona. 
The concierge desk was very helpful and knowledgeable when we asked for help looking for good restaurants for dinner. ",5,2016,12,08
11,"Liked it, didn't love it","We stayed at the apartments across the street from the hotel, which was good for the family size and the price. The suite was nice and spacious. We really didn't use any of the amenities of the hotel but from what I saw they were nice. Service was good. The bar on the rooftop must be amazing in season but it was closed due to weather when we were there. 

Im always concerned about location but this is really in a great spot around high end shopping, restaurants, bars, etc. Walking distance to many attractions like the Gaudi apartments and Sagrada familia. 5-star location.

There wasn't anything memorable about it in my opinion to make it a 5 star.",4,2016,12,05
11,Very nice property,"This is a very nice property located in a nice area. Service was very good. They have a great breakfast buffet and a rooftop dining area or lounge. Our room was comfortable, although a bit on the small side, but that's fairly consistent in European hotels.",4,2016,12,05
11,Relatively affordable luxury in Barcelona,"It may not be the most expensive hotel in Barcelona, but The Majestic Hotel and Spa isn't cheap. And in a city with many very nice and affordable accommodations, it isn't for everyone. But if you're looking for what I might  describe as affordable luxury, you're in business at the Majestic. What is there to like? The rooms are wonderful. Well appointed and comfortable, and in some cases quiet spacious, even at the low end of their rack rate. The service is also outstanding. You'll be hard pressed not to find assistance when you need it.

The hotel's location on Passig de Garcia is also a huge perk. Lots of high end shops and a couple of tourist sites are close. The Barcelona ""hop on hop off"" bus stops at several places along he avenue. It's a 10 minute walk to Las Ramblas and 15 to the gothic quarter. And access to cabs and the metro is plentiful.

To me though, the star of my stay was the food. The buffet breakfast is among the best I've had at any hotel anywhere. Everything is fresh and well prepared. The selection is beyond a typical buffet, and the staff is incredibly swift and attentive. It isn't cheap at nearly 35€ per person. And at that price it's hard to say any hotel buffet is worth it. But hotel breakfasts are usually about convenience, and if you can afford to stay here you probably won't care. My advice, look for a rate with the breakfast included. Aside for the breakfast, the food in the lobby and rooftop bars is also great. And the drink quality and selection was wonderful. I love a fine hotel that has good food. You're paying enough to stay at places like this, so it's always surprising to me when this a hotel messes up their dining options.

The spa was my biggest disappointment, in large part because it's a tiny, tacked on space off the rooftop bar. There isn't room for changing rooms or a quiet waiting area. There are no pools or bathes. And they suggest to you to arrive in your bathrobe, but the tiny elevator is shared with the rest hotel and rooftop lounge. Not a great experience. The service I had was pretty good, but considering the expense, it's hard to say I felt like I got great value.

So in a nutshell, Barcelona has a lot to of fine hotels to chose from. Many which are more affordable. But if you want location and comfort, this is a relatively affordable place to get it. And they take great care of you. Also, one final tip: If you book through American Express Travel, you'll pay about 25€ more per night, but get your breakfast included plus early check in, late check out, and a spa credit.",4,2016,12,02
11,Good location...rooms a let down...,"Was very excited to visit the Majestic as it is not tied to any hotel company.  The lobby area is ok, but the rooms were very small - a surprise as this is a well regarded hotel.   The best thing about the hotel was the service - excellent with kudos to concierge stood out as exceptional.  Overall would look at another hotel in Barcelona.",3,2016,11,30
11,Loved the Majestic ,My wife and I just returned from Spain. In Barcelona we stayed at the Majestic. We had a wonderful time in this really fine hotel.  Perfectly situated in Barcelona to anywhere we wished to eat or walk or visit. The Hotel staff couldn't have been more agreeable or helpful. From the door man to the concierge to the staff in the breakfast room. Everything was first class. Nice gym facility as well. The rooms were nicely spacious. It should be noted that the concierge was spot on on their restaurant recommendations and their directions to find these places was perfect. We highly recommend the Majestic if your going to Barcelona. ,5,2016,11,27
11,Unbeatable location and lovely hotel,"I stayed in the Majestic Hotel for 3 nights in mid-October with my mother for her birthday. We had a standard twin room but were pleasantly surprised by the size of the bedroom - it was very large compared to many other hotels, with a walk-in wardrobe, large bathroom and a sofa. The beds were very comfortable and the room had good climate control which was ideal for the chillier evenings. The bath is enormous and robes and slippers are provided, as well as high-quality toiletries.

The location of this hotel really is unbeatable. It's right by Gaudí's Casa Battló and Casa Milà, both of which are must-sees and it's only a short walk away from most other sights in the centre of the city. It's surrounded by shops and restaurants so there is so much to see and do right on the doorstep of the hotel. We never needed to get a taxi anywhere.

Service in the hotel was good, the staff are very attentive and courteous. The roof top bar is very picturesque for a drink or dinner in the evenings and worth a visit. However prices in the hotel generally are very, very high. Breakfast was nearly €30 each per day (so we ate out every morning) and drinks at the hotel roof bar were highly overpriced - €16 for an Aperol Spritz, for example. I'd recommend eating and drinking outside of the hotel, if possible.

Another negative is that there are fewer complimentary amenities given to guests than I've experienced in other five star hotels. For example, a Nespresso machine is available in the room but the Nespresso pods are charged on your mini bar bill, and there is no other hot drink facilities in the room, which is a shame.

However on the location and quality of the rooms I'd recommend the hotel highly as an excellent place to stay, right in the heart of Barcelona.",4,2016,11,27
11,Thanksgiving,"Stayed at the Majestic Residences over thanksgiving with our family. The Hotel staff was amazing. The 2 bedroom apartments were incredible in size and cleanliness. Housekeeping came every day and all our cleaning supplies and toiletries were provided. The Hotel reservation manager, Carlos, understood all our needs and could not have been more accommodating!  Each apartment had 2 bedrooms and 2 full bathrooms ,a fully equipped kitchen, a washer and dryer, a living room,dining room and an outside terrace with chairs. The location was very central and nothing was too far of a walk. Will definitely stay here our next trip !",5,2016,11,25
11,The best hotel I have stayed in in Europe...,"I came here for 2 nights on business and I wish I could stay on for leisure for a week! While the bedrooms are small, they are perfectly appointed with lovely furnishings and super comfy bed and pillows. Small details - a little sampler of the hotel fragrance, delightfully scented toiletries, a nespresso, a fantastic minibar, an adaptor plug, great room service menu and the white marble bathroom with huge bath - make this place great. What tips It over the edge into fantastic is the staff and their attentive friendly service. From the bowler hatted doorman to everyone you pass by, everyone has a smile and a greeting. A real sense of pride. 
The breakfast is also the best I have had in Europe. The bread and pastries were enough to tempt even the fittest in our group!  Just a tiny detail, which is common in most hotels in Spain - only 3 English channels and they are all news...one movie would be fab ( although this time I didn't stay much in my room). 
I will be back - not least to experience the rooftop bar! Thank you to the Majestic team!",5,2016,11,22
11,Great location & excellent 5 star hotel overall,"I have just returned with my family ( 2 adults and 2 children)  from a stay at this hotel. The location is its main forte. It certainly lives up to the standards expected if a city centre 5 star hotel having given us an overall long weekend.

The established concierge team of Noella and Mario (can't remember the third persons name) were excellent and an asset to this hotel, even better than some of the less experienced reception staff - Mario made a huge difference to our stay especially in recommending child friendly restaurants and activities. If you are travelling with children - no matter what ages - do not miss a trip to Cosmo-Caixa, the amazing science museum (15 mins taxi ride away) , its massive, and has large open spaces and amazing collections of science related and biological interactive content that would keep 2-16 year olds occupied for 3-4 hours happily. 

The hotel is on the main ""posh boulevard"" of Barcelona - the Paseig de Garcia and the main attractions were within a 15-30 mins walking distance or a 5 mins taxi hop away. 

The hotels rooms were spacious and decorated to a very high standard and they do have very comfortable beds. The Dolce Vita rooftop has great views of sunsets over Barcelona hilltops. 

The breakfast buffet is good and room service can be a bit hit and miss. Language, I suspect may be a challenge as Spain unlike some European nations still struggles with English speakers, so exercise caution when you order allergen free food etc as the responses from the room service team is never consistent on content, so we had to check and double check.

Senior management were excellent and are visible in the hotel and always approachable and seek to settle any queries (they do have an excellent hold on English as expected).

They have some Dutch management trainee graduate interns who are all an asset to the hotel and they should think about offering some of these young people jobs as they break the language issues and are all very engaging - credit to Mitchell - a bright young intern who looked after my daughter's at breakfast times and made their day. 

They have a small rooftop pool - and not heated, which was a disappointment. In this day of solar panels, it probably would cost very little to heat it and keep guests happy- but I suspect that semi clad hotel guests and noisy children on the rooftop pool would affect the rooftop Dolce Vita clientele who pay well to watch sunsets from the roof , so may serve the hotels interests not to heat the pool and keep it cold for 6/12 in the year. 

Overall - excellent location, great team, excellent facilities, good rooms and 5 star management  and concierge team.

11,Very Majestic,"The location of this hotel was perfect, everything was walking distance and anything that was not walking distance, the red bus was the perfect transportation to use.
The staff were very friendly and the hote was very clean.
Plenty of shopping for everyone.",5,2016,11,15
11,Not as Majestic as one would expect,"Maybe it's because we came for one day,
Maybe it's because we are spoilt,
Maybe it's because we hardly spent any time there,
But the Hotel Majestic just didn't inspire us that much.

My mother is fabulous and has excellent taste. We have been in Barcelona many times, and have decided to finally treat ourselves to one night at the Majestic, which we have passed by a million times.
We loved everything - the name, the five stars, the location, the website!

However, it was just...alright. There was absolutely nothing wrong with it, but it just wasn't five stars majestic. The interior wasn't anything special, the service wasn't any different from 3- and 4-star hotels, it was all...fine.

But ONE thing was truly spectacular. The breakfast. The breakfast and room service. Absolutely delicious. I am a vegetarian and I was VERY happy. My mom eats everything, so it's easier to please her, and she was very happy too.

Perhaps if you get a room of a higher class and enjoy the rooftop pool and the SPA you'll feel it's Majestic power. But for a one-night stay we just didn't get enough of the city's unique atmosphere that some other hotels do offer.",3,2016,11,15
11,A haven of peace during a difficult time,"Our cruise ended early. We were bused from a previous port to Barcelona so that we could continue with our scheduled travel.  The Majestic was our home, but only for one night. After a somewhat stressful journey including being tied up in traffic due to a protest, we finally arrived.  It was a haven of peace.

The staff was prepared with rooms at short notice. Our room was spacious and lovely.  The concierge helped us plan our evening.  Breakfast the next morning was delicious. Oh, that we had more time . . . .

We are planning to return next year  in order to enjoy Barcelona and the Majestic more thoroughly.",5,2016,11,14
11,Hope to Return Soon!,"I booked the hotel through American Express Travel - FIne Hotels Program.  It was lovely.  The room was clean and nicely appointed.  Plenty of space for all of our purchases from shopping!  The location is excellent.  Right in the middle of it all.  Located directly on the street for high end shopping and then just a short walk to old town or the church that will never be done!  LOL.  We did make our way down to the seaport/beach area where the W is and it is beautiful; however, definitely removed from the action.  That area was worth a visit, but not to stay.  One of the best aspects of the Majestic is its 10th floor roof top bar, pool and lounge.  We started most nights with bottles of Cava and enjoyed the view.  Just amazing.  Breakfast was included with our room and it was awesome.  The selections were endless and staff most friendly.",5,2016,11,14
11,Majestic Hotel is really majestic!,"We have stayed at the Majestic Hotel in Barcelona, Spain twice and find that
it really is a five-star hotel.   It offers everything one could want.   The location
is very good, the breakfast is fantastic, the staff is very accommodating, the
rooms are lovely, and it is just a great all-around hotel.   We highly recommend
the Majestic to help in making a visit to Barcelona  great.",5,2016,11,14
11,"High crime, bad information.","Many crimes occur in this hotel and the staff do nothing to prevent them.

My mother came to stay at this five star hotel for a visit. To be clear, I was not staying at the hotel, but my mother was, for an entire week. While we were having a drink in the bar (not in lobby, not outside, in the private bar of the hotel, more than 100 feet inside and around the corner) two thieves working together stole my laptop bag with passport, wallet with all money and cards, and house keys.)  One thief distracted me by pushing me from the side while the other stole my bag off my lap.

This kind of theft happens in Barcelona. What I am disappointed by is the hotel's response. One staff member was kind and came to the police station to help on her own time. The other staff and management of the hotel said it happens all the time, and they caught it on videotape but wouldn't do anything about it. Needless to say, they didn't comp anything - not even the bar bill. One might suspect they were in on it.

On top of this, at other times we were given misinformation. Examples: we were told we didn't need printed versions of the Articket (you do need printed copies when you try to use it) and told stores were open when they were not.

Two stars because the decor is quite nice and location is ideal, but leave absolutely everything locked in the safe in your room even when you are INSIDE the hotel. And if you get robbed, don't expect the hotel to help!",2,2016,11,14

We enjoyed our stat and would come back to the hotel for sure.",5,2016,11,10
11,Everything you want in a hotel,"The Majestic was the choice of my tour group, Travel Wright, which specializes in architecture tours, which is always carefully chooses their hotels. This was a great choice on their part. The room and bath were very comfortable, quiet, nicely appointed and very clean. The manager introduced himself to me the first day there and greeted me by name each morning when he saw me. The staff had noted I was having a birthday during my stay (I assume from my passport), and the manager acknowledge it at breakfast that morning and with a bottle of cava in my room that night. The bar and breakfast options were numerous, though the chef in charge of omelettes most mornings needed more training. The hotel is at a great location for exploring Gaudi and other architectural treasures, dining, accessing much of the city on foot and shopping.",5,2016,11,07

Hotel is elegantly appointed and very conveniently located for high-end shopping and visits to the Gaudi houses. Area seems to be very safe.

11,Comfy ,"Our room in this hotel just feels so indulgent. The beds are comfy, the furniture is cute, and the bathroom is simply indulgent. 

We saw a few different rooms and they aren't all quite as amazing, but they all have the same elegant and upscale vibe and lush beds. 

This is the perfect nest to come home to in between big days of touring. The breakfast is also to die for.

Don't forget to go to the roof bar, the view is spectacular!",4,2016,10,29
11,"Rooftop Bar - beautiful setting, expensive","Had a couple of evening drinks here duing our week in Barcelona (and spent a morning relaxing by the rooftop pool). The setting is beautiful with lovely views of the city. Drinks good, but very pricey - a glass of wine approximately €14 and a small bottle of water €7-8. One of us ordered a mocktail which was actually a perrier water with some chopped up fruit and mint - €14.... However, this is an exclusive hotel and I guess you pay for the view.....",4,2016,10,29
11,A bit of a disappointment for a LWH,"I am here for my honeymoon with my husband. We just arrived today from Madrid where we stayed at the Only You Boutique Hotel (4 Stars), which was great! We were really looking forward to our trip to Barcelona and staying at a LWH, Majestic Hotel. Since this is our honeymoon, I wanted to stay at a nice hotel. The hotel exterior, location and lobby are really nice and the service is great. However, we are really disappointed in the size and quality of the room. I am from the US and I stayed at my fair share of hotels in the US and around the world. The room quality is similar to that of a 3 stars hotel. The closets, floors, curtains, side tables are very worn. Unfortunately as much as I want to love it here - I just can't based because of the accommodation. For this quality and at this price, I regretted not staying somewhere else. 👎🏻",3,2016,10,26
11,"Lovely Hotel on Barcelona's ""5th Avenue""","We enjoyed our 3 night stay at the Majestic, a grand old hotel located right in the upscale shopping district.  The rooms were very nice and spacious (we booked through Amex and received an upgraded room, so ""regular"" rooms could be smaller), with the only quibble being the limited lighting for the shower/tub.  The beds were comfortable, the HVAC worked well and there were ample power outlets.
The breakfast buffet (included with our reservation) was excellent - with a very wide variety of food for every taste, including omelets cooked to order.
Staff was friendly and efficient and virtually everyone spoke excellent English.
The rooms are not cheap - I believe with taxes and other fees, we paid roughly $500 per night (including a Saturday night stay), but I do not think this was unreasonable given the location and the quality of the hotel.
I would happily stay here again.",4,2016,10,25
11,No value for money,"We took the standard (deluxe) rooms on October 16. The staff at the reception was arrogant, the rooms were tiny and not indulging at all as expected from a five stars hotel and considering the price we paid, every other item costs extra. Needless to say that visiting the spa is not included. The only plus was the location. Luckily, we enjoyed Barcelona despite the disappointing hotel.",2,2016,10,25

11,"A highly recommended, memorable experience!","This gorgeous hotel flawlessly radiates charm, class and comfort.  I was immediately captivated by a pleasant ambient fragrance throughout the hotel, which only added to the aura of serene elegance.  I was then delighted to find that pleasing scent in the luxury toiletries that were provided in our room.  But enough about the olfactory experience … every aspect of our stay was “five star”.  First, we could not help but admire all the original art, sculptures, and ceramics throughout ... even in our room, which in itself was an inviting, comfortable retreat.  The staff, with no exceptions, was professional, attentive and multi-lingual.  We enjoyed the extraordinary buffet breakfast each morning and the breathtaking rooftop terrace in the evening.

11,True 5-Star Hospitality and Facilities in Barcelona,"My wife, 10 year old son and I stayed at this exceptional hotel in July, 2016. We had a 1 bedroom suite facing the city, which had a pull-out sofabed for our son in the living room. The king bed, mattress and bedding was luxurious, and made for the perfect sleep, and double glazed windows provided a silent retreat from the street below. Our check-in was smooth, in the private lounge off to the side, and we were greeted and had our luggage brought up to the room by always available and friendly bell staff. We couldn't believe the incredible amenities, such as turn down service that had chocolates along with a artistic postcard and perfume left on our pillows. The breakfast service was one of our favorite parts of the stay, with panne tomate, exquisite coffee, pastries and fresh fruit. I used the gym every day, and while small it had all the equipment one would need.WE only went to the roof top bar/sok pool once as we were touring the rest of the time, but the views from up there make it worth visiting. The location is second to none, you are right in the thick of the best shoppes and sights, and are right in between Casa Batlo and :La Pedrera. The bathrooms are floor to ceiling marble with a tub and shower in the one bedroom suites. The price is pretty steep but I firmly believe you get what you pay for, adn would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2016,10,20

Great position for sightseeing around the city and shopping. Room was nice and also nice bathroom but could have been bigger.  Staff helpful but think the price we paid was too high .,4,2016,10,19
11,"Arrogant staff, but besides a nice hotel","From the outside the hotel looks very impressive. The check-in, however, was rather slow and the staff seemed incompetent. The Deluxe City View Room we stayed in was quite small, but tastefully decorated with high quality furniture and had an extensive terrace. Fortunately, it was very quiet. The marble bathroom was also of very high quality and exceptionally clean. Although the pool was extremely small, it looked quite nice. Unfortunately, it was not heated, so we couldn’t use it during our stay. The gym, which is located in the basement, was equipped with plenty of high quality machines which made working out a nice experience. The food at the bar was overpriced and we had to wait very long to receive the menus and to place our orders with the waiters. In contrast, service at the rooftop bar was a lot better. The breakfast buffet was very extensive with a Spanish touch and amazing quality. Additionally, there was a live cooking station, which I really liked. You find an extensive review and more pictures on traveluxblog.com!",4,2016,10,19
11,Great location,"Stayed at Deluxe Passeig del Gracia: clean and modern room with a lot of light. There is a Nespresso machine in the room and a bottle of complimentary water. The one negative experience was the bed, way too saggy. 
The roof bar with pool has a beautiful view over the city, you can even see the sea.
The concierges recommended great restaurants which were all walking distance from the hotel.",4,2016,10,18
11,Lovely hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights in October, 2016 and picked the hotel for its location.  We also prefer traditional hotels with charm, rather than large, modern impersonal ones.  The welcome we received from the lovely staff on arrival was second to none.  The room was spacious and the bed very comfortable.  Given that we were right on the main road, the room was surprisingly quiet.  My only small complaint was having to pay for Nespresso capsules after the first day - a small cost when we were already paying quite a lot for our room.  The staff could not have been better; especially the concierge, who recommended plenty of delicious restaurants and never got it wrong.  The other facilities were excellent, including the wonderful rooftop bar with its stunning views of the city, the gym with earphones and a lovely shower, plenty of towels and bathrobes etc.  We would definitely go back there and very much enjoyed our stay.",5,2016,10,17
11,Expensive but pretty nice,"Room was ok, not very large. The bed seemed old, not very padded. The bathroom was very nice with a wonderful rainfall shower head and nice toiletry products. The included breakfast was good with a wide range of hot and cold items. The staff at breakfast was especially nice and helpful. The hotel is very attractive and in a good location. Beautiful view from rooftop bar / pool area. One negative - the hallways are sprayed everyday with a very strong perfume scent.. It was way too strong .",4,2016,10,16
11,Wrong location and a bit dated.,"On first appearance the hotel is good, pleasant foyer and reception next to their comfortable bar area, all clean and good quality.  Unfortunately the food at the bar is very ordinary which is why it is always empty and lacks atmosphere.  The whole hotel is a bit of a rabbit warren with lifts and passageways everywhere.  The rooms and the restaurant are very well maintained but a bit dated.  The breakfast is good and the rooftop is a great area with a good view but very busy if the weather is good, it's very small so you may not get a spot.  Good gymnasium.  All of the staff are very efficient but not really friendly.  The rooms are quite small with a good bathroom and have free wifi, mini bar, in room safe etc unfortunately no English TV channel apart from news. The location may be ok for business but not any good for tourists, next time we would stay around the port area or old city.  If your a tourist I would not recommend this location.",4,2016,10,16
11,Loved This Hotel!,"We enjoyed our visit in Barcelona. We loved this city! We stayed at this hotel for 5 days and we loved it. Our room was very spacious, clean and beds were very comfy.  Staff was excellent and buffet breakfast on the 10th flr was awesome. We went up to the rooftop restaurant which was very nice but didn't stay cuz it was full.  The hotel is on a really upscale area .. much like Rodeo Dr in Beverly Hills. We were very glad our travel agent chose this hotel. We will stay here again on our future visits. 
I forgot my wallet at the Mango store across the street and one of the ladies at their concierge was kind enough to pick it up and send it to our hotel in Granada. I was so pleased mango store personnel kept it .. well.. except the cash in it - thankfully I didn't carry a lot of cash.. but nonetheless I was happy to get back my driver's license and bunch of credit cards. 
That's how excellent customer service at Majestic Hotel was. Highly recommended!  ",5,2016,10,16
11,Outstanding,"Outstanding hotel in center of Barca. Could walk to all sites. Surrounded by good Catalan restaurants. Good recommendations from concierges who were very helpful. We had a suite on top floor--roomy and quiet. Outstanding breakfast. Two enjoyable bars on bottom and 10th floor. Highest recommendation

My only complaint is not about hotel but about Barca government. Took 30 minutes to get a taxi when raining. No Uber. Taxi are similar to medieval guilds. Doesn't convenience of visitors to Barca government matter?  Or are taxi drivers running the city?",5,2016,10,14
11,Pre-cruise stay in Barcelona,"When we arrived at the hotel at 3pm it was very busy trying to get checked in.  It was a cramped room I think a special check in area for cruise companies.  We were told that our room was not ready as they had a group late check out.  We were advised if we didn't mind a disabled room (which apparently is bigger) we could have the room now so we opted for this.  Our shock was when we arrived at our Deluxe Double room it was an interior room.  The only small window looked out to a wall so made the room incredibly dark, we had to have the light on the whole time.  The wardrobe was a small waist high closet so we were not able to hang any off our cruise dresses or jackets.  They had to remain in our suitcase for the 2 nights we stayed there!  We were very disappointed.  We tried the roof top bar and meet some American visitors who had arrived that morning on a night flight and were still waiting for their room at 6pm which is shocking.  The next day the rooftop was closed for a wedding so we never had the opportunity to sit out and admire the wonderful views.  The only good thing about this hotel is the location.  We didn't spend much time in our room as it was like a cupboard!  Disappointing as you expect more for a room sold as deluxe.  I would suggest a superior room if you plan to stay here as you may get a window! ",2,2016,10,14
11,Wonderful stay!,"Loved our stay at the Majestic Hotel.  First, the rooftop bar/restaurant is a great place to end your day.  The views are incredible.  Second, the breakfast buffet was one of the best I've ever had.  And the staff at this hotel were all very helpful.  We were given an inside room with our window overlooking other rooms, so it was a bit dark.  The room itself was beautiful and very comfortable but I was a little apprehensive when I first saw it due to it not facing the street.  But this room was quiet and made for a great night's sleep, so it was a good trade-off.  Hotel is in a great location.  I would stay here again.",5,2016,10,12
11,"Location, Location, Location!- Excellence All Around!","Loved our first trip to Barcelona! Hotel located within walking distance to EVERYTHING!  We were steps from Gaudi's La Pedrera and Casa Batllo.  Plenty of high end shops and great restaurants.  The Barcelona City Tour bus stop was steps in either direction of the hotel which allows you to easily see the entire city including, Parc Guell and La Sagrada Familia.  The room with a private terrace was spacious, clean, and a relaxing retreat for 4 days!  The rooftop bar/restaurant has amazing views of the city and also has the swimming pool!  Loved hanging out during breaks throughout the day and ending each night under the stars with a beverage!  There is a spa in the hotel, but we didn't use it.  It also has a great bar and sitting area in the lobby.  We enjoyed a wonderful buffet breakfast each morning with made to order omelets, many fruits, yogurts, breads, and pastries.  I really didn't want to leave!  The staff were helpful and everyone was multi-lingual, which certainly helped us English only speaking folks!  The doorman hailed cabs for us and directed them to our location.  All we had to do was ""enjoy the ride""!  We will definitely return here when we visit this beautiful walking city again! ",5,2016,10,11
11,"Good, with some cons","All at all good, clean, service was nice, but, for example, while staying there for 3 nights they closed kitchen at night 
because some of the staff was sick. 

They have private SPA, which works very well too. Restaurant on rooftop has nice view, would suggest to go there in the evening. ",5,2016,10,10
11,Better Impossible,"great Hotel, with great location and great Service/ Staff
super roof terrace with views on all Barcelona, from La Sagrada Familia to Montjuic
rooms super nice with a lot of pampering - would recommend without any doubt",5,2016,10,10
11,Two Bedroom Apartment,"We had a 2 bed, 2 bath apartment owned and operated by the Majestic and it was superb! It is located across the street from the hotel, but you have full use of the hotel facilities. The apartment had a huge living/dining area and a full kitchen. There was good closet space and our unit had a lovely balcony in the rear of the building.

This is an excellent choice for a family or two couples. We were three persons and it was perfect for us.",5,2016,10,09
11,It use to be allright,"this place its becoming popular lately thst become so crowded it doesnt worth staying here anymore!
Long waiting time for checked in and check out.. not great customer care from doorman.. it used to be better few years ago
bcn was so much too offer now than this clasic place
when you think you are famous you lose your soul",1,2016,10,05
11,Hotel Majestic Barcelona,"Had a wonderful stay at the Majestic Hotel in Barcelona for our company sales conference.  Very well organised, polite staff and beautiful hotel.  They even went out of their way to cater for my wheat intolerance.  Only negative I would say is the staff of the 10th floor bar and pool area.  It was like we were not in the same hotel.  The staff were arrogant and rude.  Maybe a good idea for management to teach them how to treat customers, as they did ruin it a little for all the other staff in the hotel who went out of their way to make you feel welcome and to assist you.  Overall though was a very good venue in the heart of Barcelona.",4,2016,10,04
11,Stylish,"Excellent service all round including the restaurants from this fine hotel set in a central location surrounded by boutique shopping. 
I was upgraded to a luxury room with a street view but this was let down by just having a standard double bed which was OK for me but not if my wife was with me . Do check the size of bed if you want a Queen or King when booking .
Otherwise the room was beautiful but smallish  and the bathroom huge with bathtub and shower .
Superb breakfast with a massive choice of fruits ,meat etc etc .
Sorry I cant score the hotel a 5 but the size of the bed is important .

Gluten free ,no problem !",4,2016,10,04
11,Excellent Hotel,"This is an exceptional hotel in a fantastic location in the  center of Barcelona. The rooms with a view of the city are wonderful. The service and attention to detail are great.  The hotel is located right in the center of excellent shopping, attractions and of course dining.",5,2016,10,03
11,Stunning!,"Absolutely perfect place to stay when in Barcelona! Tremendous service and detail. The location is ideal for shopping, attractions  and of course food. The rooms with a city view are beautiful and comfortable. Thank you!",5,2016,10,03
11,Classy and comfortable,"This grand old hotel has been a much-loved fixture on the Barcelona hotel scene for decades and deservedly so. The Majestic oozes charm, class, and comfort in an understated way. Staff are attentive but never pushy, the rooms hark back to a more elegant age yet offer all the contemporary facilities today's business travelers demand. 
The location is also fantastic and I am grateful that my busy schedule of meetings meant I couldn't be tempted into the array of luxury boutiques nearby.",5,2016,10,03
11,Best experience ,"The best hotel and service in Barcelona..  
The veiw is very nice all staff was helpful ..
It's best choice for a family to stay ..
The breakfast is perfect ..they help us a lot to show us the best way to visit the city ... recommended ",5,2016,09,30
11,Wonderful Hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel in a great location. The rooms and baths were lovely....spacious and nicely appointed. Concierge service was really patient and helpful. We had breakfast included and it was also plentiful and delicious. 
Rooftop bar and lounge is a must see. 
I would definitely go there again. ",5,2016,09,30
11,Very nice rooms and friendly staff!,"The hotel has very nice rooms with reasonable price, nice location, just don't order Benedict eggs. The worst of all after I had in different hotels around the world. The eggs had rugged surface and the bottom was made of toast cut into rounded shape. That was kind of ridiculous...",4,2016,09,28
11,Great Service and accomidations,"The hotel was perfect for our large group of clients.  From breakfast on the first floor to the beautiful rooftop bar, the hotel shined.  Everyone raved.

A shout out must go to Christina at the front desk for truly caring about our experience.  She recommended a great seaside day trip to Sitges, which my wife and I loved.  Thank you, Christina!",4,2016,09,26
11,Friendly staff,"We Booked this hotel beceause it has a Great location. In THE middel of THE center, close to THE sagrada, THE house of Gaudí and Also THE beach. THE rooms are not big, but they are Nice and clean. THE majestic hotel has a Great sunroof terrace that comes alone With a Great view over THE city and Sea view. The breakfast is Also really Nice ! This hotel has a Great and very very friendly staff !!!!",5,2016,09,25
11,Excellent Hotel,"It was a romantic experience. They have a pleasant breakfast buffet. The concierge are very much knowledgeable of the city attractions, food, sightseeing...etc. One of the most beautiful hotels I have ever been into. The staff service is excellent and cooperative.",5,2016,09,24
11,Top notch all the way around,"This hotel has beautiful rooftop views of Barcelona from every vantage point. I enjoyed yoga every morning starting at 8am on the roof while the city was still sleeping. There is a bar and small pool there too.

When you walk into the hotel, you're immediately greeted with their custom aromatherapy scent and your travel stresses just melt away. It is situated near great, high end shopping and quality restaurants.

The rooms are beautiful and have every amenity needed (except a toothbrush & toothpaste - I know this because I forgot mine).

The daily breakfast is delicious and has hot and cold options. 

First class all the way!",5,2016,09,23
11,elegant with excellent service.,"this is a top tier hotel, quite expensive. as others have said the service is excellent and  the rooms are very spacious. comfy bed. 
breakfast is included. 
drinks on top of the hotel as show in the picture above is delightful.
2 things I did not like: * the shower is in the tub...a huge tub which is difficult for people who are not so spry to get in and out of. 
*my room (239) was on the part of the second floor which required  negotiating steps that did not have a hand rail",5,2016,09,22
11,Great location and staff,"We were walking distance of all the sights we wanted to see. We took a tour to Montserrat one day which was well worth it - a 45 minute ride away from the city. 
We had breakfast at Cafe Lola one block away both mornings as we are not big breakfast eaters and hotel breakfast is pricey",5,2016,09,21
11,"Excellent, majestic, a home from home","This is an excellent hotel with high, consistent level of service. From the moment you are greeted arriving from the airport to the check out, the experience was delightful. The staff are pleasant and friendly, a lot of young interns who make a good vibe with smiles and positive attitude. Very experienced and caring staff. Excellent house keeping with rooms cleaned twice a day as should be. A great rooftop terrace with great people working there making you feel welcome and warm. I was visiting with my mother for a family occasion, and had to work once all day at the terrace with my laptop while she was enjoying the sun and the pool. It was like a great summer residence in the sun with a sea view. Particularly thanks to Patricia at the roof terrace, who made everyone feel welcome all days I stayed there, and to Carlos at the front desk who made us feel like want to come there again. The only comment of concern was that during peak hours the service at the terrace was a bit of a long wait and had some issues but I believe it was an one off occasion due to a private party in the pool area and too many people present on the terrace. Location is perfect, close to everything and right in the middle of beautiful Barcelona city centre. Rooms are great but it could be noisy at times if you open the window at night, not that it was an issue for me though.",5,2016,09,21
11,Excellent Hotel and Service,"Top notch service from beginning to end.  I was upgraded to a junior suite on check-in, and was able to check in early, which was greatly appreciated after flying in on a redeye from New York.  I usually stay at 5 star properties around the world, and Majestic Hotel and Spa ranks at the top.  The gym is adequate, although it lacks general sauna and spa facilities.  There are facilities on the top floor, but are for private use with a fee.  The restaurant is excellent and service is 5 star.  The room was extremely spacious with excellent views of Paseo de Gracia.  The location as noted by other reviewers cannot be beat.  Walking distance to most sites, and others are easily accessible by subway or taxi.  ",5,2016,09,20
11,Elegant classic in the heart of the city,"Beautiful, and beautifully maintained, class hotel in the heart of the city. Excellent service from the concierge, the reception staff, and the dining room staff at breakfast. We opted for the executive suite which was quite spacious with a king bed, two chairs plus a sofa, and lots of room to lounge. The station for the train to/from the airport is only a block away so it was not necessary to cab it. Barcelona is home to a number of excellent hotels, both new and old, but this is one of the best.",5,2016,09,19
11,Barcelona!,"Amazing long weekend in Barcelona ... gaudi everywhere, park guell, historic churches, FC Barcelona game, tappas, tappas, tappas, paella, spanish wines, @spoonikbcn, la boqueria market, @bocagrande, picasso seat, opera in streets, exhausted!!!",5,2016,09,16
11,Bdarden,We stayed several times in June and July. The service is always impeccable.  The concierge service has always been responsive and friendly. The same for the bell staff. The rooms have been updated recently and are well-appointed. We didn't eat at the hotel this visit other than breakfast-which is a great spread. Never miss the pool/bar on top of the Majestic. There is no better place to soak in the city with a cocktail. We love this place and will obviously be back!,5,2016,09,14
11,Best Hotel in Barcelona,"The hotel is located in the centre of the city and shopping area. It's the best location in Barcelona. The room is nice and clean, the service is really good. If you find the hotel is near shopping area and restaurant, it's really a good option. ",5,2016,09,14
11,Luxury and comfort in the heart of Barcelona,"Stayed here for 2 nights with our family of 4 (2 adjacent rooms). Great quality rooms, Perfect pool area on the top floor with a stunning view of Barcelona and this hotel is on the Passeig de Gracia, THE shopping street of Barcelona and within walking distance of the Ramblas. Perfect for getting around Barcelona by foot and doing some great shopping, dining and sightseeing.",5,2016,09,13
11,Grand Hotel on Barcelona's Equivalent of 5th Avenue,"We were only here one night, but we really enjoyed staying in such a lovely hotel. The lobby, rooms and rooftop bar were all splendid! And we liked walking in the area, plenty of shops and restaurants and galleries, along with two of Gaudi's most important works (Casa Battlo and El Pedregal) within blocks. We also took advantage of the convenient subway and popped down to La Barceloneta for a hip, seaside dinner.",5,2016,09,12
11,Luxury and comfort in central Barcelona - but beware double-booking of the pool!!,"We spent the weekend in Barcelona with our two young children aged 6 and 8.  We had selected the Majestic for its central location and rooftop swimming pool - something for the children at the end of a long day of sightseeing, whilst we parents enjoyed an early evening cocktail at the rooftop bar.  The rooms at the hotel are stunning, comfortable beds, light and airy, and very clean.  We had 2 double rooms with a private connecting corridor and it was a great arrangement.
However, the pool was a very big disappointment.  When we returned to the hotel on Saturday afternoon at 17.00 to take the children swimming and have a drink (it was a beautiful 30C day) we were told that the pool and rooftop bar had been booked by a business for a private party starting at 18.00 and we could not use it at all.  As hotel guests, we had paid to use that facility and it was one of the main reasons we had chosen the hotel - the pool is prominently featured on all of the Majestic's publicity and is a real unique point of difference. Furthermore, we had not been made aware of the closure of the facility when we booked and checked in: the hotel's only communication was a small notice by the elevators saying there was a private party at the rooftop bar that evening with no mention of times.  When we expressed our disappointment at reception, we were advised we could go to a sister hotel about 30 minutes' walk away (or they would pay for a taxi) and use their pool.  We were also offered a bottle of mineral water and some chocolates by the Duty Manager.  
Facilities that are integral to the identity of a luxury hotel and a major part of its offer should be available to the guests as advertised, especially on a busy Saturday in September. This was just not good enough.",4,2016,09,12
11,Wonderful Stay,"My fiancé and I recently stayed at the Majestic Hotel during our trip to Spain and ended up staying with them an extra night because we loved the hotel so much.  The rooms are great and the breakfast was one of the highlights of our trip.  We spent most afternoons at the roof top pool before heading out for dinner.  Also the whole staff is amazing, the concierge was super helpful in booking our day trip to Penedes for wine tasting and in recommending placing to visit around the city.  We cannot wait to come back for another visit.",5,2016,09,11
11,Great spot,"We stayed for a couple of nights with our kids aged 9 and 11. The hotel is great and well located. We had a 2 bed family serviced apartment with 2 very generous bathrooms and kitchen and a very sizeable living room. We were just across the road from the main hotel and used the roof top pool both evenings before walking out for dinner. The pool area was very nice, chilled music, great views and the kids enjoyed the pool. A great central bolt hole, with very comfortable accommodation and comfy beds. Would definitely recommend.",5,2016,09,08
11,Roof TOP bar....,"A nice, 'secret' yet popular spot to have a couple of drinks with best company.
Surprisingly we got a lounge table and the staffmembers know how to treat you....
Asking for a gin tonic, they suggested us one of the finest gin's you could possibly think of. An exploding red-fruit-flavoured gin paired with sparkling tonic. Under an almost mysterious sunset we ate a completely new 'translation' of the ultimate classic Club sandwich. In the air were the feel-good-beats by the DJ who made it complete.....",5,2016,09,07
11,Class hotel,"We visited this hotel in august on our travel around Costa Brava, following TripAdvisor tips. It was aa very good decision, as this hotel has everything. Brilliant location, brilliantly stocked breakfast, very pleasant and helpful staff and a rooftop bar with a cooling pool. The rooms require some minor refurbishment.",4,2016,09,07
11,"Elegant.....world class service, restaurants and location!","Majestic Hotel is a fantastic spot to land pre-cruise, post cruise, or simply on your first visit to Barcelona. It is in a premium location, just a few minutes walk to Gaudi's Casa Botllo as well as the Le Pedrera. Rooms were modern and luxurious, complete with Nespresso style machine for morning coffee. Service was top notch, with polite and courteous staff at checkin, checkout, and throughout the visit. Definitely not the most economical option, a family of four would likely require two rooms. The breakfast restaurant is incredible (Cava!) and the rooftop lounge/pool offers a fantastic panoramic view with a chique, chill vibe.",5,2016,09,07
11,Loved it! ,"Beautiful hotel and just a stunning city! The hotel room was small but comfortable and served us well. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Valet underground parking. The location was central to all tourist sights. The roof top bar had great views of the city, although the pool was a little awkwardly placed in the middle of the roof bar! Would go back again",4,2016,09,07
11,Even better than last time,"We stayed here a couple of years ago, and liked it so much then we decided to try the residence apartments across the street from the main hotel, and it was GREAT!  We booked a two bedroom apartment, and before we arrived we called to make sure we had a street view.  We were informed that we did not, but for an additional 45 euros we could upgrade, which we did.  Best decision ever...we were given the 4 bedroom penthouse, with a huge balcony overlooking the Paseo de Gracia. Totally modern, clean and at least 1,200 square feet.  All staff very helpful, especially Tim (concierge) and Andranik (porter).  This has ruined me for a regular hotel room...",5,2016,09,06
11,A Hotel I would return to ..,"Stayed here early in September. Very convenient and centrally located. Check in was welcoming and efficient and the room was pleasant and very clean with comfortable bed and good bed linen with a well equipped bathroom and good air conditioning on a hot day. Double glazed so no noise. 

The roof top bar is definitely the star of the show though don't expect to really swim - the pool is really just for cooling off. But good views and fun music. Drinks Rather expensive though. 

Breakfast is fabulous - everything you can think of and more and good service. 

Wifi was good - tv a lot of channels including many Arabic ones but no sports which disappointed my husband as he wanted to catch up on the US tennis open. But we didn't come to Barcelona to watch tv.. 

Would return. ",4,2016,09,06
11,A Major Disappointment,"The staff, to a person, couldn't have been better.  The service, all around, was excellent.  The location is superior. But, the room, based on the price we paid, was an insult to our judgement.  The room was tiny with minimal luxury appointments.  It was very over rated in comparison to other facilities in their category.  We tried for a room change but nothing else was available. Since we arrived late in the afternoon I guess all the good rooms had been assigned to others and, because we were pre-paid, the hotel had nothing to lose by giving us an inferior room. If we hadn't been prepaid we would have gone to a competitor.

I couldn't recommend this hotel to anyone except at a 3 Star price but certainly not in the category we paid for.  If we had been assigned a decent room I would probably feel very different.",2,2016,09,04
11,Magical Majestic,"From the moment we arrived for our pre-cruise stay, the Majestic Hotel staff made our first trip to Barcelona a memorable 3 days. The hotel is located in the perfect area for Barcelona exploring but honestly, you could totally enjoy just relaxing at this beautiful amazing hotel. We loved the gorgeous roof-top bar and lounge as well as the five-star accommodations. Our room was absolutely beautiful with a view of the Passieg de Gracia, with no noise because the windows are so thick they could block out most anything. I can't wait to return to Barcelona later next year and there is no way that I would stay anywhere else but the Majestic. ",5,2016,09,03
11,A hotel with a return rate ,"Royal suite is brand new nice and clean with a great view and butler has really good service get everything I requested done in seconds with his help makes my journey a lot easier 
Great location walking distance to every where specially shopping is right next door ",5,2016,09,01
11,Rooftop Bar,"Didn't stay here, but had a great night poolside at the rooftop bar which was recommended to us by the restaurant we had eaten at up the road.   Fantastic views, lively and great drinks.    It just had the perfect ambiance and Barcelona feel for a catchup with an old friend!",5,2016,09,01
11,Majestically awful,"5* hotel. Best in Barcelona we were told.  Having been privileged to stay in some of the finest hotels in the world this one seriously lets you down. Apart from the check in staff and the concierge who were lovely!  Our 'deluxe' double room was smaller than a Premier Inn and apart from fancy toiletries in the bathroom could have been one.  We asked specifically for a room with a bath and got a shower only.  The 'swimming pool' on the roof had space for perhaps three adults and there were four au beds, always occupied. The rest of the roof terrace comprised of slouchy chairs but people were turned away due to lack of space.  19€ for gin and tonic.  Breakfast cost 37€ each (16€ for a fired eg....). We were punted to a separate check in area perhaps because we had prebooked?  Don't know.  Great hotel if you are from an oil producing nation and flash the cash but for mere mortals I would say don't bother.",1,2016,09,01
11,Nice hotel in BCN Downtown,"This historic hotel in central Barcelona,located in Paseo de Gracia is well worth it...But it needs a room refurbishment.The breakfast buffet is nice and staff are helpful and friendly.But room rates are bit high for the room you get...",4,2016,08,30
11,Dark rooms,"We were disappointed with our room which looked out into a gloomy central light well. We were expecting a courtyard view as it was a superior class room but it was depressing and we had to keep the curtains drawn all the time as the room was very overlooked and lacked privacy. The hotel was full so we were unable to change rooms.
The roof top pool area is pleasant.
The staff were helpful  and generally spoke good English and tolerated our attempts at Spanish with good humour.
Breakfast was excellent and served in a lovely room. 
The location is central for sight seeing in Barcelona.",3,2016,08,30
11,Would stay here again!,"Beautiful hotel in the heart of shopping, dining and sight-seeing. Friendly staff who allowed us a very early check-in- much appreciated!

Rooms are very clean, comfortable, well appointed and equipped with a fantastic waterfall and hand held shower head. Beds were heavenly!

Rooftop pool and deck with fantastic city views and great cocktail service. Would highly recommend this property and hope to book here again when we return to Barcelona.",5,2016,08,28
11,Great Location and Rooftop Views!,"We stayed at the Majestic Hotel before heading off on a Mediterranean cruise, wish we could have stayed an extra day. The Majestic is a true European luxury hotel. The rooms were comfortable with traditional styling. The bathroom and amenities were very nice. Room service provided a high quality meal. Be sure to visit the rooftop for views of the city, even the Sagrada Familia at a distance.

The location is central to the town with easy access to the hop on hop off bus and walking distance to landmarks. Since we only had a short time there, the bellman helped us get a taxi and gave instructions to the driver to send us on a quick tour of the Sagrada Familia so we were able to get some awesome photos.",5,2016,08,27
11,One of our favorite hotels...ever!,"Our family of 5 arrived in Barcelona for our last city in Spain (following visits to Madrid and Seville) and what a way to end our trip! We had a family suite (two rooms with a lock-off entrance) which gave us plenty of space to spread out.  The staff was wonderful (think Four Seasons caliber but nicer and friendlier).  The rooms were luxurious, huge for European standards and great dining options.  We had lunch on the rooftop when we first arrived and it was a great first introduction to the city. The lunch food was excellent.  We also enjoyed the morning brunch each day before long day of sightseeing and it was one of the best we've had with something for everyone.  Our only disappointment was the rooftop pool is actually quite small and don't expect to swim.  The rooftop is geared towards people wanting to ""be seen"", not for sunbathers or family time.  If you enjoy a luxury hotel in a great location, look no further, you will not be disappointed.",5,2016,08,27
11,Lovely Excellent City Hotel,"The location is perfect, in the middle  of historic Barcelona, with upscale shopping and toney restaurants all around.  Fine dining, a first class bar,  
professional service, a beautifully appointed breakfast room with a buffet and eggs and more on order, a scenic rooftop bar and a ritzy spa, what more do you need.
This is a
Luxury hotel that caters to everything one wishes during their stay.",5,2016,08,27
11,Wonderful hotel,"Friendly staff. Everyone speaks English. Super comfortable beds. The breakfast is amazing. We spent one afternoon and evening at the pool with the kids, eating and drinking. Fantastic location. Room for 4 with kids worked perfectly. We recommend to anyone else visiting Barcelona with their family ",5,2016,08,27
11,Weekend away ,"This hotel is fantastic in terms of location , it's close to Gaudi's house , not far from the tube network and away but not far  from the main bustling shopping street . The staff were very welcoming and the room is well equipped and comfortable . I did think it was a little mean to charge for the tea and coffees in the room , considering that you do quite a bit for the pleasure of staying there . There are many nice cafes around though where you can get a bite to eat and we really enjoyed the chocolate shop/ cafe close to Gaudi's house . 

The rooftop bar is pleasant and worth a visit . There is a pool up there but it is very small and I didn't see many people use it . 

The staff are all very professional and do a good job .",4,2016,08,25
11,Fabulous short break !,"I wanted to spend some time with my daughter before she heads off to Australia for 12 months, so booked this hotel through Amex fine Hotels and Resorts package. Although the Hotel was full and we were unable to benefit from a room upgrade, both rooms were excellent and I can't fault any of the staff who were incredibly helpful and friendly. The rooftop bar is a particular attraction and we enjoyed our visits both in the day and in the evening. 
The location is second to none, whether it's for shopping, visiting many of the attractions the city has to offer or for some wonderful restaurants, all within a short walking distance.
We shall certainly return....!",5,2016,08,24
11,Great hotel in heart of Barcalona,"We're a family of 4 (2 boys of 13 and 11) and we've been coming to this hotel in Barcelona for 4 years.   In short, it's superbly located, has wonderful service and great rooms.   The buffet breakfast is insanely good! Staff go out of their way to make things easy (eg we booked a rental car to go to the Costa Brava and it was driven to the hotel and we were able to drop it back out front in return.).  Also has one of the nicest rooftop bars in Barca!!!",5,2016,08,24
11,Cocktails ,Fabulous place for after dinner drinks with an amazing view of the city! Very comfy chill vibe with soft music and attentive waiters. I had the cucumber martini and loved it...very fresh and delicious. I will definitely be back another time. ,5,2016,08,23
11,Beautiful spacious rooms,"We had three days in Barcelona with our three children, ages 8-15.  We picked the Majestic because of the roof top pool, and in addition we got fantastic service, a nice breakfast, and huge (for Europe) rooms. The roof restaurant/bar is great for a cocktail after a day of touring and offers snacks and fantastic views.  The pool is pretty small, but my children loved having it. The rooms were such a surprise. We put three children in one room - two twin beds and a pull-out couch - and they had plenty of space to spread out. My daughter worked at the desk, my son took the arm chair in the corner and my other daughter stretched out in the little ""walk-in"" closet! The bathroom was large too, so they weren't stepping on each other. In addition, the concierge ordered all of our tickets in advance (Sagrada Familia, Gaudi house, Picasso museum), so we didn't need to wait in any long ticket lines. Plus, it's about two blocks to the Gaudi houses, so it's easy to walk and great shopping along the way.  Overall, the hotel helped make the trip easier for everyone.",5,2016,08,22
11,Well appointed property with great views!,"The Majestic Hotel is a beautiful hotel (historic charm) with a gracious and well informed staff. We hung out on the roof top, planned site seeing trips and purchased the tickets with concierge. before bouncing off to enjoy a leisure afternoon in the city.  What I especially appreciate is that upon check-in Carlos took what could have been a trip spoiler (momentarily anyway) and turned it into a trip highlight.  Let me explain:

We arrived in Barcelona mid morning (overnight flight) and had a lunch reservation at a nearby restaurant.  I had requested an early check-in to refresh prior to lunch.  However, when we arrived at hotel we were informed that there were no rooms in our category available for check in until much later.  Carlos upon hearing this swooped in and gave us a room in a different category that was immediately available.  We made it to lunch without offending ourselves or others with disheveled looks and we stayed in a room that had one of the sweetest views of the Paseo de Garcia. It was a great day thanks to Majestic's comfort plus the amazingly knowledgeable and helpful staff.",4,2016,08,21
11,Excellent hotel and the best location,"Stayed here in July with my family. Great hotel, great staff and the perfect location.  I would recommend this hotel and would stay here again on my next trip to Barcelona. After this hotel we moved to Hotel Arts by the beach, and what a bad experience we had there. We should have never left the Hotel Majestic.",5,2016,08,21
11,Weekend break before med cruise,"Arrived at this grand hotel and was made to feel very welcome by the doorman he took our luggage and guided us through to reception where we were promptly checked in. We had booked a 2 bedroom apartment which is over the road from the hotel. The rooms were well furnished and very large with two bedrooms and two bathrooms, a spacious lounge and a well equipped kitchen. Loved having a nespresso machine(just like being at home). We got to use all the facilities at the hotel. I have to commend them on the most amazing breakfast buffet they had everything you could think of and more. The omelettes were excellent along with all the fruit and pastries. We also had champagne on the roof terrace which has the most amazing views over the beautiful skyline of Barcelona. The pool is kinda small and busy but when you have something beautiful everyone wants to be there I guess. All the staff are a credit and very friendly. Would always return which says it all as we love luxury and the Majestic certainly offered it.",5,2016,08,19
11,Amazing,"I experienced the terrace of the majestic this summer and this is one of the best place to be in Barcelona. The food was amazing and the service second to none. The fantastic attention to details, the surrendering, the kindness of the team and their product knowledge made it an outstanding experience.",5,2016,08,19
11,One night only ,"We arrived Barcelona to attend the final football match between Barcelona Vs Sevilla and we decide to sleepover at Majestic Hotel & Spa. The hotel located in very luxury streets who's looking for shopping. Many brands are close to the hotel such as, Hermes, Gucci, Chanel and LV and more of bards. 
The hotel arrange for us the transportation to the Barcelona stadium and the driver was waiting for us until the match finished. The services are amazing and the room services are available and ready for any call. The location of the hotel are far a way from the airport only by 15 minutes by taxi. ",5,2016,08,18
11,5 star hotel located in the heart of Barcelona,The Majestic Hotel is a full service 5 star hotel. The service was impeccable and the staff was very friendly. They helped us with dinner reservations and how to get around the city.  The hotel has an incredible roof top pool and cafe. From the roof you can see the whole city and the ocean.,5,2016,08,14
11,Hospitality and kindness is their standard ,Marvellous staff everywhere. Special attention for Mr Carlos the concierge and Mr Said of the breakfast staff. A pearl as hotel in the center of Barcelona. Best shopping area. Next we will be back no doubt. And for the Sunday brunch with Moet & Chandon who unfortunately doesn't take place in August. Perfect price quality ratio. ,5,2016,08,14
11,"Fantastic location, excellent facility and amazing service","We stayed at this hotel in June 2016. I was a little nervous to book a hotel that was not one of the names that we recognise easily. My Amex travel agent insisted I book this hotel, and I am glad I listened. My fears were short-lived once I arrived at the Majestic. We landed in the morning and got to the airport by about 9 AM. Normal check-in is obviously at 3 PM. But when we got there, the hotel offered us use of a smaller room to shower/change and use until we got our rooms. That was very thoughtful and kind of them to do, especially after our long overseas flight.
We had an amazing suite that was absolutely flawless. Very well appointed, large, and beautifully maintained. Turn-down service was wonderful. Bathrooms beautifully maintained. The service of the staff from every department was absolutely outstanding. They tried to anticipate your needs and fulfil them with a fabulous attitude. 
The breakfast buffet was sumptuous. Lots of choices of food and excellent wait staff made very breakfast an enjoyable event. The hotel is located across the street from Casa Battlo and caddy corner from Casa Milo. If you are a Gaudi aficionado,  this is a wonderful location to visit both these places. Sagrada Familia is a short taxi ride away. This location was very central and it was easy for us to get to all the attractions very easily. 
A fabulous hotel in a magical city! I will be back soon for another visit.",5,2016,08,10
11,Unforgetable Experience,"I was hesitant to book this hotel for my first visit to Barcelona. And after I stayed there, I can't thank enough everyone recommended the place. The location was amazing with easy access. The staff were so helpfull and friendly. The roof terrace and the view was breath taking day and night.",4,2016,08,06
11,If money isn't option chose the Majestic ,"From the moment you arrive you know you picked the right hotel.  The staff is great, meals even better and the room was spectacular (735).  It is large, modern, clean and has a huge balcony with city views and partial mountain views.  You will be pleased!!!",5,2016,08,06
11,Wonderful end to our holidays,"The Majestic is in a wonderful location of Barcelona close to super shops, restaurants and Gaudi sight seeing. ```the staff are welcoming, friendly and efficient. Rooms are spacious and luxurious and the Spa was super. Marvellous rooftop restaurant and pool area.",5,2016,08,06
11,Majestic Start to a wonderful vacation.....,"The Majestic is located on a very beautiful boulevard with a view of great architecture
and great shops... Walking distance to the old area. The service was incredible and the General Manager - Pascal Billard -helped to make this a wonderful celebration weekend... Loved the rooftop bar with a view of Barcelona...cannot wait to go back and stay again....",5,2016,08,05
11,Great hotel and service,"Modern, clean luxury rooms in a great location.  Doormen are excellent they look like a combination of security guard, doorman and models.

A great experience when a bartender quickly packaged up some crushed ice for a bump on my daughters head; he was truely concerned.

Front desk helped get tickets for La Sagrada Familia = a huge help since that was the goal of our trip and we had limited time.

We would stay here again.",5,2016,08,04
11,"Great location, nice hotel, nice bars, wonderful breakfast","We stayed here for 3 nights before getting on a cruise.  Very nice hotel in a very  upscale area.  The room was not large but bigger then the room we just had in Paris.  The bathroom was very nice.  Tiny little not quite balcony.  The concierge was excellent with mapping out places  and getting us tickets to Sagrada Familia- although we did find out when we were there we had to have tickets to up which you cannot buy once your inside.  It would have been nice if we had been given a choice of tickets.  We did order ice and cream for coffee one evening, which never came.  No big deal we were tired.  The room has a Nepresso machine but only a few capsules that they do not refill.  Big Nepresso store across the street that you can get capsules for so very much cheaper.  We went to the lobby bar one evening.  Excellent drinks.  We went up to the roof bar our last night very nice and great drinks.  The breakfast came with our room- was wonderful!  Huge selection.  Champagne  - too bad we were off being tourists as I would have loved to sit and have mimosas.   Staff in the hotel, bars and restaurants were excellent.  Down the street is a Torres wine bar and restaurant which was great. On off bus is right across the street.  Only real problem we were right next to the elevator- which was not noisy at all but the family in the room across the hall thought it was ok for their kids to play in that area which then made it very noisy.  Why do parents think this is ok?  I don't want to hear your kids.  This was not the hotels fault.",5,2016,08,04
11,Amazing and very pleasing experience,"We had a one night stay over at this hotel on Sunday 24th July prior to picking up a cruise ship on the Monday.  Firstly the facts - it's 5 star, its in a prime location in the city, easily accessible and just a short walk away from the famous Las Ramblas.  That alone is a great reason to choose this hotel - but it has so much more to offer than location.  It actually has that rare thing that so many city hotels say they offer but fail to deliver on - it has staff that are friendly, helpful, keen to please and above all else who genuinely smile at you.  The check in staff were helpful and attentive, the bar staff were amazing - I asked for a particular drink in the bar - the bar staff went all over the hotel to find what I wanted and they delivered on it.  Nothing was too much trouble.  We also ate in the roof top bar in the evening and again we received consistently helpful service, also at breakfast the following morning with the quality of the food being on a par with the level of the service.  Our room was a junior suite which again surpassed expectations in terms of cleanliness, comfort and facilities.  As it was the first night of our hotel we were tired and ready for some comfort.  The bed was absolute heaven as was the shower and towels.  The room was very clean and has all modern facilities,  We only had a 24 hour whistle stop stay but we were so impressed with every aspect of this hotel we will go back as soon as we can.  I highly recommend this if you want comfort and luxury together with excellent and welcoming service.",5,2016,08,04
11,"Very nice hotel, in a very posh area","We stayed for a week at the Majestic, which is centrally located in the Eixemple area of Barcelona.  The area itself reminded me of 5th Avenue in New York City, and I'd probably preferred something in a different area of the City.  Having said that, the hotel was comfortable and well-appointed, and the staff were extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful, whether it was in recommending a beach day getaway or a nearby restaurant.  The rooftop offered great views of the City, which made it a nice place to unwind and have a drink.  I'd recommend the Majestic, but would likely stay in a different hotel in the future.",4,2016,08,03
11,Beautiful hotel in Barcelona ,"The hotel was beautiful, and the staff was very attentive. The breakfast was excellent, and the rooms were luxurious. The concierge was very helpful in providing us with dinner reservations and assisting us with directions. The location was difficult to beat. 

Only complaint was the gym, which was small, and the TV's on the equipment did not work well. ",4,2016,08,03
11,Review of the rooftop bar at the majestic,We visited 3 rooftop bars in the Eixample neighborhood/ Passage de Garcia. I rate this second best after the Mandarin Oriental. The views are magnificent and the searing very comfortable. Drinks were fine but tapas underwhelming. But we were here for the overall ambiance and it was great.,5,2016,08,03
11,"Nice hotel, but over priced ","Nice hotel, excellent location in a luxury street with lots of high end boutiques. However, the price considered high in comparison to the room size. Similar 5 star hotels can easily be found with cheaper rate in good areas also. The breakfast costs € 37 per person. The staff quite helpful and friendly. The hotel has two concerns; the room size which small for two persons and the services which you may need to call for replenishing the missing items such as the cotton buds, coffee and milk.",3,2016,08,02
11,Great place to stay in Barcelona!,"The Majestic was one of our favorite hotels! After staying 5 nights, our traveling group all commented that we couldn't wait to return.  The hotel is well located, has a signature scent that delighted (and I'm usually one to get headaches from perfumes), and had extremely comfortable rooms.  The concierge staff were so helpful and made our stay in Barcelona even more enjoyable than we imagined.",5,2016,07,31
11,Rooftop not up to expectations,"Disappointing visit to the hotel majestic rooftop. 

The space itself is not bad, nice sofas and a bit of shade. The spa/pool is more like a bath than a pool. But what I found really disappointing were the juices we took. They were simply terrible. Served with no ice, too much water and few fruit, tasteless and expensive. 

All rooftop bars are expensive and tourist oriented, but the bar offer is, usually, good.

Music was good.

There are many rooftops in Barcelona better than this one. Choose another.",3,2016,07,30
11,Perfect Location,Really good location if you want to see all the nice buildings in Passeig de Gracia in barcelona. Close to Casa Batlló and Diagonal. Nice Terrace with good views until the sea. The relation price/qualitie good.,4,2016,07,27
11,Nice place,"This is a expensive hotel in Barcelona, but it is nice. Room are big and have more than everything you need. On the top roof have a nice bar. The situation is amazing in the center of barcelona near everything",4,2016,07,26
11,"Excellent hotel, Fernando Castillo made our trip!","Dear Señor Castillo,

I wanted to write to say an additional thank you for your kind and considerate response to my concerns after the first day of our stay at the Hotel Majestic. Everything you arranged to make our stay more comfortable was beyond the call of duty and extremely generous on your part. The suite was beautiful, the in room breakfast was much more comfortable for us, the wine and cheese were delicious and the luxury transport to the airport was very much appreciated ( a taxi would have been fine!).

My son and I thank you and your staff for making our stay truly exceptional. I hope you and your hotel have continued success. 

Warmly,

11,Fabulous,"Fabulous hotel with luxurious rooms. The staff were very helpful and friendly. We went there for our honeymoon and it was awesome. The breakfast was very good. The location of this hotel is perfect, walking distance to many of the attractions in barcelona",5,2016,07,26
11,Fabulous Break,"We stayed at the Majestic Hotel and Spa Apartments which were fantastic! The staff were brilliant and well and truly went the extra mile to sort anything out for you. Guest Relations in particular were fabulous.
The apartment was stunning and more than we had expected. We went for our ten year anniversary and were greeted with a bottle of bubbles and card from the hotel.
The children were given teddies on arrival and were treated very well. The food at the hotel of which we only tried breakfast and lunch were amazing and well worth trying. I can't praise the hotel and apartments enough and will definitely be returning soon.",5,2016,07,25
11,awesome!,"The majestic hotel is a great hotel!  They have thought of everything! We stayed in a room with two twin beds which is a luxury in Europe!  Unlike most European hotels, the room was large and spacious, as was the bathroom.  Well worth it!!",5,2016,07,25
11,7 perfect nights,"We stayed for 7 nights early July. We booked a Jr Suite to accommodate our ten year old son on a pullout sofa. It was all set up and ready for him to use. Everyday we had complimentary water, beautiful turndown with Atelier Cologne fragrances (nice touch!!), we received a bottle of wine, cupcakes, the extras never appeared to stop.
Our booking included the breakfast - a wonderful buffet spread, just enough to fill us each morning before touring. Best was the fruit, Iberian ham and fixings for pan tomato!

Check in and check out were a breeze and concierge was very helpful with airport transfers for our departure for Ibiza. 

Location is fabulous on Passeig de Gracia, surrounded by shopping, restaurants, coffee shops and two Gaudi houses!

Would definitely recommend and stay again.",5,2016,07,24
11,Best Located Hotel in Balcelona,"Everything is great about the Hotel.
The service ,staff ,food. There is a residence also which has large well appointed apartments.
The hotel has a lovely roof top bar ,its a must go!
Its has old charm to it which was nice.
It wins for its location hands down,located on passaige de garcia,with in walking distance of Batilo,Peredera and all the beautiful shopping of Barcelona.next street. 
the La rambalas with its cafes * bar is on the e
All in all Great !!",4,2016,07,24
11,Great location,"Stayed here for a couple of nights, and the rooms are spacious, and the roof top pool is excellent for a nice drink after a long day strolling around this great city. 
The staff offer great insight into the city, and provided some great tip on local restaurant. 
I would definitely stay here again.",4,2016,07,24
11,Excellent hotel,"This is an excellent hotel. Well located and with helpful polite staff. An excellent art collection. They were happy to mind some art purchases my wife had made pending her return to the hotel after two weeks. Food was of high quality.

There are a couple of minor things though: our first room had a fairly industrial outlook but this is a matter of the design and location. Nonetheless they did move us to one with a better outlook. The spectacular pool bar at one point seemed to be populated by people who were not staying at the hotel as evidenced by their street clothes and airport trolley bags, which made getting a place difficult. It really should be reserved for guests who after all are paying up to stay there.

Apart from that, no issues and would stay again.",5,2016,07,24
11,Majestic in every sense of the word,"Fabulous location on Passeig de Graca.  A traditional hotel restored to its former glory but with every mod con. We went for a slightly larger and more expensive room overlooking the Passeig. Worth every penny. ALL staff friendly and helpful. Outstanding service. Excellent but unobtrusive security in foyer.  Lovely lighter meals and coffees served in extensive lounge area. The hidden gem is the rooftop pool with a modernista style mural behind it together with views across Barcelona including La Sagrada Famiglia .  Drinks and snacks served during day. Outstanding dinner options and wines at night.
Can't recommend it highly enough",5,2016,07,23
11,"Awesome hotel, great location, great service ","As said, awesome hotel, great location, great service. Love this hotel, we stayed in a 2 room Suite and it was excellent. 

Shopping and sightseeing at your doorstep. Great food. Great roof top bar with views. 

10/10

Will stay here again when next in Barcelona. ",5,2016,07,22
11,Best rooftop view in the center,"Great live DJ ambient music
Great cocktails and an amazing view of the principal attractions of Barcelona.. 
Sagrada Familia, botello house / Gaudi .. Etc. 

I was there by night, so only appreciate some of the view.. Next time I'll go to see the sunset. ",5,2016,07,22
11,Best service of any hotel anywhere,"My wife and I spent a week here for her birthday.  From the moment we checked in to the moment we left nothing but fantastic service.  

When checked in I asked if we could have a room with a balcony.  The person helping us said one moment and said he would need to upgrade our room but it shouldn't be a problem.  I asked what is the cost he said nothing because you booked through American Express.  

Our room was nice and big and had a perfect balcony for sitting and drinking Cava while we planned our evenings.

We ordered room service a few times and they always came right away (even if it was just for a bucket of ice for the previously mentioned bottles of Cava.)

Breakfast was fantastic way to start every morning and the rooftop pool bar was a great way to reenergize in the early evening.",5,2016,07,20
11,Great hotel but..........,"Truly a superbly equipped hotel: walking down the corridors alone speaks volumes for its magnificence. One does pay top dollar, as one would expect at such a prestigious establishment: I have deducted a star for each of these two factors. Firstly, the room I was allocated (before asking for a change) was grim; dark and if curtain was opened you looked directly onto some ugly monstrosity. The hotel might say that I was paying at the lowest level but the room charge for three nights, excl breakfast, was over €1000. Secondly, and I suppose related, you are given two 'inclusive' coffee capsules for use in the coffee machine; not two per day but two per stay. So if I did three separate one night reservations I would have had six! One could purchase more. At that room rate any additional payment for a cup of coffee seems bizarre. Great hotel but at these prices it will be judged by very high standards.",3,2016,07,17
11,Fantastic view on the terrace,"We had some drinks on the terrace. Perfect view of Barcelona! You can see all landmarks (sagrada familia , montjuic, puerto olimpico, etc) Expect to pay between 6 and 15 euros per drink. They also served very nice tapas. The view is worth it. Next time in Barcelona go to this terrace. ",4,2016,07,17
11,Luxury in the heart of Barcelona,"The Majestic Hotel and Spa is a fantastic hotel located in the heart of Barcelona. 

It's perfect location will give you close access to Gaudi architecture, high end shopping and a wonderful variety of dining options. 

The hotel staff are friendly and detailed and the rooms are spacious. 

I highly recommend the breakfast buffet which is excellent! There you will find a wide variety of breakfast items in a great setting. 

",5,2016,07,15
11,Lovely for a visit or a drink ,"I didn't stay there but we heard amazing things so decided to visit there for a drink in the roof top bar. 
It was breath taking . Very expensive but worth it. The views were incredible and the drinks were lovely but strong - I had a sangria . We ordered a cheese board as well but it never came . The staff are lovely though and very friendly . Good location too and lovely for a treat! ",5,2016,07,14
11,"Fantastic location, great hotel","Travelled with family; wife and three kids. Stayed at the Residences part of the Majestic Hotel. 2 bedroom apartment with kitchen, two bathrooms and crucially, washing machine and dryer. Apartments are across the street from the hotel but this was not a problem. The location is priceless. Right in the hub of things, on Passeig de Gracia, in the middle of the shopping strip. Behind is Las Ramblas, a bit touristy but worth a look. The Majestic is between the Casa Mila and Casa Batlo, both Gaudi masterpieces. 10 minute walk to the Placa de Catalunya and thereafter the gateway to the Gothic Quarter. Will definitely be back.",5,2016,07,13
11,Outstanding service! Excellent location!,A beautiful hotel in a great location! We especially enjoyed the rooftop lounge a night for drinks and beautiful views. Our room was first class and breakfast was a magnificent array of quality food. We really didn't want to leave and for sure will return!,5,2016,07,13
11,Excellent ,"Excellent location high class you do not need to have any extra items every thing is there including electricity exchange plug , actual spa nice beautiful staff very welcoming 
Ohhh it was a nice experience i will repeat it again with the family",5,2016,07,13
11,The worst hotel I have ever stayed in.,"I travel more than 10 times a year I tried a lot of hotel but worst than this I never seen i am wondering how this hotel got 5 star and the hotel offering 1star service I booked a room with view but they gave me inside view and I payed for outside so it was given to other guest and they said we are not able to give you even when I showed them a confrontation for city view second thing when I checked out I was going to cruise ship I checked out at 11:30 and my and my family luggage came at 2:15!!!!!! When I asked a lady in the guest service what's happening she start to answer in a very rude way like she said its late what can I do for you but in very bad language I was upset and this hotel is excellent for screwing the holiday.
I will never visit this hotel again and I advice to just skip it Even when I informed my supplier he said I won't recommend this hotel because of their lies sent a confirmation letter and changes the promise bad service and no any respect to the people ",1,2016,07,12
11,Shame I was there for such a short time,"This is a jewel in this City. Its very expensive, but then nothing in the center is cheap. Attention to detail is almost their expertise. It is not the biggest hotel, it lies on a busy road, full of designer shops etc. But they really do look after you, and its genuine, not the fake attention that you get in some hotels.",5,2016,07,11
11,"Beautiful hotel, great location ","My daughter and I spent three nights here a few weeks ago. It was a lovely experience in all respects. The location is convenient to everything and right next door to very posh shops. Barcelona is my new favorite city!

The only criticism I have are the employees at the concierge desk. I didn't find them overly helpful and one tried to talk me into a 300€ private (four hour) tour. I checked with my sister who lived in England for several years, and traveled extensively throughout Europe, including Barcelona. She said that cost was ridiculous, so we passed. We booked a group tour at the Sagrada Familia and a free walking tour of the Gothic Quarter and both were great. Check Trip Advisor for recommendations!",5,2016,07,11
11,"Perfect location, fabulous service and lovely room","First rate hotel with impeccable service. The room was small yet comfortable, modern yet warm with a luxurious and large bathroom.  Fabulous rooftop bar with small pool area. Staff were all friendly and helpful.  Definitely would stay here again.",5,2016,07,10
11,Great location ,Stayed here for business and was able to visit many local restaurants within walking distance or a short cab ride.  Rooftop bar view of the city and the Sagrada Familia are amazing.  Very kind staff and good size room for a city hotel. Definitely would stay again on a future visit.,4,2016,07,10
11,Incredible Staff,"Just spent 4 nights at the Majestic Hotel in Barcelona. Although we didn't spend much time at the hotel because we were always out enjoying the beautiful city, it was a great spot to come back to. We had the junior suite overlooking the main road. Two small balconies to view everyone passing by, yet the room was very quiet when the doors were closed. Very comfortable bed and there was plenty of room throughput from living area to bathroom. Great location. Right between two of Guadi's famous spots and only a couple stops by metro to Gothic area (quick walk and ride). Highlight was the staff. They are very attentive and very professional. The folks at the desk or the doormen always had the right answer or a quick solution for whatever we needed. The only thing I found odd was to be charged 6€ for a small generic bottle of water from the mini bar. They provide two even smaller ones each night at turn down, but you may want to grab your own. The welcome bottle of wine and Spanish ham were a huge hit. Great way to kick off a vacation. A bottle of cava also found its way to our room on my wife's birthday. Another great treat. Thank you, Majestic Staff!",5,2016,07,09
11,A special place!,"We stayed in room #125 which is a beautiful, comfortable suite with wonderful views down the main boulevard from the balcony. We took advantage of breakfast in the main dining room everyday, which has more than enough options to please anyone, as well as a lunch in the lobby bar, and dinner in the formal dining room. All were very good! The roof top bar offers stunning views of the city lights at night, and is a must see....The staff couldn't have been more gracious and accommodating. After a disappointing hotel experience in London, this was truly a welcomed surprise for our first, but certainly not last, visit to this exciting city!!",5,2016,07,07
11,"Fabulous Hotel, Fantastic Spa!","The Majestic Hotel is a fantastic hotel and their Spa services are wonderful also.  The hotel is in the best location to walk to all that Barcelona has to offer.  The front desk staff, concierge, really everyone offers A+ service.  The rooftop terrace is the best in Barcelona (and I have seen many).  We will return!",5,2016,07,07
11,Luxury and well worth it,"Our first trip to Barcelona and what a welcome we received. The hotel staff are extremely hospitable, helpful and this is what hospitality should be--professional, welcoming and understated. The restaurant is superb, both for lunch and breakfast, the rooftop is spectacular. We will definitely return. What memories!",5,2016,07,06
11,Treated like Royalty,"After traveling around Europe and having a disappointing hotel experience in London we were so lucky to land at the Majestic Hotel for 4 nights.  The customer service started before we checked in with emails confirming rooms and airport pick-ups. It is obvious that the staff are trained to provide impeccable service. No matter what your request, they were on it! The room service was fabulous and there was never a language problem on the phone when ordering for fussy children. Every staff member spoke impeccable English. The breakfast was wonderful and you never had to wait for coffee or look around for someone. They were there! The concierge team pointed us in the right direction for every meal and booked all our tours. We loved the roof top deck for drinks, and even the small pool provided hours of fun for the kids. It was REFRESHING to see such a wonderful hotel run so perfectly! Bravo Majestic! We will be back!",5,2016,07,05
11,"Great view from the terrace, not so great rooms","Stayed for 5 nights, wonderful staff and great terrace view of the city. Very small rooms with almost no cross ventilation. View from my 2nd floor room was not great. Also, size of the room was small - 2 suitcases and you couldn't walk! Very clean and wonderful lobby to walk around",3,2016,07,03
11,Faultless.,"We were there for just one night. The hotel is very pricey but completely faultless. Our room was elegant, spacious and extremely well appointed. The common areas, bars, lounges, etc are inviting and very user friendly. The location is excellent. The staff were extremely obliging. I would certainly go back there.",5,2016,07,03
11,"Nice hotel, excellent location","Very nice hotel on a beautiful, centrally located street. Walking distance to virtually everything--great restaurants, excellent shopping and sites (La Sagrada Familia). Our room was a junior suite and was large enough for my husband, 13 year old daughter and me. Our daughter had a pull out couch. The bathroom is huge and there were 3 closets in the room. The room had a Nespresso-type coffee maker and they give you only 2 pods for the maker but if you request more during your stay they will charge you,I found that interesting. The buffet breakfast was excellent and large. The rooftop bar is amazing with views of the whole city. Drinks are very pricey, but that's the cost when you get such an amazing setting. Staff at the rooftop bar was spirited and outgoing making the experience very enjoyable. Hotel is updated and very clean",4,2016,07,02
11,Had a fab time!,"Loved this hotel! It was stylish, comfortable, clean. all the things you want from a hotel! 
Check in was easy and simple!
Room as I stated was lovely! 
Staff were great, happy to help! 
The little touches this hotel has are the reasons I'm writing an excellent report. As I don't give out many! The concierge who was extremely helpful, the way they hold the door for you whenever they see you coming past. The taxi order that we got so quickly the room service delivered with a smile. It was all very very nice. And will return. Bar alone is an amazing city and has so much to see that it didn't even matter where we stayed so this hotel just topped our already amazing stay. !! 😀 
",5,2016,07,01
11,"Loved, Loved Loved this Hotel","From the minute we were greeted at the Majestic we knew it was something special.  We were pleasantly surprised by the size of the room and the bathroom.  Many European hotels are tiny so we were prepared.  The bed was so comfortable and a welcomed relief after walking miles every day.  We spoke with the concierge a few times and got many great recommendations.  Although we didn't swim in the pool we did go up a few times to look at the city, just beautiful up there.  Very happening place around the pool, would have liked to have had a drink there but for 20 Euros a drink we decided against it.  The hotel is so conveniently located.  There was a pleasant fragrance throughout the hotel and it seemed to match the fragranced products in the room.  I am still using the body lotion and the smell brings back such nice memories of my new favorite hotel.  Can't wait to go back!!!",5,2016,06,30
11,Respect and comfort,"The hotel is well located in this area. My wife and I came to Barcelona as tourists and the hotel is a great place in terms of location, cleanliness, good service and quiet rooms is of specifications, excellent breakfast, and I think its only downside is the pool is too small and more like bathtub",4,2016,06,28
11,Amazing stay,"Majestic hotel is in the heart of Barcelona, with a walking distance to the metro, plaza de catalunya, and to the shopping centers. The staff of the hotel is very friendly, rooms are comfortable and clean. On the rooftop you can find spa and open terrace for a drinks. ",5,2016,06,28
11,Great hotel & rooftop lounge is amazing!,"Stayed June 2016. Upon arrival, my room was upgraded to a room with a brighter view (according to Stephanie who checked us in). We valet parked. Concierge was very helpful in getting us a reservation @ a great restaurant for authentic paella. Rooftop lounge was amazing. Music was great, not too loud so that you could have a conversation.  View of the city at sunset was spectacular. Would not hesitate to stay there again. All staff were extremely helpful and the location was amazing! Not close to the beach, but close to great shopping areas (on the main street for all high end designer shops) and only a few blocks from Avinguda Diagonal. Would definitely stay here again!",5,2016,06,28
11,One of the great European hotels.,"Once there were many hotels in Europe like the Majestic. Proud and exclusive where staff and management all sing off the same song sheet in a symphony of attention and good manners. Now there are more hotels run by people with poor management skills, slovenly staff and a general lack of care and responsibility to the guest.
Be prepared to step back in time at the Majestic because that's what it's like. Two years ago we stayed at their apartments across the Paseo de Gracia and this time, for a shorter stay, at the main hotel. It is a well oiled machine devoted to its guests. Everything from reception to rooms to restaurants and the magnificent rooftop cocktail bar where a blisteringly dry martini is even more enjoyable with the sweep of this superb city and the Sagrada Familia as a backdrop. This hotel is really a place you'll be very sorry to leave. I was.",5,2016,06,28
11,Excellent service,"Stayed one night with two more nights coming in a few days 
Polite and very efficient arrival and departure experience. 
Rooms, although pretty small compared to what I am used to, but are well decorated and the mattress very comfortable. 
Was on 2nd floor so could here quite a lot of street noises which, living on a small island in the Indian Ocean, was a little disturbing. 
Looking forward to our re-visit in a few days and being able to try out their roof top bar and the sights of Barcelona 
Cheers ",5,2016,06,27
11,Could not be better! Fantastic!,"Good service. Nice rooftop bar with a very nice view and pool. Delicious food. Perfect location in the best street of Barcelona!
We were celebrating our 1st year anniversary and this hotel made it memorable.
I recommend!",5,2016,06,27
11,Great location! Beautiful historic hotel in the heart of Barcelona.,"I was very pleased to experience this beautiful property.
A classic beauty. Great location, stunning roof top area to enjoy.
Walking distance to everything! Las Ramblas about 15 min walk.
The staff was fabulous, everyone speaks English, they are well trained in hospitality. Great choice in Barcelona.",4,2016,06,25
11,Charming full service hotel,"Stayed one night before a cruise and found this hotel to be a great venue. Staff were extremely helpful and the hotel and the rooms are well appointed. The location is great, within easy walking distance of many Gaudi buildings, old town and the Ramblas. Sorry we did not have the opportunity to use the spa and fitness centre.",5,2016,06,23
11,Good Value in a Great Neighborhood,"The elegant Majestic is well situated, well staffed and well priced. The concierge staff is knowledgeable and helpful. My room was spacious, the bathroom large, the bed comfortable, the room quiet and dark for a good night's sleep. Though nicely decorated, the room's furniture - wooden desk, coffee table and side tables - were quite scuffed and worn, hence four stars, not five. I do recommend a stay at the Majestic as a good value in a great neighborhood, especially when adding on the superb breakfast buffet, one of the most generous and delicious of its kind.",4,2016,06,22
11,Majestic Hotel & Spa Lives up to its namesake!,"It was our first time to Barcelona with two young boys and we were blown away at the renovation of the property, the cleanliness, the courteous staff and the impeccable five star class this hotel exudes. 

We were lucky enough to get a room upgrade with American Express Business Platinum and that made our stay even more enjoyable with two separate rooms.

The location is perfect and walking distance to many wonderful things in this beautiful city. If we ever go back, I can assure you, we will stay at the Majestic!

On a side note: my 5-year-old son accidentally left a very small stuffed animal in his bed and we thought it was lost in the laundry forever. He was heartbroken. However, not 12 hours later did we receive a knock at the door with a very clean stuffed animal. Not sure how they did it, but they found it!

Stay at the Majestic, you will not regret it one bit!",5,2016,06,22
11,Excellent place in beautiful city ,"Great location, nice modern room, beautiful terrace and excellent service! Perfect as it is, nothing to improve, nothing to complain. Convenient for shopping and tourism, business and holidays, with family and for solo travelers. Thank you!",5,2016,06,21
11,Fabulous Property in great location!,"I met with my clients earlier this week. They had a wonderful stay in Barcelona at The Majestic hotel. They absolutely loved the hotel and was one of their favorites on their three week tour of Spain. All properties where they stayed were from the Virtuoso portfolio. However, the Majestic stood out as one of the properties they loved. So much so they are thinking of returning next March/April for a week.

Summary of comments:

•         Roof top terrace exceptional with tremendous views over Barcelona. They really appreciated the dinning setting the first evening that you so kindly had arranged. My client  noted that everything was attention to details.
•         The accommodation was superb with excellent service
•         All the hotel staff they met were extremely friendly and helpful
•         Breakfast was excellent  and what they loved was the way the staff came up to you at breakfast to chat and were so friendly wishing you a lovely day.
•         Concierge team, excellent. In fact they commented that every member of staff from the door man to senior management were ALL excellent and always had a smile and were so accommodating and friendly.

Excellent location!!!! 

If you want a luxury property in the heart of Barcelona, this is where you most definitely need to stay.

My sincere thanks to all the staff. You have been wonderful to deal with. Please convey to the entire HOTEL TEAM, my sincere thanks for making my valued clients stay a most memorable occasion. Your team need to ALL be congratulated for their standard of excellence!

CONGRATULATIONS to The Hotel Majestic and Spa Barcelona!!!!! Suburb in every category!!!!!!",5,2016,06,21
11,Best luxury hotel ever... personalized service and well trained staff.,Our booking agent found this hotel for us. We stayed 4 nights. The Majestic is close to every major spot in the heart of Barcelona. Attentive concierge service always available to take care of every single need (thanks Angel). Very professional and knowledgeable room service staff... seriously it felt like being in a fine dinning restaurant with a sommelier who recommended the best local Ribera wine to pair with our food order... sampled the wine in our room and tempered it to perfection (I consider myself a little connaiseur just for the record... thanks Emilio for serving us the best in-room meals and for checking the weather for us). The porters really fast and straighforward when checking out (thanks Javi)... we will definitely be back over and over.,5,2016,06,21
11,Fabulous Majestic!,This was our second stay at this wonderful hotel. Many beautiful renovations had been made since our first stay.  The location is perfect and our rooms were quiet. The English speaking staff were friendly and accommodating at all times. We especially enjoyed the music in the bar. ,5,2016,06,21
11,Great location for shopping,"Great location for high end shopping. Gucci, D&G, LV are all located on the same street. 1 street down from la Rambla de Cataluna. Child friendly.
The service is very personalized in this hotel. I am very impressed. Stands up to its 5 stars.
Rooftop at night is very in. Great music and drinks. 
I will definitely return and recommend to travelers.",5,2016,06,18
11,Great Location,"You walk out of your hotel and are really within walking distance to most places you would want to see in Barcelona. The concierge desk does an excellent job, they are very knowledgeable and very helpful.",4,2016,06,15
11,Great place!,"The hotel is great. I stayed in a room with a balcony which was really nice and also used the Spa for a massage. The Spa was under construction but they accommodated us with a quiet room on another floor for a massage which had champagne along with it. 

The rooftop pool and bar has an awesome view of the majority of the city. The hotel is located in a great shopping area and the restaurants around the hotel are amazing (we got recommendations from the hotel). 

The staff is extremely nice and helpful - they helped us to set up dinners along with tours which were close by.

I highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to be in the heart of the city - it's about 20-30 minutes walking from the beach or a quick cab ride (which are always outside).",5,2016,06,14
11,Lovely place to hang your hat for a few days in Barcelona,"My husband, daughter, and I stayed here for 3-nights in the apartments which were absolutely perfect. The kitchen was stocked with staples such a small amounts of olive oil, salt & pepper, espresso machine, dish soap, washer & dryer with a bit of detergent, and bottles of water. There is a bogada a few blocks away to pick up some fruit and eggs. We had access to all the hotel amenities including the spa. My husband and I both had the 90-minute ""relaxation"" massage upon our arrival. My massage therapist was Cecelia who was wonderful. The showers were hot, the bathrooms were clean with lovely towels, and the beds were comfortable. Our sheets were a bit scratchy but over all I have no complaints. The location is in the heart of high end shops and tappas restaurants. Very easy to walk to many places. The pool was a bit small but nice for a dip.  I'd definitely stay here again.",5,2016,06,14
11,Wow breakfast nice balconies and old world service ,"Service was lovely here… We stayed as a family and we loved this old world hotel. 

Best location, bar none. Great walkable shopping. Better than las rambles. But right near that too. 

You will be totally jealous if you don't get the breakfast with your room rate. Coffee could be taken up a notch, however-it's watery and not so good. 

You can walk to casa battlo (mansion designed by gaudi) and il padrone. 

Fun rooftop pool but not really for families /swimming. It's small. And the cafe up there is cool but service is sorely lacking in the sense that you have to waive to get your check, waive waiters down etc. but we think everyone in the city wanted to be there for pre dinner drinks because of the beautiful view overlooking the city and the feeling.  

Had a problem with the rooftop cafe. Ordered the Caesar salad w lobster. I don't eat meat. Lots of Caesar dressing so I couldn't quite see it .....and I'm eating and eating and it turned out to be chicken. No problem--sometimes there is a language barrier and tho I had clearly stated (albeit I English) that I don't eat meat when I ordered, I was fine to forgive the initial mistake! 

However, my same salad came back just w a lot more Caesar dressing and a sampling of lobster on the side so I began eating that too… Only to find out the chicken pieces concealed in the additional dressing…This second time was  unacceptable --the whole thing made me sick and late for our waiting guide-- and  our meal should have been comped. But it was not and I simply asked not to pay for my entree. Later the manager sent up a lovely fruit bowl. 

Service excellent otherwise. Nice old style hotel. Loved our room w two balconies on paseo De Gracia. 

We had some lovely drinks in the downstairs bar w great piano music. 

Thank you Hotel majestic. Would not hesitate to stay again. ",5,2016,06,13
11,So Many Things To Love!,"My husband and I stayed for 2 nights pre- cruise. We got into the city early (overnight flight) and unfortunately the hotel was booked so we couldn't check in early. We did check our bags and walk around the area (this hotel is in a great location) and have a drink on the rooftop terrace (fantastic views!). We then ventured into the hotel bar across from the check-in area. When the server realized we had been traveling all night and were hungry and waiting for our room, he immediately prepared a quiet table for us to eat - and then brought us every menu they had (including room service!) and went about suggesting items we might like - he was wonderful and the food was delicious! When our room still wasn't ready at the standard time the staff sent us back up to the rooftop terrace and comped drinks and a dessert for us - very nice gesture. Even though our room took longer than expected we still had a good first impression.

The standard rooms are small, but the bathroom is nice and quite large for a standard room. The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet.

The breakfast was delicious and the selection was fabulous. Again, service was perfect! 

We would definitely stay here again - easy walk to Gothic area and lots of shopping nearby. Also a minute walk (literally) to La Pedrera and Casa Batllo.",5,2016,06,12
11,Great hotel in heart of Barcelona,"Spent three nights at the Majestic.  Highlights were the breakfast and great rooftop bar.  If you are staying at the Majestic, make sure you grab a drink at dusk on the rooftop bar, great view of the city.  Average size rooms and service was always helpful and friendly.",5,2016,06,11
11,Gorgeous Hotel with great location!,"So happy with this hotel! The Hotel is beautiful and well staffed. Our spacious room was lovely. The floor to ceiling marble bathroom was my favorite part! We had massages at the spa, but the tiny massage rooms and noise from construction did not make for a relaxing experience. The view from the rooftop pool is absolutely breathtaking! The hotel is situated in the best area. Lots of shopping and delicious restaurants are all around it. Can't wait to go back!",5,2016,06,11
11,Great Experience,We had a wonderful stay at The Majestic during June of this month.  We stayed in room 821 that is an excellent junior suite.  The facilities were very good and the staff was very courteous.  The roof top bar was a great experience and the DJ plays excellent music.,5,2016,06,10
11,Excellent Hotel,"I highly recommend the Majestic, which is conveniently located right across the street from the Casa Batilo in the upscale Eixample area of Barcelona.  We had a corner deluxe room with a view of Casa Batilo from our window.  The room was roomy and quiet.  We really enjoyed it.  The hotel's breakfasts are also memorable.  The buffet was huge with a fabulous selection.  The concierge was also very helpful in getting us online tickets to some of the major tourist attractions.  The attractions were very crowded, so online tickets were a must. The rooftop bar also has a great view of Barcelona. This is an excellent place to stay in Barcelona.",5,2016,06,10
11,Worst service and organization of my trip,"I stayed at this hotel as it is a member of leading hotels of the world (I have been a member for a long time and enjoy the hotels and the little extras you get for the paid membership). Right from the start I was told before I arrived that I would have to pay for the transfer to the hotel (120 euro) which I was entitled to free as part of my LHW membership  even after talking to the manager who denied the entitlement I had to call LHW in New York to sort it out.  We are also entitled to a room upgrade upon availability which was organized. When we returned to the service desk at 330pm we were told that the room was not ready this is 30 minutes after check in time. A very rude and sarcastic man told me that I was lucky to get s better room than I had booked and he had changed the room to a different room than the manager had organized for me. This room was really bad it was dark and looked out into the ugly back of a building. (I had booked a street view with balcony). So we had another trip to the front desk and another discussion with a very hostile and derogatory service person before I asked him to phone the manager. After talking to the manager he practically threw the key down and we were given a nice room with street view. 
The room and amenities were lovely the housekeeping excellent
The breakfast was extensive  it all the hot food was tepid at best precooked and placed under lights and all buffet no service for cooked meals. It was also pot luck if your coffee or hot chocolate turned up hot
On leaving the hotel it was the same disorganization with no attention to detail.  We had arranged a 4 pm checkout and returned to the room at 3 pm to find we were looked out. 
The bill had an extra $80 charge on it that was given to us as a credit for lhw and I again had the embarrassing situation in a crowded Lobby of ha I get to pull out my letter which stated it was so before it was removed from my bill 
I loved Barcelona it is a beautiful city but it is a shame that this process checking in and out of the hotel was so unpleasant and stressful 
",1,2016,06,10
11,Excellent stay!,"the staff was fantastic...the apartment we rented, gorgeous! We enjoyed the Sunday brunh very much and the spa is exceptional as well. The bellman were very attentive and the front desk went out of their way to help us.",5,2016,06,09
11,Wonderful stay in the heart of Barcelona,"I have booked this as a birthday surprise for my partner, and we both loved it!
Upon arrival we were upgraded to a nice suite to our surprise, which was fantastic! 
The food in their restaurant was the most delicious I had in Barcelona!
I have booked in advance with the hotel's concierge the restaurant Petit Comité de Nandu Jubany, and also pre-ordered a birthday cake and they did it brilliantly! 

I so recommend this place, lovely and friendly team too!",5,2016,06,07
11,BrilliantHotel,"Stayed at the Majestic hotel last week and as usual we both had a brilliant time. It's a beautiful hotel, elegant and tasteful. The food and service is 2nd to non and the staff are courteous, efficient and great fun. If you want to visit Barcelona this is the place to stay in, the location is ideal for all that the city has to offer. We ALWAYS stay at the Majestic when we visit this great city",5,2016,06,07
11,Wonderful Hotel and Location,"This 5 star hotel is near almost everything!  Located on Passeig de Gracia, you can easily walk to Las Ramblas, shops galore, sidewalk cafes, Gaudi Museums, the subway system, and touring busses.  The rooftop bar is a wonderful getaway spot with gorgeous views of Barcelona’s sky line.  You won’t be disappointed staying at Majestic Hotel and Spa.",5,2016,06,07
11,Great Location,"Beautiful hotel, nice size rooms and washrooms . friendly staff on check in and out.
Buffet breakfast is very nice lots of items to choose from.
The hotel is a great location to walk to shopping and restaurants.
would love to stay again!!",4,2016,06,06
11,Great location,Stayed in the apartments which are across the road from the actual hotel. They were nice and had everything you need. The location is excellent right in the centre of everything. Rooms were clean and staff were very friendly and helpful. Overall a very pleasant stay.,5,2016,06,05
11,A good hotel - but not as good as expected,"The Majestic Hotel is definitely good - but I was led to believe it was a great hotel - and it failed to live up to expectations.

The location is great (and probably could not be better).  It was easy to walk to many of the main sites in Barcelona (and luckily the weather was excellent while I was there).

It is an old hotel (and I was aware of that), 

I was in Barcelona on business and what disappointed me most about the room was that there was no desk in the room where I could work on my laptop.  There was a small round table and lounge chair - but there was no power outlet nearby.  I found myself sitting on the bed with my laptop on my lap working for hours - not good for my back.

I was also disappointed that the gym did not open until 7am.  I was wanting to work out at 5.30am or 6am and be finished by 7 / 7.30am to get ready for meetings.  Instead I was having to run / walk around the streets (which was pleasant as the weather was great).

The room walls are also not sound proof. One morning the guests in the room next door returned at 4.30am and then continued to party with loud music and laughing in their room - I could hear all of it. I got up and went running at 6am, when I returned at 7.30am, the party next door was still continuing until I left for a meeting at 8.45am.

Good hotel but not designed for business travellers.  Could be better.",4,2016,06,04
11,Superb in Every Way,"Fantastic location, staff and comfort.  Everyone we dealt with was friendly, helpful and did an outstanding job with a smile on their face.  True 5-star service from top to bottom.  Speaking of top, don't miss the roof top lounge and pool area with its great vibe and views.   Can't beat the location and convenience.  Wonderful breakfast, too.  Everything was excellent.",5,2016,06,03
11,Half term family break for four ,Luxurious hotel with a rooftop terrace bar and pool offering fantastic views over the city. Fabulous and friendly service from staff. Apartment accommodation very well suited to family stays. Hotel ideally located for la Pedrera and Casa Batllo. Beach and other attractions only a short taxi ride away. We will be back! ,5,2016,06,03
11,Birthday with Class!,"I booked this hotel via a recommendation from my wonderful Amex- Altour travel agent. This trip was to celebrate my moms 80th Bday and everything at the Majestic was superb. We had a junior suite. Everyone was unbelievably nice. Mom was surprised with flowers and gifts from the hotel staff and greeted by the manager on the day of arrival and more champagne and flowers and gifts on her Bday. There was one day that we forgot to remove the Do Not Disturb sign and when we returned to our room later that evening, I called housekeeping thinking they would just bring up some fresh towels. They came within 5 minutes and did a full cleaning and sheet change. I was totally impressed since it was after 8 pm. Every concierge we spoke with for dinner recommendations gave excellent choices. The location of the hotel is ideal. Train station in front and several museums within a few blocks. Highly recommend. Breakfast was delicious. Enjoyed our stay here more than the Four Seasons in Paris!
",5,2016,06,03
11,Wonderful Stay in Barcelona,"I stayed here a few weeks ago with my family and friends, and we had a great experience.  The staff was all very welcoming and helpful.  We had a fairly large group, so we had a number of rooms.  

One room smelled horribly, but the hotel moved my brother and his wife to another room because I'm not sure anyone could spend more than a few minutes in a room that smelled as horrendously as that one did.  Hopefully, they discover what was creating that smell and fix it. 

The rooms were clean and comfortable, and the beds were fantastic.  The shower pressure was amazing, and the bathrooms were very nice with two sinks in them.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Barcelona!  

The only negative is that the bar staff is not very attentive, if you want to go down and get a drink at the bar/ lounge.  It took a very long time to get someone to come take our order, and one time we even left because we waited for 20 minutes, and the server saw us but wouldn't come over.  

Everything else about this hotel is great!  The breakfast buffet is pretty pricey, but I still enjoyed it because it had a number of lighter options including meats, cheeses, pastries, fruit and yogurt.",5,2016,06,02
11,Housekeeping Staff,"My husband & I stayed at the Majestic Hotel & Spa in Barcelona for 4 days. This is a fabulous hotel right in the heart of Barcelona. The staff were very helpful & very attentive. 
The reason for this post is to sing the praises of the housekeeping staff. My husband left his Rolex in the room & did not realize it until we reached Milan. We figured that we would never see the watch again. We called the Majestic & the housekeeping department had found it! They delivered it to one of business associates that had not left the hotel as early as we did. To say the least, we were thrilled. I wish that all hotel staffers would be as honest and as trustworthy as they are at the Majestic Hotel & Spa. 
We will always stay at the Majestic when we are in Barcelona.",5,2016,06,02
11,At the Majestic for a conference,"As the organisator, we had a wonderful experience at the Majestic. From the site inspection, contracting phase, contact with the Event team ( Huge thank you to Astrid) to on-site with the Guest services and the F&B team , our requests were met. Always there to cater to our needs and with a huge smile. Delegates have shared with us great comments about the food quality and the services as well. A beautiful location , extremely well located in the heart of Barcelona. To recommend without hesitation.",5,2016,06,01
11,"Excellent location, excellent service!",I had the pleasure to stay at the Majestic for 5 nights.  We loved the location of the hotel as it is convenient to all the attractions of Barcelona.  The daily breakfast was delicious.  The room was small but nicely appointed and featured everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel.  The decor is traditional and lovely.  The absolute best part of this hotel is the rooftop bar/pool/restaurant. The view is unlike anything else in Barcelona and the service is exceptional.  Highly recommended.,5,2016,05,31
11,The third time is a charm,This was our third visit to Barcelona and our third time at this hotel. Needless to say we really enjoy this hotel. Our only disappointment was that because it was during the month of May this time the roof top closed at 9 PM. We always enjoy going to the rooftop after we went out at night for a nightcap and to listen to music and were on able to do it at this time. Also the rates were much higher in May then they were in September.,5,2016,05,30
11,A very pleasant stay,"In stayed in the majestic in May, location is great, just where the action is.
Service is great, hotel is not new.. But that's he's thing. Room was clean, and hotel kept cleaning it maybe 3'times a day. I really enjoyed the stay with my wife and I definitely recommend, for couples, a great hotel to stay, don't have really anything negative on my experience there, stayed for five nights. ",5,2016,05,28
11,Best Business Hotel in Barcelona,"Convenient location in the center of the city, Majestic hotel is at the same time clean, elegant and 10 minutes walking around everywhere in Barcelona. Rooms are quite and very well maintained and the Concierges (especially Juan) are helpful!Recommended  ",5,2016,05,27
11,Lovely hotel - Bit posh for us!,"My boyfriend surprised me at christmas with a trip to Barcelona. It was bought from lastminute.com so I think he just thought 5 star hotel - spa, brilliant! 
The staff were really helpful, although they linger about waiting for a tip all the time.
The hotel was lovely - Couldn't fault it! Although our hotel room was quite small. 
The showers are AMAZING! Best shower I have ever had. 

As an average couple from London I feel that maybe this hotel was not best suited for us as it was quite posh! To go down to the bar for a few jolly drinks apart from being expensive we also got a few snobby looks.

Breakfast was really expensive too.",4,2016,05,27
11,Luxury hotel that totally deserves its status,From the moment you walk in you feel pampered. Beautiful hotel in a perfect location with a very attentive personnel and charming rooms. What else would one want? If you can afford it - this one is no-brainer.,5,2016,05,26
11,Accommodations and Butler Service Fit For Royalty,"Upon entering this luxurious hotel, my husband and I were greeted by the guest relations team, escorted to our suite and given our own personal butler. The hotel team had inquired as to our wine preference and a beautiful Chardonnay awaited us along with a fruit basket. Our suite had an expansive terrace that provided a beautiful view of Barcelona and La Sagrada Familia. Oh and did I mention the hotel is next door to Chanel. The hotel had given Chanel additional second story space and the temporary Chanel store was next to the hotel lobby. Antonio Gaudi's famous buildings are only steps away. Javier, our butler, was amazing. I had made all of our restaurant reservations for early evening prior to arriving in Barcelona. This was definitely a problem as I found out dinner and entertainment started after 9:00 PM. Javier came to the rescue and changed every reservation for us.  When we had returned from a day's excursions, Javier would have a bottle of white wine waiting. A friend had given me a list of what I needed to see and try in Barcelona; Sangria was on the list and Javier remembered and again upon returning to our hotel after a long day had made a delicious pitcher of Sangria.  . The daily buffet breakfast included everything from hot pancakes, omelettes, sweets, fruits, meats, and of choice the delicious hot chocolate. Anything and everything breakfast food item on this buffet.   Javier was there to take care of us for breakfast also.   They also have an amazing spa.  On our last day, I truly did not want to leave this beautiful hotel and our butler Javier, though we were beginning our cruise.  The General Manager, guest relations manager and our Javier escorted us as we departed the hotel. Kudos to a top notch hotel and hotel team. My husband and I will return.",5,2016,05,26
11,Perfect for a luxury getaway... best in-room dining we've ever had.,"A superb spot in the heart of the city. Close to all major luxury stores (there´s a Chanel pop store in the very lobby). We had an amazing suite and the housekeeping dept did all their best to adapt to our needs. Astonishing views from the rooftop bar along with a varied tapas menu. Must say the pool is definitely not the size of an olympic one but good enough for cooling off a bit. In general all the staff is friendly and well trained but on the second night we got impressed by the greatest dinner we've ever had in a hotel room. It really felt like we were in a restaurant (a fine dining one though), starting with fresh hot buns in hot bb plates (you don´t even get to see this in restaurants) the waiter Emilio served our meal in tree steps while explaining every dish and the history of the catalan cream that we both had for dessert following his advice for a good local sweet treat. Wine tasting, table crumbing, a bunch of fresh flowers, better than a restaurant since Emilio brought our camomiles in a small tray to our couch, removed the trolley and left us in the quiet living-room smiling at each other and all set for a great sleep. We'll definitely be coming back over and over in future stays.",5,2016,05,24
11,Superb All Rounder,"I love this hotel.  Everyone is so charming and attentive.  The room was outstanding, our bedding, towels and toiletries were changed every day.  We had a turn down service and bottles of water left every day.  The bathroom is out of this world, huge bath with large, powerful shower.  The breakfast is tops, the variety is incredible, the atmosphere charming. There is a Channel shop in the reception area.  Taxis available right outside, Metro station 2 mins away. Shops gallore, from really expensive to budget.  Top hotel in a top location.  Swimming pool and bar on roof top with seating area all around overlooking the city.  Stunning.",5,2016,05,24
11,The perfect location in Barcelona,"The Majestic is not only in a perfect location but the hotel is gorgeous and the staff are wonderful.  It is a classic European Luxury hotel.   The view from our room was gorgeous and  speaking of gorgeous the hotel is really special.  The wall are even Venetian Plaster so they feel like they are made of Marble.   The rooms are very elegant, the restaurant is fantastic. the location is my favorite as it is right in the middle.
It is close to La Rambla but now on it.   It is quiet but lovely.  I would never consider staying anywhere else.",5,2016,05,23
11,Pricy but worth it,"Perfect place to stay in Barcelona. Centrally located , well kept and with extremely friendly staff.  Breakfast is rich and tasty. Great views from the rooftop terrace. Room is  nicely decorated with marble bathrooms. The hotel is pricy but  worth it. ",5,2016,05,23
11,Fantastic,Just returned from 3 nights at this fab hotel in Barcelona all the staff were fantastic lovely welcome on arrival from the general manager staff on the tenth floor were brilliant as was the food brilliant location fab rooms will def return sometime this is the place to stay if you are on a trip to barcelona,5,2016,05,22
11,Stunning,"Just back having spent 3 nights here and it was perfect, from the moment we arrived to the moment we left, what a very personalised service from such a fantastic hotel, each and every one of the staff from the general manager, who came to welcome us to the porters and bar men concerige, guest relations, chambermaids etc, the lunches on the rooftop in glorious sunshine with spectacular views will live long in my memories, i couldn't visit Barcelona again without a stay at the Majestic.",5,2016,05,22
11,Inspiring,We held our strategy summit in Barcelona last week and we were told to go to the Majestic. In summary it was very good advice since the hotel provides inspiring spaces within the great city of Barcelona. Most remarkable was the rooftop bar.,5,2016,05,22
11,Inexperienced front desk personnel,"What should have been a smooth check-in was not due to Carlos the inexperienced front desk person.  He did not read my comments in the reservation which kclearly staes do not put me in a room next to elevator, also he didn't listen to me when I verbally told him to his face that I did not want a room next to the elevatoet, he didn't listen when I told him spa bout the last hotel putting me next .to the elevator.  Guess where Carlos put me, in a room in the elevator vestibul.  Not near the elevator but practically in the elevator as the front door was approximately four feet from the elevator.  How obtuse can you be Carlos.  I refused the room as son as I got off the elevator and there it was four feet from elevator.  Now I have to go downstairs and tell him are you crazy to put ,e in that room what a waste of my time.  I tell him he has to do better than that I'm a repeat customer and he shouldn't treat repeat customers like that giving them the worse room next to the elevator.  Now Carlos inexperienced and has no clue about customer service in a five star hotel puts me in a smaller category room than I paid for in which we couldn't even put our bags in hallway to get out of rooms. Now I'm really upset because it's now an hour later and I'm still not happy with the awful rooms Carlos tried to,stick us in while everyone else gets the better roms.  You all know what oil talkingo about. Now we ask for general manager of hotel to come to our room because we are not happy at all with their room assignment.  Adrianne the valet was the only one so fat to treat us with dignity and respect, he went and got Francisco from guest relations..  After another twenty minutes, we ended up in A rom away from elevator with no view I paid for city view but supposedly room was bigger.  One hour and half to check in and feel settled is ridiculous thanks to your inexperience Carlos.  Then all you is hear are doors slamming til you can't stand it anymore and check out.  Not worth the money.  Treat your repeat guest better.  We will not be coming back.",3,2016,05,21
11,Extremely pleasant!,"Yes, the location of this hotel is truly fantastic. Two steps outside the grand entrance and you're on one of the most wonderful walking streets in the world. The hotel itself is fresh, modern, and very pretty -- if a little generic -- with a friendly staff. We had a immaculately  decorated standard room with a smallish bath; the high floor and thick curtains kept it quiet and dark at night. Tip: the lunch served here is WONDERFUL and can be taken on an semi-open porch. The dinner, though, is served in a room that cannot be described as anything other than a peculiar space in the basement. All in all, though, we enjoyed our six nights and wouldn't consider any other hotel in Barcelona.",5,2016,05,20
11,Fantastic location for exploring all of Barcelona,"What a great experience my fiance and I had at this hotel.  The hotel found out we were celebrating our engagement, and they sent up a complimentary bottle of Champagne!  The room was a bit small, but still very charming, luxurious, and comfortable.  We did have the most basic room, so this was expected!  The bathroom was fantastic, with great finishes.  

Walk out the hotel and you're in the best shopping and people watching area in Barcelona.  it's a bit touristy on the main drag, but go a few blocks in either direction and you'll come across charming and delicious restaurants.

We'll definitely stay here again on our next trip to Barcelona!",5,2016,05,20
11,Luxury and Comfort!,"This is my second stay at the Majestic Hotel and I prefer it to all others in Barcelona.  It is so well located within one block of two Gaudi masterpieces...the Casa Mila also known as  La Pedrera and Casa Batllo.  The hotel has delightful dining facilities, however, the nearby sidewalks are lined with charming restaurants and outdoor dining facilities...marvelous experience!  The Sagrada Familia is only a few blocks away and easily within walking distance which I have done twice alone as the route is direct and very safe along the Carrer de Mallorca.  Cabs are readily available and quickly secured by the hotel attendants with the Picasso Museum and Park Guell on a short distance...very affordable.  The hotel aims to please and provides the highest quality service at all times.  The Concierge is outstanding and provides assistance with any needed tickets or requests.  A total pleasure to stay at the Majestic Hotel in spacious, luxurious accommodations.",5,2016,05,18
11,Nice hotel in the center of town!,"The hotel is wonderfully situated in the center of Barcelona.  Terrific staff.  Small, but clean and comfortable rooms.  The downstairs bar is a great meeting place.  Suggest the roof top bar is a disappointment as is the very expensive breakfast buffet.",4,2016,05,17
11,Roses and Books,Ingrid Bergman classy.  Somehow I was transported to 1940's Paris.  The April weather was unseasonably cool as the couples walking below our room sought out their roses and books on this romantic holiday. Great corner balcony room set the stage for visions of bathrobes and candlelight.  Close your eyes and you can almost hear Humphrey Bogart reading the lines from Casablanca. Go for it. You won't be disappointed. Magical.,5,2016,05,17
11,"Nice hotel, Awful view at back..","We stopped at the Hotel Majestic for one night and were left feeling a little underwhelmed. The hotel itself is good it has a great location and the room itself was very good, however, our room was on the rear of the hotel which has a terrible view over a car park.

The following morning we were woken by continuous loud banging of doors, our room must have been located close to the house cleaning storage room, each time the room was accessed the door would slam, very loudly. It was very annoying.

Its a good hotel, but if you are here for any significant anount of time you should request a room view a view over the front. You will also need to request an iron and and ironing board.",4,2016,05,16
11,Everything we expected and more,"We stayed in the Majestic which was a little above our usual price range because we were meeting other people here.  From the beginning the staff could not have been better!  Excellent service, a gorgeous room and such a central location.....what we paid was made up for in lack of transportation time and fares.  We lost our camera in a cab that pulled away too fast after he dropped us at Park Guell.....we talked with Carlo in guest service who helped us find the best store to buy a new one.  When we came back from shopping we had a lovely note from him and some local comestibles.....made the expensive purchase easier to take.  Don't forget to eat some meal on the 10th floor terrace.....we had a perfect afternoon meal in glorious weather.  Our meal was a bit delayed due to problems in the kitchen- Ana apologized and brought us some specialities of the house to hold us over.  Great experience thanks to wonderful, thoughtful staff.",5,2016,05,15
11,Home away fro Home!,"this is a beautiful hotel and centrally located in Barcelona.  The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, and the rooms are fantastic.  We stayed here both at beginning and end of our last trip to Spain.  Both times we checked in the hotel left a bottle of Cava in our room, which was a very nice touch.  You should splurge and get a suite, the rooms a re very comfortable.  We also stored some luggage here and picked it up upon our return.

I compliment this property and its staff, they do a very good job making you feel welcome and catering to your needs!!",5,2016,05,13

11,"Great ""Cool "" Hotel in a great location ....very poor Breakfast location and service.","The accommodation is very good indeed and sensibly priced.

The Top floor Terrace is just great and perfect for drinks...light bites and people watching.

Location is very good and you are right in the middle of good shopping.

The standard of service is excellent .

The only negative points on this hotel is the food services for Dinner( Sunday night)....very poor location and you wouldn't want to dine in this improvised poor area.

Breakfast was a ZOO......and totally unacceptable for this 5 star hotel...You've paid top dollar and its like a Zoo with cramped tables...busy staff....no detail.......good food but in totally unacceptable service areas ....it was like a 3 star hotel......breakfast in your room or don't buy breakfast...as its the worst aspect of this good hotel.",5,2016,05,09
11,Stay @ Hotel Majestic When in Barcelona,"Located in the trendy L'example region of Barcelona, this is a hotel worth every penny.  Although the room was a little ""different"" (somewhat small and had two steps up to a landing with two wing-back chairs and round table) it is still a wonderful experience.  The bar on the main level is first-rate (don't forget to try their nightly tapas and handmade sangria).  The staff is incomparable.  The location can't be beat: delightful walking any time of the day or sit on one of the many benches and people watch for hours!  Make sure you take in the view from the hotel's rooftop terrace while you enjoy a Spanish beer or cocktail.  My husband and I would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2016,05,07
11,Comfortable & well located,"An excellent hotel for comfort, good facilities and not too large. Well located and very good guest service from all staff. 
Excellent breakfast and a good bar/ lounge.The gym is small but adequate and the spa for a redial massage was great.
The room was comfortable but my room on L2 had a step up to the robes and had a bench seat which was not comfortable .
I suggest checking the room .",4,2016,05,05
11,Beautiful hotel in beautiful Barcelona,My wife and another couple spent several nights at the Majestic.  Found it to be a top notch property with great service.  We were in the city  on our way to begin a cruise and found the property to be extremely well located to all the great points of interest and great shopping.  Would not hesitate to return for another stay if the opportunity should present itself.,5,2016,05,04
11,"Good service, great location, all the amenities ...perfect!","Went to Spain for a wedding being held in Murcia.  First stop was Barcelona.  I booked the hotel based on the reviews and was not let down.  We stayed three nights before departing for Valencia.  Reception was a breeze, rooms very nice and staff extremely helpful.   All the rooms had spare converters in case you needed one .  The rooftop lounge had a spectacular view of the city.  Try not to miss it.   The restaurant had a very nice lunch Buffett if you like Spanish food.  Not much my husband would eat but he is not a very adventurous. 
On our way back from the wedding in Murcia, I canceled our hotel that I had originally made reservations in.  We then spent our last night in Spain back at the Majestic.",5,2016,05,02
11,Great Location in Heart of Barcelona,"The roof-top bar and pool is great, if you can get a seat.  This popular spot fills up too quick.  Service on the roof is slower than it should be.  The main floor bar is well decorated with better service.  Breakfast buffet (included in some rates) is worth the additional price.  Service for the buffet is the most attentive in the hotel.  Front desk staff are helpful.

Rooms are oddly shaped given the age of the hotel; but are more that adequate and quiet.  Air conditioning in this older property is not up to par with newer buildings.  In meeting rooms it is either off or on.  Staff are chronically turning AC off to save on electricity rather than comfort of the guests.  Air Conditioning in the rooms requires modernization.",4,2016,04,28
11,Luxury in the Heart of Barcelona,"We spent one night there prior to our cruise and would love to have spent a few more days and nights.  We closed down the bar downstairs and then headed up to our gorgeous room for a lovely slumber after soaking in the tub.  All the amenities you could want in a hotel room.

The breakfast next morning was the best breakfast we had during our ten days in Barcelona.  The waitstaff were very kind, the food was the best quality and as much as you wanted to eat.  It was like a fantasy that you wish would never end.

Alas, it had to end, as our bus was loading up for the cruise ship.

And the memory remains...

One little thing.... Our room was down a hallway featuring three steps.  It was awkward to race up that hall with two huge rolling pieces of luggage.  Was there another way to get to the elevator?  I don't know.  Just a weird little moment.

11,Repeat guests... but what's going on?,"This was our 3rd stay at Hotel Majestic located on beautiful Passeig de Gracia.  We enjoy the cleanliness, spacious rooms and wonderful employees of this hotel.  Our stay was for 2 nights, but our room was never cleaned.  We left the room at 9am each morning and returned after 4pm, but the beds were never made, the towels were not replaced and toiletries were not restocked.
We were quite surprised by the 2nd day of our stay, since we had chalked up the first day to a simple fluke by the housekeeping staff. 
For hundreds of dollars per night to stay at this hotel, we expected much more from housekeeping -- it was unfortunate.
Overall, we recommend this hotel and will likely return.",4,2016,04,26
11,Lovely but expensive,"We stayed in this hotel back in September for 3 nights, the room we had was nice, fresh linen everyday, the shower was excellent and the complimentary toiletries were fantastic. The staff were very helpful able to book us dinner at a restaurant we had been recommended and arrange a hair appointment for my other half. She also used the hotels spa for a manicure and pedicure both of which were excellent again. The only down side was the roof top bar which cost 70 euros for 4 drinks, the view and atmosphere up there were amazing though so was worth a visit on our first night even if we drunk elsewhere on other nights. Would certainly visit again if we had the money.",4,2016,04,25
11,Un hotel verdaderamente majestuoso,"Spent 6 nights at the Majestic and would happily have stayed longer. Faultless service from all departments - a smile at breakfast, quick and helpful service at the front desk and seamless service from housekeeping.
The view from the bar/swimming pool on Level 10 is spectacular.
The room was fully adequate with a large bathroom.  The sign to ask that linen not be changed every day could be a bit bigger - I didn't notice it until day 5 and felt a bit guilty about my environmental footprint.
The hotel is on the Passeig de Gracia - think Champs Élysées - with lots of designer shops and people out enjoying the
sights or having a drink at a footpath bar.  100m from La Pedrera and Casa Batilio and an easy walk to Sagrada Familia.  Also on the route for the open-top tour buses and metro nearby.
If looking for a good restaurant, try El Nacional which has a choice of styles. And McDonalds is about two blocks down.
Free wifi is OK for checking emails.
Breakfast will suit all tastes and is open until quite late in the morning (11am I think, but check).
No hesitation in recommending.

11,Amazing neighborhood and high class lodging in the heart of the city,"There are two areas to consider to explore the city - the first two days we stayed here (thanks to our group travel person) right in the heart of the city -this is like Barcelona's 5th avenue with tons of stores, restaurants, boutiques and cafes lining the sidewalks. We loved the service, the gym facility (although they need some yoga mats!), the rooms (very spacious - we had an executive suite for our son and his bed was perfect/king size). The staff was super accommodating. I wish we had a room with a view towards the street - that was my only complaint. Other than that, first class service, lots of free water, fast/free internet and you feel like a king. What's not to like?! Bathroom was awesome - the BEST shower of all time. The pressure from the rain shower was so strong that I felt wasteful taking a longer shower. We also had a bath and the bathroom is HUGE. Even with 4 of us in the room, we did not feel crowded. Treat yourself!",5,2016,04,22
11,One night stay in paradise,"The majestic hotel is one of the nicest hotels in Barcelona, if not the nicest. Bet customer service, gorgeous hotel, of course comes with a price but all worth it.

11,Quality and care at its best,"On arrival, greeted warmly and efficiently.

On the 10th Floor you are close to heaven. A comfortable and sumptuous bar area with views over Barcelona. Staff very attentive. Opens at mid day and closes at 21.00.

Breakfast is to die for but a bit cramped as tables rather close to one another.

Metro station on your door step.

A great hotel and family owned...the best in Barcelona",5,2016,04,20

11,Outstanding Service,"Had a fantastic long weekend with our teenage son. We stayed in a Junior Suite, a little pricey, but in line with what we would have paid at comparable hotels for either a suite, a family room, or two connected rooms. Hotel itself is a wonderful grand dame with lots of gleaming marble and intricate architectural highlights, very upscale but also very friendly. The service was impeccable. Housekeeping immediately showed up to convert the sofa into the sofa bed. They also made sure we had 3 robes and 3 sets of slippers, rather than the standard 2 -- completely unnecessary but a very nice touch. I highly recommend booking with the American Express ""Fine Hotels"" website if you can. Comes with a noon checkin that actually worked for once -- we had our room upon arrival, whereas I noticed that other people attempting to check in were being told that their room was not ready. Also got an $85 spa certificate, good for a pedicure in the well laid out spa. A nice bottle of champagne showed up. Room service was prompt and tasty. The terrace bar had fantastic views and atmosphere. Upon checkout, the manager approached me to make sure my stay was satisfactory. It certainly was!",5,2016,04,18
11,Wonderful! Brilliant customer service !,"We stayed in the suites across the road with our 2 teenage children. Having 2 bedrooms 2 bathrooms and a large lounge area was fantastic and the entire flat was beautifully furnished. The fully equipped kitchen meant we could have breakfast in before we went out for the day. 
Our flat faced inward and had no view but we didn't care as it was ultra quiet. 
Staying in the suites you can still use all the hotel facilities and we enjoyed cocktails on the rooftop patio with stunning views. On our last night my husband and son went over to the hotel to watch BCN play a football match. It wasn't on regular TV so the hotel put it on in a conference room. 
Concierge desk happy to book anything for you or print your own bookings if you email it to them. Nothing was too much trouble for them. We had an issue with the AC the first night and they offered to move us or repair in the morning. We didn't want to move and the next day they fixed it, leaving us a complimentary bottle of wine and nibbles for our troubles. Every member of the front staff was without exception friendly and helpful. We WOYLD definitely go back.

11,"Good location, beautiful breakfast","This is a nice hotel located in Passeig de Gracia and only 7 minute walk from Las Ramblas. Two Gaudi houses almost next door and many fancy shops. Hotel is comfortable with quite big rooms and bathroom. We had room without view, it was in general very quiet - but if you happen to have neighbors who watch TV midnight then you might hear them. Wifi worked well, big TV with international channels. Bathroom has high quality Bvlgari toiletries. Minibar and coffee machine. Room cleaning happens disturbingly often, so you really need to use "" no molesten"" sign if you don't want the cleaning ladies step in already at 9 am. Breakfast is good, wide option of hot and cold dishes, lot of fresh fruits and fresh orange juice, eggs according to your will and various cakes and breads. There are many people servicing breakfast, majority are very nice. Some behave a bit arrogant way putting your used oily knife and fork on white table cloth for the second use ruining the clean picture. Good fitness room, open at least from 7 am. Roof top pool is very tiny and do not seem to be for swimming ( only if you fancy about swimming in a bar). Restaurant chef knows how to cook fish and meat. Tasty desserts. Although the hotel has almost everything needed, then expensive for what you get. I would return at half price.",4,2016,04,15

The apartments are large with a full kitchen and laundry room. The living room, 2 bedrooms and 2 bath feels spacious. The view was of other apartments but that was fine with the privacy curtains. All in all the Majestic Apartments are perfect for families.",5,2016,04,14

11,"""Excellent Hotel in the best location in Barcelona""","We stayed at The Majestic Hotel in Barcelona over the Easter weekend.
What a wonderful trip and what a wonderful stay at The Majestic Hotel!
The hotel is excellent and its location on Paseo de Gracia couldn't be better, it's like stepping out on to The Champs-Elysees in Paris but with much better weather!
What makes this hotel so wonderful is the staff and its outstanding service. 
At first we didn't like the view from our room...so Miguel from the reception made sure that after viewing two other rooms we got the room that made us very happy throughout our stay! 
The concierge team is definitely a ""Clé d'Or"" team...always helpful and so efficient, they recommended such wonderful restaurants to us and many places to see, they made numerous reservations for us in restaurants, at the nearby hairdresser, at the Gruell Park...always with a smile and we were never disappointed!
The breakfast buffet is again outstanding, the choice and the quality of the food are both of very high standard, the staff is yet again so kind and so attentive.
The rooms are beautifully decorated with all the necessities that you could possibly be in need of...spotlessly clean and the turn down service at night is such a treat with lovely little gifts, chocolates, water....so nice!
The rooftop pool with its bar/restaurant has stunning views overlooking Barcelona...
drinks, snacks, food all of a very high standard.
I can highly recommend this hotel...it is simply faultless!",5,2016,04,13

We had a two bedroom two bathroom apartment that easily accommodated kids in the lounge as well. The views of passeig de gracia were phenomenal. It was centrally located and within walking distance to the las ramblas area. I would definitely recommend the majestic apartments. ",5,2016,04,11
11,Muy Bien!,"This is one of the iconic hotels of Barcelona, located on the local equivalent of 5th Avenue or the Champs Elysées.

The hotel has recently been entirely refurbished, and the decoration is really pleasant.

The staff are attentive, professional, educated and helpful. 

We had a very nice room overlooking Paseo de Gracia, and enjoyed every minute of our weekend stay. 

 A class place!",5,2016,04,11
11,Top Class Hotel!!!,This is obviously one of the best hotels I have ever been to. remarkable concierge service! friendly atmosphere! Perfect location on Passeg de gracia! Classic & luxurious rooms! I would definitely go there again on my nest visit to barcelona,5,2016,04,10
11,Excellent hotel but..,"My wife and i stayed at the Majestic from 2-5 April. I chose the hotel because of its Trip Advisor reviews. The hotel was indeed excellent and well located for trips to the Sagrada Familia and Las Ramblas. We had a suite(625) overlooking the main street. The room was large and beautiful with tasteful decorations and a very comfortable bed. However the main purpose of the trip was to attend el clasico at the Camp Nou between Barca and Real Madrid. When we arrived we were told that the metro was on strike, there would be no taxis? and the only way to get to the ground was by using the hotels VIP coach at 50 Euros each. The coach would leave at 7pm for the 8.30pm start. we had VIP tickets for the game, so were keen to get there for the pre match meal/drinks. At 7.25pm we finally left and suffice to say we got to the ground at 8.15 so missed our meal/drinks and just made our seats before kick off. That spoilt the evening and Barca played poorly and deservedly lost! Also us English do like our tea, but the room only had a coffee machine. After 3 separate requests, we finally got a kettle but one tea bag!!!
On check out i complained about the coach timings and to be fair the hotel knocked 50 Euros off of the bill. Overall though we may have been unlucky and we both enjoyed our stay and would not hesitate to recommend the hotel",4,2016,04,07
11,"A very good hotel, needs a few issues to be fixed","Stayed here in may 2014 . Location is excellent if you want to be in the shopping district and near some of the sights near the old town . 
The hotel has some history compared to the other new ones that have sprung up , consequently there are always local celebs or other prestigious events on in the hotel . This does not impact on the guests at all but does add to the overall 'air' about this place 
The lobby and lobby bar great , concierge knowledgeable and great with kids . They give a lovely kids pack and gave even more when asked . When we checked in to our suite there was a lovely biscuit box .
My son loved this and a quick mention about this  saw a couple more brought to our room the following day . One day a lot of people ( especially teenagers) were hanging outside our hotel , apparently an international celeb was in our hotel . We were also invited to a fashion party on the roof top . Nice touch .
The breakfast room in stunning and good food ,however , queues waiting for breakfast not nice . 30 - 45 mins is ridiculous waiting for breakfast . This has never happened to us before . They really need to look into this . 
The other thing is the room itself . We stayed at the entry level suite and it really is basic .
I shudder to think what an average rooms size is. I would have expected a suite to be larger , however , it was very nicely decorated and had a basic balcony . 
Overall I would visit again for the location , service and the place overall . But needs to improve on its breakfast situation",4,2016,04,06
11,Superb hotel!,"Every single staff member truly cares about each guest. You'll find well-trained professionals throughout the hotel, whether they help out at breakfast or at the reception desk. No matter if you're looking for directions, help in obtaining ticket reservations, supplies from housekeeping, or assistance in connecting to WIFI.  And, speaking of housekeeping, staff tidies up each room twice a day!  Thanks for helping me practice my Spanish, everyone!  What a lovely location; this hotel has great amenities and ambiance. I truly enjoyed every moment.",5,2016,04,05
11,Perfect location,"Beautiful hotel in the grand old European sense. Excellent helpful doormen and reception staff. The hotel is ideally located on a lovely boulevard with gaudi houses, excellent shopping, & charming cafes nearby. There is a lovely roof bar with a little pool. They provide blankets against chill weather. We had one tiny problem that was swiftly and generously corrected. 
The beds are comfortable though the room was a bit small. ",4,2016,04,02
11,Wonderful hotel,"Stayed there for about a week and we enjoyed it quite a lot. This is what we found best: 

1. Location: On the corner spot on one of the main roads in BCN, Pasaje Gracia, you are a short walking distance of many of the city's main attractions and key transportation hubs (bus stops, cabs and the underground) 

2. Staff: Amazing people. Extremely friendly and always offering help and assistance. 

3. Room size: The room we got was very spacious and relatively well maintained. It didn't have a view (we were OK with that - it was much quieter this way)

4. Facilities: Though we didn't stay much in the hotel, but the pool deck on the roof top is really nice to visit. Finding a seat can be hard if you come during the peak hours. But since you are a guest, they will try to accommodate you quickly. The breakfast venue was also quite decent. The buffet was small and gets over crowded very quickly, but was good enough in terms of options and verities. 

Now, things we thought needs some improvement: 

Technical services. This is the only reason I am giving the hotel 4/5. 

We had issues with WIFI access all the time. On a couple of occasions when we were there, the service was completely down. Coverage is very poor and even if you are connected, you simply don't have access to the Internet. I really hope they address it. There was never reliable service at night. Only during the day - when most people are out of their rooms.

TV: On several occasions, there was no TV signal and when it is there, the image is not clear and constantly cut off. 

Pluming: Sink and bathtub were clogged and would fill up very quickly. There is not handle for the bathtub cap/lid, we had to remove it by hand, and the hot running water would cut off while u are taking a shower (maybe someone in the next room flushed or something) and u end up with a cold water shock. 

Inspite of the above, it didn't really ruin our experience and I am guessing those maybe issues related to our room only and not the entire hotel. If you are OK with all the above, then don't hesitate booking in this hotel. 

I know I would definitely go back again.",4,2016,04,01
11,Ice cold pool,"Stayed in their sister hotel so only commenting on the roof pool and bar. 
Attentive service from the staff on the drinks front. Not cheap, but we were expecting that. Daughter went in for a swim and loved it once she got in. 
Nice family treat after a long day walking around. Great views of the city too...",5,2016,04,01
11,Doesn't get better than this!,"We enjoyed an outstanding five days at the Barcelona Majestic Hotel.  Every detail is considered, and accomplished beautifully.

The hotel itself is stunning.  The lobbies, walkways, hallways, lounges are beautiful and immaculate.  Our room was attended to multiple times a day.  Amenities were refreshed constantly, from bottled water to lotions and soaps.  I never saw an attendant with a cart in a hallway.....yet fresh towels etc. were always taken care of. I had a cold and needed a few extra amenities at odd times, which were delivered immediately and pleasantly.

The staff were lovely and professional.  The bellman were truly a pleasure...from check in, to hailing taxis, to departure....friendly, helpful and professional.

You should stay here.... you will not be sorry.  And we will be back, I hope!",5,2016,03,31
11,A wonderful stay,"We stayed at the Majestic Hotel for a special family celebration. The hotel was everything it said it was and in an excellent location in the City centre. Our children and their families stayed in the Hotel apartments across the street and these are tremendous value.
We would certainly stay at Majestic Hotel again.",5,2016,03,31
11,Majestic all the way!,"Stayed with the family in 2 connecting rooms, one of which was a junior suite. The rooms were ready for our arrival at 1:00pm and check-in took less than 5 min. The connecting rooms shared a common foyer which was private and convenient. It was essentially a 2-bedroom, 2-bath apartment, very spacious and quite well laid out. Junior suite also featured a glass enclosed balcony, which served as an office with the fantastic views of Paseo de Gracia.

The marble bathrooms (with Bulgari toiletries) were spotless and the shower had great water pressure. The mattress was super comfortable and the windows insulated city noise quite well despite our room being on the second floor.

Breakfast had a good selection and was open until 11am. Many hotels stop breakfast earlier, which is not convenient if you are on vacation and arrived from a different timezone.

Overall, we were very happy with our stay. This hotel is member of Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts as well as Leading Hotels of the World -- and it shows. Lastly, the location can't be beaten -- close to everything and right in between 2 Gaudi buildings.",5,2016,03,27
11,Majestic!,"We are staying at Majestic right now, loving it! The room is great but the bathtub... Wow... Just Wonderful! Well located, great service. Walking distance from Las Ramblas. Just 25 min from airport by taxi. And the smell of the hotel is AMAZING. I wish I could buy that essence. Highly recommended. ",5,2016,03,26
11,Very nice hotel,This was my second stay at the hotel and I do like it.  My room felt a little bit like it could do with a bit of an upgrade in the sense of a lick of paint especially for a 5 star hotel.  When I checked in I was asked if I had stayed at the hotel before which I had but didn't feel like it meant anything.  I do think the breakfast is pricey for what it is but still very nice.  This time I got to have a massage and it was heaven.  I used the room service and the food was great.  I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel!,4,2016,03,24
11,Excellent Hotel in the hub of Gaudi's Architecture,"The hotel oozes class and first class service. The roof top terrace and pool, give a fantastic feeling of space and relaxation. 
The bed are very comfortable but not too soft, and i sleep wonderfully. We had two interconnecting rooms, for 2 adults and 2 children.
The hotel is close to all the main subway lines, plenty and restaurant, and a shortish leisurely walk to Las Ramblas. 
The hotel only enhanced a brilliant base for a long weekend stay with the family.",5,2016,03,23
11,SIMPLY AMAAAAAAZING,"Such an amazing hotel in all aspects... Starting with the check in, it was so easy and fast.. We booked an executive double room, for a room it could never be better, except the view.. It looked on the courtyard that wes not nice... But honestly we don't stay at the room much so it was ok. Breakfast was soo nice too, with good varieties. the location is the best I guess in Barcelona if you are looking for good chic shopping. Love the hotel and all the people working there 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 ",5,2016,03,22
11,Best place to stay in Barcelona,"Great hotel and great service! In order to fully enjoy Barcelona, this is the place to stay. Don't bother to bring a travel guide - rather ask the hotel concierge to recommend activities and places to eat. ",5,2016,03,21
11,Wonderful Stay,"We spent 7 days in Barcelona. Upon our arrival from the U.S. we were greeted by Noelia who advised us our room was not ready and that we would have to wait until 3pm. We had been awake for 27 hours at this point and desperately wanted a shower and a nap. We asked for somewhere to change our clothing so that we could leave the hotel and come back at 3:00. Noelia advised us she could not allow us to use another room to change and freshen up because it would lose the hotel
money. Instead, we had to open our suitcases in the middle of the lobby and rustle through our personal items to find a change of clothes and then change in the downstairs public restroom. We left and went to a spa, came back and our room still was not ready and Noelia could offer no other accommodations. Exhausted, we sat on a downstairs sofa and fell asleep sitting up until Ingrid found us and offered to fix the situation. Ingrid was an absolute delight and salvaged our whole opinion of this hotel. She was pleasant and got us a room immediately. In addition to that she upgraded our room at no cost.

The breakfast menu was my favorite but we found the other items for dinner and lunch bland and simple. We ordered room service often and I was pleased each time at the promptness and politeness. The vast majority of the staff are truly eager to help with whatever your request may be, without it feeling forced. Besides Ingrid, we greatly appreciated the people who cleaned our room multiple times a day. They thoughtfully arranged our personal items and always made sure the linens and towels were fresh. Slippers ands robes were laid out for us each night and one night they decorated our bed with rose petals. In addition to this we were given a complimentary bottle of champagne. The bellhops/doormen were lovely as well. They greeted us enthusiastically each morning with a warm smile and and offer to help. They're efforts did not go unnoticed of unappreciated.

The hotel itself is inviting and clean. The smell was overpowering at first but we grew to enjoy it. There is a lovely roof top with a small swimming pool and restaurant bar. From here you can see the entire city including the Sagrada. We felt as the the rugs could be a bit cleaner but we understand this is a high traffic hotel. Overall, I will miss the hotel and I did enjoy our stay.",4,2016,03,19
11,Food was delicious,I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone who comes here. We were in city to visit the art galleries and the hotel was perfectly situated for this purpose. It is near station and in a great area full of very competitively priced restaurants and tapas bars. I had dinner in the restaurant on our last night and the food was delicious. Thanks again to all and we will come back again.,5,2016,03,19
11,Excellent in Eixample,Fantastic Five Star luxury located in Eixample district of Barcelona near Casa Batallo and La Pedrera. We had a great connecting room.  The hotel has a fantastic bar on first floor and on roof. Best parties location. Helpful concierge and doormen. Stay there. You won't regret it. ,5,2016,03,18
11,Outstanding service and accommodations,"We stayed in the Majestic Hotel at the end of our two week tour of Spain. After starting our trip in the Majestic Residences, we were thrilled to return to the property to end our trip. From the luxuriously appointed two bedroom suite, to the extremely accommodating staff, our stay at the Majestic was spectacular. Located on the beautiful Passeig de Gracias, the Majestic is steps away from Casa Batlló, luxury stores, and numerous restaurants. Our rooms were quite spacious and elegantly appointed. From large marble bathrooms with Bulgari bath products, robes and slippers, to Nespresso coffee in our rooms, very attentive and friendly staff, as well as a lovely welcome basket filled with wine and cookies upon our return, our stay was fabulous. We will definitely be returning to the Majestic each time we visit Barcelona. ",5,2016,03,18
11,"iphone was stolen in the hotel, still waiting for a good response","Unluckily phone was stolen IN THE CONCIERGE, hotel respond very quickly at the beginning and passed us to insurance company...., but ever since then, one month later, still waiting, and no response even we wrote emails and call, I am happy to revise this comments if this is fixed as promised, please contact me if this review helps",1,2016,03,18
11,A Perfect Holiday Stay and Location,"This hotel was perfectly situated for us to enjoy the sights of Barcelona.  The rooms were comfortable, the roof top terrace provided a great view of the city and the drinks were heavenly.  The hotel staff was knowledgeable and friendly.  Their recommendations worked perfectly for our family.  ",5,2016,03,17
11,Its perfect,"All in this hotel is perfect. The staff, the rooms, the breaksfast, and specially the Bulgari products like shampoo, soap, body lotion... And I cant forget the adress!!!!!!!!! Its a perfect location for all activities.",5,2016,03,17
11,Amazing,"I've stayed in quite a few hotels in Barcelona recently due to work commitments, I chose this hotel for a special occasion with my girlfriend and what a fantastic place this is.

From the moment we arrived till the moment we left everything about the hotel ousted class.
Free room upgrade, free champagne for my girlfriends birthday, friendly welcome, just amazing.
Room was fantastic, the bed was unreal, super King and a mattress we didn't want to get off!!
We will definitely return.

One word sums this hotel........Amazing!!!",5,2016,03,17
11,Karim and family,"We have had a great experience in the majestic hotel, its location in the heart of the City which makes everything nearby you on a walking distance, hotel staff are very much friendly and supportive , I highly recommend this hotel for family and friends.",5,2016,03,17
11,Brilliantly located hotel,"We visited Barcelona for 4 nights in February 2015 and stayed at the majestic, we absolutely loved this hotel and the city of Barcelona, the staff at this hotel were lovely and friendly and the concierge was tremendous, we booked a 2 day bus trip through the hotel on the open  top buses and I cannot recommend a better way to see the city. The rooms in this hotel are lovely and well equipped, the hotel is in the centre of 2 Gaudi buildings with a bus stop just opposite. The breakfasts here were brilliant which I would really recommend. The roof top bar is very expensive for a drink but the views are so amazing so we had to go up there for one drink just so that we didn't miss out on that view. All round lovely hotel. ",5,2016,03,15
11,Beautiful in Barcelona,"If would give this hotel more than 5 stars if I could!! From the moment we arrived we were treated like VIP guests in this stunning & sublime hotel. The room was cosy yet spacious with a beautiful marble bathroom with BVGARLI toiletries. 

The buffet breakfast was INCREDIBLE! Treat yourself to local Spanish meats, cheeses, Cava & more! I wish I could eat there everyday.",5,2016,03,12
11,Fantastic hotel in a  beautiful city,"A luxurious hotel, in a superb city center location with great service and very helpful staff. The room was spacious, very clean and well equipped. The panoramic views of Barcelona from the roof-top bar and pool were superb. The staff were very polite and attentive, especially Tim, one of the Concierges, who advised us on authentic, reasonably priced Spanish restaurants, helped us choose an relaxed itinerary of places to visit on our three night break and organised tickets for a couple of attractions in advance. The stay was topped off with a lovely complimentary bottle of Catalan Cava left in our room to help us celebrate my partners birthday.",5,2016,03,10
11,One of the best places I have stayed!,"The hotel is in the perfect location. You can easily walk to all the main shopping areas  are surrounded by excellent restaurants. We stayed in an apartment which is located across from the main hotel but you still have access to all the amenities at the hotel. The apartment was perfect for the four of us. We had two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a full size kitchen, washer/dryer and living room to relax in. It was very clean and spacious. What I really want to rave about is the staff at the Hotel Majestic. They went above and beyond to make our stay a memorable one. They took care of us from A to Z. The concierges would recommend wonderful restaurants and make the reservations for us  as well as make sure we had proper directions. I really want to spot light one person in particular for really going out of her way to make our stay amazing. Ingrid is such a kind and patient person. On day 2 of our trip one of my friends lost her phone. Ingrid would call almost everyday all the different places we had visited trying to locate my friends phone. We had give up hope and the day before we left she called to say she had located the phone. We couldn't thank her enough for all her hard work. She made sure that we had the most comfortable stay and took care of all our needs.She even gave us little gifts before we left which was a great surprise. I plan to come back with my family and would not stay anywhere else. The location, staff, hotel and food were top notch. I would recommend the Majestic Hotel and Spa to everyone, trust me you will not be disappointed.",5,2016,03,09
11,"Fabulous Stay, excellent location","I stayed in a suit facing the street, the room was quite large and very clean. The service was excellent. The roof bar has a perfect view of the city. The hotel is on a very busy street however the sound isolation is very good and you don't hear any noise. Definitely will come back again!!",5,2016,03,03
11,Beautiful hotel and location ,"What a beautiful boutique hotel and a perfect location that really made me love Barcelona . The rooms were so nice and luxurious and the bathrooms were crystal clean with great toilet facilities . The spa was very relaxing and the view from the top you can see all of Barcelona . Will surely come back 
",5,2016,03,02
11,Great place to stay in a great city.,"The hotel is very conveniently placed, near to all the good stores, and close enough to the Rambla in order to be able to walk there, but far away enough to avoid the noise and late-night partying. 

The hotel staff goes out of their way to be helpful at every step, and there are some great details, like an umbrella in your room that you can use during your stay, (or available for free at the front desk when the weather requires one.

Highly recommend",5,2016,03,01
11,Excellent recently renovated hotel,"We spend four nights in this wonderful hotel. It has been renovated 3 years ago and is still shining like new.
The staff is very helpful,the rooms spacious and comfortable.
We had superior double....the room was facing the street but still it was silent. Any how try to get the room as high as possible.
We also had a little balcony....
The breakfast was excellent,the rooftopbar was really nice...all the city was around and you could see all the way to the sea.
The location is the best...important Gaudihouses are very next to the hotel....and wonderful shops and restaurants...
We can highly recommend the Majestic and absolutely shall return this hotel next tome in Barcelona.",5,2016,02,29
11,Elegance & location,"The Majestic Hotel is a long established hotel located in Barcelona's premier haut couture shopping district.  The hotel is very elegant and the location is superb - 2 of Gaudi's iconic buildings are close by as is the metro, shops, restaurants etc",4,2016,02,26
11,Maravilhoso!,"Wonderful experience, rooms are big, breakfast is amazing, lots of options of food. The lounge is great, the happy hour offers free peanuts and olives, drinks are amazing and the pool is not too big, but must be great for a shower after a long walk. Very close to all great spots and restaurants in Barcelona.",5,2016,02,16
11,Nice view from the balcony!!,"Went to celebrate Valentine's Day, got upgraded to the balcony room, was fantastic! Front desk was nice and helpful. Roof top bar was nice with a great view. Breakfast was ok, ate some really old donuts...not worth 34€..

很美的飯店、風景很棒、櫃檯接待很友善，被升等到頂樓景觀套房美到無話可說！早餐蠻浪費錢的，東西普通，有些麵包很硬，像放很久",5,2016,02,15
11,Lovely Hotel,"Spent a long weekend in Barcelona.  The Majestic is centrally located with plenty of shopping and restaurants nearby. The rooms are spacious.  There is a sitting area and nice size bathroom.  I enjoyed the bar.  Great to sit and enjoy a drink after dinner.  A must see is to go to the rooftop bar/pool.   The staff is great.  They are friendly and helpful.  The concierges gave great recommendations for restaurants and were helpful in arranging tickets to the Park Guell and Sagrada Famalia.  One concierge, Angel Beltran, was wonderful.    I would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2016,02,14
11,Classic luxury ,"One of the better in Barcelona I think. Very helpful and nice staff. Really comfy bed and great bar. A bit dirty carpets in the hallways (I'm picky) The only think not so great was the small rooms, I had the deluxe room, meaning that the superior rooms have to be extremely small. Nice BVLGARI   toiletries. Overall great stay would come again. Location is excellent! ",4,2016,02,09
11,Excellence,"Great, traditional property ran with extreme care and absolut guest centricity. World class concierge, efficient and attentive front desk, expert barmen at the bar. Rooms are beautifully appointed, extraordinary linen,  Chopard toiletries.  Roof top bar is a summer delight in the evening with a curated wine & champagne selection and artesian gin tonics. My favorite hotel in Barcelona,  by far. ",5,2016,02,03
11,"Fall out of bed, and you have Chanel, Hermes, and Gaudi's architecture steps away...","We selected this hotel because of location...not disappointed! A few days to see art & architecture...shop...and enjoy the fabulous food before meeting our cruise ship...
We enjoyed a suite with a glass study over-looking the fabulous main street that reminded me of the Champs Elysees...We enjoyed the vast breakfast buffet and
the bar service...The only negative, would be a suggestion to do something about the very uncomfortable sleeper sofa in the living room...Otherwise the hotel is excellent...",4,2016,02,02
11,only went for the views,"Hi, i probably cant help with what u need, as i only visited the majestic for its skyline views, which were excellent. However immediately when u entered, u knew u were in a 4 * hotel, helpful, un-snobby staff who were more than welcoming unlike the W hotel lol. We went up, had a few cocktails and nibbles at sunset then left, was lovely to see the city at that height, u could see most of the local attractions and its very suave and lovely to sit and have a few drinks. would recommend visiting and cant see you would be disapointed while staying ",4,2016,01,28
11,Excellent Old Fashioned Hotel,"The Majestik has all the amenities and very attentive service.  There are solicitous staff everywhere waiting to serve you.  The rooms are nice, up to date and maybe a little smaller than the best places in town but above average by european standards.  And the linens, AC/heating, wifi, shower, etc. all work very well.  The amenities like bath soaps are sort of grandmotherly, but this is more a hotel for your parents (otherwise try the Alma a few blocks over). At 300-400 per night offseason it is also a tad expensive but you know that everything will be really, really good there.  The location, bar and breakfast are top notch.  The rooftop bar is absolutely spectacular.  The beds and rooms are very comfortable.  Even the gym, usually perfunctory in most Barna hotels, actually is pretty nice.  I might stay someplace boutiquier, but I will recommend this to all my friends for their first few visits to the city.  Can't go wrong.",5,2016,01,27
11,"Beutiful Hotel, Great Location","We spent just one night at the Majestic so we weren't able to check out much of what the hotel had to offer.  Our room was beautiful.  We were in a suite.  The location of the hotel was great for the tour we had lined up the day we checked in.  We had a small issue at check in that wasn't a huge deal.  However, they had wine and a little treat sent up to the room which was a very nice gesture.  Returning to Barcelona we would book at the Majestic again.",5,2016,01,25
11,Loved it!,"My Husband and I stayed for 3 nights last weeekend. From the moment we arrived I knew I had pciked the right place. Location is great and within walking distance to most of the sights. Room was lovely with a balcony overlooking the main street. Reception/Concierge were extemely friendly and helpful.
We didnt eat in the hotel howver drank in the bar - can recommend the cocktails! We also had a drink in the rooftop bar which had great views, it was quite a cold night and we were offeredf a blanket which was a lovely touch and kept us warm!
We loved Barcelona as a city and will definately stay here again if/when we come back.",5,2016,01,23
11,Classic Luxury,"We spent 2 nights at the Majestic in October 2015. The location in the Eixample section of the city is excellent for visiting Gaudi sights such as Casa Mila. It is walking distance the Placa Catalunya and the Barri Gothic. Service is top notch from the front desk at check-in and the bellman and valet service. We stayed using the Platinum American Express Fine Hotels program so while our room was not available at the time we arrived at 11AM, we were upgraded to an executive suite which was very well appointed and large by European standards. Our room rate also included a lavish breakfast each morning with French press coffee, juices, made to order eggs, pastries, fruits, breads, etc. Breakfast is served in a dining room and in an adjacent covered garden-white tablecloths, flowers and silver. There is a full bar in the lobby which was great for people-watching and a stunning roof top bar with a view of Sagrada Familia and Casa Mila which is beautiful at night. There is also a rooftop pool in the same area which we did not use but would be a pleasant diversion on a hot day.

We enjoyed the hotel very much and would stay here again.",5,2016,01,22
11,Great Rooftop Bar,"We stopped by to have cocktail on the roof
before dinner and it's terrific. Great place to view city and relax over drinks and catch up on day's activities. Very comfortable and great service. 
You can also dine if you like. 
Great location also",4,2016,01,18
11,A touch of glamour ,"My Mum and I booked 5 nights at The Majestic during our Spain travels and loved every second of our stay.

From concierge to the 'bell boys' to guest relations to reception (especially Alexia) to the waitstaff we felt welcomed and accommodated throughout our entire stay...(to the point the lolly (candy) bowl at the front desk was my weakness and it became a running joke each day with reception that I couldn't leave the hotel without a handful to pop in my bag!)...it's the little things that count!

We had a stunning room with a balcony - spacious enough to accommodate my mum and I comfortably. The balcony provided great views of the city. 

Facilities are great - I will definitely be returning in Summer in the near future to take advantage of the roof top pool and bar.

Perfect stay to end what what a perfect holiday in Spain. ",5,2016,01,14
11,We loved every minute at the Majestic Hotel & Spa Barcelona,"The location, shower, size of the room, housekeeping staff, bell staff, closet and even the slippers were completely wonderful. We will always measure every other hotel to the Majestic and I am sure they will all come up short. 
Thank you for making our first trip to Europe something to remember always!",5,2016,01,12
11,love the bed and location ,"The heritage hotel is nicely renovated and gives you a comfortable modern feeling despite the building being so old.

The hotel concierge is the best I've ever experience - they are not just helpful, but goes all out to make each guest feel like home. 

The rooms are spacious and the thick bed is comfortable - I had no problem sleeping, every night the hotel will leave a small perfume by your bed for a calm and relax sleep.  ",5,2016,01,09
11,Very Grand,"Elegant hotel, friendly staff, beautiful rooms.
Worth a stay.  Centrally located.  Free WiFi.  Upscale, but not snooty. Wonderful breakfast buffet with a large variety to chose from.  The rooms are well appointed and very comfortable...good size.  Spent the day after checking out and were able to leave our bags at no extra charge.  When our drive picked us up the staff was all available to help with bags and had them out in seconds.  I would stay there again next time I am in Barcelona",5,2016,01,08
11,Beautiful ,"This hotel is magical and romantic. We stayed for two nights, our first and last night's in Spain, so the Majestic was the perfect bookend for a long holiday in Spain. We were exhausted both days, so it was vital to have a beautiful relaxing setting to just chill out, rest, and enjoy each other. The Majestic provided this, and more. The staff is lovely, the food is great, and the location is fantastic Take a room with the balcony and the little outdoor sofa. ",5,2016,01,07
11,"Elegant, classy hotel with high standards","The customer services staff did their utmost to make our stay memorable. It is a fabulous hotel in a fantastic location, and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants five star luxury. The rooms at the front and the suites are beautiful, and the cleanliness and service was exemplary. Very friendly and helpful staff.",5,2016,01,07
11,Feel like Royalty at the Majestic Hotel and Spa,"We stayed here for one night before a cruise.  The accommodations were outstanding.  Amazing soaking tub and rain shower in the oversized bathroom.  The bed was very comfortable and despite the urban setting, it was peaceful.  You are literally in walking distance of nearly everything-Gaudi museums, La Sagrada Familia and one of the best shopping districts in Europe.  

Be sure to check out the rooftop bar.  The jamon is amazing.",5,2016,01,03
11,Wonderful and family friendly hotel,"Nothing to complain, everything is simply wonderful, top service from all levels, very friendly and service-orientated staffs, great and wide variety of breakfast, central location eventough room is a bit small",5,2016,01,03
11,"Love the hotel, service and location","Concierge and Front Desk are very helpful. They helped recommend places to go, helped make dining reservations, and help get tickets to places of attraction.
Love the location. It is very conveniently located at the shopping and dining area.
Love the service. Everyone is courteous and helpful.
The rooftop bar is nice too. ",5,2016,01,01
11,Great location,"The hotel has the best location in town -- friendly & helpful staff.  \
Breakfast is top notch with many options.
The rooms can be on the smallish side / construction was going on in the early evening which did distract from the piano bar ambience",5,2015,12,31
11,Absolutely loved it.,What an amazing hotel. Service second to none. Room lovely. Location perfect. Fab view from rooftop bar. First trip to Barcelona and when we return we will stay here again. Good value for money too. Within walking distance of everything.,5,2015,12,30
11,Amazing!,"I booked a last minute trip for myself and my mum before the Christmas chaos!
We were blown away with this hotel. Clean, comfortable, exceeded our expectations on every level.
After checking in and being shown to our room, we made out way to the rooftop terrace. Although it was cold, the view was amazing so we decided to stay for a drink. No sooner had we sat down, the waitress gave us blankets and bought over a heater for our personal use. Such personal service.
The room hotel outstanding with a constant fresh air smell through the air conditioning throughout, it was hard not to be amazed. Nothing was too much trouble.
We didn't take breakfast at the hotel as it was €34 per person. Instead we crossed the road and had a very pleasant brunch at the cafe opposite. The hotel staff pointed us in the direction. The location was excellent - central to everything.
We will be back!!! I need to buy a candle of the hotel scent!!!",5,2015,12,26
11,Majestic Hotel - very comfortable,"Just come back from 3 days in Barcelona staying in the Majestic Hotel.  Altogether a very good experience.  The hotel is well located, in easy walking distance to a great variety of restaurants and all the main attractions.  The staff were excellent, the room just what we need and   with a huge bathroom.  The Roof bar was great for a drink and had fine views of the city.  Would stay there again",5,2015,12,22
11,"Breakfast, comfort, and quiet","For a variety of reasons, we stayed at the Majestic Hotel. The location was just perfect, as was the amazing breakfast.

I asked for a quiet room with a shower (rather than a bath). It fact the room was so quiet that we didn't wake up in the mornings without setting the alarm. And the shower was just the best hat we have ever come across in our travels.

Service everywhere in the hotel was impeccable, And the the most wonderful selection at breakfast. My only complaint was no freshly-squeezed orange juice at breakfast!

WiFi worked fine at a very good speed

We were within reasonable walking distance of most of the places that we wanted to visited, and very close to the Passeig de Gracia and Diagonal metro stations for those times that we needed to make use of the city's easy-to-use metro system.",5,2015,12,21
11,Expected more from the Majestic Hotel,"I don't mind a small room in a big city.   There were no lights in the room except next to the beds which made the desk unusable because it was too dark. But was surprised at the snarly staff.  Our air conditioning didn't work, called to report, no answer.   Left for dinner and got back late, had to try to sleep with our balcony door open but on the third floor on a busy street the noise was deafening.  Reported the AC problem to the front desk at 6:00 AM the next morning and they said they'd put a note in our file.   When we checked out and they asked about our stay we told them it was a lovely hotel except for the AC problem.  They had no note in our file and acted put out with our attitude.   What a disappointment. ",2,2015,12,20
11,Luxury in the Heart of Barcelona,"You are first impressed when your limo or taxi drops you at the Majestic Hotel. The BellBoys then the Reception really makes you feel so special. It was our first stay with my family. The Rooms are fresh and have excellent direct light. The little balcony let you get a feel of the Barcelona action. 
Breakfast was one of the best I have taken in a five star hotel. Warm bread, good assortment of cheeses and cold cuts and freshly cooked eggs. 
All in all a beautiful hotel with excellent service. We will go back.",5,2015,12,19
11,Lovely for all types of trips,"This was my first trip to Barcelona and I couldn't have chosen a better hotel. It's located in a beautiful shopping districts on a tree lined boulevard. There are lots of lovely eateries nearby and a few landmarks and hop on/hop off tour stops within walking distance. 
The lobby was beautiful and bright with very polite and smiling staff. The rooms were large by`European standards and clean with Bvlgari amenities. 
Room service was supremely delicious and I had a chance to sample a variety of items. The breakfast on the 1st floor was well stocked and staff very intuitive to my needs. 
The only 'negative' mention is the view out of my one tiny window which looked out at another wall and other guest windows. I was there for business and didn't mind not having a view and the overall hotel made up for this.",5,2015,12,19
11,good location,"this is a very good hotel for whom would like to sight seen and shopping,
hotel is very clean with friendly staff .
high speed internet is available free.
top roof restaurant is fantastic with good views from the city.
the quality of foods is grate!",5,2015,12,19
11,Class at best location in Barcelona,"The Majestic Hotel & Spa is one of those place that after you stay for the first time you feel at home on the second time.The hotel has one of the best locations in Barcelona near the upscale stores as well as very local shopping like El Corte Inglez and shopping stand right on the street. Pretty close to a subway station and walking distance from some of the best bars, cafes and restaurants in town. The bar at the terrace is a must overlooking historical buildings and downtown. And the staff, nothing more to say but commend all of them for being so kind..",5,2015,12,16
11,Perfect location - Majestic Hotel shines,"Great location for easy walk to many points of interest. The hotel is top-notch for cleanliness, service, design and the rooftop restaurant is worth a meal with a view of the city. Would return and definitely recommend!",5,2015,12,16
11,wonderful experience,"My husband and I stayed here in September. The location is very good with proximity to nice shopping, restaurants and train stations. Our room was very well appointed with modern fixtures, artwork and furniture. The beds and linens were very comfortable. Unfortunately, although we thought we booked a street view, our window was facing an inner wall. We didn't want to bicker after arriving so early in the morning  from a long flight from the states.
The staff was very kind and the concierge was knowledgeable and helpful.
Go for the amazing breakfast buffet. That was a hit every morning. We also enjoyed the rooftop in the evening for drinks.
The spa services were wonderful. I had a ""Champi"" (?)  massage that was so very relaxing. I would recommend it. 
Although this property was wonderful, I think I'd like to stay in a different area of Barcelona on the next trip. The "" Michigan Avenue"" of Barcelona is very touristy and the shops are predictable and boring for those from an urban areas of the states. Seen one Chanel store, seen them all.",5,2015,12,15
11,"Very nice, traditional hotel with excellent service.","Pro:
Heart of everything, excellent service, professional staff, impeccably clean, good buffet, rooftop deck with outdoor pool and bar, concierge and bell staff very helpful.
Liked our room, it was small but very comfortable.

Con:
Most views were not great, bar on roof closed at 8 (so did the roof), lobby small with limited seating, bar had no views (or windows), breakfast was in an oddly layed out area, decorated nicely for Christmas. Going back to the rooftop thing - this was such a great loss with the bar shutting down so early.

Quirky note: I had left my iPhone in my bathrobe and the maid took it away for cleaning. Caught it before it went through the wash cycle, but it was returned bent from some type of press. Hotel is making good on it, just thought it weird to take away something without checking pockets.",4,2015,12,15
11,Beautiful Hotel in Great Location,"We were very comfortable here.   The room was spotless, quiet, and well-serviced with excellent turn-down.  Both the room and bathroom were well-lit.  We liked their type of electronic keys, which are just held against the door-pad (they don't seem to de-magnetize easily).  Wifi was good (except you had to sign-in with each use).  All the expected amenities were in the room, except  we were rather surprised that they charged for each Nespresso capsule used.  We chose not to eat breakfast here, because the charge was exorbitant.  There are nice coffee/pastry places everywhere.  The staff was excellent, and we were happy with our stay.  Barcelona is great.",5,2015,12,15
11,Short Weekend break,"We stayed at this hotel in February 2015, arriving on Saturday morning and departing on Sunday evening. The hotel is ideally located hotel in an upmarket area of the city. The staff could not be more helpful offering our room early and upgrading from a standard room. They recommended areas to go and a few good restaurants. 

There is lovely bar at the top of the hotel overlooking the entire city and provides a fantastic cosmoploitain setting. Barcelona is a little slow to wake up on a Sunday morning so we would recommend you have a lie in/swim/breakfast in the hotel before heading out.

We will definitely be staying here again when we return to Barcelona!
",4,2015,12,14
11,Just wonderful.,"I stayed at Majestic because of its location and also because I had loved their Xmas tree the year before.  We were too early for the tree this time but it was still beautiful, smell lovely and luxurious.  Bed, linens, amenities all wonderful. Excellent breakfast with excellent service.  Excellent bar service indoors and on roof top. Excellent, well educated concierge. Full of beautiful art scattered around.  Just wonderful.  I had no day light in my room as it faced walls on all three sides but as I had asked to be placed in a higher room for sleep quality - hotel is on a busy street - I cannot complain.",4,2015,12,13
11,"Good hotel, excellent service","Stayed for 5 nights during a business trip.The hotel is located within 5 mins walk from the Metro station, making it easy for us to move around Barcelona. 

The rooms were large and comfortable, with everything you need. The toiletries are from Bvlgari. 

The staff were very attentive and are able to help you make bookings for restaurants and attend to our needs very quickly.

I have two minor issue with the hotel:
1) they only provide with 2 very small bottled water a day. Would appreciate if they could provide a larger bottle.
2) For some reason, there is a separate platform in my room for the cabinets and sofa. Not sure why is it there for. But definitely not the safest design. Note that not all rooms have this raised platform. Ask for one that doesn't have if you do not want to climb up and down in your room.

overall, excellent stay.",4,2015,12,12
11,"A Must Stay - location, service, comfort...the complete package!!!","First time in Barcelona.  Want to move here!  This hotel rocks.  Fabulous location.  Wonderful feel about it - walking through the common areas is a pleasure.  Although we were with a small group, we had terrific service, rooms and ambience.  Would definitely stay here again and I am very picky.",5,2015,12,11
11,Excellence!!,"Have just stayed 2 nights at this lovely property and I was not disappointed. As a Leaders Club member I got a wonderful upgrade to a spacious corner Junior Suite.
To my great surprise the management send us a bottle of my favorite Spanish wine (how did they know??)) now a  usual  mediocre cava.
The service is impeccable.  
The breakfast is great with many cold and hot things to choose, excellent fruit choice.
The roof-top bar is a delight.
My special thanks to Maria - front/concierge  who were very friendly and hospitable.
If I am back to Barcelona - Majestic will be my first choice.

Compliments!",5,2015,12,11
11,Best city centre hotel,"Two nights at this fabulous hotel last week.  Staff are brilliant, rooms very comfortable and the breakfast buffet the best I have ever come across.  The Chef has huge influence - try the Nando Club sandwich on the roof terrace - a revelation !  We dined in as a group for one night and dinner was faultless.  Cannot recommend too highly - will be going back without a doubt, worth its 5 stars plus.",5,2015,12,11
11,Love this Home away from Home,"Every time I visit this Beautiful city The Majestic is where we stay.  No other hotel in the city comes close to the Service and Accommodations which are second to none!
We are so looking forward to our return in a couple months!!!",5,2015,12,09
11,"Majestic? Yes, the name fits","We had booked a cruise with Princess from Rome to Barcelona, the latter a city we had not visited before. My task was to find a hotel using Tripadvisor.

The Majestic leapt off the first page but to be fair and do due diligence I looked at the top 30 hotels listed. The classic facade, the understated but luxurious interior, the location on a beautiful wide boulevard, the proximity of two Gaudi houses (Batilo and Mila) and the rooftop bar all helped tip the balance so we booked a balcony room facing Passeig de Gracia.

Communications with the hotel over the next few months were answered promptly which is always reassuring.

After a great cruise visiting several key Italian ports we landed in Barcelona October 3rd for a two day stay. A Gaudi tour with Pepito tours occupied our morning and they dropped us at the hotel.

A uniformed bellboy came out to take our luggage-a big smile and a welcome making a good first impression. We were led past the reception desk to a smaller lobby on the side where we were greeted by a young Jose Carreras, he of the radiant smile and efficiency.
We already felt we were in good hands. Two other receptionists who may have come from a Vogue photo shoot were helping other guests and all could speak English well.

Our room would not be ready for an hour (Check-in is at 3 pm, it was now approaching 2)
so we decided to visit the amazing roof top bar (La Dolce Vitae-see my review on TA)
and enjoyed that experience so much we didn't mind the wait.

Once we were shown to our room we were very happy with our choice (see photos)

It was spacious and immaculately clean. Ditto the bathroom which featured Bvlgari soaps and such. Fluffy robes and fluffy towels were appreciated.

The bedroom had a Nespresso coffee maker and a big desk where I set up my computer.
Alas I couldn't get a wi-fi signal and we needed one to book and print some tickets for the two Gaudi houses next day. I went to the front desk and the concierge told me the wi-fi is down. It remained so for the rest of the day. Back in the elevator another American guest was voicing her displeasure at this event. We all like to stay in touch and today the hotel was falling short. Next day (Sunday) the wi-fi was working but with a weak signal, so slow that my companion spent two hours of her morning trying to print out the tickets which would save us from waiting in the long lines to enter Casa Batilo. She succeeded using the computers and printer in the basement Business Center but it kept her off the Barcelona streets for two hours on her vacation. I do hope the issue has been resolved....

As I walked through the hotel that evening around 6 p.m there was a very lively scene in the lobby bar.  It seems to be a magnet for the early cocktail crowd and a fine pianist was playing Spanish classical music. I didn't have time to enjoy, alas but would have loved to.

The hotel doesn't have an ATM but directed me to one across the wide street and there I got some Euros.

The rooftop bar is my favorite place in Barcelona at sunset when the city lights itself up.

We were seven floors up but the traffic noise wasn't an issue at night as there were very heavy drapes muting the sound below. A good night's sleep was had.

At 6 a.m I took one of my walks in the dark, which I do in most cities I visit. I go out to take photos when the city is quiet. I couldn't use the Nespresso as it would wake my companion but down in the lobby I found a similar machine waiting and made myself a double espresso to go. A basket of warm mini croissants was a welcome find. These I enjoyed on a mosaic bench just outside the hotel. I walked down La Rambla to the port area and returned two hours later. I wear a money belt by the way and hold onto my camera bag as Barcelona has a lot of pickpockets. I returned safe and sound.

HOHO buses stop at both Gaudi houses and each of those are just two blocks from the hotel. La Rambla is one block away. Location, location, location!

The hotel has some nice looking restaurants and one serves a breakfast  buffet @ 30 Euro but we wanted something light and simple and most of all outdoors in this glorious weather. We went to Cafe Francesco just across the narrow side street.

Speaking of food, our Gaudi guide recommended a tapas restaurant-El Passage de Murmuri, just a few blocks from the hotel. When I asked the Concierge for directions he remarked that it was owned by the Hotel! We had a very good tapas dinner there.
I would imagine that the hotel's in-house restaurants are also of a high standard. Maybe we'll find out on or next visit.

The Majestic was a great choice for us. Classic elegance and a staff that seems very happy to work there-just a well run business that gives you a home away from home.
There's a great team working there, focused on the guest and making a great impression. In two days we just scratched the surface of Barcelona. We kept saying ""we'll just have to come back"". We will return to Barcelona and when we do we won't have to look for a hotel. We have already found it.",5,2015,12,06
11,Luxury and 5* Service,"I had a wonderful 3 night stay here during a business trip to Barcelona.  The staff was attentive and friendly, the location right in the upscale area of Passeig de Gracia was ideal and central, and the rooms were spacious and comfortable.  I slept like a baby! 

The breakfast buffet was delicious and has so many options... I overate each morning because I couldn't choose!

The hotel is right between 2 Gaudi buildings - La Pedrera and Casa Batllo.  Not to mention all the designer shops that line the streets around it!  I did my fare share of window shopping.",5,2015,12,03
11,Perfect!,"When you are overseas, it is nice to have a soft landing, a place that you can call home while you hustle around seeing all of the sights. The Majestic in Barcelona was home for us in Spain. The staff, the breakfast (one of the best layouts I have experienced), and the room were absolutely wonderful! Our room had a private balcony with sweeping views of the city. It is also centrally located so very easy by metro to go anywhere. We had a 5 star experience at the Majestic and will stay there again on our next trip to Barcelona....",5,2015,12,03
11,A beautiful hotel in a beautiful city. ,"5* hotel. 5* location. 5* city. 
If you want to feel special and important, come here. A top class hotel with staff to match and very much an ideal location for a weekend in this amazing city. Nice rooms, a lovely rooftop pool and bar with views of the city and beyond, walking distance to pretty much anywhere and in a vibrant and upmarket spot for shopping and dining. 
Definitely come again. ",5,2015,12,02
11,Nice place to stay,"Stayed in the suite for a few days. It is also in the central location which have so many exclusive stores around. The room is very nice with big jacuzzi bath and balcony which you can stand out and enjoy the night city view in Barcelona . The hotel itself has a rooftop bar, pool and amazing view as well. I also had my lunch in the hotel restaurant on Sunday (they have special offer). It has a lot of seafood selection and it's very good value. Will definitely recommend people to stay!",4,2015,12,02

11,One of my favourites in Barcelona,"Fabulous location in the city and comfortable public areas with pianist playing in the evening. For me, the best was the roof terrace....truly wonderful for a drink before dinner or a night cap. Rooms are extremely well equipped and mine was particularly large. Nice breakfast and extremely professional and friendly staff. Definitely made the stay in Barcelona all the more enjoyable being on business!",5,2015,11,25
11,fantastic stay,"incredibly helpful and accommodating staff, beautiful rooms, amazing rooftop bar and breakfast buffet. In a great, central neighborhood walkable to everything. Particularly want to thank a young man at guest services who gave us great tips about what to go and see that were a bit off the touristy areas. I would HIGHLY recommend!",5,2015,11,23
11,Excellant Choice,"We arrived early after a long flight from NYC. We got into a room after a 2 hour wait - this is not a complaint just a reality of a very booked Hotel. We enjoyed our 3 night stay since the room was comfortable and quiet overlooking the side street. 
There is car  parking available but the hotel is within walking distance of the Gothic section, Gaudi's Casa Batllo, and the Sagrada.
Service was great and appreciated. On checkout, I left behind some personnel items but did not realize it for a few days. The hotel had placed the items aside, and shipped the back to the US after a few calls and EMails. 
I recommend this Hotel and we would stay here again.",4,2015,11,22

11,Elegant hotel,"Located in a premier shopping area, this hotel is within walking distance of most tourist sites while not being in the middle of all the bustle.

The concierges are excellent in their recommendations and for securing tickets, and the accommodating staff is attuned to guests' needs.",5,2015,11,20
11,"Great hotel, great location, great staff","An elegant and well-maintained hotel in an excellent location and with helpful staff, including the concierge who kindly reserved tickets for us to various tourist sites.  We were upgraded to a Junior Suite which was very spacious and nicely furnished with a large balcony.  Although situated on a lower floor and facing the busy street in front of the hotel, because of soundproofing our room was quite quiet;  that, together with the comfortable bed, made for a good night’s rest.  About halfway through our stay we were distressed to hear hammering and drilling in the Chanel store beneath our room.  We called Customer Relations to find out how long this would be going on.  They told us the store was being renovated and offered to relocate us.  However, because we really liked our room and Customer Relations found out that going forward the noise would be restricted to hours when we would likely be out of our room, we decided to stay where we were and indeed there was little disturbance during the rest of our stay.  We were very pleasantly surprised when Customer Relations presented us with a bottle of cava the next day with apologies for any inconvenience regarding the construction.  Overall, we give this hotel very high marks overall with special recognition for the lovely room and the helpfulness and thoughtfulness of the Customer Relations department.",5,2015,11,19
11,Birthday and Anniversary trip away,"Firstly, to the Majestic, please accept my apologies for not completing this review earlier as it has been 4 months since our stay.  From the moment we arrived at the hotel, at around 12 noon, we were made to feel especially welcome.  We had arrived before the check in time, but were given a room straight away, which was very kindly upgraded for us, a great start to the break.  The hotel is in a fantastic location, surriounded by great restaurants, and the terrace bar at the top is perfect for winding down after a day of sightseeing, or for a nightcap after dinner.  

This trip was a Silver wedding Anniversary trip and coincidentally, was my wife's birthday as well.  We were looking for somewhere really special for dinner one evening, and Ingrid David, the hotel Guest Relations Manager, could not have been more helpful, booking us into a beautiful fish restaurant, Barceloneta, where we had the most amazing meal. Before we were due to go out, room service called, with a bottle of Cava, a bottle of Rioja and a delicious chocolate cake and sugared almonds, with a card wishing my wife a very Happy Birthday, signed by Ingrid on behalf of the hotel team, a lovely touch, and thank you so much.

We had 3 nights in the Majestic, and cannot recommend it highly enough, I travel around a lot with my work, and stay in a lot of hotels Worldwide, but I can honestly say that the Majestic is the most welcoming one of all, a huge thank you to Ingrid and the whole team, you made our stay very special.",5,2015,11,19
11,Lovely,"Luxurious 5* in a perfect location. Easy to get to from the airport. You can take the train direct from airport to passeig de Gracia station and the hotel is then a 2 minute walk.
The hotel has a great roof top bar that is slightly higher than the other buildings around it so you can get a full panoramic view of the city. ",5,2015,11,17
11,FANTASTIC SUNDAY BRUNCH,"We always book a Sunday Brunch when on a city break. This is by far one of the best.
The great experience begins when the Manager( I can't recall her name but she worked in Ireland for two years) made us feel so welcome.
Gregg, our waiter from France, made us the best Vermouth we had that weekend in Barcelona.
Elisa, from Holland made sure that nothing was too much trouble for her to ensure we both enjoyed our meal. Excellent and well trained staff are the hallmark of this establishment. I am still remembering the oysters, clams, cheese, and the fantastic display of food in the restaurant, not to mention the champagne. See you next time.",5,2015,11,17

11,Excellent stay with great service,"The hotel was fantastic.  The location is central, walking distance to most sights, and the hotel itself is surrounded by high end designer shops.  The service was efficient and the staff went the extra mile to help with every query and request.  There was never any time that they said no.  This was the first time we travelled with our little baby.  The hotel provided us with everything you would need with a little baby- a nice cot, a teddy bear, baby slippers, baby toiletries, etc.  This took a lot of stress out of the holiday.  The front reception staff, concierge, door staff, and guest relations all deserve recognition for the exceptional work that they do to make guests feel welcome at this splendid hotel.  I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel.",5,2015,11,15

The staff is accommodating and friendly. The rooms are lovely, the beds are uber comfortable, and the roof top bar is intimate with a 360 degree view of Barcelona. This 5 Star hotel lives up to its name. Magnificent breakfast buffet for an additional fee is money well spent. The Majestic Hotel is walking distance to everything!",5,2015,11,11
11,Beautiful hotel close to everything ,"This hotel was beautiful and quite the splurge for our honeymoon.  Good service (except for when the do not disturb sign was in the door and people still knocked) that went above and beyond.  Great complimentary breakfast buffet.  We loved the jamon and chorizo! They had very slow internet connection, if you need to use it. Otherwise, it was very nice and recommended for a splurge. ",4,2015,11,10
11,5 star Hotel with 5 star service,"Easy to find and located centrally enough to be able to walk to most places, the Majestic has the ambience of a classic 5 star hotel. From the greeting by the doorman, David, to the ease of check in. Luggage taken to the room and in the lift, hotel services explained by the porter. 
Beds were set as twin, but within minutes the housekeeping team arrived to re-make them as a massive super king sized bed with a 3 inch thick topper - so no zips!!
The balcony and design of the room was simple yet sophisticated and it all felt rather special.
It was a shame to only be here for one night before going up to Girona the next day, but we made the most of it with a very lively and late night in Barcelona.
We didn't eat in the hotel, but it all looked great.",5,2015,11,10
11,five stars vacation in Barcelona,"Majestic Hotel is one of the truly five star hotel. Let me start with check in, Everybody in the front desk are nice and smiling. All speaks English. The staff went with us in our to explained all of the features of the room. The rooms are large and clean. The bathrooms are quite large and clean. The breakfast are excellent. Good varieties of food including different types of juices, cheeses and meats. The only downside on our second day during ordering our omelets 11/4/15 the lady is stressed out and not friendly. The rest are very friendly. The fitness center is small but doable. There's 3 treadmills, 2 bikes, some free weights. The lobby is quite large and clean. They also offered some croissants and coffee early morning in the lobby. The location of the hotel is perfect within walking distance to all shopping centers including the famous Las Ramblas. ",5,2015,11,08
11,No breakfast @ Majestic for early risers,"Stayed there for 5 nights. It is a truly 5-star hotel with all of the luxury that there is. The location is great , close to metro and one of the main streets of Barcelona. The service is impeccable, I was in the bar area when I received a phone call and one of the servants showed me one of the chairs stating : this sir is your room. I was impressed.  The room is fine, I slept on the first floor well connected, wifi internet was a tad slow here but worked fine for e-mails. The fact that wifi came free is a bonus in a 5 star hotel such as this. Is all good? Well, all… no swimming pool (unless you call the rooftop bath tub a swimming pool) .The breakfast area only opens at 7 am. I am sorry but business life in Europe kicks in earlier and this is a missed opportunity. Please open at 6 am.",5,2015,11,07
11,Style and location,"This hotel had almost everything- room, view, service , but lacked a concierge level and, in our room (725), had a lack of Internet service despite checking with numerous people including engineers using multiple devices, over the entire stay. It appeared they were as frustrated as we were. The first night they sent an engineer up at 0030. They even offers to inconveniently change rooms though without an upgrade and sent us chocolate.
The suite had 1.5 bathrooms and was otherwise quite modern and spacious.",4,2015,11,06
11,Fantastic Hotel in the Heart of Barcelona,"We stayed at the Majestic recently for 3 nights.  The hotel was beautiful, the room spacious and well appointed, the service excellent and the buffet breakfast delicious and plentiful!  Loved both the rooftop terrace bar and lobby bar.  Concierge staff, particularly Marc, were exceptionally helpful.  When we're back in Barcelona we will definitely be staying at the Majestic!",5,2015,11,06
11,"Excellent location, staff needs more training","We stayed here for 3 nights at the beginning of October and I booked through the AMEX fine hotels program.  We arrived after 3:00PM and were told our room was not ready and that we should go to the roof top terrace bar to wait.  No apology was offered, nor was a complimentary drink offered for the inconvenience.  It was 45 minutes before we were told our room was ready.  There was a mixup and a staff member, who we thought was escorting us to the front desk escorted us to the bar while we waited as the bartender and the staff member spoke in Spanish.  Finally, we realized that there was a problem with someone's credit card at the terrace bar and the staff member thought it was our credit card.  My daughter had paid for her glass of wine with cash and it was not our credit card.  Another unfortunate delay before we were shown to our room.  I was supposed to receive certain benefits, including a voucher for the spa through the AMEX program, which was not delivered to our room until the next day. The bellboy was the nicest person we had met since entering the hotel.  The room was clean and the beds were very comfortable.  The bathroom was spacious but the water temperature in the shower kept changing from hot to cold. One evening, I saw a note that we had missed turndown service before 7:00PM.  I had been in the shower.  I called housekeeping to see if they could return and they did.  It seems turn down service was a little early as most people are getting ready for dinner before 8:00PM.  The concierge service was very helpful and friendly.  The breakfast was excellent.  The massage I had at the Spa was also excellent.   The location is terrific and I would stay here again.  I hope the front staff receives some more training in guest relations in the meantime.",4,2015,11,06
11,Beautiful hotel with great service,"The location is perfect, the hotel is beautiful and the staff were friendly and professional. The hotel bar in the lobby is classy and comfortable. There is a rooftop bar that has excellent views. The buffet breakfast is a large spread of all types of foods. You can eat inside or outside in an enclosed area that is very pretty. We found the room to have a very comfortable bed! Heaven! The bath products were excellent too. A lovely option when in Barcelona.",5,2015,10,31
11,Very Nice Hotel,"This hotel had a fabulous location, great patio bar/ restaurant with beautiful views of city. Service, well done. Also quiet piano bar in lobby. Our room was large, very comfortable, and quiet even though we were on second floor. Lower floors in Barcelona can be the best, tradition in Spain. Very nice breakfast buffet.",4,2015,10,31
11,Not only a fabulous hotel but concierge made sure I received best medical care,"We were supposed to be in Barcelona for five nights.  A bad fall at the Dali Museum involving marble steps that were freshly washed led to a nasty wrist fracture, surgery and an extended stay at the Majestic for two weeks.
We were already very pleased with the Majestic in every way but after my fall it deserves 6 stars. 
I was initially sent from Figueres Hospital (where I received excellent care, BTW) to an ER in Barcelona.  The doctors there told me that the wrist was shattered and NO ONE could give me back full range of motion.  Despite the pain, my husband and I had the wherewithal to leave against medical advice.  Not really knowing what we were going to do, we went back to the hotel.  This is where the amazing care began.  The concierge saw the mess I was in and kept thinking about how to best help me.  He not only got me to the clinic (Cugat Clinica at Queron Hospital) where most of the soccer players get their injuries fixed, but he connected me with a woman there that spoke English and she stayed with me until I was ok (Debora). Later, when I got back to the hotel, the concierge, Angel, told me that he kept calling to check up on me. Finally, the secretary at the clinic asked him:""Didn't you already call?"" He said: ""Yes, I will keep calling until I know my guest is there and ok."" 
The care I got at the Majestic and at the Cugat Clinica leave me with a warm wonderful feeling about Barcelona. Even though the hotel was filled to capacity when I returned from the hospital, they made room for us to stay for the full two weeks and treated us with kindness. 
On a more mundane note, the Majestic location is perfect to see everything!
As a follow up, I am well on my way to getting back full range of motion after needing 10 titanium screws and a plate to put my wrist back together.  After 5 weeks I am back to doing my tai chi.The doctor joked that I would be flamenco dancing soon.",5,2015,10,30
11,"Perfect location, amazing view, fantastic staff!","The Majestic hotel was the perfect combination of luxury and convenience for my vacation in Barcelona.  First, I had a junior suite (827) with my sister and it was very clean and spacious.  As a general rule I prefer to stay in hotels that are as nice as where I live and as clean.  It's not always easy to guarantee a really clean bathroom, even when reading the reviews.  If this is important to you then this hotel will fit the bill.  It's clean, very clean.  It's comfortable too, like after a long day out on the town seeing all the sights this place makes you feel at home.  The staff is kind and cheerful and when in a strange city there is nothing better than a smiling face to welcome you back home.  The roof top pool/lounge is the perfect place to wrap up your night.  The views are out of this world amazing (the building it taller than all others around it so you get the best view).",5,2015,10,29
11,Great 2nd time around!,"This is my second time in Majestic Hotel. I just came back after a 5 days stay for a medical congress. The first stay in 2010 was troubled by a lot of noise and hindered sleep. This time everything was perfect: the check-in swift and prompt, the lobby wide with lots of areas to sit in, the breakfast various and quite complete. I was a bit worried when we were placed on the first floor but i have to stay i was wrong. The room size was adequate, the bed was comfy and the sound isolation pretty well. The bathroom was large, uptodate and very clean, amenities were complete. Housekeeping very pleasant and vigilant. The location of the hotel (passag de gracia) is great on the edge of the shopping district and close to the major metro station. In general we did not have any complaints and it was truly a 5 stars experience. ",5,2015,10,29
11,Great hotel in Barcelona,"The Majestic was one of our very favorite hotels. Beautiful and comfortable, it was perfectly located and wonderfully maintained. The staff couldn't have been more welcoming or more helpful. We stayed for six nights and our room was very comfortable and kept very clean and well stocked. We loved this hotel",5,2015,10,28
11,Location location location!,"We stayed at Majestic Residences, just across the street from the actual hotel. We rented a 4 bedroom apartment, duplex with a beautiful veranda with fantastic views of Paseo de La Gracia. You have one included cleaning after a 7 days stay, but if you need you can pay for extra. We have access to hotel facilities and SPA, also room service. It is the best of the worlds. All privacy of your own home with all the comfort of a hotel. Location is hard to beat. You are close to the major sites, best stores and it is not far away from the beach. I highly recommend!",4,2015,10,28
11,Wish to visit again,"Have been to the Majestic on a show around to see the hotel with my travel partners and in spite of the hotel being full the top management took the time to show us around personally. Every person we met had the most welcoming smile

The chef treated us with some amazing and unforgettable delights we just didn't want to leave

Upon departure we were given their signature perfume in a personalized leather case that has your initials which was a great touch

The even greater gesture is that by the time we were leaving and because it was raining the GM offered us umbrellas as fare well gifts which we really appreciated

What a great hotel that I'm eager to visit again",5,2015,10,27
11,Fantastic  Hotel,"We recently visited here for a long weekend.
From arranging the stay direct with the hotel, arranging private pick up through the hotel, arrival, the room, the bar, the restaurant, the hotel location, but 'above all' the staff were all absolutely Fantastic.
Right in the middle of the decent shopping areas and eateries, easy reach of the tourist spots.
Definitely recommend.",5,2015,10,27
11,"Five-Star Hotel, Excellent Location","We were looking for a special hotel in Barcelona and we were not disappointed in the Majestic.  The room was very comfortable and the cleaning service excellent, both daytime and turndown service.  The hotel itself is very elegant.  The lobby is well appointed and always busy, but welcoming.  The rooftop is worth a visit, even if you're not staying here.  We were there in October, so it got a little chilly at night, but they provided warmed blankets.  There is also a small pool on the roof, which must be great when it's hot out.  The fitness center had everything I needed in terms of free weights, weight machines, and cardio.  It would be an excellent fitness center anywhere in the States.  
The location of the hotel is terrific.  While it is not right in the middle of the touristy spots, they are easy to reach from there.  We could walk to the Barrio Gottic in about 15 minutes and it was only a seven Euro cab ride.  In the evenings, we really appreciated being in the area around the hotel.  There are lots of great restaurants and the two nearby Gaudi houses are spectacular in the lights.
Perhaps the best thing about the Majestic, however, was the service.  You are really made to feel special.  In particular, the Concierge desk was helpful and friendly - and they spoke great English!  (We especially liked Marc.)",5,2015,10,25
11,Beautiful Barcelona,"My husband and I and another couple had a wonderful stay at the Majestic Hotel.  Our rooms, 733 and 229, were spacious with large marble bathrooms.  The breakfast was one of the very best we have experienced at a hotel.  The service was outstanding, and the attention from Alvaro Canales, in guest relations, was beyond our expectations.  The location was perfect, and we walked to many of the sights and restaurants.  I would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone planning to visit Barcelona.",5,2015,10,24
11,Wonderful,"This hotel was great!  Our room was beautiful with a great view. The bed was very comfortable,the sheets luxurious.  The roof top bar should not be missed the views of the city are spectacular.  The location was great walking distance to most everywhere we wanted to go. Very courteous staff! ",5,2015,10,23
11,"We had reserved a double deluxe room, and what we got was a Deluxe Single","The room we got was very small. The bathroom was so small that if my husband was washing hishands I had to be outside because we did not fit. It only had  a wash basin.
I think it was a deluxe single. It would have been excellent for one man alone,or any one person, defenitelly not for two.
Apart from this the hotel was very pleasant, the service was good. I do not know if I would go back.",3,2015,10,22
11,Best 5-star hotel in Barcelona,"The hotel was absolutely amazing! The rooms were large, extremely well-designed and comfortable. The breakfast in the morning was a feast, including many sausages and hams from the Catalonian region as well as cheeses (the goat cheese in olive oil was the best for sure, so make sure to try it!). It also had a great selection of different fruits, eggs, breads etc. Everything you could wish for a breakfast, was present there! Moreover, be sure to check out the rooftop bar, it had some absolutely amazing views on the city. Just if you go on a colder season, make sure to bring some coats or warm sweaters, as it can get pretty chilly up there. I absolutely loved my stay in Majestic hotel, the service was great and everyone was extremely friendly! To be honest, it is one of my favourite 5-star hotels. I would for sure stay in this hotel the next time I visit Barcelona and would suggest everyone to do so too!",5,2015,10,22
11,Barcelona 4 nights,"Everything at the hotel was perfect.  Do not miss the rooftop bar and restaurant. Also, if you're there on a Sunday, don't miss the afternoon brunch.  The location is perfect for local restaurants and tourism.",5,2015,10,19
11,Five Star Review,"Barcelona was our last stop from a 12 day cruise that originated in Istanbul.
We decided to book The Majesticc Hotel as it came highly recommended by a friend.

This Hotel was amazing. First of all it is located right on Passieg de Gracias and close to everything. Breakfast was included and a feast for the eyes. Great assortment of cheeses, ham, salamis, baked goods, fresh fruit of every kind and a special section that made omelettes to order. Service was impeccable!

Our Hotel room was beautifully decorated with white marble floors, a separate shower and beautiful soaker tub. Double sinks and the amenities provided were ""Bvlgari"" Everyroom comes with dressing gowns and slippers and has a mini bar and safe.
The beds were very comfortable and had the perfect pillows.  (Most are too hard or lumpy)

John who delivered our luggage was good enough to give us some recommendations for Tapas Bars which did not disappoint, one of which we went to 4 times ""Vinitus"", only 4 blocks away.

The Consierge staff especially Mario were most helpful to arrange for tickets for The Sagrada Familia Tour as well as our air tickets to Brussels. Now that is service!!

Can`t wait to go back to Barcelona!! Next time longer.  Love Spain!!

11,A Good Hotel in the Best Location,"My wife and I just stayed 5 days in the Hotel Majestic and enjoyed it very much. This was the second time that we stayed in this hotel. We stayed in Room 631, which had a partial view of the street, with a door leading to a small balcony on the façade of the hotel. There were two single beds side by side. The beds were very comfortable. Each bed had two pillows, a large one and a smaller one. The headboard was made of black leather. On each side of the combined bed there were two wall mounted lamps, one of them for reading. There was a small table on each side of the bed.

The room had a wall to wall carpet with a gray color. The room was decorated with a striped wallpaper and one side of the room had blackout drapes with a similar design of stripes. There was a black classical desk with convenient electrical outlets over it. Beside the desk was an upholstered chair covered with a black fabric. Over the desk were two wall lamps. There was also a large flat TV set over the desk and the TV had many international TV stations. At one corner of the room there was an upholstered arm chair with a black color. 

The bathroom had a toilet, a sink and a large walk-in shower. The bathroom was clad with grey marble, making it elegant. However the marble could also have been ceramic tile that simulated marble. Nowadays one cannot tell the difference. The shower had a hand held shower and also a very good rain shower. There were two closets for clothes. One of the closets had a full length mirror. A third closet had the minibar.

The room was quite large and comfortable. There was no noise at all from the street and we could sleep well in the room. We were very satisfied with the room. 

The El Patio Restaurant was where the breakfast buffet was served. This was a large salon adjacent to the garden, with plenty of greenery. The salon was light colored and the columns were faced with mirrors,  that made the room quite elegant. There were two side rooms where the food was kept. At one corner there was a cook, making the fried eggs or omelets that the customers wanted. There was a very wide variety of food and bread, fruits (especially strawberries), and pastries. There were many waiters and waitresses who were very attentive and gave very good service. There was also cava for those who wanted it. At the entrance desk there were many Spanish and English language newspapers. This was one of the best breakfast buffets I have experienced in Spain and Europe.  

The staff of the hotel impressed me because they were very friendly, attentive and helpful. All of them had smiles on their faces. You could see that they were all very well trained. I did not see any grumpy person on the staff. All of the staff wanted us to have a good time at the hotel. I think this factor is the most important for me when I judge the quality of the hotel I stay in. All of them were dressed in black uniforms. All the staff spoke English. There were several young people from other countries who were trainees, and they were all pleasant to talk to. 

The hotel is located at the Passeig de Gracia, the most sophisticated street in the city, with many fashionable stores nearby. The street is the 5th Avenue of Barcelona. This is the best area to stay in Barcelona and it is the reason I chose this hotel. It is completely safe and one can walk to the Plaza de Catalunya, which is downtown. The side streets are filled with small and interesting boutiques. The street also has many of the important modernist buildings that the city is famous for. 

A small supermarket near the hotel is the Supermercat at Aragon, 284.

I have one place to recommend to readers. It is Enric Rosich Macarons, located at the small Bulevard Rosa mall (Passeig de Gracia, 53), which is across the street from the hotel. The store has the best macarons in Spain! The best buy is the box containing 24 macarons with many varieties, and this costs 30 euros. I am a macaron fan and buy them everywhere I find them. 

My only complaint about the hotel is that our room had only 6 clothes hangers total in the two closets.  Hangers are very inexpensive and I expect that a 5 star hotel will have many more hangers.  I hope that the hotel management will correct this situation.",5,2015,10,18
11,Great roof bar with view,"The roof bar  is named La Dolce Vitae, and a sweet life it is to enjoy cocktails with this view.  Great drinks, good service, and great views.  Grab a drink and a bite mid-day.  A bit pricey, but it is a 5-star hotel and how many times will you be in Barcelona?",5,2015,10,18
11,Majestic!,"Located along Passeig de Gracia, Barcelona's Majestic Resort and Spa is truly a gem of the city. Possessing an old world charm, its well-appointed rooms offer refuge after a busy day in this bustling metropolis. The hotel's restaurants serve Catalan and continental dishes while its bar is good for a relaxing time out. A bit pricey, yes, but worth a splurge once in a while.",5,2015,10,18
11,Probably the best place I've ever stayed,"I spent five nights with a friend in one of the flats across the street from the hotel in early October.  It was a perfect home base for visiting the city, and was a really beautiful apartment.  We booked a 2BR, 2Ba flat with balcony overlooking the Psg de Gracia.  

We arrived about 9:30, coming off a cruise.  We were met at the curb, bellmen took our luggage and we were escorted to a private checkin desk.  Our flat was ready for us, which was a nice surprise.  We were escorted to the flat, shown the basics and settled in.  The apartment was huge - 860 sq ft, 12' ceilings and beautiful hardwood floors throughout.  Nicely furnished, clean and contemporary.  Full kitchen, and great bathrooms. Beds were comfortable.

The location is perfect - very convenient for Gaudi touring, the Ramblas, metro, anything you want to see is easily accessible.  

It was a fantastic stay, and I'd recommend it.  A few minor things could be improved:
We called the front desk perhaps three times during the stay.  The phone would ring 20 times or more before being answered, and the operator had a tough time understanding we wanted ""paper towels for the kitchen.""  We got toilet paper instead.
In most flats I've stayed in, the leftover nonperishable items like salt and pepper, tea or coffee, simple basics, from prior guests are left in a cabinet for future guests to use.  Majestic appears to clear those out, so every guest starts over from scratch.  

Again, these are minor quibbles.  This is my new favorite places in Barcelona.",5,2015,10,17
11,Right hotel in the right location,"This hotel was beautiful and located within easy walking distance of many parts or Barcelona,  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely stay here again when we return, and like everyone else we know, we will return. ",5,2015,10,16
11,Really nice experience.,"I stayed at this hotel for a week while attending a conference in Barcelona. The hotel is well located, close to a central subway station and close to many historic venues. Many good restaurants in the area as well. The hotel itself is really beautiful, well maintained, clean and calm. Rooms are really nice with enough space, good lighting, beautiful marble bathroom with a spacious shower and a comfortable/clean bed. Everyone at the hotel was nice and helpful. The concierge offered us great advices on restaurants. The rooftop bar offers great drinks and an amazing view of Barcelona. This hotel is definitely worth it.",5,2015,10,16
11,Very Good ,I have spent two nights in this hotel during my visit to Barcelona. The hotel located in the heart of the city in the middle of the shopping area and a couple of kilos from the old city. I have stayed in the junior suite which was made of a bedroom and a separate setting area. The bed room was small in size with barely enough room to place your suit case. The setting area was ok in size with a small sofa and a study desk.  The minibar had a nespresso machine with capsules that you have to pay for each usage. The breakfast buffet was good with good quality food. ,4,2015,10,15
11,Amazing Experience.,"After months of researching Barcelona hotels, we decided to stay at the Majestic  Residence in a 2 bedroom apartment. We are so glad we did!! As frequent travellers we are quite particular with hotels and this one far exceeded our expectations. 
Location is unbeatable right in the heart of Placa de Gracia. 
The apartment was beautifully appointed, with modern ammenities and very spacious for a family of 4. Even though our apartment was not serviced daily ( this can be arranged at an additional fee) however you do get one complimentary clean and towels are replaced daily on demand. The beds were a dream, like sleeping on a cloud, the best sleep ever in a hotel.
Customer service was outstanding. Friendly, informative and always helpful.
Rooftop pool although crowded at times, a lovely retreat from the heat and the crowds.
Overall a very memorable stay and can't wait to go back!",5,2015,10,15
11,Hotel Review,"The Service was Amazingly excellent , perfect location in a luxury street near all attractions of Barcelona  , very good service and I would like to thank especially MR.Friedrek for his amazing and polite way and service to us , thank you",5,2015,10,15
11,very nice Hotel with a great location,"we had a very good experience at hotel, the room was comfortable, clean and spacious. itl is very well located within walking distance for  shopping, museums restaurants and coffee shop, buses... the lobby is nice, and the food is great but we didn't like the  the restaurant located in -1. the staff was nice but since the hotel was fully booked, staff very busy, we couldn't get nice recommendations for nice restaurants from the concierge !!!! 
we had the chance to stay next to ""La Rambla"" but very happy we didn't, because the majestic has a better quiet and nice location",5,2015,10,15
11,Great hotel but lock your valuables,"Stayed 5 days while attending a conference with many others in my company. Beds very comfortable, similar to memory foam. The housekeeping was immaculate with turn down service in the evening. They have a beautiful and delicious breakfast each day. The one negative is that many of my colleagues had items taken from their rooms--even items that weren't what one would consider valuable like a coat. Management was made aware of this issue. In fact, one coworker reviewed the key log and learned that his room had been accessed 7 different times in one day. Just beware. Otherwise a great place to stay. ",4,2015,10,14
11,The devil is in the details - not a 5 star experience,"This was a good hotel and an overall good quality for value.  However, it's definitely not a 5 star experience.  Pros include: Great location, great views from select rooms, beautiful views from the terrace, extensive breakfast selection that starts early, great beds for excellent sleep quality.

Now for the growing pains...

1) Service - We arrived after 3pm and our room was not ready.  We were told it was because they were completely booked.  I had the impression that they felt we should have been lucky to get a room and not be upset over the inconvenience.  We waited on the terrace for about 45 minutes and were not even offered a complementary drink.
2) Shower - nice design but water consistently changed from freezing to scalding
3) Misleading costs -Never assume anything is complementary, not even the coffee and tea (which normally is in other hotels).  Also, upon arriving, the sign in the lobby said ""this way for your welcome drink""  sounds like it's free right?  Nope just a ploy to get you to the bar
4) Other - while the breakfast selection is amazing , on last day my mother found hair in her nutella (which guests put on their plates from a communal bowl) - probably an isolated incident but yuck all the same. The terrace is lovely and should be a place for guests to enjoy and relax.  Yet, while the pool is also there, one gets the distinct impression that ordering food and drinks (both which are way overpriced even for a hotel) is required.  

We booked early so we had great value. Still, what it comes down to is the experience.  It's like having a BMW exterior with an average engine.  Would I book again, probably for the location and value but definitely not because it was a 5 or even 4 star experience.",3,2015,10,13
11,One of the loveliest hotel we've ever stayed in!,"After a long flight from the U. S., arriving at the Majestic was like a breath of fresh air! From the rooms to all the friendly and helpful staff, we were very impressed! The room was elegant and the beds were very comfortable. The complimentary breakfast was much more than we expected and it was delicious! Check-in and Check-out was a breeze. The hotel is very well located within walking distance of shopping, museums and parks. 
We were on our trip for two weeks and honestly this was our very best experience!",5,2015,10,12
11,Majestic Barcelona,We were a travelling party of 12 with 5 children who had a fantastic time at the Majestic. The location was perfect with endless shopping choices and many restaurants. We had a Junior Suite and an Executive Suite which were both spacious and comfortable. Others in our group had similar rooms that where very nice but lacked natural light. The roof top pool and bar was great and our children where always welcome. We would definitely stay there again.,4,2015,10,11
11,Super location,"Majestic may be the best choice for someone visiting this city for the first time as it is at a corner of Passeig de Gracia, a block from in each direction from two Gaudi buildings, Casa Mila and Casa Batllo, and a quick taxi ride from Sagrada Familia, plus within walking distance from a lot of great tapas restaurants. The rooms in this hotel are very small but we were lucky after some effort of the front desk staff, in particular Francesco to find a reasonably sized room in the executive deluxe category. We had nice big marble bathroom with two sinks, a shower, a tub, and toilet. Our beds could be more comfortable and the sheets needed to be tucked properly before we used the bed. The terrace bar has great views of the city but be cautious as it is a rip off in prices. We were pleasantly surprised to find Francesco at or near the front desk almost every day of our five day stay. Both him and Ingrid at the concierge desk graciously helped us plan our sightseeing itinerary. We also appreciated the concierge who made us our dinner rsv.s in the evenings.",4,2015,10,11

11,Excellent hotel in a great location,"The hotel has benefited from a relatively recent refurbishment.  The common areas are excellent and the staff were friendly and helpful.  The room was of a good size and high quality with a good sized bathroom and good quality products.  The breakfast was excellent with a great selection of food.  The only issue being it was very busy at 9am on a Sunday morning but to be expected.

A great hotel is an excellent location for shopping and sight seeing.",5,2015,10,11

Exactly as shown in the pictures on the web site.The Majestic Residence is located in a great area of the city; restaurants and tapas bars, shopping, art and architecture just outside the door. Staff was very attentive, friendly and fluent in english.A wonderful place!",5,2015,10,09
11,Very nice hotel.,"This hotel was in a really good location for us. We had friends who stayed on La Rambla, and it was quite busy, so it was nice to get back to the calm and serenity of the Majestic. The service was exceptional, the view from the roof top terrace was beautiful, the decor was lovely and very friendly and helpful staff.  Loved the pianist in the downstairs seating area as well. I would definitely stay here again.",4,2015,10,09
11,Best of Barcelona,"My view is that every guest is treated like he or she is the only guest. From the cab arrival and greeting, to the registration, to the concierge service, the friendly smile from every staff member, the amazing dining room and bar area service. It was all very much appreciated. ",5,2015,10,09
11,Majestic Late September 2015,"The Majestic is a very busy establishment.  However, the hotel was more than adequately staffed to meet the needs of its customers.  The facility was immaculately clean, the staff was at all times courteous and exceptionally capable of serving your needs.  The restaurant was top notch.  ",5,2015,10,09
11,Let down by having to repeatedly asking for things,"We had a junior suite as our son was with us. We had to ask repeatedly for more pillows, cups and saucers and glasses as only enough for 2 people were provided. This happened on more than one day. I do not expect this from a top class hotel that knew 3 people would be in the room. Room service kept trying to give us more towels and bath robes which we did not need!
Swim trunks from prev guest found behind sofa.
Staff very friendly though and breakfast excellent.",3,2015,10,09
11,The Magical Majestic,"This is a must do experience

11,Fabulous Hotel and Location!,"Our three night stay at the Majestic Hotel Barcelona was an exceptionally enjoyable vacation experience!  It is an excellent luxury hotel in every respect and is extremely well located near numerous famous Barcelona sites.  Our  room was well appointed, clean, and well maintained, the staff persons were friendly and helpful, and the roof top lounge is one of the best views of Barcelona.  We will look forward to staying at the Majestic again when we visit Barcelona again and highly recommend this hotel to all.  ",5,2015,10,09
11,Wonderful Stay at Majestic,"We stayed in the apartments accross the street from the hotel and it was perfect for a family with a kitchen, huge living room, 2 bedrooms and washer/dryer. We had access to all the facilites at the hotel and spent most evenings at the roofdeck restaurant.",5,2015,10,09
11,Truly Majestic,My husband and I stayed at the Majestic for our honeymoon. Our room was  upgraded and upon arrival we had a bottle of Cava and chocolates! The hotel staff was superb and concierge helped book us at top attractions so we didn't need to wait in lines. The rooftop pool was pricey but the hotel gave us a dining and drinking credit which we used there. The location is fantastic and we walked everywhere! ,5,2015,10,09
11,Great location,"Overall, this hotel was decent. The location is fantastic as you can get to 2 different metro lines within 1 to 2 blocks. There are also great tapas restaurants, shopping and sights within walking distance.  Also, the hotel was kind enough to let us check in an hour early and check out an hour late. 
I certainly would not consider this a 5 star hotel though. I paid extra for a ""city view"" room, and was given a room with 1 tiny window in the corner. It's difficult to enjoy a view with such a small window.  I was also charged 7.5 euros apparently for having some extra coffee pods and creamer brought to my room. I was under the impression this was ""complimentary"". I didn't have time to argue the charge as I had to get to the airport, but I believe I was overcharged. ",3,2015,10,09

11,"Great hotel, perfect location","The Majestic is a top-notch hotel with beautiful, clean rooms, friendly service and the fantastic roof-top pool and bar area. We stayed in a Deluxe Room at the Majestic for four nights in September 2015.  The only thing I would have liked is a bath tub - our room only provided a shower.  ",5,2015,10,09

11,Well located luxury hotel with spacious rooms,Great location for tourists with quality staff. The rooms are spacious and luxurious. I would have rated it excellent but my room had no external light which was the only thing that distracted from my stay.

11,Hotel Majestic - perfect place to host our stay in Barcelona,"The room was well designed with lush bathrobes and bed to make our arrival (after the 9.5 hr flight) a welcome sight.  We were able to check in on arrival (10 am) and was a perfect way to rest, relax and rejuvenate before our day-long bus tour of the city.  Princess escorts and arrival were perfect - helpful, friendly and informative.  A great way to start our vacation on the cruise.  Rooftop bar, dining was an unexpected delight- beautiful view from the top.",5,2015,10,07
11,Amazing Hotel in an Amazing City,"My girlfriend and i returned from a 4 day stay at the Majestic in Barcelona and can easily say, without hesitation, that the Majestic is the most elegant hotel we have ever stayed in (and we travel quite a bit). This exquisite hotel is located in a high-end, main avenue, surrounded by excellent shopping and dining. The hotel itself was immaculately kept and completely spotless at all times. We stayed in an Executive Room, which was quite large and had a great bed. What makes the Majestic stand out, however, is the outstanding level of customer service that we experienced throughout our stay and at all times - whether it was 7am or 2am.  Every single employee that we encountered, from the cleaning staff, to the front desk staff, concierge, bartender and door man, were highly professional and polite. Each of them should be commended because it is this type of attention and service that has a tremendous influence on a guest's experience, and ultimately, on the hotel's reputation. We were always greeted by the polite staff, who went out of their way to be of assistance and always seemed pleased to do so. 
   The rooftop bar at the Majestic offers great drinks and food (try the lobster salad and Joselito bikini ham and cheese) and a terrific view of the Barcelona skyline - they even have a wading pool!
    Travelers looking for a luxury hotel have many choices, but the extraordinary customer service at the Majestic should help make the decision that much easier. I would not hesitate for a second to choose this hotel again the next time we return!",5,2015,10,07
11,Had a great time in a great location,"Excellent location and good facilities , a little on the expensive side but location made up for it. Outside alfresco service very poor and staff not the best. 
Good hotel staff and service. Would recommend location .",4,2015,10,07
11,Quick stay in Barcelona,"We needed a place for a quick stay before boarding our ship in Barcelona. The Majestic was perfect. It was very comfortable, central to everything and provided a nice romantic weekend before setting sail! We would definitely stay again.",5,2015,10,07
11,Almost perfect!,"Stayed here 4 night on business. Checkin was a breeze. Rooms were clean, AC worked great, and room had all amenities. BUT to use the coffee machine in the room they charge you 1 euro! Ridiculous! I have never seen a hotel charge for in room coffee. So petty!!!
Gym and bar were great, great location. ",4,2015,10,07
11,Beautiful stay,"We spent 3 nights here and were very pleased with our stay. This is a lovely, well appointed hotel in Barcelona's most elegant, convenient district.  Eager to please staff and the breakfast buffet,  which was included in our package, was definitely worth it. Really spectacular. Excellent concierge. ",5,2015,10,07
11,Great Location! Excellent Service!,"Visited Picasso Museum, and magnificent “incomplete” La Sagrada Famillia.
Hotel had a great location. Near many attractions like Casa Mila La Pedraza and Casa Ballou Casa Amatller. Had a marvelous decoration. Service: fantastic. Very responsive. Had a welcome “gift” on the desk/bed to enjoy. Bedroom/bath: nice and clean. A magnificent and huge dining room. Breakfast: plenty of choices with cook-to-order dishes.",5,2015,10,06
11,"Gracious, Lovely and Do not miss the Rooftop Bar","Perfect location with quiet understated elegance and very professional helpful and gracious staff. The rooftop terrace is not to be missed. We ended every day and started every evening with drinks and snacks and amazing 145 degree view of Barcelona . the roof bar was a mix of guests and locals. Jeronimo, jaine and barbie delivered excellent service.",5,2015,10,05
11,Definitely Five Star!,"Barcelona was the culmination of a two week train tour of mid to southern Spain. The Majestic Hotel and Spa shined as a true five star hotel. The staff went out of their way in terms of customer service! The hotel itself was beautiful and luxurious, not to mention the location which was near all of the sites Barcelona has to offer. The rooftop terrace and pool were offered truly majestic views of the entire city. Would return again and again!",5,2015,10,05
11,September 2015,"Majestic hotel Barcelona

We stayed in September 2015 and would not return. 

One the elevator is so small that four people can barely fit. With one corpulent person it would be impossible. 

Two. There are no king-size beds so we requested two singles joined. But there is no linen to accommodate two single beds and the two are on wheels so if you want to put them together you're likely to fall into the crack and leaning against the headboard while reading causes the bed to separate from the headboard. 

Three. We were on the east side of the hotel facing the side street (Valencia) in one of the larger rooms facing that way and we had a tiny balcony large enough for one person with the door leading to it. Other than that there were no windows, just a curtained wall. Somewhat claustrophobic.  Other rooms in the new wing (ours was the last room in the original building) facing same way on our level had no balcony. Rooms in the original building  appear (from outside at least) to have double windows and balcony. 

Four: No clock in the room and thermostat is a read out screen that's hard to see even in good light. 

Five:  One Continental breakfast in the room is €29 but if you add toast its an additional €15. We ordered four bottles of water and they came with a bill for €37. We complained and got a credit back, perhaps because we were staying there five nights.  The room is so small that there's no place to have breakfast other than on the single desk.  But there's a small grocery one block north on corner of Valencia and Pau Claris. 

Six:   One of the advantages is La Consentida restaurant directly across Passeig de Gracia where, if you're tired of tapas,  you can share one (1) Moncho's house salad and one (1) roasted chicken large enough for two plus three glasses of wine and two waters for around €40.

Unforgettable, Majestic!

Where do I begin, we spend 6 wonderful days at this fabulous hotel.  

From check in to check out we felt welcome, important, and where never disappointed with any aspect of our stay. Location wonderful, but what we remember is the friendly, happy staff from door men, breakfast staff, cleaning staff, probably  the best roof top pool-bar staff I  have ever been to, and we have been to many. Sunday brunch was unforgettable. 
Our room was immaculate, Quite,  comfortable, well appointed with a  view of the Gaudi House.
This hotel was one of the reasons our Barcelona  trip is so memorable. 
Bravo to this hotel. 
",5,2015,10,04
11,Worst five star hotel I've ever stayed,"Decided to stay here given references for travel agency (tip #1 - never trust your travel agent ) . Generally, a super crowed hotel which is fine given its location. However, we got a very old room looking nowhere (we paid for a standard 400€). The hot water system was not constant and rather spotty. We were two days without Internet!,, The buffet is over crowed and for a strange reason they have two buffet islands setups but they one operate with one making it busy and rather uncomfortable. 
It is definitely overrated and overpriced.   For this price range you may get a nice room at nearby 5 Starr hotels as the Mandarin. Not a pleasant experience at all, given the beautiful city and the many options to stay.",1,2015,10,04
11,Great Hotel with a Personalized attention.,"This Hotel is in a great location. We received an excellent service from the whole staff. The concierge Ingrid, was superb and very kind. She gave us detailed information about places to visit with directions. The barman Joan, at the lounge and the terrace, prepared our unique cocktails "" a la carte "". The breakfast menu was great. We will definitely  coming back to the Majestic.",5,2015,10,03

      ",5,2015,10,03
11,Great Experience/ First Class Service in Barcelona!,"This was our first visit to Barcelona and we were very happy we chose to stay in the Majestic Hotel.  The staff truly provided OUTSTANDING, FIRST CLASS service from the bellhops to the front desk and room service.  We chose to stay here during our pre and post cruise for a couple days.  The taxi ride to the port was relatively close - about a 15 minute ride.  

We stayed at the Residence across the street since we were a family and wanted more space along with the washer/dryer.  Rooms were very clean, nice large size apartment and probably one of the safest areas in the city.  Great location since you can still walk to a lot places and the hotel is centrally located between the Gaudi building architectures.  The rooftop views at the pool are unbelievable!  Pool is a little on the smaller side but it's nice to have a pool given many of the city hotels in the area do not have that luxury.  The costs for the food and drinks at the rooftop bar is on the higher side.  All in all, I would definitely recommend the Majestic Hotel and would absolutely come back again!  Thank you to the staff for a great experience!",5,2015,10,03
11,Majestic stay in Barcelona,"We stayed at the Residence section of the hotel, which is across the road from the main Hotel building. We had a two bed room apartment so we used the smaller one for our luggage as the main bedroom was relatively small but adequate. The facility of a kitchen, washing machine and drier was very convenient as we had been traveling for almost two weeks and had a fair bit of wash.
The location of the hotel is excellent and everything is within walking distance. The terrace on the top floor of the Hotel is very nice for a relaxing break early in the evening.
We enjoyed our stay there and will defenitly return to it if we visit again.",4,2015,10,03
11,Luxury and Attention to Details,"I was fortunate to stay at the Majestic Hotel for a small conference.  This hotel offers classic luxury, with great attention to details.  The entire staff is extremely professional and attentive and all spoke fluent English.  The Concierge staff, in particular, provided personalized recommendations for attractions, restaurants, and shopping.  They arranged for reservations, ordered online tickets and provided detailed directions for each establishment.  This really opened the city of Barcelona to me.  The breakfast was stocked with a large variety of delicious fresh food and even offered a glass of Cava.  I would definitely return to the Majestic Hotel for business travel.",5,2015,10,03

The hotel is a pleasure to enter with a spacious feel and a wonderful musk cologne smell.The guest lounge is clean,comfortable with ( faux) travertine- like columns.A great selection of wine
Breakfast room on 1st floor was excellent indoor and outdoor seating . The roof pool a nice touch ( a bit small and cool)but fab views,pool-lounges and seating friendly great service and tasty food.
Location is excellent in an upmarket district surrounded  fine boutiques and Tapas bars. A 30 min + walk  to port and close to most tourist attractions. We were impressed how extra staff came to help at front desk when things got  busy. Quite a brilliant hotel

11,Great apartment for a three day stay,"With our daughter and son-in-law, we stayed in one of the Majestic's two bedroom apartments for three days. It was perfect for our needs - clean, quiet, spacious and beautifully decorated. We really appreciated the extremely well-equipped kitchen (dishwasher, microwave, huge refrigerator, washer and separate dryer).  It was an added bonus to be able to use the facilities of the hotel itself, just across the street. The amenities, staff and location could not have been better. Highly recommended!!",5,2015,10,02
11,Classic Luxury,This is not my first trip to Barcelona. I have stayed in other hotels on the  passeig de Gracia hotels. We chose the Junior suite and enjoyed every single moment of our hotel stay.

11,Excellent property - brilliantly located.,"We really enjoyed staying here.  Facilities were amazing. Location brilliant.  Staff really lovely.  The room was very nice and very quiet.  The bathroom was lovely.   We particularly liked the lovely shower gels/shampoo/body lotion - all excellent quality and a real treat.

Our luggage was delayed and the concierge staff was super in helping us track the delivery and getting it to our rooms.

      ",5,2015,10,02
11,Above and Beyond My Expectations- An excellent place to stay in the heart of Barcelona,"Having lived in Barcelona for a semester during college, I was both excited and a bit apprehensive about traveling back for a vacation. I can honestly say it took hours of my time scouring hotel reviews trying to decide which were being most accurately depicted in their photos and would best suit our needs.

 My boyfriend and I took a trip there the end of August, and could not have been more happy with our choice staying at the Majestic Hotel & Spa Barcelona. Firstly, the hotel itself was magnificent and far exceeded my expectations. The service was outstanding. Upon arrival, my bags were taken and I was escorted to check in. To be honest, I had had an awful flight and was quite exasperated from travel. The manager and associates at check-in were not only overly helpful, but believably empathetic to my frustrations. I was greatly taken care of, and made comfortable immediately. It's often the little acts of kindness that really make a person's day. I can honestly say that at the Majestic, the staff went out of their way to be kind to me and provide me with an amazing stay that I will not soon forget. I truly enjoyed the people that I met there and learned what it means to stay at a luxury hotel. Instead of just another faceless guest, I was greeted by name each day and remembered. That is a great touch and something more hotels should make note of. 

To speak of the edifice itself, the hotel is beautifully decorated and the rooms are impeccable with amazing natural light. We stayed in a junior suite and it was absolutely perfect. The beds were comfortable, the bathroom was gorgeous, and the balcony overlooking Passieg de Gracia was perfect. 

The rooftop has probably the best view of the city, unless you are up at Mount Tibidabo I do not think you will be able to take in more from one vantage point. The pool was great, as was the service at the roof. I also visited the spa and had a massage, which was lovely. I could have stayed in the hotel the entire time and that would have been enough of a vacation without even exploring the city. 

The concierge were extremely knowledgeable and quick to make reservations at our request. I could go on and on here, but I think I've made my point. If you are looking to stay near the beach, there are a couple of great hotels that I hope to one day check out---but to be in the heart of the city -- the Majestic Hotel & Spa is a done deal! 

My tip: Include the breakfast with your room. Unbelievable spread, worth it! ",5,2015,10,02
11,Top notch,"We enjoyed nearly everything about the experience..the breakfasts were excellent as was dinner.  Loved the rooftop bar and cafe in the evenings.  Great location.

I would prefer a slightly larger room as our room sememed very small, even though the bathroom was spacious.  ",5,2015,10,02
11,Very nice and great hotel,"Am staying in this hotel since 2011 and coming to Barcelona tow or three times a year and am staying only in this hotel serives very great, people wonderful ,rooms very clean ,location perfect , I recommend this hotel to all the people wanna stay in very good hotel

11,Experience to remember,"Great location, helpful staff, spacious rooms--this hotel was certainly one that we would return to if visiting Barcelona. It is away from the touristy Las Ramblas but still manages to provide quick pedestrian access to major tourist destinations (Casa Batllo, La Pedrera) and trendy restaurants.

The hotel was beautiful, staff was friendly, attentive and helpful, the rooms were clean and comfortable and the location was excellent - near high end shopping and restaurants..

11,Grand Hotel in Prime Upscale Shopping Area,"The nearby shops are Gucci, Prada, LVuitton, and the level of service at Hotel Majestic is at a similar high standard.If your tastes and shopping budget lead you to these fine stores, then the Majestic is the hotel for you.We stayed at the Majestic in 2011 and four years later we can say it is better than ever. The staff are all professionally cordial, as you would expect at a 5 star hotel. We were upgraded to suite 905 which has a lovely terrace and East and South exposures. To the East there is a distant view of Gaudi's Sagrada Familia basilica. Unique to the Majestic, there is a small swimming pool with bar service on the tenth floor...a welcome oasis after a day of shopping!

It is a healthy walk, mostly dowhill to Ramblas. Most people will find the Port area to be beyond walking distance.

The suite was large and comfortable. The decorating style is what I would call rustic chic, although more chic than rustic. (In a city and region that takes pride in design, it would be disppointing if this were just another St. Regis/Ritz Carlton interior!) The breakfast buffet was very elaborate. One caution is that breakfast was priced at 75 Euro.for two. Our booking included breakfast and I would encourage anyone to shop for a similar deal.",5,2015,09,30
11,Flawless,"Our four night stay in a small suite with large terrace on the 9th floor was wonderful, without flaw. The breakfasts were lovely, too. My partner and I wouldn't even think of staying anywhere else in Barcelona.",5,2015,09,30
11,"Comfy, Great Location, Great service, Very friendly","This is a fine hotel that I would hapily return to. In the heart of the high end shopping district, near a subway stop, a block from Gaudi's Casa Batlo, near Las Rambla, The gothis Area, The port area - you get my drift, a perfect location.

Service was outstanding. Any info and sevices available from the well staffed concierge is available. English widely spoken except for the cleaning staff.

Very comfortable hotel with one of the most comfortable beds I've encountered in a hotel. Beutifully decorated and maintained. Extremely quiet, and immune to any road noise in my room or in the public areas.

11,"Spacious rooms, good food","We booked through the Leading Hotels of the World and  got a complementary upgrade to a large junior suite as well as a late check-out so we could sit in comfort here rather thanin a pokey airport lounge.

Room is large and bright (although no view), with a huge and comfortable bed with a 3 inch memory foam top that makes this an exceedingly comfortable place to sleep.

One 24-seat venue serves good food for dinner ( I had the roast pork; my husband the entrecote) and there is  large breakfast buffet included in the room price in the main dining room which is open for breakfast and for lunch.

Rooftop bar adjacent to the swimming pool and a lovely bar on the main floor with a piano player completes the drinks and dining offering.",5,2015,09,27
11,Perfect location and hospitality,We stayed at Majestic Hotel Barcelona for 3 nights and I highly recommend it. Its location is very convenient to catch city tour buses or to reach Av. Diagona and Placa de Catalunya which is the main square. The staff is very well trained and offer boutique services. The rooms are cleaned twice a day. ,5,2015,09,27
11,Best Hotel i've stayed in .........,"I stay in hotels most weeks due to work and lucky enough for me they are always good 4* and 5* quality hotels. Example - The Breakers - Palm Beach, Ritz Cartlon - Maui, Conrad Singapore, Merrion - Dublin, Bellagio - Las Vegas etc.....

I check into Hotel Majestic today for a 6 day vacation in Barcelona and was ""WOW"".... from the minute we stepped out the taxi to be met by the bell boy, to reception/checkin, to the roof terrace staff... EXCELLENT. 

This was all before we even got to our room. We were checked into Room #735 and again EXCELLENT. Fantastically sized rooms for major city hotels, exquistely decorated and a large terrace with 2 x sun loungers, sofa, table and views of the Paseo de Gracia. 

All in all we've only been here a couple of hours, but WOW, EXCELLENT, FANTASTIC are the words that spring to mind as we sip on a glass of wine beside the pool on the roof terrace :)",5,2015,09,26
11,The stole my jewellery!,"I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in July. I was very pleased with the suite, amenities and service. I was then devastated to find out that my rings who are of extremely high sentimental value to me had been stolen from the room. I had left them on the coffee table in the living room and then they disappeared. I left Barcelona and called the hotel about 5 times during the period of month and found the staff to be of no help as almost as they didn't care. I then returned to Barcelona from London to find my rings. Then again, i was advised to file a police report. They wouldn't investigate their staff. I would expect much more from a so-called 5-star hotel. 

I am now devastated over the loss of 2 rings which represented an emotional familial value which i will never see again.",1,2015,09,24
11,How high can the bar be raised,"One of the most amazing hotel ever.... my #1. From the way your addressed from the first meeting, by name, to the service and quality this is by far the classiest hotels I've stayed at. Location is perfect for nightlife, ease of access to sights and shopping. The top level bar is perfect for a drink, bite, and an awesome view of the city. As one of the highest points around you can see 2 Gaudi's. The rooms are large for European hotels. The amenities cant be beat..we were on a lower floor with a street balcony which was perfect - doors closed off the sound well.",5,2015,09,23
11,Luxury at the right level,"Junior suite was excellent, perfect for our 10yr anniversary. Brilliant hotel, staff attention to detail, great location, and a terrace on the roof! We loved our stay snd would recommend it for couples or business",5,2015,09,23
11,Solid hotel but you expect more,"My second stay.  Absolutely first rate location and a beautiful grand buidling.  The hotel staff is friendly but just a touch short of great (silly errors of not keying entry cards correctly forcing us to have to head down to get them rekeyed just after check in, missing towels, etc).  The rooms are fine but again, not great (poor insulation in the room made it quite noisy).  A good experience but you leave a bit disappointed - although again, location is great.",3,2015,09,23
11,Wonderful hotel ,My wife and I went to Barcelona for a planned stay of two days.  We were planning to go on a cruise with another couple but the night before the cruise my wife broke her hip and wrist in an accident so we couldn't go on the cruise and stayed two extra days at the Majestic.  The hotel staff was very nice and helpful during this crisis.  The room beautiful.  We look forward to returning without the drama.  ,5,2015,09,23
11,Very Chic Hotel,"The location of the hotel is just perfect. Luxurious and modern facilities, great staff at all levels and the pool a real treat. 
The breakfast is just a breathtaking, the choice is varied and everything is delicious, 
      ",5,2015,09,22
11,Very disappointed honeymooners,"We stayed at the Majestic for 2 nights during our honeymoon in Barcelona. 

We went down for breakfast our first morning had our room checked off the list and my husband had cereal and a coffee and some fruit. 
I had a bit of fruit to keep him company as the gluten free options were limited for me. We left no problems. 

The second morning after the same process the woman at the desk handed us a bill for 70 euros or $110 australian dollars. 

We said ""no there has been a mistake we have breakfast included, check again it's included and we know because yesterday the staff didn't charge us "". She demanded a signature my husband said ""no we would take it up with front desk in person now."" She hurriedly picked up the phone in front of us to call down to reception as if we were thieves. 

We went to the front desk calmly brought up the issue and and the staff member produced a bill from the day before that we had never seen before and did not know about and did not sign for for the previous morning another 70 euro or $110 australian. 

The gentleman produced the sign in sheet for the hotel that we did sign at check in, a long list of small lines of hotel policy etc. in teeny writing a box was checked that said breakfast not included. This was not highlighted to us at check in by the way, we were asked to sign. 

Ok he had us there but our argument was this.
It was not highlighted to us at check in or entering or leaving breakfast the previous morning. Morning 1 when the staff went down the list at breakfast with our room number why did she not inform us it wasn't included? 

The second point was why did they not give us the bill the first morning. If they had we would have known not to come back the next morning. 

The man at reception said 'no we didn't give you the bill yesterday but of course you would have had breakfast, you would take breakfast at home would you not?' 

Wrong actually I personally don't  but yes my husband enjoys a coffee and a cereal.

'You have now used the service provided you must pay.' 

My husband said it was very expensive 130 euros for him to have coffee and cereal and I to keep him company both mornings and if there was anything the hotel could do to help us in this matter. 

The man said ''you would take breakfast of course, you did take breakfast and it is expensive and this is a 5 star hotel in Barcelona''. As if we were not not used to this level of wealth. 

It was not this gentleman's fault I suppose he said this is guest relations telling him the rules. The guest relations manager was standing right there and would not talk directly to us but give him and us disgusted looks. That's the funny thing about Guest Relations... Usually you would relate with the guest. The staff looked down on us and frankly embarrassed us to the point where I was nearly in tears to be treated so poorly and just asked my husband to drop it as it was causing a scene. We felt as though the hotel scammed us 130 euros which is $220 Australian dollars! It is a lot of money. On our honeymoon no less. 

He was very wrong and incorrect we would not have taken breakfast and frankly if the hotel is as prestigious as he suggests one would expect the breakfast be included in the exorbitant rate and not chase down patrons at breakfast. 

We would have gone across to the local cafe for my husband to have a good coffee and croissant rather than eat the buffet. 

1. The coffee was cheap and nasty not of europe standard. They only cater for American style coffee. I have a caffeine allergy so I drank none. 

2. I would not eat the food or drink the coffee as I am gluten and caffeine allergy. They had little gluten free options other than fatty meats and cheeses & eggs as the majority of the buffets was breads and pastries. 

3. The buffet was so crowded and poorly planned out crammed in a little side room within the dining area it was impractical and awkward not an enjoyable experience.

Also, this is not our first stay in a 5 star hotel regardless of your staff's assumption. 
We have stayed in 5 star hotel all over the world including Hotel Santa Caterina and Villa D Este this trip and they do not even check your name at breakfast as they hold themselves to a higher standard and not after bleeding every cent dry from their guests. 

They made us feel awful on our honeymoon and for that I give them a poor rating on a customer service level it was unprofessional, unsympathetic and patronising. You are in customer service and did not even want to help us. 

They made no effort or even a congratulations
for us. Or even a nice room. The room had shutters with no view. Just into the building next door. Other hotels gave us room upgrades or the best room they could and also champagne, chocolates, cakes and one even a gift. We did not ask or expect any of these things but it highlights the majestic does not have a sense of generosity or care that other 5 star hotels do. 

We spent a lot of money in their establishment at their bar and restaurant upstairs and were happy to pay a higher price for these services than the streets of Barcelona or lower end hotels when the choice was ours and the value to us was there. 

The only reason I did not give this hotel a terrible was because the house keeping staff were lovely and attentive and the location is fantastic.",2,2015,09,22
11,Terrible customer service,"Ok, so the rooftop terrace is fantastic, but that's about it. Let me explain.

It's the sort of hotel that is friendly until you require customer service. They are 100% geared to taking your money and care not for any form of service that they do not get paid for. Read the other reviews and you will see a common thread. Great if all goes well, but terrible if you need some sort of assistance and a friendly bit of advice.

It's just easier to book somewhere else.

You've been warned.",2,2015,09,22
11,50th Wedding Anniversary,"The hotel is excellent and the staff are outstanding, we recommend visiting the rooftop bar for the food and  views over Barcelona.  

The location is great for either shopping, restaurants  and visiting places of interest.
We look forward to a return visit.

We would like to thank the Management for their bottle of wine and biscuits on our arrival which was a lovely surprise, also Sandra from reception and Albert from the bar for making our stay memorable.",5,2015,09,22
11,Cocktail hour with views just tops it off,"After staying in lots of apartments, we wanted he simple pleasures of a luxury hotel -- fresh sheets and towels etc.
What made us choose the Majestic was it's rooftop pool and lounge, which turned out to far more useable than we imagined.
Most days, tired after sightseeing, we would head there for a late afternoon drink and swim. I was worried it would feel too upmarket to sit around in swimwear but it was very relaxed. Absolutely the highlight of our stay in Barcelona!",5,2015,09,21
11,simply majestic,"The hotel was beautiful and the staff excellent.  We loved the rooftop bar!  Location was very good close to shopping and restaurants.  The rooms were nice.  Loved the Bulgari toiletries.  Need to use the hop on hop off buses to get around town, but it was a great way to see Barcelona.  The  lobby bar was great too.  Bar tenders were always pleasant and helpful.

      ",5,2015,09,21
11,"Superb service ""old fashion""","Make no mistake, this is a 5 star hotel and even if expensive, you get a superb service, a very comfortable room and all the amenities you might desire. We found the room we chose (knowing it would not have a city view) a bit off putting by the fact there was actually no view at all, if not on a very small internal courtyard. The roof terrace did not seem to be a very trendy place, in spite of the superb view. The superlative service surprised us with sparkling wine and chocolate cake the day of my birthday. Overall a great location, frequented mainly by English speaking customers and a bit too far from real life in this warm and friendly city",5,2015,09,20
11,Paradise in Barcelona,"Arrived for a three day visit in this beautiful city. The hotel staff could not do enough for us any time of the day. The roof top pool bar is a beautiful way to spend a few hours after exploring the city sights.
Remember this is a 5 star hotel with 5 star prices but worth every euro. Cannot wait for next April 2016 for another visit.",5,2015,09,20
11,"Central, Convenient, Comfortable - Barcelona","Toured and dined the city extensively.  Can't imagine staying at a better hotel in Barcelona -- very central.  Concierge and staff was quite helpful.  Room was well-stocked, clean and very, very comfortable.",5,2015,09,19
11,Lovely hotel in wonderful location,"We chose this hotel on the basis of other TA reports. We were in Barcelona for the first time, and we stayed 4 nights.

Having arrived at the airport we took a taxi to the hotel for €27. It was an easy journey taking about 20-25 minutes.

Check in was swift, although rather surprisingly not at the front desk. We were then escorted up to our room (a junior suite) which was on the third floor over looking the Passeig de Gracia. In addition to the bedroom we had a large living area. Both rooms had patio doors and a balcony. At night time, despite the heavy blackout curtains we did experience some noise from the street below, but not to the extent that we were kept awake. 

The bed was comfortable, with a mattress topper. The bathroom had a large shower and a separate bath, with twin sinks. The toilet was off the bathroom with a rather unusual frosted glass door that didn't lock and swung either way in order to open. Towels were changed every day - as was the bedlinen despite the fact that we left the little card on the bed saying that we didn't require this to be done.

There was a Nespresso coffee machine which we didn't use having read that the hotel charges for its use. Free wifi was available throughout our stay and we found this very useful with reasonable download speeds.

Overall, the hotel exudes class and the staff were pleasant and friendly. We obtained helpful advice from the concierge too.

We used a hop on, hop off bus tour to get our bearings on our first day. We could have purchased tickets online at home (for a discount), but decided to leave it until we were there to make a decision on which company to use. In the event, either would have been fine as they offer much the same routes.

We didn't use the hotel for eating at all. We were told that breakfast was €35 and we decided to give this a miss and see what else we could find locally. We found just what we were looking - coffee and croissant - for at a tiny fraction of the cost just 100 yards away.

The location of the hotel is second to none, with designer shops all around. If you're looking for a superior sort of hotel right in the centre of things in Barcelona you really can't go wrong with the Majestic. It's a couple of blocks away from Gaudi buildings and walking distance (or do as we did and take the underground) to the Sagrada Familia. The taxi rank is just outside, and the underground a block away. What more could you ask for?",5,2015,09,19
11,Majestic Hotel and Spa,"My daughter and I LOVED this hotel.  It was perfect for our stay in Barcelona.  Amazing staff and facilities.  We felt like royalty! The location was excellent.  We enjoyed the rooftop pool and bar. Thank you!
      
      ",5,2015,09,19
11,Class throughout the hotel,"We had a complication with our booking which was resolved satisfactorily and with charm with the help of the Customer Service Desk (Albaro and Ingrid). This exemplified our treatment throughout the hotel from the efficient and helpful staff in the charming lobby bar, the chambermaids and the restaurant team. Everyone seemed genuinely happy to go the extra mile to make our stay as positive as possible. These are the signs of a first class training programme. The Majestic has become our default hotel when in Barcelona, I can't think of why we should want to stay anywhere else.",5,2015,09,19
11,"Great Hotel, Great Service, Great Location","We really enjoyed our stay at Majestic Hotel in Barcelona. The staff was outstanding and that is why I give it four stars....I didn't give it 5 because I do feel the rooms could use some updating and we had no early check-in. We arrived in Barcelona early in the morning from the US and were at the hotel by 8 am. Not expecting a room at that time, we were told we could possibly have a room at about 11 am.....so we hung around the rooftop pool area, got something to eat. We weren't given a room until 3 that afternoon. It made for a long day and a long wait. The breakfast buffet is really nice. The bar area is lovely. And as I said, the staff is outstanding. It would be nice to see an option for early arriving guests as there is nothing to do that early in the morning having traveled all night, just wanting to unpack and get a quick rest.",4,2015,09,18
11,"Great hotel, greater location","This is my fourth time at this hotel.  It is in a great central location, being within waking distance to important landmarks and great restaurants.  It is comfortable and five star in every way.  An added bonus during my most recent stay was an upgrade, without additional cost, to an exclusive suite with terrance.  First on my list of hotels to stay in Barcelona. ",5,2015,09,17
11,A Special Hotel in a Great Location of Barcelona,"Summary: amazing service in a very well designed building and rooms. Great location in the city center especially if you are there for Gaudi. Roof top bar/pool with nice views is a major plus as is the outstanding breakfast. I would highly recommend this hotel especially if you can afford it.

Amazing Service: I've never met hotel workers that seem genuinely happy to be there and take the initiative to see if you need anything. The gentleman, who I believe is named Fernando, looked after us very well. We were there for our honeymoon and the hotel took care in making it special for us. We are truly thankful.

Building and Rooms: well designed and appointed. Very comfy beds for both me and my wife even though I like a little more firm and she likes a little softer. Clean, nice bathrooms, very well working wifi connection. Turned down service was a very nice touch. Roof top bar with a small pool is great for catching the sunset or night cap before bed. That breakfast…wow…try it once if you can manage it.

Location: very well centered on a major street (not noisy). Perfect for those looking to see a lot of Gaudi's works but close enough to the beach as well (we actually walked to the ocean in about 25 minutes). Also perfect for those into shopping, right next to Chanel and other high end stores.

Critique: not much bad I can say. If I had to change something I would say maybe more plush bath towels to match the thick robes? 

Our favorite hotel from our two week trip!",5,2015,09,17
11,Spain vacation,"The service, rooms, location & quality of food was impeccable. I would recommend this place for anyone couples or family. I loved the location it was close to all the high end boutiques & great restaurants

11,Best service we ever had!!,"The hotel itself is new and beautiful, it's an oasis of piece and tranquility in the center of Passeig de Gracia! We had our wedding in Barcelona and had 60 rooms booked for our guests; each of the 120 people was surprized by level of service they recieved, even for a Leading Hotels of the World this is outstanding! I'm not even sure we needed the amount of staff who were looking after us, making sure every detail is perfect! We would like to thank in particular Marta Manrique, Eva Crespi, butlers Emilio and Griselda, porter Andranik and Dmitry from guest relations, who were nothing short of fantastic!
The hotel surprized us with so many wonderful gifts for our wedding, and notes of well-wishing!! After our bags were packed, we sat in the room and discussed how we really don't want to leave, because the hotel and staff had played such a big role in our wedding. We don't think it would have been the same in any other hotel, we travel a lot and see a lot of beautiful hotels, but Majestic is something special.",5,2015,09,16
11,Great Location!,"The best feature of this hotel is its location. It also has a wonderful breakfast buffet!  We stayed in one of the apartments which were very spacious and modern. The concierge service was excellent. The rooftop has a beautiful view over the city but the pool there is quite small.

11,Summer stay at the Majestic,"The hotel is as beautiful as you would expect a hotel of this par to be. The facilities were very clean and comfortable. In particular, the washroom were very nice; we had 3 adult women in our room and the washroom space accommodating three morning makeup protocols. 

The location is perfect and the staff were helpful in directing us to get around. 

The rooftop pool and lounge cannot be missed. The pool and view truly makes you feel as though you are being pampered - just be prepared to pay the cost of pampering.",5,2015,09,16
11,"Beyond Great, this hotel is amazing. One of the best. EVER.","Everything about this hotel is perfect. The location is near Gaudi buildings, high end shopping, great restaurants, and La Rambla. Rooms are light and well appointed. Turn-down service comes with bottled water, great for the next day's touring. The views from the rooftop bar are stunning. 

The buffet breakfast is outstanding. There are about 10 different kinds of cheeses, an equal number of pastries, little sandwiches, and several different types of fresh fruit, In addition, there are made to order eggs, a variety of meats, and interesting Catalan dishes like white beans. Everything was fresh and delightfully presented. After this breakfast, we only needed one other meal per day.

What truly makes this an outstanding, one-of-a-kind hotel, however, is its service. From the doormen to the bellmen, to the housekeepers, to the concierge staff, each and every staff member is a delight to encounter. The doormen all smile and say hello. The waitstaff in the restaurant are quick to remove used dishes and flatware (these people really hustle), and Carlos the bellman/doorman is super friendly. My husband and I spent quite a few evenings in the rooftop bar. The servers there are young, attractive, attentive, and very friendly. The are skilled at their jobs. My special praise goes out to Angel, the concierge. His restaurant recommendations are perfect, and he takes the time to show you how to get there to.

This is truly one of the best hotels in which I have ever stayed. Don't be daunted by its size. You get boutique hotel personalized service and an amazing location.",5,2015,09,16
11,Great hotel in the middle of Barcelona,"Barcelona is on the move.  Stay at the Majestic for a great venue, good restaurants and wonderful roof top bar with a view of the Sagrada Familia.  We were on a cruise and finished up in this wonderful city.  They are rallying/debating and moving on the issue of independence.  You are close to the Gaudi Museum and the Batllo mansion (designed and constructed by Gaudi)....both of which are musts.  Staff is super professional and helpful.  Definitely going back there.",5,2015,09,16
11,Pre cruise review,"We could not have chosen a better hotel or better location to explore and enjoy Barcelona before our NCL cruise around the Mediterranean .  The staff were all so pleasant and helpful; the roof top swimming pool and terrace/bar were a delight to use day and/or night with again, brilliant service and comfort, not to mention the superb views of Barcelona.  The bed was so comfortable and wonderful to return to after a hard day foot slogging around this beautiful city.  The hotel was ideally situated, close to some lovely restaurants and a brilliant Tapas bar....recommended by the hotel ... Set amid lovely shops and yet near enough to the Rambla and at the far end the Marina, so you  could walk to both reasonably easily yet still being able to enjoy a bit of peace and space around the hotel itself.  We would definitely recommend this hotel and if in Barcelona again would most certainly stay there again.",5,2015,09,16
11,Magical Experience,"Thanks to the reviews on Trip Advisor, selecting this magnificent hotel was an excellent choice.  I traveled with a group and all our needs were met upon our arrival until our departure.  The hotel was elegant yet warm and inviting.  I was only there for a one night stay in a suite.  The food was great - I dined in the bar lounge area for lunch, the rooftop for dinner and the restaurant for a breakfast buffet.  The room was fabulous with a wonderful balcony off the main living area and another off the bedroom.  The bathroom was wonderful with a full bath and hand faucet, separate toilet area with a door, and a huge shower which all our guests raved about.  The hotel was very clean and comfortable.  We were adamant in finding a hotel with an actual door to the bathroom area for privacy.  Lastly, the location was perfect.  It was in walking distance to great shopping, dining and tours.  I think it is child friendly as well.  Hotel Majestic is the ultimate choice when traveling to Barcelona.",5,2015,09,15
11,Great location in Barcelona,"Location in Barcelona was awesome.  Central to everything including another Gaudi apartment within easy walking distance.  Local tourists buses easy to access here.  Hotel staff was most welcoming and very helpful about getting reservations for all of the sights and helping to pick out the best restaurants.  Rooms were large and very comfortable.  Quiet too.  Be sure to enjoy the complementary breakfast which is your standard European breakfast (not the meager one you get in the USA).  Also, check out the roof top bar which seems to be a favorite place for many in the city.",5,2015,09,15

The hotel Concierge was pleasant and very helpful. He suggested and made us a reservation at a great restaurant.

11,Most amazing hotel,"As a group of 6 friends we chose this hotel because of the location and terrace and we like a little luxury when we go away.  This hotel has to be one of (if not the) best hotels we have ever stayed in.  You walk in and are greeted by a lovely Jo Malone fragrance in the lobby. Check in is a little confusing as it is not in the main reception area but in a room around the corner. The receptionist was fine - not overly friendly but efficient.  The guy who was sorting out our luggage explained he would bring them up to our room and accompanied us to the lifts - great service.

We booked executive rooms and they did not disappoint although our twin room was made up as a double but no problem as they remade the beds for us.

Lovely dressing room and bathroom with separate toilet although watch the sliding doors as they do seem to open without warning! Top notch toiletries and everything was spotless. You do have to pay for the capsules for the nespresso machine but you can't complain at a euro for a quality coffee.

Lovely little touches like a turn down service with slippers put by your bed and a sample of fragrance to put on your pillow to help you sleep.  A travel adapter to use during your stay which you can purchase and some lovely thick robes.  Every evening a fresh small bottle of water was by your bed.

We were celebrating a 50th birthday and were very surprised to find we had a complimentary bottle of cava with a note waiting in our room when we returned in the afternoon. 

The breakfast is not cheap (€34) but the choice and quality was just fabulous.  We did not have breakfast in the room rate but it was so good we all chose to stay for breakfast on both mornings.

What really sets this hotel apart from the others is the quality of the staff there.  Every single person we met was friendly, courteous and very very efficient.  From the lovely staff on the roof top terrace (they move the furniture to accommodate our pary of 6 and sorted out a sun bed for one of us) to the amazing Marc on reception.  We asked for a recommendation for somewhere to eat the one evening which coincided with a bank holiday. It was about 8:30 and he asked what kind of food we wanted.  We asked for a steak or fish style restaurant and he phoned a local steak house but the could not fit us in until 10:00.  As it was just round the corner he actually went to the restaurant to see what they could do for us but to no avail. He then showed us a restaurant on the internet called Mirabe which he said had good food and amazing views.  He booked us a table and got us a taxi for 6 within minutes.  The restaurant was really really good and Marc had arranged for us to have a window table. The food and staff there were amazing but that's for a seperate review. We gave Marc a tip on the day we left and thanked him and he was very pleased. 

Overall this is an amazing hotel with amazing staff. The city of Barcelona is a must and when we visit again the Majestic Hotel will be our hotel of choice.

11,Great hotel in prime location,"We have just returned from a 3 night stay here. Lovely hotel with immaculate clean rooms. Only complaint was ours was a little small but functional. Lovely roof top area for chilling out and swimming. Expensive drinks though! 
Excellent service and very attentive. The breakfast was amazing with a fantastic selection. 
Excellent location and walking distance to selection of shops and restaurants. We also walked to all the major tourist attractions from here (although we did walk at least 40+ miles whilst we stayed here!) highly recommend and would love to go back.",5,2015,09,13
11,Barcelona,"We had 3 magnificent nights at the Majestic Hotel.  It was perfectly appointed, great restaurant recommendations and help from the concierge.  The Majestic is one of the most luxurious hotels I've enjoyed
 ",5,2015,09,13
11,Wonderful Hotel!!!,"I had initially booked another hotel in Barcelona for our family vacation. After reading Hotel Majestic's reviews, I decided to switch hotels and am so glad I did!  We stayed in one of the apartments across the street for one week with our 16 year old daughter. We had an apartment on the 5th floor facing the back, which was super quiet. My husband loved the blackout shades that come down with a push of a button....we felt like we were sleeping in a cave! The apartment was very clean and comfortable.  The hotel staff was friendly and extremely helpful.  They assisted us with dinner reservations a few times, and were incredibly courteous when we changed our minds a few times. The rooftop pool and bar was very nice and they even held a couple of lounge chairs for us while we changed into our suits.  All in all a great experience and we wouldn't hesitate to stay at the Majestic again!!  I honestly wouldn't stay anywhere else.",5,2015,09,10
11,Barcelona Visit,"The Majestic Hotel lives up to its name. Truly wonderful time in a wonderful city staying at a wonderful hotel.  Service was outstanding. My husband wanted to rent scooters with my son and the hotel had them brought pronto to the hotel. They went above and beyond with the service.
      ",5,2015,09,10
11,Highly Recommend,"Our stay at the Majestic was excellent. We originally planned on staying at the Mandarin but chose the Majestic because of its fabulous location and previous reviews. Our stay was excellent.  The staff, especially the front desk,was exceptional.We traveled throughout Spain and stayed at 5 star resorts and the Majestic was our favorite hotel.The rooms were beautifully appointed and spacious.The rooms had large beautiful bathrooms and closets. Our room was quiet even though it was next to an elevator.  The food, especially the Sunday brunch, is a ""must have"" and the food in the bar was quite good as well. I would stay at this hotel again and highly  recommend it for its fabulous location, fantastic staff, great  food and beautiful hotel rooms. MaryAnn T, Napa, CA",5,2015,09,10
11,Amazing,"The name says it all, and it truly is just that... Majestic. Absolutely amazing, the rooms are spacious the staff was incredible, couldn't ask for a better location, walkable to the beach, and shopping 
      ",5,2015,09,10
11,First stop; SPAIN,"This was the firs leg of our Mediterranean trip. The Majestic was a perfect choice! The hotel was beautiful, the location was right in the middle of everything and the roof top bar was insane! We would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again!

11,Great hotel in great location ,"The hotel exterior may look outdated but the interior, from the lobby to the rooms and the breakfast area was neat, bright and spacious. Everything was spick and span, with the service prompt and friendly. You will also like this hotel because of the shops around you and the restaurants within walking distance. The hotel is actually centrally located to the famous La Boqueria market, the Sagrada Familia, etc. ",5,2015,09,10
11,Very Nice Hotel - Great Location,"Our room was cramped. We did have a half set of stairs between us and any elevator, which wasn’t a big deal but did make handling the luggage to and from the room a little bit of a hassle. A sign in the room indicated that making coffee in your room was charged at 1 euro. I think my wife made coffee before reading the sign but there was no charge on our bill when we left, so either I misread the sign or they failed to charge us for the coffee. 
Bathroom was large and well appointed. The water temperature in the shower could change on you very quickly but in our room the pipes made a sound before a big temperature change so you had a little warning. Once again a rain shower head for which I have no fondness, but that does seem to be the trend so someone must like those things. Fancy toiletries, always nice touch. 
Location was excellent. Easy access to everything we were interested in. There were a number of restaurants in walking distance and a selection of coffee shops to grab a light breakfast with a couple blocks. We paid 35 euros for a cab to get to the hotel from the airport. 
Service staff was friendly and easy to communicate with but we did stump them more than once with our questions about the immediate area. 
The business center gave me 24 hour computer access which came in handy as I did not travel with my computer.
For the price we would stay again, I might shop price for a nicer hotel, but I think we got value for the price we paid. It’s a lovely hotel. It didn’t feel like luxurious, but it also didn’t cost luxurious.",4,2015,09,09
11,Overall very nice hotel with good service,"We stayed at this hotel in August 2015 for 3 nights. The location of the hotel is in the nicer part of Barcelona, not very close to the Gothic Quarter and Las Ramblas, but if weather permits, it's definitely a walking distance. Majestic is on their famous Paseo de Gracia which is pretty much the equivalent of the Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, meaning the nicest shopping district. The famous Batllo House of Gaudi is just across the street (a must see in Barcelona, if you ask me). My impression was that Hotel Majestic is a favorite among American tourists, because I could see a lot of them staying here. The staff speaks perfect English. This hotel is quite big and not as much focused on personalized attention to the guests as hotel Ritz in Madrid was, but again the customer service was very good, and the concierge tried to be as helpful as possible with our requests. When we arrived, they gave us a quite specious room (a rarity in Europe), but it had no view whatsoever, so when we asked for a change of room with a better view, they instantly accommodated our request with no extra charge, just apologizing that the room with view was much smaller than the previous one. The amenities in the room were excellent, and the rooms were quite updated to the 21st century standard, with good sound isolation. Even though our room was facing the quite busy Valencia street, there was no street noise bothering us with closed windows. The hotel has a very nice roof top veranda bar where also the pool is. The drinks are quite pricey there (quite in accordance with the 5 star status of the hotel and its location), but the view is worth a visit.",5,2015,09,09
11,Luxury and Service,"A fabulous location for shopping and sights.  Add to that a luxurious hotel with an extraordinary attention to service and the result is the best place to stay in Barcelona. The Majestic is a rare gem, one that we hope to return to soon.",5,2015,09,09
11,A Barcelona Beauty!,"Loved every minute! Great location. Great service and very comfortable! Extremely close to the train station if you want to do a day trip to Sitges. Great shopping district as well. The restaurant on the roof by the pool is excellent.
      
      
      
      ",5,2015,09,09
11,"Spacious and better value, luxury hotel","I stayed at the residence side of the hotel which is across the street from the hotel. This is the best bet if you're traveling as a family. Much more space and less pricey than the hotel side, but you can also enjoy all the amenities of the hotel. It is inconvenient that you have to walk across the street to get to the pool, but it is worth it for the spacious room you are getting. The location is perfect for shopping & dining and very easy to grab a cab. Friendly and helpful staff. I'd stay here again when I go back.",5,2015,09,09
11,15 Day European vacation,"Excellent.  The day always started off with an incredible breakfast.  We would definitely recommend and return to the Majestic.  The hotel was centrally located and offered above par amenities.  Hotel staff was very accommodating.
      
      ",5,2015,09,09
11,"Great location, but many others closeby to choose from","The hotel is quite nice but the staff was not helpful and directing us how to get where we needed to go, nor was the check-in process a good one taking over 90 minutes to grant us a room.  Much better service at other properties

11,One of the best!,"The Majestic Hotel was one of the best hotels that I have ever stayed in. The staff was very courteous and the concierge was very knowledgeable. 
The hotel is centrally located in Barcelona and close to everything. ",5,2015,09,09
11,Lovely hotel,"Really nice hotel on busy street but don't let that put you off as rooms are very quiet. Good breakfasts plenty to eat and concierge was brilliant booking places offering suggestions. Spa was nice husband had massage said it was one of the best. Spisticated rooms, good amenities and gym.",5,2015,09,07
11,Majestic experience...,"I fully recommend this experience. This hotel was not only beautiful, inside and out, its location was excellent and its staff were all very friendly, helpful and professional. Hotel lobby has several places where you can sit and relax. Dining experience exceeded my expectations. Rooms are comfortable and well equipped. The hotel is walking distance to Casa Batlló and La Pedrera; Nice restaurants and shopping area, as well. We stayed for 9 nights and will definitely stay here again.",5,2015,09,05
11,Art & Luxury...,"Standing majestically on Pg de Gracia, this hotel has an uniqueness that most of the luxury hotels in Barcelona don't have. The visit to this hotel was a very special visit, filled with history, art and emotions. Maybe because it has always been the 5 GL hotel since its opening, more than 100 years ago. It has always belonged to the same family and it has known to adapt to modern times. The hotel has 275 rooms including the suites and penthouses with butler services and other exclusive services. Many famous people have stayed here during the years, such as the Dalai Lama, Antonio Machado, Catherine Deneuve, Joan Miró or Ernst Hemingway among others. 

If you are visiting Barcelona, and you want a classic, luxurious and majestic place this hotel is for you. 
It also has some wonderful dining options, you could go if you are visiting Barcelona or if you are a local. Their terrace is one of the most hype in town with wonderful views and unique bites. Their gastronomy offer in the terrace and restaurants is by the michelin star chef Nandu Jubany. Go for a drink in their terrace Dolcae Vitae, a high fashion tea in their exclusive lobby bar, for a meal or try their lunch menu on weekdays. 
They also offer an exclusive service, taking guests in a private car to a private beach club 30 minutes away. 
The main part of this hotel is the wonderful art all around the hallways and rooms, it is the personal collection of the owners. You can admire some unique art pieces by Miro, Anish Kapoor, Phillipe Stanton, Tapies... 
It has a banquet hall that could fit a big number of people, perfect for a wedding or big celbrations, it also has different halls where you could hold a meeting or presentation.",5,2015,09,04
11,Hotel Majestic - Apartment Eixample,"Great stay in the Majestic Hotel's Apartment Eixample - enjoyed the full amenities of the hotel (Gym, valet parking, restaurant, pool and pool-bar) but with the independence of a fully self contained apartment with full kitchen, washing machine/dryer and ample areas to relax. The hotel staff were amazing and I must admit I expected to be treated a little differently being in an apartment rather than the hotel proper but this as not the case at all. The location was awesome - so handy to great shopping and restaurants and an easy walk to Las Ramble area. I fully recommend this hotel and apartment - awesome experience all around and will definitely stay again :)",4,2015,09,03
11,Very relaxing stay,"I stayed with my family for 9 nights and I have to say that the hotel truly reflect its status; clean, relaxing and very well located.

Special thanks to Marco who checked us in, Manuel for the extra help & The Intern,",5,2015,09,01
11,Barcelona At Your Command,"Stayed 4 days with my wife and nephew. 

When we got to the hotel, the taxi was immediately met by the bellhop so they took care of unloading the bags and ushered us into reception. So top marks for the greeting. It sets the expectation for the rest of the stay.

We had a Jr Suite which was very well appointed and had good light coming in. The Pull Out couch for the nephew was very comfortable. Our only quibble was they did not fold it up each day so we had to navigate it all the time we were in the room. 

The bathroom had Bulgari toiletries so that was nice. The bath/shower has one of those complicated (for me anyway) combination of levers which may or may not turn on rainhead, showerhead, water volume and temperature. It seemed every time I used it, I somehow got it to where I wanted it but not sure which lever controlled which. Toilet and bidet was in a separate room. So, overall, great bathroom.

The rooftop bar / pool has an incredible view. The pool is pretty small but sufficient for kids and they all seem to have fun splashing around. The service in this area is spotty and I had to complain about the lack of service I encountered. 

The breakfast room was great (inside and out) and the fare provided had a nice variety. Plus.... big plus.... the breakfast closes at 11:00 AM. At 11:15, someone would come around and remind us that the buffet was closing. This was greatly appreciated that we were not rushed. 

Their attention to guests comfort was tested. We thought the air con was not quite cold enough. I mentioned it at the front desk and they said they would have maintenance look at it. I thought there is not much they could do. To my surprise, the room was cooler when we came back which definitely increased our comfort level. Kudos to the staff on that one.

Location.... can't be beat. Down the street from one of the hop-on hop-off buses plus walking distance to La Rambla and other great sites. 

Do not miss having tapas at Cerveseria Catalana. Get there early!! Have fun.

We did not use the Spa or any other dining/drinking spot outside of the rooftop bar. Overall, the room was a bit pricey but I thought the value was there.",4,2015,09,01
11,Fantastic hotel,"My girlfriend and I had a 7-day stay here in mid-June, and had a brilliant stay.I had deliberately booked 5-star as I wanted it to be a special trip, so expectations were high, but the Majestic met them all. A grand and stunning building on the affluent Paseo de Gracia, it impressed from the start. The room was great - massive, comfy bed, tasteful decorations, and a very stylish and spacious bathroom. We were on the second floor, facing out over the mall road to the back. Whatever we lost in view, was made up by lack of noise, as it was blissfully quiet. The bar on the top floor is brilliant, with spectacular views (particularly of the festival of saint on on 23rd June when the city is lit up with fireworks), and has one of the best grilled ham and cheese sandwiches I've ever tasted (not exactly a 5 star choice of cuisine i grant you, but 5 stars for taste and setting). The pool on the roof terrace is small, so serves more as a plunge pool, but can certainly meet requirements for a much needed cooling dip. The gym is again small, but has a good range of equipment, and was never overly busy. Location wise, we were able to reach everything we wanted to see on foot. The staff were friendly and helpful. I would happily stay there again, and recommend it to anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2015,09,01
11,Suite Life,"Worth every penny - If you're looking for a little luxury in the heart of the city this one is for you. We stayed in a beautiful suite with 2 balconies overlooking Passeig de Gràcia. Location is perfect, one block down from Gaudi's Casa Mila, it's great to walk into town via the Place de Catalonia and down through las ramblas. Or turn left and into the old town. Roof top pool is small but ok if not busy - rooftop night swimming is fun",5,2015,09,01
11,""" Great Location """,Very good hotel with great location. The hotel is close to La Rambles and other sites. Room was very  small but clean. Walking distance from shops and restaurants.good customer service. The view from the roof top bar and pool were amazing. The front desk and bell captain were very helpful with taxis and any other form of transportation.,4,2015,08,30
11,Summer bliss,"On a recent trip to Barcelona, I had booked a room at the Majestic. I expected this to be top notch and it was. We really enjoyed afternoons on the rooftop pool and bar. What a view. The class of this hotel,is evident. The only disappointment we had was there was no tub in the bathroom, only a shower.",4,2015,08,30
11,Very Majestic - Perfect Location,"We were lucky enough to stay at the Majestic Hotel with a company trip to Barcelona.  

We loved this hotel.

It is very aptly named as it truly is a majestic hotel.  We loved that we had 2 balconies in the Jr Suite.  The bathroom was huge and very luxurious.  Bed was comfy.  Service was just what you'd expect.

For the slight price delta between this place and some slightly lower end spots, I'd recommend booking the majestic.

Enjoy!",5,2015,08,30
11,Cant say enough good things about this place.,"Very nice hotel located in the middle of everything you could want and a few blocks from some of the best restaurants in the city. The staff are very on point and ready to help at a moments notice. Very nice rooms and fun bar. Geronimo the bartender will not steer you wrong on references. I needed some help making a market trade from Spain to my bank in the states and with the help of one of the staff scanning signatures and emailing back to my broker I made $15,000 in two days...I say this because these folks will drop what they are doing and head to the front lines with you at a moments notice. If you stay anywhere else in Barcelona your making a big mistake...just saying.",5,2015,08,28
11,"Lovely hotel, great location","The Majestic was just right for our stay in Barcelona. The rooms were not huge but were comfortable and accommodating. Staff efficient and helpful. Near Gaudi houses so easy walks around interesting area. Bar a little slow to serve us, but that is not a deal breaker by any means.",4,2015,08,25
11,Perfect location in Barcelona,"This is a beautiful hotel, located in one of the nicest districts, near two of the Gaudi houses(both should be seen on the inside). You can walk to La Ramblas and shopping is close by, also. Helpful people, great room, terrific breakfast, reasonably priced.",5,2015,08,24
11,Truly Majestic Service,"Hotel Majestic... What can I say?
This hotel is Beautiful, the rooms truly Awesome, BUT all that pales in comparison to the truly heavenly service we received.

We flew in to Barcelona to catch a cruise and I got a suite for my wife and I. Our flight got us in early at 8:30 am and check-in was standard 3pm. We had come up with lots of things we could do to keep ourselves busy till 3pm. We checked in at 9:30am and to our surprise we were upgraded to the penthouse suite (this comes with a private extra large balcony with an awesome view) and given immediate access to our room.

Fernando, the associate that checked us in then proceeded to ask us about dinner plans and got us a reservation at Restaurante Barceloneta (truly delectable); they checked up on us during the visit and brought us some complimentary champagne; for each and every request we asked it felt like they were just looking for a way to ""over-fulfill"" the request and they truly made our stay Majestic.

My wife loves this hotel and says our next stay in Barcelona has to be with the Hotel Majestic and their awesome staff.",5,2015,08,23
11,A Wonderful Stay,"The hotel is beautiful, the location, prime and the staff, incredibly professional. We had one occurrence - in an otherwise brilliant stay - that was dealt with swiftly and in an extremely professionally manner - the difference between a good hotel and a great hotel. We will look forward to staying there again soon.",5,2015,08,23
11,"Second Time Here, Truly Great Service, Location and Rooms","I am currently staying at the Majestic Hotel. Everything is first class! Love the breakfast. The beds are ""just right"" (not like most in Europe that are very hard). But, the best things are the incredible service and great location. I look forward to being back again.",5,2015,08,22
11,OUTSTANDING  in every way,"If you want a luxury hotel in the perfect location then stay at The Majestic Hotel. This hotel can compete with some of the finest hotels in the world.  The service was outstanding, I especially have to thank one of their staff members Ana, who was our waitress one night at their beautiful roof top bar.  This hotel should be proud to have such a warm, caring and intelligent member of their staff who goes out of their way to make sure the guests are happy.  The next day we saw Ana again in their bar area and she went over and above to make sure that we had everything that we needed, including recommending 2 wonderful restaurants in the area. She was an absolute delight. The service at the Majestic is impeccable and I wouldn't say anywhere other than this hotel on my next trip to Barcelona.",5,2015,08,19
11,"Old school charm , best location!",This is a beautiful hotel in what I feel is the best part of the city. It also has an amazing rooftop bar for a quiet drink and view of the city. I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact they tried to put us in a below par room when we arrived. The room should not be available for guests. They were very busy and decided to sell this room. We made it clear it was unacceptable and the hotel did accommodate with another room. Other than that it was a personable and pleasant experience. ,4,2015,08,18
11,Great apartment connected to a great hotel,"We stayed in a 2 bedroom "" Apartment Passeig de Gracia "". One bedroom had a queen bed, and its own balcony. The other room had 2 twin beds. The kitchen, living room(with balcony), and dining area were all very comfortable and nicely furnished. I loved that there were separate thermostats in the 2 bedrooms, so everyone was comfortable. The location was fantastic, and the hotel itself wonderful. The rooftop lounge has spectacular views, and is a great place to wind down the evening with a nightcap. Very friendly and helpful staff. The only negative thing was one of the showers was extremely slow to drain, and while we did let the front desk know, no one came to fix it. Luckily, there were 2 baths, so everyone shared it, not really a big deal.

Oh, and I appreciated corresponding with one of the reservation agents, David Rubio, who was very patient and answered a bunch of questions, prior to our arrival.

Also, the location was great! A block from the train, walking distance to so many places, and just a block either side to two of Gaudi's famous buildings.",5,2015,08,17
11,FANTASTIC SERVICE AND PERFECT LOCATION,"I couldn't have asked for a more enjoyable time than I had at the Majestic Hotel. The location was marvelous ( right in the city, next to Chanel ), the food was superb, and the service was exceptional. Sandra and Marc from the front desk went out of their way to help us to find our lost car, making numerous calls and keeping us posted throughout the day. With their help, we managed to find our car at the end. We are fortunate to have picked such wonderful hotel during our stay in Barcelona. Thank you so much for everything. Thanks again, Sandra and Marc. We greatly appreciate all your help.",5,2015,08,16
11,Outsanding hotel - the best in Barcelona!,"We spent ten days in Barcelona in August 2015 and had no idea where to stay.  There are so many seemingly ""self-designated"" five-star hotels.  We found a very good deal for the Majestic Hotel on Trip Advisor.  We booked three nights.  The rate was $254.  We went there blind, without any knowledge of the hotel.  When we arrived hours before check in, after flying from the US, the staff did everything they could to check us in fast.  They even allowed us to check in before noon!  The three days we were at the Majestic were magical.  The room was huge, the staff were friendly and happy, and the drinks on the roof were perfect.  Everyone was so nice.  The staff seemed genuinely happy to be there. The lower bar staff (especially the sommelier) were also very attentive.  The sommelier let us try a few wines to find the perfect glass of wine.  The room service was fast and delicious.  I recommend the American breakfast.  I have stayed in many five star hotels and can honestly say that this is truly a five star hotel.  It is actually underpriced for what you get.  The location is on the main shopping street, right next to Chanel.  The Gaudi attractions are within walking distance.  The Majestic is a block away from the Mandarin Oriental.  The lobby of the Majestic is much bigger and more comfortable than the Mandarin.  We ended up moving from the Majestic to the Serras Hotel after three days because we wanted to try the Barrio Gotica area in Barcelona.  Although the Serras Hotel's location is central and spectacular, I was underwhelmed by the service.  We missed the Majestic!!!",5,2015,08,16
11,Perfectly placed for a visit to Barcelona,"This is a five star hotel and the levels of service and rooms reflect this. The location of the hotel ensures that you are close to great shopping, eating and attractions.
The rooftop deck has a small pool but fantastic views of the city and notably the Familia  Sagrada. Best to go there early as it gets crowded especially at weekends.
A great stay!",4,2015,08,16
11,Stay here!,I LOVE this hotel! The location is steps from the hop on hop off bus tour and just a couple blocks from las romblas shopping. It is directly across the street from one of Gaudis famous buildings. The hotel is gorgeous. We stayed in a Jr suite and it looked exactly like the photos and had a fantastic balcony.,5,2015,08,13
11,"Perfect location, wonderful service, and a pool to boot!","We stayed in Barcelona for 5 days on our way from from the Algrave and decided to stay at the Majestic mainly based upon its convenient location and the pool- being August we wanted options other than trekking to the beach. We arrived late our first night due to a flight delay but were shown to our room promptly (sidenote- at checkout they initially billed us for a 'no-show' fee around 300 euros which we discussed with the manager and it was removed; the intern had initially stated it was for checking in late, which to me, makes no sense when you pay for a room in advance anyway). 

The pool is tiny, but kept at a refreshing temperature so it does the trick. There are only 6 lounge chairs by the pool, so if you wish to lay out go up there early- however, there is tons of other seating just not loungers and not right next to pool, but people seemed to be using those all the same. Drinks by the pool are expensive- about 18-22 euros a cocktail, but give the price point of the hotel it makes sense. 

Room service was prompt and quiet good- even the chicken fingers were freshly made and clearly not something pre-packaged or frozen. The house-made paella was perfection.

The cleaning services were on point- with super prompt servicing and good attention to detail. We called for an iron and within 5 minutes had one and the board delivered that we kept through the whole stay. 

There is a big foreign presence at the hotel which is to be expected. The lobby and downstairs bar area was one of the fullest i have ever seen- with groups/families sitting down there all day- maybe due to the heat they were not venturing outside as much?

Overall, the services were well done and you are getting a good return for what you pay for.",5,2015,08,13
11,Overall an above average stay.,Rooms are very small. The air conditioning went out in our room. Waited on someone to repair it for several hours. Very hot!!! Finally had to change rooms. Very pretty hotel and centrally located near luxury shopping.,4,2015,08,12
11,Fantastic,"We actually stayed in the hotel in august 2014, we got upgraded on arrival to a suite and it was fantastic. Good location, friendly and helpful staff. A really good break. Thanks for making a poor year seem a little bit brighter.
",5,2015,08,12
11,The finest customer service ever,"We have traveled all over the world and always stay in 5 star hotels. This hotel not only meets all expectations but exceeds anything I've ever experienced. Every department from Bellmen, front desk, concierge, engineering (who spent hours with our TV reprograming it) and especially guest relations. The food in both restaurants was excellent as was the service. I simply cannot say enough good things about this hotel. If I had to find something to complain about it would be the furniture in the rooms could be updated. Our couch was a little worn as were the night tables next to the bed. All amenities were excellent.",5,2015,08,11
11,Wonderful stay in Barcelona,"I booked this hotel as a surprise 30th birthday present for my partner. The hotel have us a beautiful room as well as a bottle of champagne on ice to mark the occasion. 
The location is great- central and within walking distance to all the main attractions. The roof top bar is also a lovely bonus- the views are great and it's a nice way to start your evening or end a long day of sightseeing. 
Staff were welcoming and friendly- especially evening staff on hotel bar. 
My partner and I both loved this hotel, and can't wait to go back!
I would also recommend seeing a Barcelona football match if possible- it's a great day even if you are not a big football fan!",5,2015,08,09
11,Delightful stay apart from a huge mistake!,"Overall our stay was delightful. It was only for one night as a stop over on our way to Palma de Mallorca. We had been on a 5 day road trip through the Italian and French Riviera. So valet parking was a requirement. The hotel really met all the requirements of a 5 star establishment throughout all departments except when it came to the front desk. It was obvious that it was a timw of high occupancy, but the front desk really needs to stay more organized and focused during these times since it is the head of this body. Instead staff was fakly nice, recommended terrible restaurants  (all tourist traps) and worse of all forgot our two wake up calls in the morning. This of course was not appriciated since we only had a few hours to visit the city. In regards to the recommendations, I specifically asked for a local restaurant for dinner. Since I have lived in Barcelona before (for about 1 yr) i wanted to try a different authentic  restaurant. Instead we were suggested a commerial establishement with all foreigners as cooks. I had already tried this restaurant on my last visit to BCN and remember how terrible it was the second I walked in, so I opted to show my friend and first time visitor of BCN a more traditional place I had already tried. That was front desk agent was the one that didn't note down our wake up call. She treated us with a very fake niceness and smug attitude. When we complained managers didn't seem bothered with the fact that we woke up 4 hours after we had requested to be awaken. Other than that it was a nice stay. ",4,2015,08,09
11,Just amazing just like the city,"Perfect place and perfect location to explore this Gaudi architechtutal gem city.
Everything about this hotel is just great. And dont miss the rooftop terrace with great views of the city. Walking distance to all atractions and hop of and on bus take the 2 day pass and book all the Gauidi houses on line to avoid the lines",5,2015,08,09
11,We're expecting the better place,"We are family of three (2 adults and 1 child) stayed in the hotel from in August, 2015. 

This is not a five star hotel. The staff did not listen to our requests and, moreover, for three persons they give the smallest room on the floor. It was very uncomfortable to stay in this hotel. We expected the excellent service but did not receive it. 

We heard that there has the small reconstruction of the enter at the end of July. We called to the reception and asked about it, because we did not want to stay in the hotel during this reconsrtuction. The manager told that it will be finished in 1 - 2 days. But when we come in August the reconstruction did not finished. And it still continuous. We did not understand the purpose of the manager's lie.",2,2015,08,05
11,Great Hotel,"Great hotel to stay in Barcelona. Nice location. Good service. However, the Breakfast options are somehow limited but better than other 5 star hotels we stayed in during our trip in Spain.

The room was well cared for. The lobby is nice.",5,2015,08,03
11,Perfect Location and Elegant Hotel,"this hotel has the charm you are looking for, it is in the middle of most tourist attraction. you can walk to most of it literally. good work out and good way to see the charming city!
I know that because it is in the middle of the tourist area, this hotel can be expensive but the interior is beautiful. the bathroom is nice. their rooftop is very pretty, especially at night, overlooking the whole town. great for selfies!
the only thing is, the room is very small. well if i can afford the bigger room, maybe ill have no complain. I stayed here for 2 nights. btw coming from the states, the wifi is very slow.",4,2015,08,01
11,Outstanding experience,"This was simply an amazing experience.  It was our first trip ever to Barcelona with the family and I was a bit nervous about our accommodations.  Like I always do, I read the negative posts on Trip Advisor and started getting cold feet about staying at Majestic.  I could not have been more wrong.  From the moment we arrived we were treated kindly, considerately and with expedience.  We did have an issue with the air conditioning not working in our room, but Francisco, the head of guest relations, was in our room within minutes and moved us to an upgraded room to accommodate us for the very slight inconvenience.  He sent a note to our room apologizing for the incident and offered his assistance during our entire stay.  Every day we would see him and he knew our name, greeted us kindly and asked if all was well.  It was not just Guest relations, but the entire staff treated us this way all week without fail.  We rented bikes to ride around the city and each night the bellman would take our bikes, store them and charge the bike batteries for us.  The front desk staff took ample time to give us directions to various locations.  We called housekeeping several times to request power adaptors, fans, and ice for the room and each time they were at the room with our request within minutes.  I am so happy we chose Majestic and would never stay anywhere else in Barcelona.",5,2015,07,31
11,CREAM OF THE CROP IN BARCELONA HOTEL ENVIRONMENT,"Great Location for shopping and to move around anywhere downtown.
5 stars top notch service and concierge.
Beautiful recently refreshed rooms.
Good restaurants and room service.

There is not much to add - go there if you are searching for 5 stars premises with a high end profile.....!",4,2015,07,31
11,Truly Majestic Stay,"My husband took me here a few weeks ago for my birthday ... As soon as we arrived we were greeted with smiles and help. They parked my car and our experience began .. All I can say is wow..! It's beautiful inside and the rooms were loverly , clean and the staff were fabulous .. I am desperate to go back and hope so in few weeks. For my birthday day I was greeted with a beautiful cake and champagne as I got back to our room. The roof pool , food and staff were wonderful .. Thank you Majestic we can't wait to come back ...❤️❤️",5,2015,07,29
11,Better than expected!,"The location of this magnificent hotel is superb! Passaig de la Gracia. Near the best Tapas Bar, Restaurants, and Shops. Minutes away from La Sagrada Familia, Plaza de Catalunya and La Rambla. The accomodations were those of the Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons and St. Regis. Excellent service provided the whole time we were there. The roof top Bar and Pool is a must. Amazing views and top notch service.",5,2015,07,28
11,Stayed 9 great nights last wk at the Magestic Grand  in Barcelona,"Before going to Barcelona I think I read over a 1000 comments on the hotel . I would say after spending 9 nights there it was everything and so much more then I expected . The service was exceptional . I can't  begin to type everyone's name, but I did personally thank each and everyone . Plus I left a bottle of wine for an intern . The interns are amazing. Three level of detail and organization were 10 stars. I think a few of the older team members can learn allot from them as we'll. They made my 19 yr old son and I feel so very comfortable , and safe. With it being our first time in Spain , and with it being our first trip without my husband who passed away 5 moths ago from a brain tumour, it was a very bitter sweet trip ,it was a surprise birthday trip for my son to see visit all of the soccer stadiums . I have to call out the twin brothers that work on the roof top everyone was talking about how amazing they were with service. My only recommendation is adding a peep hole on the hotel room door. Just to add to the safety i would add security to the elevators due to not having a card secured for each floor ,  With the general public all going to the roof top at night it made me nervous a few times going back to our room. I would also add that the pool needs a good cleaning , the 3 inch black ring needs a good cleaning each night . Other then a few suggestions we are planning our next stay for June 2016. 

From a very happy Vancouver Canada guest.",5,2015,07,28
11,What A View!!,"What makes Hotel Majestic a wonderful experience is the rooftop bar and the view of Barcelona. On the rooftop, the staff and service was impeccable. Patricia, the hostess, went above and beyond to service our needs. Beds were very comfortable. Room was adequate and quiet. City view is a side street. We had a deluxe room with breakfast included.The breakfast buffet has an unbelievable selection. I can't imagine what else they could add. Breakfast staff was also very attentive. Parking, with a fee, is another plus if you have a rental. Location is great as you can walk everywhere. Concierge needs to be a bit more down to earth.They kept steering us to more expensive restaurants. Overall, a pleasant stay.",5,2015,07,27
11,Superb Hotel,"From the moment I arrived, the staff were excellent.  The lobby has a pleasant smell that is instantly relaxin  I had a simple room with queen bed. the finishes were all top notch. The bed was just wonderful.  I stayed there only one night, such a shame.  The hotel is indeed located next to the main shopping area and the Gaudi buildings and a short walk from Sagrada Familia.  

I will definitely be coming back.",5,2015,07,26
11,Best location,Staid at the Majestic Hotel during my visit to watch the Classico match in March 2015. Hotel location is centrally located where all brands and shops are around. Hotel rooms and service was so good. Sure I will stay there again in my next visit to Barcelona.,5,2015,07,26
11,Would be great if we had expected a three star hotel,"Our room was clean, well sized, with a decent sized bathroom and a good closet.   The breakfast buffet appears wonderful, until you look closely.  Illustratively, the ham which has been wonderful throughout our visit in Spain, was good some mornings and barely adequate others.  The markets are selling seasonal fruit-  cherries, peaches, wild strawberries, apricots;  none of these appear on our hotel buffet.   Trying to get a manicure with 24 hours notice met with no success.   However, the hotel was very apologetic about this failure and arranged to compensate us for it.",3,2015,07,24
11,service is excellent,service is excellent ad the location is  excellent location for the shoppers.its right  in the heart of the city  all the brand  names and local brands and individual brand creators seling their own brands..and hotel  restaurant and cafe shop is both excellent service minded staff is smiling you at  all times.absolutely must stay or visit for a lunch or coffee....,5,2015,07,21
11,"Gorgeous property, impeccable service..","They have a beautiful property with a rooftop restaurant overlooking the city for happy hour, tapas, music, a small pool... We stayed at their apartments across the street, gorgeous and comfortable for a family or two, such as ourselves. 4 bedrooms and all the comforts needed. Impeccable service provided by friendly, attentive staff... We loved our stay. Oh! And the breakfast... Amazing! ",5,2015,07,20
11,The 5 star standard ,"I can't say enough about the excellence of the Majestic Hotel.  From the second you arrive you are welcomed as family and given the royal treatment.  The entire staff always greats you with a warm smile and a helping hand.  Check in was easy, fast, and they were fluent in many languages (English for us).  The lobby is warm, welcoming and a nice place to sit while waiting on friends.  The rooms are luxurious with a full shower and separate toilet.  The concierge was very helpful and knowledgeable on selecting restaurants, tours, and other activities.  If I had to say one negative it would be the frequency of house keeping and turndown service - 3 times per day!!  (Sad right?!) There are several metro stations located around the hotel making travel very quick and easy. (I recommend the 10 ride ticket that multiple riders can use).  One of the local tour buses stops close by and is a great way to see the whole city.  We split our stay and the hotel stored some our luggage so we did not have to drag it on the train.  This customer service that you just don't get at the average hotel (or most resorts).  I must say I am embarrassed for 5 star hotels in my city because they don't compare to the Majestic.  ",5,2015,07,19
11,Terrace,Just visited the rooftop for a drink and I definitely recommend it. They have a high ended bar on the terrace by a pool and a great selection of wine. If it's summer you should go there at the end of the day and have a drink while enjoying the view to virtually all of Barcelona. Fantastic picture opportunity.,5,2015,07,19
11,Great central location,Only second time visited Barcelona but it's such a beautiful city. My husband and myself were there for the Spanish Grandprix . We were only a few steps away from the train so it was so easy and cheap to travel to the track on the Saturday and Sunday. The hotel and staff were really helpful and rooms and service were very good. We are hoping to visit again next year so will definitely like to stay again. The only disappointment was the breakfast! For the standard of hotel we thought for the price you were paying the choice wasn't very good!,5,2015,07,19
11,Would stay here again,"Enjoyed everything about this hotel. We received a nice welcome, the staff were very professional and could recommend restaurants and a nice tapas place. Very convenient location for shopping and we used the hop on and off bus to get around which had a stop nearby.",4,2015,07,18
11,Enjoyed our stay,This Hotel is in a great location in the city. Close to the Ramblas area as well as the Metro station. High end area of the City. Staff very pleasant and eager to please. Concierge made all restaurant reservations. Housekeeping service twice per day was nice. Excellent Breakfast. Rooftop pool which is a cool bar and nightclub at night with excellent views of the CIty. Rooms were nicely appointed and clean. Free WiFi. Would recommend and stay again.,5,2015,07,17
11,Exceptional,"From when we arrived and until we left, we were treated royally by the staff at the Majestic.  The room we had was actually larger than we anticipated, beautifully furnished and they provided adapters in the room!  The breakfast buffet is NOT your typical breakfast - it was fabulous and even included champagne.  This hotel is very well located and the rooftop pool and bar were also delightful- I just can't say enough- we will be back!",5,2015,07,17
11,The Place to Stay in Barcelona:  Majestic Hotel & Spa,"We loved everything about this gorgeous five star hotel. The staff was so gracious and professional.  They impressed us on every level from check in and concierge services to food and beverage.  The stylish rooms are divine with wonderful beds and baths.  The rooftop lounge and pool was an ideal airy perch to view the Sagrada Familia, city and sea, while sipping Sangria and enjoying a swim.  A live DJ added to the vibe. Majestic is in a great location with shopping galore out the door and easy access to Gaudi architecture, paella restaurants by the harbor, La Rambla and the Gothic Quarter. Barcelona is such a dynamic and pulsing city and Majestic Hotel and Spa is the perfect sanctuary in the middle of the scene.  And their concierge team is  excellent at recommending the right restaurants. Highly recommend staying here.",5,2015,07,15
11,Rooftop bar and pool spectacular ,"The Majestic is a five star hotel in the heart of Barcelona. The building, interior decor, and dining facilities are all worth a visit.
What is outstanding is the bar/pool on the 10th floor overlooking the city. One can see all of the prominent landmarks all the way to the sea. After touring the city on one of the hop-on-hop off busses, one can see the various building from this vantage point and understand what you have see.

The frozen fruit drinks are delicious after a hot day touring.",5,2015,07,13
11,I will return,"Spent 4 days here on my own before a business event at different hotel. Service is exceptional, in all departments. Rooms are reasonable size and have Nespresso machines (hurray!). Bathroom very good although some issues getting consistent water temp. But hotel is old building so not a big surprise. 
Great location - can't imagine better. I will come back here. ",5,2015,07,12
11,Comfort and luxury with great service,"The quality of the hotel is evident from the minute you approach the front doors.  The location is on an exciting and bustling retail thoroughfare and the multiple doormen are very courteous and helpful.  The rooms are very comfortable, the fitness room is sufficient and the breakfast buffet is fantastic.  The roof deck is a great place to see the skyline, dip in a refreshing pool and have a few cocktails.  The Majestic Hotel & Spa is a great play to stay in Barecelona.",5,2015,07,11
11,Love the roof top terrace!,"Stayed at The Majestic Barcelona at end of April for 3 nights - had a wonderful stay , the welcome from the Management upon check in was above expectation and this carried through for all staff who were very attentive throughout.
Breakfast was amazing with loads of choice , panoramic views from the roof top terrace , a great place to relax  during the day and also for drinks in the evening

A lovely classical and traditional hotel , we will definitely return !",5,2015,07,11
11,Special Hotel,"If all hotels viewed the guest stay as curb to curb, they would model their service after this hotel.  Attentive, friendly, proper.  The lobby makes a solid first impression and the rooms are very tasteful.  Our room had a beautiful bathroom though, and for the life of me, I could never figure out the hot and cold water in the shower.  The concierge service was helpful and absolutely showed that they listened to the question before offering a one size fits all recommendation.  While we did not eat in the restaurants, we did enjoy dessert on the roof top, truly a treat with stunning views (and well worth the effort). The gym is more than ample and the only negative from the trip was the spa which, despite the charming receptionist, was hot and noisier than it should have been. Truly, the spa seemed to be a bit of an add on to the hotel.   We would surely stay at the hotel again. ",5,2015,07,10
11,beautiful,"After spending 11 days on a cruise ship which was also beautiful this hotel was amazing from the rooms to the view from the roof.  The staff were very attentive and very nice.  The location was very convenient to shopping, walking, and eating.  Our room was on the first floor we had a beautiful junior suite and amazingly we did not hear any street noise.",5,2015,07,10
11,LOVE LOVE LOVE the Majestic!,"I can't think of anywhere better to stay in Barcelona than the Majestic Hotel & Spa.  Thank you once again to the lovely Ingrid for such a perfect stay! We truly feel welcomed...and spoiled when we stay the the Majestic Hotel.  

Besides the ideal location (next door to Chanel, no less) the Majestic Hotel is top-notch in every way.  The service is impeccable, the rooms are beautifully appointed and oh, so comfortable. Everything is considered.  With champagne in the room to greet us, along with water, sweets and snacks, we were welcomed to the hotel in style. 

Breakfast is a treat, with the freshest array of foods and impeccable service. The spa is intimate and provides a quiet reprieve and excellent massages.  The pool and bar on the top floor is fantastic, right down to the house DJ.  

I highly recommend the Majestic Hotel to anyone who enjoys a luxury hotel experience in an ideal location for walking the charming streets of Barcelona!",5,2015,07,09
11,Perfect location for shopping - Expedit Region,"I have stayed at this hotel 3 times once before the renovation an twice afterwards.
It is located in the expedit region which has designer shops and top end restaurants.There is a taxi rank right outside the door. The main shops and the Las Ramblas main street is within walking distance. 

The hotel is comfortable and clean. i found the breakfast average but overpriced so on my last 2 visits i have got breakfast from the cafe directly opposite the hotel. 

On a warm evening we usually sit the roof of the hotel where they have soft seating candles and a pool .food and cocktails are served with greta music and a view of Barcelona at night .( Roof terrace is also open in the day but seasonal warm evening only.  I think the hotel also has apartments. 

I would stay here again",5,2015,07,09
11,Great location and very comfortable bed,"We loved our stay at this elegant and beautiful hotel. It is not the Four Seasons, the rooms are small, but the staff were attentive and helpful, the room was comfortable and the bed was heavenly.  Loved the location. The rooftop deck in the evening was a fantastic place to grab a drink and people watch.",4,2015,07,09
11,"Great location, courteous staff, enjoyed my stay!","If you are with friends, family, or just business, this is a great property to pick and enjoy your stay. 

Pros: The roof top bar on level 10th is just perfect to unwind, sip your poison and watch the city, sun go down... just apt. Rooms are pretty decent, location of the property and the breakfast buffet are just icing to the entire experience. 

Cons: Ageing reflects on the elevators, could be certainly looked into but works well even if you've had a few more :)

Tip: Train station is just a 10 mins walk, enjoy the city and if you get time, do visit 4 cats restaurant for a great dinner and wine. (15 mins walk from the hotel). ",4,2015,07,09
11,Majestic location and Service Excellent,"This hotel has a great location in Barcelonas high end shopping district
The pool on the roof top has the best view of the city and is a wonderful area to have a casual bite to eat or just enjoy the view with a cocktail  the staff were helpful and pleasant a great place to stay within walking distance of the tour bus shopping and many restaurants",5,2015,07,08
11,Family Apartment Stay,"We just returned from a great visit to Barcelona. We stayed in a family apartment at the Majestic Hotel & Spa (the apartments are across the street from the hotel). The apartments are more understated and simpler (in decor) than the hotel, but it was a perfect arrangement for our family of four. Two bedrooms (one King and two twins) and two full bathrooms. The apartment also had two wonderful balconies that overlooked the Passeig de Gracia. Although it sits on a main road - the apartment is quiet. It is a perfect location! Only one block from Casa Batllo. Less than mile walks (and all were pleasant walks!) to Barri Gotic, Las Ramblas, La Bouqueria and La Sagrada Familia. Our only taxi rides were airport transfers and one trip to eat at Bestial seaside. Lots of restaurants and shopping at our doorstep (my kids loved Bacoa). The hotel staff were incredibly friendly - and in a genuine manner. And all the hotel amenties were available to us. Since it is a residence, there is not a daily cleaning (like in hotel stays), but the apartments are well stocked (and cleaning is optional for a fee). Hotel Wifi is free and reliable. The pool is a bit small, but we were not there to swim and it was enough for cooling off. The pool area is on top of the hotel and has a great view! It also has great lounging chaises. I highly recommend staying at the Majestic Hotel & Spa when visiting Barcelona! I know we hope to return soon!",5,2015,07,08
11,"Wonderful Hotel, Great Staff...pity their conditions!","I have just returned from a wonderful city break in Barcelona staying in my preferred hotel in the city, The Majestic.  I always choose this hotel as it's location is fantastic and the service always impeccable from arrival to departure.  Everyone in the hotel from the Bellboys to the Barmen on the terrace (which has the best views of Barcelona) seem to go out of their way to ensure I feel like an individual and no request is ever too great.

In fact it was the diligence and uncomplaining nature of the staff which struck me both when I entered and left the hotel that left me a little bemused at the conditions to which they had to work!  Bellboys tirelessly handling luggage all day in temperatures exceeding 33degrees.  To see them them sweat underneath heavy suits whilst tending to the bags of every guest made me feel uncomfortable and I couldn't understand why they didn't have more suitable uniforms.  Traveling frequently across the globe I have seen bellboys in less hotter climates with smart and weather appropriate attire.  When I raised my concerns at the front desk I was given a nonchalant response so when I left I tended to my own bags and left a tip with the bellboy team.

I believe that employees here should be treated with the same respect as the guests in turn allowing for a better service to be enjoyed by all!",4,2015,07,07
11,"Gorgeous hotel, with a few issues.","I really love my creature comforts so, after a week in the country side of Catalonia in the early summer heat with no A/C I was so excited to check into the Majestic... ahh clean sheets a *fantastic* shower and good old 5 star service... sort of. We were a group of 3 rooms each checking in individually this seemed to really baffle the check in staff...though we booked on Expedia - so maybe that had something to do with it. 

The room was small but well appointed comfortable and clean. The location really can;t be beat and because it can't this particular weekend it was packed full and *busy*, don't imagine this is ever a quiet hotel.

However, it took 4 phone calls down and many hours to procure our requested crib for our 16 month old. Not something I'm used to waiting for, doing legwork for at this caliber of hotel. When the crib arrived it was done up very nicely, with gender specific bedding and a small teddy bear and some toiletries for our daughter. The mattress in the crib was very high - so we ended up tucking it in the corner and fortifying it with the high back of a chair on one side so that out curious toddler wouldn't throw herself out in the middle of the night (instead she climbed out onto our bed, vs falling on the floor) Essentially I wouldn't recommend a crib for anyone travelling with a baby who can stand.",3,2015,07,07
11,Great location and great people,"The hotel is right on the Paseo and you can see Gaudi's architecture from the rooftop.  Everyone there is helpful and the hotel is kept up very well.  The rooftop bar is our favorite, we sat there for 6 hours and had lunch and dinner while simply lounging.  Our room was spacious and even though right next to the elevator, it was not a bother for noise.  The buffet breakfast is not to be missed!  It is a shame to call it a buffet breakfast, the food is amazing!

Two waiters at the rooftop bar need to be recognized for their extraordinary service - Alex and Giovanni Hernandez.  Great guys, great servers and knew our needs before we even asked.  Giovanni recommended a bar for us to visit when we continued our trip to Madrid - The Reina Victoria. And to say ""hello"" to his previous manager at the rooftop bar. We spoke with Giovanni's old boss at the bar and we were treated like family.  

Thank you for making our first trip to Barcelona special.",4,2015,07,06
11,5* LOOKS,"We came here after getting married in London and staying in another 5* hotel, however very different, in London breakfast was included, At the Majestic it wasn't, in fact to have a coffee in our room was chargable, very strange of a 5* star hotel I thought, roof terrace lovely, enjoyed a couple of drinks here, looked wowed, didn't get treated wow, we normally book hotels direct, maybe it is because we booked through expedia, who knows....just slept here really, didn't get the special feeling we got in London",4,2015,07,06
11,Nice ,"
The comments about these residences being large were not an exaggeration.  Our 2 bedroom unit was massive.  We were in R31 (3rd floor).  We had a wonderful street view.  After staying in smaller hotels previously, it was nice to stretch out, although we did not need all the amenities (full kitchen, washer/dryer). The unit was, however, a bit dark and did not have a lot of character.  The hotel staff was extremely pleasant and helpful.  Great views from the rooftop bar (although it was very crowded and pricey).  Personally, I prefer the Barri Gothic area where there are more places to congregate and people watch.  Things are not quite as expensive in that area either.  I would definitely recommend this apartment if you had a big group, small kids, or wanted to do some cooking while in Barcelona

",4,2015,07,04
11,A drink on the rooftop,Went here with a couple of friends to have a drink after dinner. A very nice rooftop with great views over Barcelona:) the DJ played nice lounge-music and everybody was very relaxed. The place was full so get there in time! A bit expensive but worth a visit.,4,2015,07,04
11,Wonderful family vacation,"Our family really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Majestic this June. Our room had a view of Casa Battleo from both balconies and was quiet and very comfortable. Housekeeping did an excellent job of keeping fresh towels and toiletries stocked (I was travelling with two teenagers which meant there were a lot of showers and grooming daily). The concierge and reception staff were lovely. I had to book and cancel a couple of dinners during our stay and they were kind, informative and helpful. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet in the mornings and looking at the view of the city from the rooftop lounge in the evenings.  We would definitely stay here again. If there was one small item that was not so fabulous, it would be the difficulty we had in finding a place to sit on the rooftop terrace. It isn't a large area, but the hotel doesn't seem to put a priority on keeping that space for guests of the hotel.",4,2015,07,04
11,Great hotel . Not far from the center of Barcelona .,"We stayed there 4 nights , We thought the staff were very helpful and most spoke English . The hotel was clean and well kept, the lifts are a little rickety .
I really liked the roof top pool and bar . ",4,2015,07,02
11,Beautiful room,"This was a dream room with great amenities and a bed I never wanted to leave.  The staff were helpful in every way. They brought bottled water and cheese and crackers to the room complimentary.  It was a great stay.

      
      ",5,2015,07,01
11,Absolutely amazing!,"I would highly recommend the Majestic to anyone who wants a 5 star room and service. Also the location and rooftop bar are probably the best in all of Barcelona! We are going back for sure next time we are in Spain.
      ",5,2015,07,01
11,Majestic Hotel Barcelona Spain,"The staff was courteous and extremely helpful. The rooms were comfortable clean bright and modern. The location was perfect reminded me of Madison ave. in Manhattan. 
Easy access to all tourist attractions.  Great rooftop bar over looking the city. I highly recommend this hotel and plan on revisiting someday in the furture. 

Thank you ,
TripAdvisor for the recommendation.",5,2015,06,30
11,Honeymoon stay,"No better location in Barcelona.... Not cheap but not crazy expensive either.  Super friendly and helpful staff and worth the ""leading hotels"" ranking.  Do not sleep through the breakfast like we did on first day!! Would definitely come again",5,2015,06,30
11,"Excellent, but.......","So, this hotel is beautiful, cool, and located in the middle of all that is great about Barcelona.  We booked the penthouse suite and it was lovely.  The room was typical luxury modern Europe - the size of the presidential suite was the same as a regular suite in the states, it is an older building so the ceilings are average height (not ""grand""), and all of the fixtures have been updated so it is very comfortable.  What made this suite extra special was the HUGE patio we had to ourselves - it spanned the entire length of our room with a dining area, couch & love seat and two lounge chairs.  We were on the top floor so we had a great view, however, they used a type of wood fencing to block off the balcony so it kind of blocks the view (they should replace with glass fencing so as not to obstruct the view).

Breakfast was included.  They had a nice spread for the guests with an omelete bar, lots of fruit, pastry, and meat choices.  Cappuccinos, juices, and champagne included.  The bar area is nice and luxurious and we enjoyed many after drinks there.

So now the ""BUT"" part of the title for this review........When we first arrived, there was a bottle of fabulous champagne and some sweets waiting for us, we had water by our beds, and our towels were well stocked.  The next night there was a pastry treat waiting for us celebrating the Nascar races happening in Barcelona that week and complimentary water.  The next night, no treats, no complimentary water (not even with turn down service) and we were shorted on towels.  Our last night we had to ask to make sure we had water and towels stocked.  Now, we are in the presidential suite, the best room in the hotel, and they could not even make sure we had towels and water.  Seems petty, but my goodness, if you can't get amazing service in the presidential suite where can you get it?

Given this little oversight, the staff was friendly, the hotel was lovely, and it was a very nice place to stay.",5,2015,06,30
11,Barcelona Hotel Stay,"A Fantastic 5 star hotel with an amazing rooftop bar with spectacular views around Barcelona.
The hotel is within easy reach of all the main attractions by foot but the plentiful taxis will get you there quicker.
Everything you will need is in the room already and the beds and pillows are very comfortable indeed, the staff are also very helpful with any of your wishes",5,2015,06,30
11,Amazing rooftop bar,"Loved this bar.....by far one of the best rooftop bars in Barcelona......
will definately look to visit again upon my return to Barcelona.....I have already recommended to friends...
 
Great find in the centre of Barcelona.",5,2015,06,30
11,Best Hotel in Barcelona,"I was there in Barcelona with my family on 13th June 2015 only for 1 day.

I must say one of the Beat Hotels in Barcelona. The Location is excellent 

The staff was so courteous. The Duty Manager was very Humble, we were surprised to find a Cava bottle for us and marshmallows for kids along with chocolates.

The Concierge Team was amazing. The were able to book us through the Restaurant which otherwise had a long waiting. 

The kids were very delighted to be here,

I recommend for all traveling with Family on Vacation to Barcelona to stay here.",5,2015,06,30
11,Barcelona Stay,"We spent three days in Barcelona at the Majestic Hotel. It is near the all the sights and the business district. Staff was very helpful and congenial. Rooms are fantastic, clean and good views. AC is just OK could use some work!! View from the rooftop lounge is awesome, views are great especially at night!! Service there was quite slow and at times they seem to ignore you. That and the AC are the reason for 4 stars.",4,2015,06,29
11,Majestic in granduer and service,"I have resisted staying in city hotels especially in cities that have beach front properties, however after being recommended by a family member, the Majestic service has drastically altered my perception.  One service that truly stood out above others was at the roof top terrace handled by the head sommelier (Serge if I am not mistaken).  His expertise especially with the local cavas was a treat my partner and I enjoyed, with a follow up smile from keki, our delightful waiter.  We had appreciated his attentive and professional nature more so especially after encountering some less than desirable service around the city.  I must say that a venue is only as good as the people they employ and luckily for the Majestic, they got the right guy.  Thanks for the food/cava combination tips Serge (or 'Merci' as they say).",5,2015,06,29
11,It Really Doesn't Get Better Than This,"I cannot imagine a better place to stay in Barcelona.  Everything, and I do mean everything, about our stay was top notch from start to finish.

Prior to our arrival, the concierge was very helpful in suggesting and making restaurant reservations and arranging for a car service for pick up and return to the airport.  Once we arrived, they also assisted with maps and directions and made us feel right at home.

We had read an earlier reviewer's suggestion to book a massage appointment on the day of arrival and I did the same for me and my husband.  What a perfect treat to help us get through our jet lag!  The spa is quiet and the staff top notch.

I could have honestly spent more time at the rooftop bar.  The views are incredible and the atmosphere peaceful and laid-back.  Service was friendly and unobtrusive.  

Others have noted the perfect location - lots of fabulous shopping as well as easy to walk to almost anywhere in Barcelona.  A subway station and bike share is also close by.  

Our room may have been one of the nicest I've ever occupied.  We were upgraded to a suite on arrival and were on the first level, close to the street.  We had an office area with a desk and chairs overlooking the street corner (and a perfect place for reading and people watching as well as working!), a beautiful living room area, a large walk in closet, a powder room, a large bathroom, and a spacious bedroom.  We were originally concerned that it would be loud being so close to the street but the sound proofing that they've done with the windows and doors makes it such that you think that you are many miles from the middle of a large city!  

My husband enjoyed the breakfast buffet probably more than I did but they are very kind and will bring you espresso and other beverages if you request it.  

For the fitness conscious, they do have a fitness center on the -1 level as well as a business center (good for printing boarding passes!)  

The staff was friendly and courteous - we would return in a heartbeat!",5,2015,06,27
11,I'd go Back in a Heartbeat,"The Hotel Majestic is worthy of its name. From the moment one steps into the lobby and checks in at the front desk, everything about this hotel is top shelf professional, yet friendly.

Our train from Madrid was late and the railroad, we accidentally learned, was obligated to refund a portion or all of our fare. One of the concierges, MARC, was overboard helpful and wrote out, in Spanish, what we should tell the agent on duty 
at the train station. We chose, instead, to let AMEX Platinum in the US, handle the details as we did not wish to spend vacation time at the train station.

Hotel manager, PASCAL BILLARD, offered his personal cell, dialed AMEX in the US and waited patiently while we attempted to resolve the problem. Sadly, AMEX Platinum proved to be of little help.

Kudos to Mr. Billard and to Marc who truly know the meaning of the word ""service.""

The area surrounding the hotel has many internationally known upscale shops and some of the best tapas bars in the area. Ask the front desk for suggestions.

The rooms are beautifully appointed and the views overlooking the main boulevard below gave us a true sense of Barcelona was.",5,2015,06,27
11,Location location location,"Fantastic start to finish,close to a lot of shopping,restaurants and things you'll want to see if your visit is vacation holiday ,if not walking distance cab stand  right on corner of hotel and you can get a double decker tour bus ticket that is hop on hop off service right out front as well and that covers many  points of interest around the city .Staff is wonderful and really made us comfortable and relaxed.Topas bars on next block has  menus in English with pics  (just ask)and draft beer I'd never heard of ...just exploring around the hotel was wonderful and then on the last night of our stay the Barcelona football club won the cup and the streets unexpectedly filled with flag waving fans and it got even better...",5,2015,06,25
11,"Top class service and gorgeous hotel, great food","The hotel is an amalgamation of 3 or 4 buildings so is a bit of a rabbit warren with different levels, but certainly not a deal breaker since the service is impeccable, the rooms quiet and luxurious and the location can't be beat. Hop into any taxi and they instantly know the Majestic. Breakfast is a delicious spread although I must say there isn't that much variation over the few days we were there. There's a restaurant in the basement, conference rooms during the day. Not a great location as a dining venue, but the food was faultless nonetheless.",5,2015,06,24
11,Great Hotel.  Great Staff.,"Almost anyone with enough money can build or renovate a hotel and have a lovely property.  What I have learned in years of globe-trotting is that what makes a hotel is the staff.  When they are well trained, and execute impeccably, then you've nailed it.  

This hotel does that.  It's a great space, but they've also conquered the more difficult challenge of great service.",5,2015,06,22
11,"Beautiful hotel, centrally situated","The room was very good, and the lobby entrance very impressive. The roof terrace and pool were also good. One criticism was the carpet on the floor of the 6th floor hallway was very marked and stained - not 5 star! The staff however were fantastic on reception, client services and at breakfast or by the pool. ",4,2015,06,21
11,Excellent Location and Elegant Hotel (Recommended),"I have stayed on this hotel for 3 nights for business.
The location is excellent on heart of Barcelona and on main street (Passeig de Gracia). Rambles Street is 5 minutes walk. There is metro station nearby.

The room is big and clean. The bed is comfortable. The staff is friendly. Wifi is good and free.

The breakfast is good with many varieties. However, the Lunch and dinner was chief selected which some time I liked.

There are many shops, restaurants and supermarket nearby.
",5,2015,06,21
11,"Great place for shopping, food and enjoying the city","Good location in the middle of the high end shopping street. Great restaurants all around, ask the hotel for recommendations. 4 nights we trusted their recommendations and they were never wrong. Great place to stay.",4,2015,06,20
11,Beautiful Hotel in a fantastic location,"Beautiful hotel in a fantastic location.  Great position to easily walk to lovely tapas bars and good shopping area.  Room just gorgeous, good facilities and great service from staff. Would definitely stay again.",5,2015,06,20
11,"Location, luxury and service","The Magestic is located on the upscale Passeig de Gracia within a short distance of two Gaudi houses and many luxury stores and tapas bars. It is in a safe, beautiful area that is convenient for exploring the city. The staff is excellent and the rooms perfect. I did not like that the rooftop bar was booked for private business parties on the nights that we stayed at the hotel so we could not use the rooftop bar. This is not fair to the guests who think that they will be able to use the bar and see the view at night. While we were at the hotel, the hotel had too many tour groups and business groups. It made the public areas crowded.",5,2015,06,19
11,Charm and Elegance in the Heart of Barcelona,"We recently spent a few days here in advance of a cruise.  Lovely hotel on a beautiful street filled with shops.  Charming rooftop terrace overlooking the city.  Fantastic breakfast.....loved the coffee and what a selection and variety of foods!  The room was typical size for a European hotel, very nicely accommodated.  The staff was welcoming and always available for assistance.  High quality all the way!",5,2015,06,19
11,A memorable stay,"We are coming to the end of our 4 night stay, and it could not have been better. The staff are friendly, attentive but discrete and our room with a terrace has been perfect. We wanted it to be special for our celebratory break, and it has been in every way. The thoughtful touches have been much appreciated. Thank you.
The room top terrace is a perfect way to end the night.",5,2015,06,18
11,Excellent Hotel on Busy Street,"The Hotel is located on a main central business street. Great location for access to shopping,
restaurants, and sights. The only draw back is the noise level. Even with the windows closed the
noise is quite pronounced.
The common areas are well done with lots of interesting artwork. The rooms are of good size. The beds are comfortable and the bathroom was spacious with all the amenities one would need. The sleeper couch in the room was not very comfortable and should probably be replaced. Otherwise room was fine.
The staff is courteous in their greetings, knowledgeable and provided good restaurant recommendations.
The roof top bar is a nice attraction with a good view of the city.
I would stay here again only in a quieter room.",4,2015,06,17
11,Great hotel and great staff in Barcelona,"My wife and I stayed recently at the Majestic at the tail end of a two-week vacation in Spain.  When we arrived from Malaga around noon for a one night stay in Barcelona, the gentleman assisting us apologized that the room wasn't yet ready (we weren't expecting it to be ready at that time anyway) and before we said anything, he went on to say that he was upgrading us to a suite for the inconvenience.  We dined out and came back for some drinks in the great bar off the lobby and found the staff there equally good and prices very reasonable for the 5-star property it is.  The next morning we enjoyed their excellent breakfast in the restaurant before heading off to the airport.  I didn't know what to expect when I booked the hotel, as I was just looking for a nice hotel that was in a good location (which it is), where we could enjoy some time in Barcelona before catching our flight the next day.  We had a great experience and I would definitely consider staying there for a longer period of time when we're next in Barcelona.",5,2015,06,17
11,majestic- perfection,"we were so impressed with the service and friendliness of the staff.  the building and rooms are absolutely beautiful and the roof top bar was so nice.  the pool on the roof is small,but nice to sit around.  the location of this hotel is perfect, the Paseo de Gracia is a wide street with many restaurants shops and cafes, very close to so much we LOVED it here",5,2015,06,16
11,Grab a Drink on the Roof,"We went to the Majestic after a long day of site seeing to grab a drink on the roof.  We arrived at 7pm and we're lucky to get one of the last available tables - by the time we left at 8pm there were at least 30 people waiting to sit! The view as wonderful.  We could see all the sites of Barcelona. I ordered a refreshing Sangria.  When exiting the hotel we decided to ask the concierge for a dinner recommendation.  Angel at the concierge desk was not only friendly, but gave us 2 recommendations for retaurants that we visited during our stay and we loved both.  Angel knew we were not staying at the hotel but still have us 5 star service as if we were VIP's.  Thanks for your help, Angel!",5,2015,06,14
11,Amazing!,"We are at the Majestic as I write this review. General Manager Pascal and his staff are wonderful! Can't wait for the rest of our stay!! Rooms, public areas, service, location....5 stars. Roof top bar has incredible views.",5,2015,06,12
11,"Comfy, elegant, central location for shops, transit, and architecture","I stayed here in April 2015 as part of a tour group of attorneys--expected a five-star experience and was not disappointed. Old-world attentive service with cutting-edge modern cuisine and decor (but cushy where it counts). Its location on the Passeig de Gracia was eerily reminiscent of the Champs-Elysees but without any touristy kitsch. (Plenty of upscale designer stores for gawking). Gorgeous views from the rooftop bar and pool--but chilly and windy in early spring. Lobby bar had marvelously inventive tapas and generously poured wines, competitively priced for the very upscale neighborhood. Bathroom had every imaginable amenity. Nespresso coffeemaker in room (1 euro per capsule), but a Nespresso boutique across the street (with prices lower than in the US).  Two Gaudi buildings within a block or two. Large flat-screen TV, dependable fast wi-fi. Sumptuous breakfast buffet--included cava, Serrano and Iberico hams, custom egg-and-omelet station (including made-to-order Benedicts), and a wide array of meats, cheeses, vegetables, fruits & pastries. Citywide metro and regional commuter train stations down the block; 24/7 farmacia, numerous ATMs and restaurants (terrific seafood/tapas/sushi across the street). Beds had duvets, down pillows, cushy mattresses. Friendly staff with good command of English & French besides the usual Catalan & Spanish. Would stay here on my next trip to Barcelona.",5,2015,06,12
11,"Great Location, Beautiful Building","My family stayed at the Majestic for two days during our vacation last summer. The hotel interiors were very nice, I loved the architecture both inside and out and would definitely stay here again.
We were split between three different rooms, all were good. My room was one of the smaller ones, it was two twin beds pushed together, but comfortable and had a beautiful view down the street out the ""balconette"" window.  Beds were comfortable, all white duvet and linens, and there was a small desk area as well. My parents had one of the junior suites, they had a separate bedroom and sitting room, much nicer, but also more expensive. It was a very nice room and had a full balcony with a view down Las Ramblas. The bathrooms were both very nice, all marble, and really nice Bvglari toiletries. 
One of the best features of this hotel is roof deck. Awesome views! It's a perfect place to relax with a cocktail or glass of rose and soak it all in. You can sit by the pool to sunbathe or sit under the shaded area to relax. We lucked out with good weather so we spent a little time up there every day, the roof deck was very busy, but we were still always able to find a spot. 
A negative is that one night the roof deck was at capacity and as hotel guests they wouldn't let us up there for a nightcap, that was a bit annoying. I also heard the wifi was expensive, but ours was free (not sure why). 
Also, the service was good, but not excellent. Friendly, but not fast. Service on the roof deck was pretty slow. It also took a while to check-in. I feel like it is such a big hotel that their service suffered a bit. Waits for elevators also took longer due to size.",4,2015,06,10
11,The Perfect Location!,"There are lots of hotel choices in Barcelona, and we picked this one largely based on its star rating & location.  We were not disappointed.  The hotel is located on one of the main streets of Barcelona in one of the upscale areas of the city.  Beyond the location, the hotel is wonderful in every respect--and the breakfast buffet, while a bit pricey is nothing short of spectacular.  I'd go back to the Majestic in a heartbeat!",5,2015,06,10
11,Great Location for Walking in Barcelona,"The Majestic Hotel and Spa was a high-end hotel located in the center of the exclusive shopping district.  The lobby was good looking and had several people available for check-in and luggage help.  We did mention that we were celebrating our anniversary when we checked in.  The lady who checked us in did not acknowledge this nor did anyone at the hotel during our stay.

The room we had did not have a view but it was spacious, comfortable, and very nice.  The large bed had wonderful linens and two separate duvets.  There was a sofa and a desk.  The Wi-Fi was free with the room.  

The bathroom was fantastic with marble floors, a large soaking tub and independent shower, double sinks, and many amenities.  Turndown service came each night.  The first night we were given chocolates and bottled water, but the other night we received only the chocolates.  

There was a coffee maker in the room, but there was a charge of 1 Euro for each cup brewed using the Nespresso-type coffee maker.  I haven't experienced that before.

Downstairs there was a wonderful breakfast buffet that was far superior to most I have ever seen. Both hot and cold foods were available, and what we had to eat and drink was well done.

The very small pool was located on the rooftop at the bar and dining area.  It was really not large enough for swimming.  The views there were spectacular.  

Checkout time was noon but they did store our bags until our departure time.  When our car service came to get us, the driver was told we had checked out.  Luckily we were able to find him after waiting in the lobby for over a half an hour.",4,2015,06,10
11,EXCELLENT !!!,"Majestic hotel in Barcelona is amazing , perfect service, the concierge service is amazing , was a great experience for us. Location is the best in Barcelona , close frome the best shops and principal attractions . ",5,2015,06,10
11,Excellent hotel in the perfect Barcelona location,"My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at the Majestic Hotel. We found the front desk staff and Concierge to be extremely knowledgeable and accommodating to our inquiries. The location is perfect as it is walking distance from the Sagrada Familia, many of the Gaudi Casas, La Rambla, Gothic Quarter, tons of restaurants and shopping. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.

The hotel is high end, however I was hoping the Air Conditioning would be a bit stronger as even set to 19 degrees celsius was not particularly cold. I will qualify that statement by saying that my wife and I like the room to be very very cold while sleeping.

Lastly, the whole coffee situation is a bit confusing in Spain and the breakfast staff can be a tad more helpful in explaining the differences.",5,2015,06,09
11,Romantic weekend,"I spent 3 nights at this hotel with my boyfriend.

Customer service was impeccable. From the moment we arrived, the staff was very helpful. They recommended us amazing bars and restaurants, which really made our stay so much better.

The location could not be better, in the heart of Barcelona. Close to all the cultural spots and the beach.",5,2015,06,09
11,Great stay,"We stayed 2 nights at the end of May before a cruise.  Loved the hotel, we had a very nice room overlooking the street corner of the hotel.  Concierge was friendly and helpful.  Location is great.  Enjoyed rooftop bar.  Included breakfast was fabulous.  Service was very good.",5,2015,06,08
11,Can't Wait to Return,"We spent four nights at the Majestic and enjoyed every minute.  The hotel is located on a lovely street, surrounded by high-end shops and Gaudi masterpieces, and a walkable distance from La Rambla and many other tourist destinations.  The staff is friendly, professional, and extremely competent.  Francisco in Guest Relations helped us obtain tickets for a flamenco performance and our Gaudi tours, and helped us make the most of our time in Barcelona.  We were upgraded to a beautiful suite with a large outdoor terrace, spoiled rotten with in-room surprises like cava, chocolates, and fruit trays, and made to feel extremely welcome.  The room was nicely updated and had tons of storage and natural light.  We ate a couple of meals in the hotel bar and enjoyed them very much, and the breakfast is extensive and delightful.  I can't wait to return to Barcelona, and will definitely stay at the Majestic. You should, too.",5,2015,06,08
11,"Great hotel, great location, great staff","Being our first time in Barcelona, we were not sure what part of town to stay, but we were given this recommendation by dear friends who stayed at the Majestic 2 years earlier.  The Majestic is centrally located on Passeig de Gracia, close to Gaudi's Casa Batllo and Casa Mila, and about 15 minute walk to Sagrada Familia.  Hotel Majestic is in the middle of the Barcelona shopping district, with every retailer imaginable located just blocks from the hotel.  We booked early, got a great rate and we were upgraded to a suite overlooking the city.  Do not miss the rooftop bar, with 360 degree views of the city.",4,2015,06,08
11,Outstanding Hotel,"This Hotel is most appropriately named, it is Majestic in every way.. A most deserving hotel to be called A Leading Hotel of The World. It's location, suites,rooms, restaurants and spa are only surpassed by the superior staff, from porters, guest relations staff, to concierge,especially Marc, to the GM Mr. Pascal Ballard....this is what takes the Majestic Hotel from a Leading Hotel of the World to An Exceptional Leading Hotel of the World.
This, our first trip to Barcelona, was in celebration of a birthday and wedding anniversary. This superior staff and beautiful and centrally located Hotel made our trip and celebration most memorable 
We look forward to returning and would recommend The Majestic Hotel to anyone considering a stay in Barcelona.
",5,2015,06,08
11,Love this hotel,"Great hotel. I loved it. And a great bargain for the money as well.  Exceeded our expectations. My daughter had been here last year and recommended it to us. There were six of us including my two brothers and their wives.  

The rooms were spacious and well appointed but the best part was the people.  Every one of the staff was professional, helpful, english-speaking and eager to help.

Also, the free wifi was a bonus. Not because it was free but because it was by far the fastest hotel wifi I had ever experienced.

I highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again if the occasion called for a return trip to Barcelona.",5,2015,06,07
11,Best Hotel Ever,"I spend 5 night in the majestic .. and it was a MAJESTIC nights .. they treat us like royal .. the staff was the best .. always smiling and greeting .. the room was wonderful .. the food was great .. they do every thing you want or need from them .. i try so many hotels all over the world .. but nothing beat the majestic.

The one thing i realy regret is that it was only 5 nights. 

You well believe my words only if you try the majestic",5,2015,06,05

It's located right in the err  center,  a walk from anything you would like to visit our shop.
The sea id about 40 minutes walk, but everything else is around you.
The facilities in the hotel are top.
The rooms are big and beautifully decorated.  Big and well built bathroom.
The bed is extremely comfortable.
But, if I have to mention was is the best quality of this hotel, without a doubt  I say, the outstanding service.    
Great service all around the hotel, I would dare to say, one of the best I ever witnessed. 
Bottom line, if you can afford it, that's your hotel.",5,2015,06,03
11,one of the best hotels but be wary of their beds,"we were traveling from the united states on both and business and pleasure trip with my wife for ten days. we were in flight for about 17 hours due to a terrible stopover. to add insult to injury on both flights their was children who would not stop crying, so we had no sleep on the plane. when we arrived at the hotel we had been awake for 27 hours at that point and we were tired and felt gross and needed a shower. From the minute we walked in the gentlemen in the front jordi and david were a true help and pleasure as they spoke english and knew the city like the back of their hands and made us feel very comfortable. the front desk told us that we had come in to early and they had no rooms to spare yet. we understood and sat in the lobby. this was 9:30am, the front desk then came at 1:15pm and told us that a room had opened. when we went to the room. we noticed that there were two double beds with 4 feet of distance between them. this made no sense as I have a wife - I'm not sure how the sleeping arrangements were going to work so we called the front desk and they said they had no other rooms at the time and they sent someone from the cleaning dept and they combined the beds together and put a comforter on top of the beds. it did not feel all that comfortable but we were so tired that we took the room. the room itself was beautiful with a french style balcony and amazing views of the street below. the shower was like a waterfall and tub which was fantastic. the door to the bathroom however was terrible as it was on a track and would constantly get stuck and you had to use all your force to try and open and close the door. there was also no lock on that door either. they did have a hand held bidet. in the evening they place a delicious chocolate on the bed and two bottles of water. the hotel is right in the middle of the best part of barcelona - easy access to everything at your finger tips.
the only problem I had was the bed which I sadly am still having back pain from due to one bed being higher in height then the other which caused extreme discomfort. but as the hotel was fully booked they were not able to switch our room.",4,2015,06,03
11,Great hotel great location,"Loved this hotel, loved the roof top bar and pool and the cocktails and food were amazing! Would defiantly stay here again. Room wasn't very big but was nice and cosy with a great view of the street and a nice bathroom. Staff were excellent and very professional and helpful. I loved the location of the hotel as it was walking distance to the best shops and attractions. The bed was also very comfortable. Would highly recommend this hotel and if you stay here make sure you try the food on the roof top as it was beautiful!! Best view of the city from up there also. They had a Dj by the pool which made it even better.",5,2015,06,02
11,Nice hotel in perfcet location,I stayed here for 5 nights and it was the first visit to Barcelona. I can tell that the hotel is renovated and I really like the hotel and the rooms. I stayed at the Executive room and it was really big comparin to europe hotels' rooms. The concierge was really friendly and helpful he helped me with anything I needed even printing some match tickets. What I liked the most was the location of the hotel it is really really really nice and the one thing I didn't like that they charge you for the Nespresso capsules.,4,2015,06,01
11,Beautiful hotel,This was a fabulous hotel within walking distance to fabulous shops. Near to the Las Ramblas. They had a terrific roof top bar and pool for relaxing after a long day of sightseeing. Near plenty of the beautiful sights of Barcelona. The staff was very accommodating and attentive.,5,2015,05,31
11,apartment was first rate,"We were there for 6 nights - 2 parents with 2 teenage children - we managed to get the 2 bedroom suite - this was huge with upgraded furnishings in all rooms - solid oak doors, 3 flat screen tvs, window on Passeig de Gracia that when closed was nearly completely noise canceling, provided american electrical adapters, 2 full baths that included towel warmers and other amenities. Main hotel was about 100 steps across the street. Easy. Breakfast buffet is not included when you stay at the apartment- ok with us - since we are not big breakfast eaters (huge breakfast - usually leads to more calories per day anyway).  Hotel did not offer a lot of options we liked for lunch or dinner but that was ok since there are plenty on the street including steps from the apt entrance.",5,2015,05,31
11,Great location!,"Stayed here for a week.  Fabulous location with an amazing roof-top lounge.  Can see Sagrada Familia and Casa Batllo from here!  However prices reflect the view.  For coctails we paid 17 Euro for each drink!  The rooms are small but comfortable.  Bathrooms on the other hand are large with the toilet in a separate space- excellent feature. The elevators are extremely small, only fit about six people, and that's a squeeze.  Sometimes had to wait a considerable time for one to arrive.  The staff is very attentive, friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay here again.",4,2015,05,31
11,Fantastic location and breakfast buffet!,"Nice hotel in great location near multiple Gaudi sites and great shopping!
Rooms are nice but not huge....hallway noise was an issue at night for me.
Wonderful breakfast buffet and nice bar....near great tapas restaurant (across street up one block.). Metro nearby.",4,2015,05,28
11,Excellent hotel,My husband and I spent 1 night here after a cruise. It was luxurious in every way. We arrived early in the moring and they assigned us a room straight away. The staff could not have been more helpful. The room was functional with a beautiful bathroom. The rooftop terrace is the perfect way to unwind. The location is very central. Most sites are in walking distance and the metro is right outside. My husband and I were on honeymoon and the hotel left a bottle of bubbles and rose petals in our room. Lovely touch. Highly recommend this hotel for a luxury stay.,5,2015,05,28
11,Class and Elegance,"This hotel located in the heart of the city simply oozed with luxury,  class and elegance. I cannot fault this hotel on anything. From their exquisite bar in the sky overlooking the city lines, to their food and their staff focus on quality customer service, it definitely gets my 5 stars. Access to the metro, bus & taxi is on the doorstep and the gateway to the whole vibrant city. Just one comment on the restaurant in the basement, decor was a bit dull but you were compensated with a 20% discount if you dined here and the food was delicious - a recommendation perhaps consider live music during the dinner period. Will definitely be back.",5,2015,05,28
11,Luxurious in Every Way,"We loved this hotel!  Our room was huge, the bathroom very large and well designed with plenty of fluffy towels.  Our bed was very comfortable.  We were welcomed with a bottle of wine, cheese and crackers, compliments of the hotel. Breakfast was wonderful, served in a beautiful Dining Room.   The hotel is located near many high-end designer shops ... a beautiful place for a stroll.  We had  flown in a day before we were to board our cruise ship.  We hated to leave!",5,2015,05,27
11,Best!,"The best hotel in Barcelona, with an amazing view and the perfect location. I would recommend to anyone who wants to stay in Barcelona and looking for a hotel, that offers little bit of everything.  
It has the nice rooms, and an a great lobby with life jazz music.",5,2015,05,27
11,Can't wait to stay here again,"We stayed here for a few nights before embarking on a small ship cruise.  Everything about this hotel is perfect ...... large, comfortable rooms, an A+ staff, incredible breakfast buffet, a perfect, central location and a wonderful, relaxing atmosphere.   This is a fabulous place to stay.",5,2015,05,27
11,Magnific,"Superb hotel and service, this is the traditional luxury style difficult to find nowadays , location is perfect , the food and beverage service is very good , food quality is top notch , if you are looking for luxury this is the perfect hotel.",5,2015,05,27
11,Two-day Pre-Cruise Stay,"Excellent stay.  First, we moved from another Barcelona hotel to the Majestic, two days before our cruise departure.   Due to early check-in, our plan was to request luggage storage.  Upon carefully checking room availability, the front desk representative was able to assign a room, and we were given early check-in.  This is unusual service in Europe.  The location could not be better.  We walked to all desired destinations. The room was beautiful, roomy, and quite exceptional.  Highly recommended.",5,2015,05,27
11,Loved it!,"We had a wonderful stay at the Majestic in every way. Arriving late on Sunday after a terribly long trip without our luggage, the people at the front desk were kind in trying to help, although they told us all the neighboring stores were closed by law! We managed to surprise them by going out and finding one that was open, and they made sure that housekeeping provided the toiletries we were missing. All the service was excellent from the lovely concierges to the waiters in the very handsome bar. And best of all was the turn down service at night and the immaculate linens placed on the floor at the side of the bed. Really first class. This hotel is highly recommendable!",5,2015,05,26
11,Truly Majestic,"We found this hotel to be superb. The rooms were large by European standards. Even the bathroom was big and comfortable. The bed was comfortable, towels were plush, room was very clean. The service was excellent. The breakfast was delicious. The location was perfect. We had a luxurious and enjoyable stay. I would highly recommend this property.",5,2015,05,26
11,Luxury with a view,"My wife and I visited during a business trip.  
Lovely hotel with beautiful public rooms, very attractive bedroom/bath and great service.

Very convenient location to the Ramblas and main shopping areas of Barcelona.  Very easy walking and great ""people watching"" opportunities.

We would go back again.",5,2015,05,26
11,"""SWEET SUITES""","We were there for 3 days,  Before we even landed they helped with a car and what attractions to see and where to eat. They had asked what we liked to drink and had not only it but also a welcome basket waiting for us in the room. It is in the best part of the city. Our balcony view was amazing with all of the top stores(Gucci was two doors down) to shop from and some of the main attractions were walking distance..Simply wonderful.",2,2015,05,26
11,Enjoyable stay with a few concerns,"By and large we had a very enjoyable stay in a junior suite (#821).  Overall, the service was excellent as was the location.  Be aware that rooms on the 8th floor do not have balconies or full-length windows.  The ceilings seemed lower than on other floors.  Our room could have used a fresh coat of paint but was very cozy and the views were incredible.  We would certainly go back.  Concerns? The atmosphere in the breakfast room was too much like what we would expect in a convention hotel, not a 5 star hotel.  Do not miss the view from the outdoor bar on the 10th floor!",4,2015,05,25
11,MAJESTIC is superb!!! Worth staying for a week. Too much helpful and friendly staff...,Superb hotel with friendly staff. David is always smiling and helpful person I have ever seen in hotel industry... Worth staying there. Will visit again soon. Always there to help staff. You feel more secured and safe...,5,2015,05,25
11,Great hotel all round!,"Perfect location in the heart of a shopping belt. In fact, u don't even need to travel far to shop for luxury labels and fashion products. Near to two Gaudi inspired buildings open for visitors as well. Plenty of restaurants and cafes too! Room is fantastic with prompt service. Only (tiny) grievance I have is the slow and squeezy hotel lift which opens both sides and can only accommodate 4 pax with suitcases max each load. Else, 5 stars!",5,2015,05,24
11,Stunning hotel,"We stayed here for 4 nights in a junior suite. Although we would have liked to have been on a higher floor (we were on the first floor near the breakfast area so it was a little noisy at times) we faced out on to the street which was great. The staff were welcoming and helpful. The room was immaculate, large, modern and very luxurious. The bed was amazing and the shower was a highlight. It's a great position - very central and convenient to everything. The bar area on the rooftop was fun with amazing views of Barcelona. We loved everything about this hotel but the best thing was the DJ. He played the coolest tracks. Watched and listened to him for hours and still wanted more. Highly recommended.",5,2015,05,23
11,Perfection!,"We recently went on a trip to Barcelona with my husband and a couple of friends, I just want to say, this hotel was everything that we expected and more!.
The staff, incredible friendly, The breakfast, very, very good! Location, I can tell you enough, you are on Passeig de Gracia!!! The bar at the terrace, simply spectacular!!!! the service and the view, is just amazing. Last year we travel to Barcelona and could not find a reservation at this hotel this year we did booked earlier, so I highly suggested..This is our new fav hotel in Barcelona!",5,2015,05,22
11,Sophisticated yet welcoming property!,"As a guest your are welcomed at the front door with a smile from men in lovely suits. Bringing your bags to the front desk for check in. We booked through American Express and received several upgrades. Spa credit and room upgrade which was available so we had an awesome corner view of the city and its bustling people. The location is perfect! You can walk to shops, local restaurants and the many sites to see in Barcelona. The rooms were well equipped and beds were divine! Greatly needed after a long day of traveling.",5,2015,05,22
11,"Excellent hotel in the best section of Barcelona; a cordial, helpful staff.","This luxury hotel lives up to its billing.  Shop the finest stores, hop on the tourist bus and see Barcelona, drink and eat tapas in nearby cafes, see two of the Gaudi houses only a block away, or walk down Las Ramblas to the Gothic Quarter.  We can't imagine a better location.  Our junior suite faced busy Passeig de Gracia, yet was completely quiet at night with the windows closed. The English-speaking staff could not have been more helpful.  The décor of the sitting room in the suite was a little less than we expected, but the manager explained that this was in the process of being rectified and sent us some very nice wine, candy and fruit as an apology.  Definitely select the room with breakfast; We have never had a better hotel breakfast, both buffet and prepared dishes.  We will definitely return here when we go back to Barcelona.",5,2015,05,21
11,Fun,Enjoyed a three night trip to Barcelona and this hotel. Service was excellent and our junior suite was very comfortable. Hope to visit again. As always Las Rambla was very entertaining. As weather was hot got to enjoy the beach this time as have done sight seeing previously,3,2015,05,21
11,Well located grande dame,"The room was on the small side, with an odd physical configuration, but well appointed with every item needed.  We had little contact with the staff, but anyone we passed in the halls or lobby was very pleasant.  The location was superb, especially for walking Las Ramblas and access to the upscale shopping area of the city.",5,2015,05,21
11,"Great hotel, great staff, great location","The only problem with this hotel for my wife and I was there was simply not very much closet space for the type of room we were in, a Junior Suite. Top notch quality and wonderful, helpful staff plus great food. The roof top bar, restaurant has a great view, too.",5,2015,05,21
11,A hotel that doesn't disappoint,Have just returned from the Majestic after a. 4 night stay in a junior suite.Why should you stay in this 5 star hotel  above  another? The staff in this hotel cannot do enough to make your stay comfortable including printing tickets off from sagrada familia and parc guell that I sent to them by email at their suggestion.  Also they booked tourist hop on and off bus which goes from a stop just 5 mins from the hotel.The roof top terrace with plunge pool is also a plus with beautiful views and an ideal place for a rest after site seeing. Location is fantastic  being near the metro and only a couple of stops to most places.Room tip - go high. We were on 7th floor and didnt hear a thing.Trip tip make sure you. Book tickets in advance for all trips. Barcelona is very busy and when we went to par  guell the earliest admission was at 6.15pm . Fortunately someone had also advised us to book. In advance . Travel bar free walking tour of old town also good.,5,2015,05,21
11,Roof top bar and pool are great,"Comfortable, well appointed room with great bathroom and amazing shower. The rooftop bar and pool are a nice touch. The bar downstairs is a bit too corporate hotel for me but breakfast was very good in the restaurant",4,2015,05,19
11,Snobby staff,"Booked a junior suite and the room was pleasant. The aesthetics are very nice with the only compliant being a nearly unusable closest tucked next to the bed as well as two beds tucked together pretending to be a king. 

The staff needs a complete makeover except for housekeeping which were very attentive. The front desk didn't acknowledge our presence several times coming into the hotel which was a little odd given that we were the only ones in the lobby. Too busy texting and basically had to beg for service. The concierge was also unhelpful. When we asked for a restaurant that they didn't suggest we were told that it had a Michelin star and were we sure if that's what we wanted. What a pretentious bunch of jerks like we didn't know what a Michelin star meant. If the the Madarin Oriental wasn't booked full I would have left then. The manager needs to make some serious changes if we were ever to stay here again. Complete disappointment because of the poor staff. ",2,2015,05,18
11,5 star hotel and a service level with 6 stars!,"We stayed here one weekend and really enjoyed staying here. We could highly recommend this hotel. Its everything you expect from a five star hotel but the hospitality level is over six stars. Very kind friendly and polite staff, more than willing to do the extra step for their visitors. Special compliments for the houskeeping staff, you made our stay perfect!  The hotel is very central, you can do everything within a few minutes, sight seeing, shopping and go for a drink or have dinner. The rooftopbar and spa can we also recommend. The rooftopbar gives you an amazing view of the city. We really enjoyed our stay and would definitly visit the Majestic again!",5,2015,05,18
11,Five star hotel in a five star location,"The hotel is perfectly situated in the heart of Barcelona on the Passeig de Gràcia. We arrived early and were delighted with an early check in. The room was decorated in good taste and in perfect cosmetic condition, fully functioning, with silent air conditioning and a fine large bathroom. Service was splendid as expected in a five star property. The breakfast was superb.  This was truly a five star experience.",5,2015,05,17
11,Fantastic Location,"This hotel is within walking distance to nearly everything you'd want to do in Barcelona.  the hotel itself is clean and well taken care of.  The staff was very kind and helpful, especially the doormen.  

The daily breakfast is great.  It offers everything you could want.  The Sunday brunch was even better!

The one thing that turned me off was the excessive use of scents throughout.  If you are sensitive to scents in anyway, do not stay at this hotel.",4,2015,05,17
11,Great location with excellent service,"I stayed 3 nites here for a conf. The rooms are decent size, 159sq ft approx, not very big for this price. The staff is very helpful. The breakfast buffet is awesome. Next to everything and the Metro is right outside the hotel. The roof top restaurant is very good.",5,2015,05,16
11,2-night business stay with son,"I was in Barcelona for a business trip and booked a 2-night stay with my 14-year-old son. I liked the hotel and the service but more importantly my son loved the hotel and if a teen his age likes a classy place you know that you have a winner. The hotel is perfectly situated right in the heart of the action. If you like to walk, and Barcelona is a wonderful city to walk around, The Majestic is just what the doctor perscribed. The breakfast buffet was outstanding and the staff was very friendly. I would most certainly return to this lovely hotel and don't forget to order your chocolate covered almonds from room service.",5,2015,05,14
11,Excellent experience and service 5*+,"We visited for my wife's 30th and I chose this hotel due to its location on one of the best parts of town surrounded by all the designer stores. We chose the balcony room with a view. We were welcomed at the door taken to private check in at rear, quick check in and Jordi took our bags to the room and showed us all the facilities which was very helpful. The hotel was pristine, not a spot anywhere. Roof top bar was very nice, great snacks and drinks. We used the spa also which was a real treat for a massage. We were sad to go and will absolutely be back again. Good value for money and you get more than you pay for. ",5,2015,05,14
11,High class level in the centre of Barcelona,"I spent  5 nights with my 2 sons in this fabulous hotel during our stay in Barcelona for the
Formula 1 Grand Prix . Accommodation as well the whole staff matched our expectations.
Everything was perfect .The best hotel I stayed at in Barcelona so far .",5,2015,05,14
11,"Great location, nice people, beautiful breakfasts","I had two nights in Barcelona before getting on a small boat to cruise around Iberia.  Was traveling on my own and had never been to Spain.  I got smart and made a reservation from home at the small but extremely nice Spa for hydrotherapy and post-travel massage.  That was a wonderful beginning - and then the bed/mattress/pillow were even more comfortable than mine in NJ; the spa people were helpful and nice and very good; and I walked out of the hotel onto not only a nice shopping street (fairly fancy) but only had to turn to the left to see one of Gaudi's fabulous houses.  I had lunch at the Torres restaurant on the sidewalk, and dinner inside the restaurant itself (I really liked the Torres wines - and their food was excellent).  I felt safe the whole time, and enjoyed being there on St. George's day (a hidden extra) with roses and books being sold everywhere - even roses from the hotel.  There is also a very nice restaurant in the lobby for a relaxed dinner when you don't feel like staying up until 9:00! I would go back there in a shot -",5,2015,05,11
11,Wonderful!,"We stayed here two nights as part of a tour group. The selection proved to be beyond our expectations. From initial check-in to check-out, a very nice experience. Our room was on the tenth floor and did not have what I would call a scenic view, but was otherwise more than suitable. The room was well-lit. The bathroom was clean and spacious. The bed comfortable -- no problem sleeping. Most impressive was the attention, helpfulness and friendliness of the staff, from the desk staff to the porters to the dining room staff. Breakfast (supplied with our reservation) was an absolute delight. More choices than one can imagine, with pastries, cheeses, meats, eggs, made-to-order omelettes, juices, and more - an amazing variety. Service at breakfast was superior as well. The rooftop bar was a great place for a panoramic view of the city, but do be aware of the hours it is open. We were minutes after closing and denied a nighttime city view. Overall, a ""majestic"" property, and an experience to be savored.",5,2015,05,09
11,Nice,"We stayed at the hotel over the bank holiday. We really liked the accomodation and staff were helpful etc. did not eat in because we wanted to experience the city (and also food on offer for veggi people is not worth it due to cost). The ""pool"" is a rooftop ""dipping"" pool. Whilst the rooftop has lovely views, it's overcrowded with locals (non hotel stayers) using it as their place to meet up. It was full of people looking v smart. The gym we were not able to locate. Wifi was good and every thing v clean. 
The place is v central and a direct line from airport. Lots of local resturants and great coffee shop. Would stay there again.",4,2015,05,08
11,Fantastic! 5 Star all the way!Majestic in name and nature!,"The Majestic is a very beautiful, centrally located Hotel for sightseeing. Catching the tour buses can be done almost opposite the hotel. There is a huge choice of cafes, bars, restaurants and designer shops all within easy walking distance. Above all the Majestic offers REAL 5 star quality service - All the staff are very polite and helpful. Our room was immaculate, with a very spacious bathroom. Roof top bar had excellent views, a small pool, fabulous food, great wine list and very comfortable lounging seats! This one's on our list to revisit *****",5,2015,05,08
11,"Beautiful hotel, but...","Could not get into the room until after 2 PM,   Delux room on the 1st floor facing an alley, no street noise but lots of hotel noise from below.  Noise continued intermittently throughout the night for the entire 3 nights we were there. Room itself was lovely, nice big bathroom, separate toilet, Bulgari, shower and tub.  Helpful friendly staff.  My complaints were duly noted and I am told they will be addressed.  This is a room that should never be given to a paying guest.",4,2015,05,06
11,Perfect stay,"Comfortable hotel, very good location and amazing rooftop bar.
I chose double room, but beds were 2 separate bedsm which were put together. That wasn't too comfortable, but ok.
Breakfast was very delightful and with many food choices.
I would recommend this place for couples and business trips.

11,Perfect Hotel for Barcelona Weekend!,"Just returned from a weekend break to Barcelona with a girlfriend and we couldn't have picked a better hotel! A beautiful, safe city and this hotel is in a perfect location near luxury shops and Guadi buildings and sights and a short walk away from the busy Las Ramblas. We stayed in a deluxe city view room which had the most comfortable beds ever and loved the bar for a relaxing drink or two after a busy day. Must mention the wonderful staff, without exception they were all outstanding - friendly and helpful. Use them to prebook fast track tickets to the main sights (a must as they are all so busy), arrange taxis and recommend restaurants. And many thanks for our meal at Petit Comite restaurant - delicious! And do try Tapas 24 - just a short walk from the hotel.
You will not be disappointed with this hotel - hopefully will return with my husband one day!",5,2015,05,05
11,BEAUTIFUL HOTEL,"Very elegant hotel. The service was superb, as well as the hotel and location. 5 minutes from a metro. The room was large and the bathroom was beautiful.  We had breakfast at the hotel which was lovely. Not a cheap hotel but worth the splurge",5,2015,05,02
11,The worst view in delux room.," I arrived at Barcelona today with my wife for 20 hours flight time. This is Spain the first travel site. I did many expectancies and investigated the hotels.
 
 But I'm very very disappointed at the moment when coming to this hotel. The employees were not kind, and to check in at 5 o'clock p.m., they just say to wait indefinitely because of system problem. 

 And I saw the worst view when coming in the room. Facing the opposite room window!!! And, price is so expensive compared to the room condition.

  I could not watch this photo and reviews in Tripadvisor. I'm not going to absolutely recommend this hotel to my samsung co-worker or the friends.

 Only a location is good. I have to stay 4 days more but it doesn't come up the idea which would like to take a rest on this hotel...",2,2015,04,30
11,Luxurious and Excellence!,"This hotel is luxurious with every amenity available.  Concierge is outstanding as is the staff.  My every need was met immediately with friendliness, competence and excellence.  Location is outstanding and within block of both Casa Batllo and Casa Mila known as La Pedrera.  I could easily walk to Sagrada Familia or taxi to other historical sites inexpensively.  Many lovely restaurants nearby for coffee or dining al fresco, although, hotel restaurants are excellent and the rooftop pool and views are magical.  Just a wonderful hotel and experience from the moment I arrived until I departed.",5,2015,04,28
11,A perfect hotel in Barcelona,"For a weekend trip to Barcelona you want some luxury, a nice breakfast, good service and you want to be close to the main shops and sights. The Majestic Hotel & Spa delivers in all aspects. I travelled with my 10-year old son and I would recommend this hotel to anyone!",5,2015,04,28
11,Unforgettable Stay,I stayed in this his hotel for several nights for businus talks. It was a wonderfull experience and I will never forget the joy I felt to stay in one the great Suites. I certainly recommend this hotel to all people that want a fantastic hotel at a good location in Barcelona.,5,2015,04,28
11,Easy for English speaking guests,"Almost everyone at this hotel speaks very good English which was helpful as my husband & I speak no Spanish, the concierge was most helpful in booking restaurant reservations and tickets for park Guell, the music centre and Picasso Museum.

The lobby bar is very nice.  We stayed in a standard room. It was nice , but not memorable.",4,2015,04,27
11,Beautiful in a perfect location,"Very good service, impeccable rooms and a roof top terrace with a view to die for. This hotel is set i a perfect location with walking distance to great restaurants, shopping and nightlife. 
Great value for money and top notch service.",5,2015,04,27
11,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Location","This is a wonderfully refurbished 100 year old hotel in the perfect location in Barcelona.  Located in the middle of the city's high end shopping district and easy walking distance to lot of sidewalk cafes and Gaudi buildings.  There are two sections to the hotel, one that is the old hotel and the other which is a relatively new addition.  We stayed in the old section with a huge room and wonderful balcony.  I don't know why, but my wife and I decided that the room had the most comfortable bed we had ever slept in.  Wifi was free and very fast.  The front desk staff is wonderful.  Throughout of four night stay they remembered our name -- even some staff who were not involved in our check in.  At the top of the hotel is a roof top bar that has among the best views in Barcelona.  I also recommend the lobby bar for light dining.  They have lots of unique spanish tapas choices and will pretty well make anything you want.  Also, down the street, a half block from the hotel is a wonderful cafe with great Catalonian food.  All in--a great hotel.",5,2015,04,26
11,Majestic Nights,"It's was a great pleasure staying in the hotel Majestic and spa,
Everything there is perfect, from the special suite, delicious breakfast, 
Everything is personalized and the hotel support really well his name Majestic.
Next vacation in Barcelone will be there for sure!",4,2015,04,25
11,Very nice hotel in great location,"I stayed with my husband in a jr suite while he was on business.  The location was great. Within 2 mile radius is everything you need for a great Barcelona visit.

The suite was not huge but adequate.  My husband hosted meetings daily in the living area.  It was fine but not really seperate from the bedroom and guests had to walk through bedroom to use the bathroom.

The bed was extremely comfortable and bathroom well trimmed.  Very quiet as well.

Service was top notch.  The room was quickly cleared once meetings were over and nicely stocked before morning meetings.  

As a tourist, i was able to walk to everything and booked private tours to many locations.  Great restaurants nearby. 

The breakfast buffet was very nice but nothing special.  I think some additional healthy choices would be welcome.  I was happy to see soy milk available as was plain nice yogurt.

My husband had 2 receptions in the hotel and he said service drinks and food was great.

I highly reccommend for business",4,2015,04,24
11,A very pleasant stay,"A fine 5 stars hotel, beautifully decorated, especially the rooms, with a splendid bar, a  friendly and helpful staff and the perfect location. Unfortunately the dinner we had at the bar was quite disappointing.
A significant plus is the terrace on the 10th floor, there the view on the city is exceptional!",4,2015,04,23
11,as good a 5 star hotel you will stay in! beautiful hotel!,"4 fantastic days with the family!
having stayed in the majestic's sister hotel the murmuri for our previous 3 visits to barca we fancied a change.not that that the murmuri had ever let us down as it is a fantastic place to stay on rambla de catalunya.
we had a lovely executive room which the hotel kindly placed a double sofa bed in for our 5 and 2 year old free of charge, its a shame other hotels are not as helpful but the spanish are family orientated !
the hotel is spotless with a constant luxurious jo malone smell wafting around every corridor.
the rooms are very spacious, compared with rooms in london/paris or new york and have every whim catered for. the roof top pool bar is as good as it gets, sunday afternoon sun shining, dj on the decks, glass of albarino in hand no better place to be!
we will return first class five star! 
p.s. the staff are the best we have ever encountered they need to pass there training manual on to the stuffy 5 star venues!",5,2015,04,21
11,Great location,"Stayed here for 2 nights on business. The hotel location was great and the rooftop bar was one of the highlights. Didn't see anyone in the pool whilst I was there and was very small, it seemed more of a tick box exercise. However the views and atmosphere in the evening was perfect. 

Bed was comfy and no complaints from the bathroom. 

The view from my room was a fire escape so not the best.

Good location to explore on foot, sadly I didn't get to see very much as was in conferences for most of it. 

Not sure if I would stay here again as I didn't feel there was anything amazing to justify the rare card.",3,2015,04,19
11,Very courteous & helpful staff but facilties not on par with 5 star standard.,"1) Room had carpet stains & bathroom did not smell clean & fresh upon check-in.
2) Gym facilities are cramped with more than two people. Gym instructor occupied most of the space for some time.
3) The sauna is being advertised as a facility but use requires appointment and payment. This must NOT be advertised as part of the amenities, rather as part of SPA treatment.
4) Main elevator to the roof deck and guest rooms tiny, delayed, and used as service.
5) Appreciate the gesture to rectify tardy and incorrect package delivery.
6) Roof deck was a among one of the considerations for our stay, but closed at 8pm.
7) All the folks in the door were extremely courteous & helpful (Roberto, Aaron, Carlos, & Andrei). Thank you guys!",3,2015,04,17
11,"Moldy suite, this hotel's overrated","I'm an experienced luxury traveler and wanted the best for my mate for his first time in Barcelona. I had stayed before at more modest digs in the Gothic quarter, but chose the Majestic based on its five-star status and good reviews. Was disappointed to find it is on the Champs Élysées of Barcelona (meaning noise, trendy shops, a kind of sterility), but I know some people like that. After a pre-trip questionnaire about room preference and welcome amenities and a pleasant check-in where we were told we were upgraded to a full suite on a floor you can access only by room card, we were excited. But suite 907 (not a full suite, though it has a terrace by the air conditioning units) exuded a moldy smell when we entered. We tried to ignore the odor because the suite was lovely,were given a scent-diffusing machine, but still wound up with eyes tearing and noses congested. Ended up in a jr suite by an elevator with a woman sitting on a hall bench talking loudly on a cell phone, overlooking the noisy street. So while the staff was very nice and accommodating throughout, I can't give this hotel top marks. If you want grandeur in a historic building with renovated rooms and marble baths, this could be for you. but that something special (think Hotel Bel-Air or Stafford in London) is missing.",3,2015,04,15
11,Excellent location and Convenient access to the center of the town.,"The majestic hotel locates in front of the Passeig de Gràcia，main street in Barcelona, and within 10 minutes walk to the center of Barcelona, Plaça de Catalunya. 
Hotel staffs are very friendly.
As I stayed at lowest price room, it was regrettable there was no bathtub in the room.",5,2015,04,14
11,Great hotel and location!,"We stayed at the Majestic for 8 nights in a Junior Suite. Ingrid, in Guest Relations, greeted us and helped us get oriented with the hotel and area. We found  her to be most professional and helpful during our stay! 
 The room was lovely and spacious. Loved being able to look out onto Passeig de Gracia, although some people might not like this location of the room as it could get a little noisy at times. 
The location of the Majestic is prime! Walking distance to everything...shops, restaturants and most of the places you want to visit! Took a taxi to the beach...a little too far to walk. 
Breakfast was excellent. We enjoyed being greeted each morning by Martina and her beautiful smile!  Some mornings were a bit crowded and it took almost 10-15 minutes before a waiter would even acknowledge you and ask if you wanted coffee. Other than the wait, the breakfast was a wonderful start to the day.  
We did attend the Easter Brunch. That was probably the most disappointing part of the whole trip. I did not feel that it was worth the money. It was basically the same set up as breakfast with some seafood items and a few hot items added. The website makes the Brunch seems much elaborate than what it was. I would not spend the money on the brunch if you are there on a Sunday... just have the regular breakfast! 
The roof top bar is wonderful! Luckily the weather was perfect and we were able to enjoy spending time up there on a few different days. The views are spectaular! 
I would highly recommend the Majestic to anyone who is looking for a 5 star hotel in a perfect location that offers high quality service!",5,2015,04,14
11,The best in Barcelona!,"We spent five days in this hotel. It was wonderful! The hotel is in a central location, close to beautiful sites such as Gaudi - Casa Battlo and Casa Mila (la Fedrera). Nearby convenient transportation, both bus and subway or underground trains out to various areas in Catalonia. Breakfast is amazing. Huge selection of cheeses, delicious, meats, breads, cakes, fruits and more.  The staff is great. They help with pleasure and professionalism. The room that we have in cooperation with American Express has been upgraded. Junior Suite, large, comfortable. Great bed! I slept like a baby! The room has a Nespresso coffee machine and ""a good night service"". It was the third time in Barcelona first time in this hotel, but for sure, the next time will be in this hotel! Cannot wait!!",5,2015,04,13
11,Yes It's That Good!,Ok this hotel is so centrally located and in the middle of town where all the action is. The hotel has a great history but the interior is totally updated. When you book spend the extra money for the city view. Food is great and the service outstanding. Stayed here 2 days prior to a cruise. ,5,2015,04,12
11,Cool Roof Terrace ,"Probably the coolest most relaxing part of our trip was the visit to the Roof Terrace bar for cocktails and the view, easy recommend 

We had Aperols, G&Ts and were not disappointed. 

The views are terrific, being of the mid city to the mountains ",5,2015,04,12
11,Perfection,"We're 2 nights in to a 4 night stay and so far this hotel has made our Barcelona experience perfect. As a bit of a hotel snob I always expect to be disappointed, but the Majestic has exceeded expectations on every level. Every single member of staff from lobby to bar to restaurant and housekeeping have gone above and beyond to make our stay special. Fabulous comfortable rooms with every detail seen to. I can't recommend enough. The concierges have been fantastic recommending the fabulous 2254 restaurant just a few minutes walk away. Spectacular tapas and friendly staff speaking every language to help with menu choices. The rooftop terrace at the hotel is a must. Easy walking to all the Barcelona highlights. Use the concierge to book advance tickets to the main attractions or risk a long 2hr wait to get in. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Barcelona after this visit.",5,2015,04,11
11,Wow location,"I spent 5 days at the majestic while touring Barcelona.  The location is unbeatable,  the breakfast buffet fresh, diverse, and generally delicious. The service is what you would expect from a five star hotel. My only disappointment was the room. Upon arrival I found the room small, noisey. We were on the first floor. There were a few broken items in the bathroom. To be fair I did not say anything because I was too tired to move to a new room. I feel that in a five star I should not have to say anything because there should not be any issues.  However overall a good experience.  I give them a 4 and a half. ",4,2015,04,11
11,"Fabulous location, service, amenities & outstanding service.",The hotel made me feel at home the moment I crossed its threshold. The room was lovely and the staff outstanding.  Although traveling solo I felt at home immediately. The morning breakfast feast was outstanding.,5,2015,04,10
11,Old World Elegance,"Beautiful hotel in an amazing location close to many museums, shops, and restaurants.  The breakfast was amazing and one of the best I've ever had.  The bed was  comfortable and the bathrooms were nice.  It's a great 5 star hotel.  I would absolutely go back again.",5,2015,04,08
11,"Excellent Staff, Location, Apartment","Myself and two adult daughters stayed 9 nights with the Majestic Hotel & Spa Barcelona.  We opted for an apartment and were completely thrilled.  The location of the hotel is perfect; just outside of the heavily populated and loud tourist area and in a very nice section of Barcelona, yet still walkable to most areas within Barcelona.  The staff is very helpful, extremely pleasant and professional.  You really couldn't ask for more of them. The location can't be beat; walkable to many nice restaurants, shopping (designer on the main road and one street off regular shops- also go north a few blocks and you'll find the area locals hang out in).  A lovely, lovely place.  I can't speak to the hotel rooms, but if you desire a bit more room the apartments cannot be beat!",5,2015,04,07
11,""" Great Location """,Good Hotel with excellent location. Hotel is close to La Ramblas and also many other restaurants and shops. The hotel has a great view of Barcelona from the roof top. They also have a pool and you can go there at night and listen to music and have drinks.,4,2015,04,07
11,The Best.....,"The Best....

Conclusion EXCELLENT!!!!!

11,Just perfect,"I only stayed for one night. Service was good, friendly and helpful, from getting out of the cab till showing the room. My room was a bit small but had everything what is expected at a five star Hotel. Room service with the club-sandwich was delicious. Will come back next time...",5,2015,04,04
11,Luxury Hotel in Bacelona,"The Majestic is a luxury hotel that is well located in Barcelona with convenient access to restaurants, sites, transportation, and shopping.  The service is first rate and the rooms are very comfortable.  Don't miss the rooftop bar and pool.  Also, take advantage of the best concierge service in Barcelona.  Need a restaurant recommendation or reservation?  they will help and provide excellent advice.  

I love this hotel and look forward to returning there.",5,2015,04,01
11,Excellent stay - twice - at the Majestic!,"We've stayed at the Majestic twice, most recently amid the inconvenience of 'street repairs' out front ... the staff was uniformly helpful, friendly, and accommodating, notably in dealing with our rental car ... and the recent renovations were very much appreciated: quiet nights' sleep were enjoyed ... great location, excellent accommodations, great staff ... amid all the wonderful choices in Barcelona, this is our go-to location!",5,2015,03,29
11,Fabulous stay in Barcelona,"I can't recommend this hotel enough. The hotel is amazing, so comfortable, fabulous location and staff that bend over backwards to make you stay as perfect as possible. I actually cant fault the hotel from the minute we arrived to the minute we left, I only wish our stay was longer
I cant wait to return to Barcelona and the majestic hotel",5,2015,03,29
11,Amazing Barcelona ,Wonderful hotel with nice location _Courteous  and very well mannered staff at reception _ and door _ very helpful_ would suggest you choose a room in the old wing which is the main part _ it has all the famous brand shops  attached to the hotel_ would 100% recommend this hotel. _ The staff ; ambience and location are.all the plus points - congrats to the GM _ ,5,2015,03,28
11,The staff is amazing!,"Although we didn't stay here, the staff helped us find the correct location of our hotel, having received the incorrect one from our travel agent. They provided a map and explicit directions. We will stay there next time!",5,2015,03,27
11,AMAZING!!!,"I thought our previous hotel was nice until we checked into this place. We rented a two bedroom apartment in the residence portion of hotel. It was VERY spacious and clean. The location? AMAZING!!! Located right between two homes designed by Gaudi and along the '5th Avenue of Barcelona'. And walking distance the center of Barcelona, Las Ramblas. I had no idea what kind of accommodations we were going to get but was extremely pleased with the results. The staff was also VERY nice and accommodating to our needs. I would DEFINITELY come back!",5,2015,03,27
11,A place of balance,"This is absolutely a place:
for location;
for comfort;
for shopping;
for tapas & drinks;
Among all ...
Must try their breakfast, infused with authentic Spanish philosphy ... jambon bruchetta, free flow cava, wine ... what more you can ask for ?",4,2015,03,27
11,Good hotel with great location,"I think this hotel is an institution in Barcelona. The place is very good. Hotel and service is nice (I think it depends on the room, I prefer the old wings). It is a classical Hotel with classical decor. Swimming area upstairs is quite nice.",3,2015,03,24
11,Great hotel perfectly located,"The Majestic is a really nice hotel located on one of Barcelona's nicest streets.

Everything about the hotel is classy and whilst it's not as swanky as the Mandarin or as modern as the Arts or W this is one of my favourite hotels in Barcelona.

The standard tourist sights are a short walk away and a taxi has you ""anywhere"" within 20 mins.

The staff and service are excellent, rooms comfortable (especially the beds).

Top marks.",5,2015,03,23
11,Excellent place to stay in Barcelona!,"Great location, spacious bedroom very quiet and comfortable...
Except tea facilities in the bedroom, there is everything you need to feel like home in this hotel. The staff is very professional and helpful. The Majestic fitness is well equipped, the roof terrace offers a very nice view of the city, and the palace is located in a very good area, close to nice shops, restaurants and the old town centre is very near...
Highly recommend this place, and would love to come back.",5,2015,03,21
11,Great hotel with great location,This was my second time in Barcelona and second time in this hotel having stayed here some 12 years ago. It was as amazing as I remembered it. The staff was very polite and helpful. The location was also perfect not just right in the centre but also very near to casa Batllo and casa Mila. The train station was also just 2 minutes walk away so catching the train from the airport was a great and cheap option. The only couple of things I was not so happy about was the intermittent wifi and the fact that the coffee in the room wasn't complimentary. I would also not recommend paying some 29euro (or even 19euro reduced rate) per person for breakfast. I am sure it's nice but ridiculously overpriced. There are plenty of cafés nearby.,5,2015,03,20
11,Top Hotel Indeed!,"Amazing hotel from top to bottom, not sure where to start with this one. Amazing location right in the heart of the ""new area"" of town. Close to all the fancy shops I can't pronounce and my wife loves! Easy 15 walk to las ramblas, ""old town"", and La Sagrada Familia. The famous Gaudi house La pedrera is down the street. Super safe and comfortably walking home to at night. Hotel is amazing. Large and nice but feels unquie and comfortable. Staff is friendly and very helpful with taxi service, restaurant reservations, and anything else you may want. Large rooms even for my American standards. Very clean and quiet rooms. Great hotel lobby bar. Highly recommend this place and would come back for sure. Definitely well deserving of the five stars awarded to it.",5,2015,03,19
11,"Great location, nice spacious rooms","This hotel is located in the middle of the main shopping district with many great tapas places around. This is our first time in barcelona hence we took the hop-on-hop-off bus which has a stop 3 mins from the hotel. We had a suite, spacious lounge and dining area which is separated from the bedroom. Nice size balcony and excellent view of the city and spain's architectural designs.",4,2015,03,19
11,"Perfect, charming, helpful staff","We stayed for or 2 nights but would have liked more! We had 2 junior suites which were beautifully presented.  Nothing  was too much trouble for any of the staff.  We had  great restaurant recommendations from the concierge, excellent service from Cecilia at breakfast and were well looked after at lunch.  Food was v good.  Really lovely rooftop bar and pool.  We were 3 generations and the hotel catered for all.",5,2015,03,18
11,"Excellent hotel, would stay there every single time!","We visited Barcelona with our two young children, and we stayed in the apartment side of the Majestic Hotel. It was the best of both worlds...all the hotel amenities, and a massive, fully-equipped two bedroom apartment on the main shopping street. It was convenient to everything, and the hotel staff was incredible. We celebrated our daughter's first birthday while there, and the hotel staff went above and beyond to ensure it was the perfect day. Would definitely recommend it to anyone traveling to Barcelona!",5,2015,03,18
11,Hotel Majestic is appropriately named!,"We stayed in the apartment section of the Hotel Majestic. The two bedroom two bath apartment is in an outstanding location on the Paseo de Grazia. It is blocks from both Gaudi homes, Casa Lleo Morera home and the Casa Amatllere. The Sagrada Familia is about 9 blocks away but very manageable. Both of the  Boca Grande and Boca Chica restaurants are also within 2 blocks. The train station for all other areas to visit is again, ... within two blocks! The location is a true winner! The main hotel across the street does an outstanding job of servicing the apartments. It was nice to have the amenities of the hotel along with the privacy of an apartment. La Corte Ingles is about 5 blocks away for groceries and any need you may have and there are many cafes and restaurants in between.  The hotel and apartments are nestled among some of  the best shopping and restaurants in Barcelona. . Will definitely stay there again!",5,2015,03,17
11,"Beautiful hotel, very central, charming staff","We were so excited to grab a very good rate for a 1 night stay at this hotel in the heart of Barcelona, and were worried it would be too good to be true! However, we arrived and goggled at the proximity of the hotel to Chanel, Dior, Prada, etc, and all the authentic little tapas bars a short stroll away. The apartment was roomy and clean, and the staff were gracious, helpful and welcoming, even allowing me to print out a boarding pass I'd forgotten to print beforehand! Thoroughly recommend. Thank you for making our all too short visit to Barcelona such a treat.",5,2015,03,17
11,"Excellent, will stay here again for sure","I stayed for 2 nights and had a great time. Our rooms were very comfortable and the air conditioning was perfect. It gets rather hot in summer.

The roof-top pool and bar area is just sublime. They had live music one night, which was great, but the DJ night was sensational. The view, the music and great booze made it feel a lot like Cafe Del Mar, with the Ibizan Sea views replaced with the sweeping roof tops of Barcelona.

I'm glad we ended up staying a 15 minute walk away from Las Ramblas. It's the kind of place where Stag/Hen party could get in to a lot of trouble, it's fun to visit but I wouldn't stay there. And keep in mind that taxis are dirt cheap. ",5,2015,03,13
11,Majestic Barcelona,We arrived at lunch time and even though check-in wasn't until 3pm they had a room available for us. The room was at the back of the hotel so no view but it meant it was nice and quiet. Staff were extremely helpful throughout our stay. Very convenient for the Camp Nou and all Barcelona's amazing architectural heritage. Many reviews advised bus transport but we walked everywhere and this wasn't a problem at all. Even though it's a 5 star hotel it was comfortable and welcoming for the more casual traveller!! The bed was the most comfortable of any hotel we've stayed in. The only minor criticism was the coffee in the room was counted as part of the mini bar and had to be paid for - never experienced that before :-(,5,2015,03,11
11,don't stay here ...and if you do you will be disappointed,the place is too big. when you walk in you suffocate from the smell of the strong perfumes sprayed.  we paid a lot to stay there 560 Euros per night and when we asked for ice and a couple of coffee pods for the coffee machine they charged us 13 Euros and told us that was not free.  this place NICKLE AND DIME YOU TO DEATH. only good thing was there spa. will never stay there again but will probably book the spa again,2,2015,03,11
11,Stay here - you won't be disappointed.....!!!,"Amazing apartment - stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment which was far bigger than we anticipated. Huge lounge, large kitchen (washer/dryer/dish washer/cooker/fridge/coffee machine/etc), 2 en-suite bathrooms (shower/spa bath), 2 double wardrobes, balcony, electronic safe, all to an extremely high standard.
Great location, approx. 10 minutes walk from the Ramblas, amongst designer shops and lots of restaurants, bars, coffee shops, although extremely peaceful and quiet inside.
We've visited Barcelona on several occasions, staying at various hotels throughout, but will definitely be booking to stay here again on our next visit.
Perfect retreat for either a couple or family - very highly recommended!!",5,2015,03,03
11,"Great hotel - clean, convenient, great staff","My family really enjoyed our long weekend stay at this hotel.  We were in one of the apartments (across the street from the main hotel) which was spacious with two bedrooms, two bathrooms, living room, etc. The hotel was well situated for visiting two Gaudi monuments - a minute or two in either direction - and was in a nice, upscale area. Also easy to walk to the Boqueria, etc.  The hotel lobby was inviting/spacious/clean/well appointed, including a nice bar/lounge for a drink before heading out to dinner. Great views from the roof deck! The staff is fantastic. Loved Alvaro who helped us plan our sightseeing route, got us tickets to a soccer game, and made a good recommendation for tapas and gelato in the Born district where we wanted to go one night.  He was awesome!  Suki, too, was great - she helped us plan our visits to several Gaudi spots and had even worked at Sagrada Familia so she knew good times/places to go, as well as gave us a good restaurant reco. Kids and I also liked the candies in the bowl at the front desk.  While we did take taxis downtown for more restaurants/some vibrant nightlife, it was a great hotel that we would recommend.",5,2015,03,01
11,Beds?,"This is a great looking hotel in a great area and is very tastefully done.  However, the beds (linens etc are super quality) are below standard for a five star gl hotel.  We had a delux double.  THe bed has a double headboard but the beds are two singles (with their own independent bed linens) pushed togeather.  Normally when you find this set up in Europe they have a modification they do to make the two beds appear/function as one, not here.",5,2015,03,01
11,A Majestic stay,"We had the most fantastic stay.   Our daughter can't have gluten and they could not have been more helpful to accommodate and find alternative croissant, bread for her.  The Spa was a huge treat and we all loved being up on the terrace in the winter sun.  Can't wait to come back.",5,2015,02,27
11,A majestic experience!,"We stayed at this hotel in February to celebrate our son's 16th birthday and in general we were not disappointed. We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment that was opposite the main hotel and these were spacious, luxurious and had everything that we needed.  The staff were friendly, professional and helpful and the surroundings were amazing. The bar staff were extremely helpful and we felt that nothing was too much trouble. The bar food we had was delicious. The only downside of our stay was the restaurant where we ate on the last night of our stay. There was only 1 restaurant open (on the basement level) and this appeared to be more of a 'corporate' restaurant where business guests dined. We felt that the lighting was far too bright for evening dining (we dined at 8pm) and that the service was not up to the high standard of the rest of the hotel. We were not offered drinks first which we thought was unusual and our youngest's son's order of a pizza was missed. When it did arrive after asking the waiter it had far too much cheese on it and as a result he only ate one slice. The cheese oozed from it and was very stringy and congealed. Also it was not a child size pizza and was far too big for a child of 9 years old. The children's menu was very limited (3 items) and we would not dine here again. We did not feel that the staff in the restaurant were very attentive. This is a shame as the restaurant let the hotel down and we would have given 5 stars if the service and ambience had matched the rest of the hotel. However we would definitely return to the hotel as all other aspects were excellent.",4,2015,02,21
11,Great location very convenient 5 stars,"The location is very convenient, in the middle of everything. The room is very well decorated, nice breakfast, good service. The business center is convenient. 

You can walk around 20 mins to rambla and many other popular places",5,2015,02,21
11,Not bad at all ....,"We booked threw Internet directly at their website the majestic residence two bed apartment which is across the street from hotel's main building,by arrival late afternoon,we were welcomed at the front desk and we were offered to take two connected  rooms in the hotel itself instead of the apartment without any extra payment (as it is low season and , I guess, there was a lot of empty rooms..)but it was nice offer especially when they informed us that they had included the breakfast.we excepted with pleasure.
The rooms where nice but noisy ,facing the street with heavy traffic even during the night,but as we are living in a city,for us it was not a big deal.
The other minus in the rooms , beds..yes they're comfortable  , but they move by themselves wile you're sleeping....yes,lightweight and  on wheels ..
Breakfast: I had divided it into two parts:
1-sweets and pastry .
2-non sweets and pastry.
The first part is like homemade of a very good quality and great taste.
The second part (excluding fried eggs and few other items) is a disaster..
But at the end in general if you ask me do I recommend this hotel?definitely yes,at least for the fantastic friendly service,helpful concierge service and great location .      
 ",4,2015,02,20
11,Best Hotel Ever,"We chose to celebrate 3 important events in Barcelona :
Valentine's Day
My husband's new patents
our first wedding anniversary.
Before arriving in Barcelona I planned 3 surprises for my husband, one for each occasion and I contacted Mr Francisco who was extremely helpful and wonderful.
All of the 3 surprises were delivered on time, just the way I planned them .
The hotel is located in the best area in Barcelona , close to Gaudi's last Pedrera and Casa Batillo. 
The rooms are spacious and get cleaned twice a day.
The hotel staff are so helpful and accommodating .
If you are ever in Barcelona  don't look any further .This is by far the best hotel ever !",5,2015,02,20
11,Fantastic place - best breakfast ever!,"We spent 3 days at the Majestic Hotel in Barcelona. It is very well located in the city, close enough to all the major sights to be walkable but far enough out from Las Ramblas to be a bit quieter at night. The staff are fantastic and the service incredibly good without being intrusive. The breakfast display is a sight to be seen on its own, I've stayed in a number of very high class hotels, but this is the best breakfast spread I have ever seen.

The room was quiet and comfortable and I used the spa as well, which was excellent. Great service and fantastic quality for everything about the hotel.",5,2015,02,16
11,Elegant Luxury - I'd go back in a heartbeat...,"Barcelona in February firstly is a fantastic time to go , perfect sight seeing temperatures , blue skies and a City that is pleased to see you ! It was about 14 degrees on average every day - 
better than 7 degrees back in the UK !
So to the Hotel. The Majestic Barcelona is the best choice of Hotel if you like a Hotel that is elegant , sophisticated without being stuffy.
The strengths of this hotel are , its location , its refined beauty , its staff and service , not forgetting the awesome breakfast.
We had booked 2 deluxe rooms interconnecting and were upgraded to a Junior suite with an interconnecting twin bedded room for my 2 children aged 15 and 10. We were delighted, especially as the rooms had a Passeig de Gracia view which is breath taking especially on a crisp bright sunny day without a cloud in the sky ! Happy so far.
It is clear to all that this Hotel has also had a very recent refurb so everything was spotless and new.
The check in staff were so helpful and caring , as were the doormen and the concierge - so , a huge thank you to all the staff who were there for us.
We only took breakfast in the Hotel which as you can imagine was magnificent. A 5 star breakfast if I ever saw one . My daughter almost wept when she saw that they had a cookie pizza as a breakfast option, if you have never made one , then you should.
The Hotel had a small but very intimate spa , I popped in for a chat and you see that the staff were exceptionally well versed in making you relaxed the moment you enter , maybe that it is because it is placed next to the champagne bar - sadly we had no time for this luxury !
There is a pool which is roof top but it is too cold for this time of year but you still have to visit as it has a lovely bar and seating area that you can grab a quick beer and take in the views , plus it is a winter sun trap !

I love this Hotel , it is a perfect example of a 5 star Hotel that does its upmost to make you feel at home .My children were so sad to leave , thank you to all the staff for making it a very special weekend.

Oh - I love Barcelona too ! Almost thought of relocating .",5,2015,02,15
11,Traveling to barcelona from Singapore for the first time,"We stayed for 4 nights in December,coming from Singapore for the first time,we were really surprised with the excellent and friendly staff at the hotel. They were ever ready to help.Also the location was excellent for food,shopping,metro and tour sight seeing busses. Thank you to the Excellent and friendly staff-Mr Singh",5,2015,02,10
11,Best Concierge Ever - Thank you Mario,"When you stay at a nice hotel, it always makes it better when you rely on the concierge for information and they do a brilliant job! Thanks to Mario, restaurant reservations and local information and recommendations made the trip all the better. Being in the industry, it is great to watch an individual that takes that much pride in the job helping their customers feel right! 

Thank you Mario",4,2015,02,10
11,Great option on Passeig de Gracia,"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights in early February.  We loved this hotel and thought it was a good value for what we paid (just over EUR per night).  

The front desk staff is friendly and english speaking.  The room was ready when we checked in and was spacious and well-appointed.  The rooftop bar is probably great in warmer months, but the lobby bar is also excellent for hanging out before dinner.  Super friendly staff throughout.  

The only minor negative is that our single bed was really two twins pushed together.  Annoying as I kept falling into the crevice.  

The breakfast buffet is very good, but slightly pricey at 29 eur per person (this applies more when you want something small)",4,2015,02,09
11,Apartments are perfect,"The Majestic has fabulous, high ceilinged, modern apartments right opposite for longer term guests.
We stayed here before Christmas for six days and enjoyed every moment. The Concierge at the hotel across the road was as far away as the phone and always brilliantly helpful -arranging anything from three fabulous seats at a Barcelona game to a birthday dinner -wonderful hotel on one of the world's most beautiful boulevards. Can't imagine anyone being disappointed here.",5,2015,02,01
11,"My favourite hotel in Barcelona, great location, comfy rooms, great breakfast","I simply love this hotel. Every time I come to Barcelona I stay here with a few exceptions.
Location is fantastic, staff superb, mainly older men working in reception with lots of experience and amazing customer service.
Comfortable and well equipped rooms, great housekeepibg with nightservice included. Beautiful uniforms of them.
Good cosmetics in bathroom, Bvlgari.
Tasty and of big choice breakfast.",5,2015,02,01
11,Fabulous hotel in Barcelona!,"I loved everything about this hotel! Every employee I came into contact with was friendly, helpful and professional and my husband and I were treated with great kindness and respect. We received excellent recommendations for restaurants, sights to see, as well as train schedules.
The hotel is in a wonderful location and walking distance to most of Barcelona's fascinating sights. The rooms are spacious and extremely comfortable. I highly recommend Majestic Hotel & Spa!",5,2015,01,31
11,Wonderful trip to Barcelona,"We found the hotel perfect, well located, beautiful. the room was quiet and comfortable and I appreciated the Nespresso machine. We avoided the pricey restaurant for breakfast and instead grabbed a more authentic snack on our way out to see the city at one of the many cafes nearby. Had great massage, and enjoyed the roof top bar many times during our week long stay.",5,2015,01,31
11,"Beautiful, well located and fantastic service","Initially we booked the Majestic apartment because we need the washing facilities especially after two and half weeks of travel and skiing but we soon regretted once we entered as the floor below us was under extensive renovation, the drilling sound upset us enormously. We moved to the hotel room the next day to the junior suite paying a little bit difference as the manager felt so sorry that we needed to put up the noise. The size of the suite is decent and well decorated, we had a fantastic stay and the staffs are so nice and helpful. The hotel is situated in Paseo de Gracia which is well located for shopping and eating. If we have a chance to return to Barcelona, we will stay in Majestic again. Highly recommend.",5,2015,01,25
11,All you van expect in a 5 stars Hotel!,"Quick check in, elevator a little small and slow: very room with a lovely bathroom, a great massage at the Spa! À little cold this time of the year but the rooftop Bar with the swimming pool is a beauty!! Nice bar, good food. 25mn from the airport and very well located in Barcelona",5,2015,01,24
11,Amazing location and breakfast,"My boyfriend and I were here and we must say it was one of the best breakfast we have every experienced. The service was absolutely wonderful, the food was really good and there was plenty to choose from. Huge Selection. Homemade yogurt that was to die for, cheeses including goat cheese, freshly squeezed strawberry juice, carrot juice, champagne etc.
The only downside was that the breakfast area was being renovated so we sat in a more dull room during breakfast. The rest of the hotel is absolutely beautiful and elegant. The staff is so friendly that you really feel welcome and at home. We love Hotel Majestic and will surely return.",5,2015,01,23
11,Beautiful Majestic,"This hotel is wonderful and I would highly recommend it.  They have a roof with the best view of Barcelona.  So nice to have a glass of wine and relax withe the view and pool! The location is centered around the best restaurants, shopping etc.  Some of Gaudi's designs are within a couple blocks.  The rooms are beautiful. The bed is very comfortable. We had an exquisite view. The bathrooms are equipped with wonderful tub, shower and bidet.  The breakfast is delicious and so many choices on the buffet.   The spa is great and so relaxing. I cannot wait to return.  I love Barcelona and the Majestic Hotel!!",5,2015,01,22
11,Excellent Value,"Very impressed following recent visit to this hotel, the facilities were excellent, bedrooms well appointed, service was great and staff were very helpful.  This was a business meeting and the hotel have wonderful conference facilities.  Overall this offered excellent value.",5,2015,01,22
11,Name says it all,"I thought long and hard before I booked a hotel for a recent stay in Barcelona. I eventually settled on the Majestic Hotel in p. Gracia. The location is excellent - on a beautiful avenue lined with the world's major fashion brand stores and across the road from an outstanding example of Gaudi architecture. The hotel is modern, spotlessly clean and equipped for both business and leisure guests.

The staff are amongst the most professional, knowledgable and obliging I have encountered on my travels over the past 39 years. Its not just their training, or attitude or their personalities, it is the combination of all three that makes for exceptional service. When my wife and I checked in, we were greeted personally by the Guest Relations Duty Manager and the General Manager who welcomed us to his hotel. That doesn't happen too often in my experience.

Our room was a Junior Suite and I can recommend this option. Just the right amount of space and plenty of daylight.

We did not eat in the hotel restaurant, although we did use the ground floor bar/lounge, which is very well appointed. The hotel has a top floor bar/lounge area, next to the swimming pool, with an unmatched view of the city. In Summer it must be the place to be. As it was, we watched the sun setting from there. Magic.

I know this sounds like a punt for the hotel, but it is how we felt at the end of our stay!",5,2015,01,22
11,Very nice hotel,"Great place to stay, good staff and perfect location. Travelled week before Christmas and was wonderful to enjoy the best area in Barcelona and make good shopping. The wi-fi was free but it was very poor!",4,2015,01,19
11,Perfect location for the older set,"During the Christmas holidays, my mom and husband ( both rather north of 80) wanted to visit Barcelona. For those who don't wish to walk too much, this was the perfect location. Taxis galore and inexpensive.. The Majestic was wonderful and the staff was very accommodating.  The two detractions were the prices in the bar and the poor checkout system. The checkout took a long time because they had so many check-ins at the same time and only two on the desk. 
The photographs on the webpage make the rooms look a lot larger. Sheets and bathrooms are superb!",4,2015,01,18
11,Birthday Celebration in great company !,"I spent the weekend of January 10th at the Majestic and I had and incredible time, the service was amazing and very friendly and the room was beautiful ! I am so glad that everything went so smoothly for my birthday celebration weekend ! Thank you so much to the whole team,I will be back soon!",5,2015,01,17
11,A wonderful hotel experience,Last March I was amongst the official Manchester city party which stayed at this hotel prior to our Champions league game against Barcelona. When we were drawn again against Barcelona this year I decided not to travel on the official trip but to go independently. The reason for this was that I wanted to bring my wife so that we could spend a few days exploring Barcelona. So I have booked to stay there again in March this year from the 15th until the 19th.I am sure she will love this fantastic hotel and the trip and share my birthday there on the 17th.This hotel has everything you would want in such a fantastic position in such a beautiful city. I am really looking forward to the trip,5,2015,01,16
11,A Great Experience,"My wife and I flew from New York to Barcelona on our way to boarding the Seabourn Sojourn for an extended cruise.  We asked our agent for a recommendation for an overnight stay before boarding our cruise ship.  Her recommendation turned out great.  As we arrived at the front door of the Majestic Hotel with all of our baggage for an extended cruise (32 days), we were warmly greeted by the staff and taken to reception.  We had asked for an early check-in as we had been on a plane all night from New York and our room was ready for us.  We were in our room and ready for a rest in five minutes.  Just what we were hoping for.  We visited the Majestic's roof top bar for lunch.  What a great view on a clear day.  The Sacred Family (Sagrada Familia) Cathedral can be seen from the roof top bar.   Our service and lunch there was just what we wanted and we were pleased to meet another couple that were also boarding our ship the next day.  The Majestic is located on a grand avenue in Barcelona with many shops and restaurants to explore.  That evening we experienced real tapas for dinner at a local tapas bar within walking distance, two blocks, from the Majestic.  Our room was excellent, comfortable and quiet which is just what we wanted.  Breakfast at the Majestic was also very good with a large selection of goodies and many choices.  Our overall experience was terrific and given the opportunity to return, we will.",5,2015,01,15
11,New years 2015,"We arrived at 10:30 a.m. after a long flight from the states, The front desk was very busy as it was New Years Eve but were able to get us checked into our rooms and settled within 15 minutes. We had a beautiful suite on the 9th floor with a huge terrace and amazing views. Our daughter was upgraded to an executive room which was also quite nice. We had booked the special celebration dinner  that night and it was a very special way to welcome in 2015! The location of this hotel could not be better being close to many high end retailers and tapas bars. The breakfast buffet is spectacular: you have to experience it to believe it! This hotel really shines on their service. We were welcomed with champagne and snacks in our room and returned on my husbands birthday to more champagne and desert! Have no idea how they knew it was his birthday.The tour guide and car and driver that the concierge arranged for us was superlative. I can't understand why this hotel does not have a higher rating on trip advisor.",5,2015,01,15
11,best vacation,"barcelona is a beautiful city! and majestic is a great hotel to stay in when you re there! 
we had the most amazing room that was really HUGE!!! the breakfast was one of the tastiest once i have ever had in a european country! great staff great service! if we will be back in barcelona we will for sure come back to this hotel!",5,2015,01,14
11,Great Location and Nice Service,"Fantastic location in the central of Barcelona with Sagrada Familia, Rambla, Plaza Catalunya, Plaza Espana, Park Guell, gothic district, all quickly accessible by walk or a short taxi ride

We hadn't heard much of the hotel so were a bit apprehensive on quality of the hotel and service but far exceeded

Breakfast was excellent but crowded, not surprising given the time of the year

The rooftop bar was an excellent place to see the fireworks from

PS - avoid the spa. It was most overpriced and not high quality at all.",4,2015,01,12
11,Top Class Location ,"Situated on the equivalent of Londons Bond Street this classy 5* deluxe hotel is perfect for business or leisure . The staff are excellent , very friendly and extremely efficient . The roof top bar is super , we were there at new year so it was a little too cold to use it but I am sure in the summer it is perfect as the views are great . Casa Batilo and Le Pedrera ( 2 of Barcelona must see attractions ) are a minutes walk away . Also La Sageada Familia is about a 20 minute walk away . Of course the best designer shops are all around you . ",5,2015,01,07
11,Barcelona's Best,"A beautiful hotel inside and out, in a great location near restaurants, museums, metro.  Pristine room and helpful staff who go the extra mile to ensure you are taken care of.  Breakfast buffet was well worth it.  Were considering scheduling a spa session but quickly filled up our days with things to do and see around the city.  Thank you for a great start to 2015!",5,2015,01,06
11,Great service and perfect location,"Upon arrival check in and luggage help was flawless and fast. We had a corner suite, very spacious and comfortable. Concierge help and food are excellent. 
Location is as excellent for touring Barcelona, close to shopping and tourist areas. We had an unbeatable experience at the Majestic",5,2015,01,05
11,Hotel hopping,"                                     12/28/14

My 3rd and last hotel hop of the city.
I was impress by it's hotel facade so I thought of giving it the benefit of the doubt.
As I enter the hotel,I didn't get the ""wow"" feeling at all.
I think it's because I've been into some of the great hotels of the world.
So first,I was taken on the 3rd Flr to where my room is.
They said that I will get an interior view as I took the deluxe room...
When I get into my room,I felt like I was at a cheap hotel...didn't get the feeling of a five star hotel...and what surprises me was it didn't have a bath tub!
I was so disappointed so I had to call the concierge.
I was moved to another room w/ finally a tub...it got better but I told the porter that I wasn't impress at all,I told him about my experience at my previous five star hotel stay.
He told me that he will try to find me a room w/ a view...and we made it.
I was again transfer to another room,better than the previous two rooms that I've been...the Executive!

I think the best things in life is when you know what you want and knows how to achieve it.",3,2015,01,03
11,A Great Place To Stay,"I would recommend this hotel to anyone as the quality is good, but best of all the location is superb. Great Tapas restaurants abound in this area as well as good shopping and wonderfull sights including Goudi houses just a short walk down the road.

We didn't eat at the hotel, so can't comment, instead we took advantage of the many great cafes and restaurants across the city.

The best thing about staying here is that you can use its great location as a base to see everything this wonderfull city has to offer.",4,2015,01,02
11,Highly recommend,"This hotel is a luxury hotel and is very elegant.  It is perfectly situated in Barcelona for tourist.  It's on the main shopping street with high end (Chanel is right next door) and moderate commercial shops.  It's walking distance from La Rambla and other sites.  Public transportation is on this main street.  

It has an amazing rooftop where guests can hang out.  It has nice views of the city.",5,2015,01,02
11,Luxury hotel,"We had celebrate our new year (2015)at this hotel.. We had magic nigh.... It was interesting for us that the owner of the hotel welcome all of gusts one by one....  The facilities ,, service,hospitality ets was perfect ,,I recommend this hotel to who wants to pay not much but gets back  for much... I like it...",5,2015,01,01
11,"Great Hotel, Great Location","I came here with my wife for 1 night in March.

Great rooms. Hotel is not ""tired"" like some 5*. Very attentive staff. Wifi perfect in rooms. Great location close to all designer stores. 

Great value if booked in advance. Bar expensive ! good soundproofing in rooms.",5,2014,12,31
11,Good Choice,"We stayed for 3 nights between Christmas & the New Year in a Deluxe Executive room on the 7th floor looking out over Valencia Street.
Every morning we lay out on the private terrace in our bathrobes and had breakfast watching the sun rise over the rooftops of Barcelona, listening to the distant chimes of the church bells. It was a perfect way to start the day.
The hotel is faultless; the staff very courteous & obliging; the beds comfortable and the level of cleanliness excellent.
Our only regret is that we didn't try the restaurant as we enjoyed our room so much!",5,2014,12,31
11,Very nice 50th Anniversary Visit,"I stayed here for two nights with my husband, to celebrate his 50th Birthday - The staff were genuinely very friend and we were made to feel very welcome and my husband very special. Highly recommended.",5,2014,12,31
11,I love this hotel!,"I stayed at the hotel majestic the first week of December 2014.  This hotel was booked through my company for business travel so I didn't know what to expect.  The hotel is absolutely beautiful and in a great location.  I have stayed throughout Europe and this is one of the best hotels.  The bar and dining area is always lively and fun even if you are traveling alone.  The property is beautiful and well maintained.  Everything about it is very pleasing to the eye.  But the best part of the hotel is the service.  The staff was WONDERFUL - helpful in every way.  Reminded me of the TRUMP properties which are known for their service.  I also had a massage at the spa and it was first rate.  The room was small, but average by European standards.  Even though the room was small it was well appointed with robes, slippers and nice toiletries.  Your room is services twice per day so you never run out of clean towels or anything.  I had dinner once in the bar area and they made me feel very comfortable even though I was dining alone.  The waiter and bar tender stopped by a couple of times to chat and ask about the food.  The hotel is walking distance to the gothic area and many other attractions.  I found the size of the hotel just perfect - all amenities, but small enough to feel cozy.  After two days it felt like ""home"".   Whether you are traveling for business or pleasure this hotel is the best.",5,2014,12,30
11,Service and confort without being pretentious,"The Majestic is a luxury 5 Star central hotel within the main shopping area in Barcelona.
The staff are excellent and efficient without fussing around. we were welcomed on arrival by cab outside the hotel.
The rooms are very clean and comfortable, the public areas and bars have a pleasant atmosphere and feel.
The hotel has an open rooftop restaurant with good appealing food and extensive views over the city. Quite spectacular at night. 
I am planning to return in 2015.",5,2014,12,30
11,Luxury and class at premium location,"Visited Barcelona before, but not The Majestic, we decided to stay there this time. We were not disappointed- starting from the location, through the elegant decor, the impeccable staff and the attention to details. We were upgraded having been a LHW member and then again because of noisy room to a junior suite. We were given an early check in and a late check out. The breakfast is outstanding. I higher recommend this hotel. I will definitely come back. ",5,2014,12,29
11,One of the best hotels I have stayed in,"I went to Spain in  December 2014 for our  wedding anniversary .It was perfect stay. The staff welcomed us very well. My daughter was also traveling with us she was 20 months old, the baby cot in the room was perfect, also they had arranged for baby slippers, bath robe and baby toiletries.
The food was perfect, tasted very good, quality was excellent. 
The only problem was the bed, it was not at all comfortable, also the access to spa was paid. 
Overall I enjoyed staying at The Majestic hotel ,location was very good, not very far away from airport and just in city centre.",4,2014,12,27
11,Beautiful Hotel,"My husband and I stayed there for 4 days and everything was great. The property was beautiful and the service was great. Location was perfect and close to the shopping area in Paseo de Gracia, Usually , I tend to rate hotels by the quality, expertise and easy goingness of the concierge and I can say that they have a great concierge! Every recommendation was great , they were very forthcoming and helpful. I would especially like to thank one of the concierge members ( blonde with short hair, sorry I forgot her name) . She helped us twice and both times exceeded our expectations. Not only that but she followed up to make sure that we enjoyed. We really appreciated that. 

Would definately recommend this hotel.",5,2014,12,25
11,Great Hotel,"We stayed in November for a long weekend.  Good location on the Bond Street equivalent of Barcelona.  Great welcome on arrival but perhaps a bit impersonal over the whole stay, very good breakfast, rooftop bar is a great place to chill and while it is a bit pricey it is not outrageous.  The room was fine other than the view was a brick wall about six feet away.  Hotel was hosting a big sales reward event for an American IT company and it is clearly geared up for the corporate market.  Does what it says on the tin!",4,2014,12,24
11,Wedding anniversary," A great hotel with an excellent service.  My stay was almost perfect as I reques a room without feathers but I end it up with one so they upgraded the room. Room was excellent including the service. As we celebrated our wedding anniversary they gave us a free bottle of Cava :) 
              
              ",4,2014,12,18
11,The best of the best!,"Amazing customer service, gorgeous hotel that offers outstanding 5star food with their complimentary breakfast package.  Concierge service was spot on with all of their recommendations.  Highly recommend!",5,2014,12,18
11,Fabulous,"We went there with my husband for our honeymoon . Hotel is very imposing and well preserved.the room was gorgeous big bathtub flat screen tv good size wardrobe. Breakfast was excellent, stuff amazing!really I can t find anything bad to say except the price per night it's a really expensive hotel... We loved it!!",5,2014,12,18
11,One-of-a-kind in Barcelona!,"We travel abroad from US once a year with our young children. We typically spent a large number of hours doing our research on luxury hotels and in the end its still always a little risky.

However, The Majestic Hotel & Spa was exactly what we read about and the service was amazing. Everything was perfect from the reception to the spa and all the way down to housekeeping folding our clothes.

My six-year-old son lost a small stuffed animal in the laundry and was devastated by the concept of it being gone forever. Exactly 24 hours later it was hand delivered (clean) to him in our room. Service like this just doesn't exist anymore!

The hotel is on the main strip of fashion (similar to 5th Ave. in NYC) and there are many wonderful places to eat nearby. All landmarks are short cab ride or a nice 1-2 mile walk if you enjoy taking a stroll to see all the amazing architecture.

We are still looking at our photos and wishing we were at The Majestic in Barcelona!

Eric Polins & Family",5,2014,12,15
11,Great hotel with good location and good quality sleep,"Majestic is well located in relation to the center of Barcelona, close to the central shopping streets and 10 minutes walk from Plaça de Catalunya and La Rambla. Terrific service everywhere in the hotel. Rooms are spacious and have a great marble plated bathrooms (junior suite), as well as very good romrenhold. Low noise so that it is good quality sleep. Wifi is included in the room rate and worked fairly satisfactory. Did not the opportunity to test the spa or garden.",5,2014,12,14
11,Excellent location great hotel,This is a hotel located in the best possible location you could have in Barcelona. You have all the shops and all the city's movement just at your fingertips. Staff is very professional and is very friendly and attentive. I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Barcelona.,5,2014,12,14
11,Great location,"We stayed in the 2 bdrm apartment.  Very clean and lots of room.  A little noisy from the street but not bad.  Inside soundproof. Hotel staff very helpful. The only complaint was when we asked for some ice we were charged 10 euros!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yep  highway robbery to say the leased.  They should post that in their services charge book with everything.  
Great location.  Would recommend but be aware of the extras we take for granted in Canada.
Definitely a five star hotel. The rooftop restaurant is very nice but needs a little TLC.  The Brunch at the hotel is definitely worth the 59 euros. GREAT",4,2014,12,11
11,Best spanish hotel I have ever stayed in,"Hotel is well-located just a short walk from the busy Ramblas area and other tourist interests such as the magnificent La Sagrada Família church.  From the moment you step out if your vehicle, you are treated with respect and courtesy.

I had a lovely room on the 12th floor, looking inwards to minimise the noise of the busty traffic on the main road.

There is a rooftop bar, terrace and swimming pool, with stunning views over the city, where we had several tasty tapas-style lunches.",5,2014,12,08
11,Best hotel I have stayed in!,"I have never left a review for a hotel or anything else for that matter but feel that this hotel deserves it! I took my mum to this hotel for five nights in August for her 50th and it was the most unbelievable experience ever. Without sounding arrogant I have had experience staying at numerous 5 * hotels but this was a cut above the rest. The roof terrace was stunning and the staff where incredible, huge rooms, luxury bathroom, amazing James Bond style bar the list goes on........ I can not recommend this place enough. Yes its expensive but so worth it and we felt like part of the furniture by the end of the five days, I even had a tear in my eye leaving. 100% going back!",5,2014,12,05
11,Best hotel i have been in barcelona,"This is a very central, cosy and comfortable hotel in Barcelona.

Rooms are very silent for a good sleep. Very well decorated, modern and premium quality. It is in walking distance to placa catalunya and ka ramblas.

Breakfast is awesome.full of quality colds, hots and pastries.",5,2014,12,03
11,Great hotel and location,"My partner and I stayed here for 4 nights at the end of November for our 10 year anniversary.
The hotel is stunning with excellent views of the city from the rooftop.The staff are wonderful and when I return the Barcelona I will definitely return to this hotel .
The rooms are of a very high standard.We did not eat at the hotel.The location of this hotel is perfect .Just a short walk from La Rambla and Gothic quarter.There are many shops and restaurants at the metro is within close proximity.
I would recommend this hotel highly to anyone.",5,2014,12,03
11,Very comfortable,"Stayed here for 4 nights this past September.  We were traveling with a group of friends who chose the hotel.  It's not the kind of hotel that my wife and I typically book as we don't like spending so much money on lodging.  We usually book a clean, comfortable mid-priced place but we decided to just go with the flow since our friends wanted to stay there. The room was extremely nice and comfortable.  Great big bathtub (request it if you can because not all of the rooms had these tubs) and very comfortable bed.  

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's not exactly a good value.",4,2014,12,02
11,perfect  hotel,"We were big group attending medical conference the reception staff were so good and tried to get each agood room they send the porter to show us the room to decide which one to choce
The break fast was a feast with all variety of fruit and cheese 
Hotel was situated in Main Street with designer shops 
I certainly will go back to this hotel if I am in Barcelona 
This was I September 2014",5,2014,12,02
11,Don't waste your money,"We stayed here for the second half of our honeymoon in October. I will never stay here again. Although we arrived too early to check in, we had come from Santorini and were barely met with any fan fare, even after I mentioned that we were there for our honeymoon. Not even a ""congratulations' was said, let alone any effort to try and get our room ready as quickly as possible. Instead we were told to come back around 3 (it was 10 am). Don't get me wrong. The woman was professional and pleasant enough - but we were on our honeymoon at a 5 star hotel - and this was how we were greeted. 

When we returned we were brought up to our room, which was beautiful, except for one thing - the two twin beds. Have I mentioned we were on our honeymoon? I called to once again remind them that we were here on our honeymoon and would prefer a queen size bed I was told that 90% of the hotel was set up this way and that they could tie the beds together and set up as a queen. I expressed my concern that the beds were on wheels and would move away from the wall mounted headboard and/or that one of us would wind up in a indentation in the bed. We were shown a room with a queen bed but it was so tight and tiny we declined. We had our beds tied together. 

A day later, after our travel agent called the hotel on our behalf, we were shown an 'upgraded' room  just down the hall from our room with a slightly better view and queen bed, but again shoe box small. At this point we had been unpacked and it just didn't seem worth it to move. The only concession the hotel made, was to allow us to move hotels without penalty. Considering we were at the end of a 2 week honeymoon, the last thing we wanted to do was have to pack up and move. To boot most of the hotels in the area or the same 'caliber' were booked. 

It wasn't until another day later that we came back to our room where a bottle of Cava (local sparkling wine) was waiting for us. 

It was still another day before we came home to heart shaped rose petals on the bed. 

And then a third day before customer relations contacted us and offered us a free drink at their rooftop bar. 

We had an early departure time so we called the front desk for a wake up call. It never happened. My husband woke up in a panic 15 minutes before our contracted car service was to pick us up. When we complained about it, we were just told that the person that took the request had put it in the wrong place! 

NEVER ONCE did we receive an apology! I couldn't have been more frustrated for a hotel stay and my husband and I have stayed in all types of hotels all over. Let alone to have to deal with this on our honeymoon! 

Now don't get me wrong - the hotel is beautifully appointed. Perfectly situated in the heart of Barcelona. But I could not be more disappointed with the way we were treated on our honeymoon. It really put such a damper on it and to have  it end in such a bad way, I would never recommend this hotel to anyone, especially for the amount of money people spend to stay there. I will never stay there again.",2,2014,12,01
11,Looking forward to returning,"We had to drive back to the UK from our home on Menorca and decided to take a long route and stop off at a few locations on the way. Due to our ferry not getting into Barcelona until early evening we made it our first stop. We booked the Majestic by chance and did not regret it. A beautiful building , inside and out , enhanced by the exceptional staff. using satnav, the Hotel was easy to find only a few minutes drive from the ferry terminal. However, due to the bus lanes and separate cycle lane, we missed being able to stop at first. We drove around the block and decided to pull up on the pavement outside. Straight away we were approached by a friendly face asking if we were staying at the Hotel. We were immediately told not to worry about the car , this would be parked in the underground car park for us , our bag was taken out of the car and we were taken straight to reception.  Check - in was no problem and we asked about dining for the evening. The receptionist showed considerable knowledge of a variety of restaurants in the vicinity and on choosing something more casual for the evening, she rang the restaurant and made a booking for us , confirming the time and name on a card. We were not disappointed with the recommendation. The room was very comfortable and had a lovely bathroom with large wetroom shower. The bed was extremely comfortable and had the softest pillows I can ever remember in a hotel. Our room overlooked the street but we were not disturbed by traffic either in the evening or the morning. The morning greated us with one of the best self service  breakfasts I have ever had. The choice of juices , mueslis , cold meats , cheese , different breads , pastries was almost too much. The difficulty was in trying not to have something of everything. A hot breakfast was also available with a chef on hand to cook eggs freshly, as you would like them. This was only an overnight stay so we did not get a chance to try the roof terrace bar or any of the other facilities. However, we have already decided to drive back down to Menorca in the new year and will be staying in Barcelona for a few days to explore this wonderful city further and we will be staying at the Majestic.",5,2014,12,01
11,Beautiful hotel in perfect location,"The Majestic Hotel was very well situated on a main street full of beautiful designer shops. The staff is incredibly professional and kind, and gave great recommendations for restaurants and bars throughout the weekend. The hotel was luxurious while also providing great value. Can't say enough good things. The Christmas decorations were magical!",5,2014,12,01
11,Great experience,"It's the third time we've stayed at the Majestic. Everytime they keep improving. The hotel has been renovated, The rooms are spacious and well equiped. The service is impeccable. From the moment you arrive to the door of the hotel you feel at home! Everybody is happy to please you. Can't wait for a fourth visit.",5,2014,12,01
11,Not up to 5 star standards at all,"Staying in the Majestic now! and another 4 nights to come. Hotel seems impressive and location is great. However for a 5 star hotel the rooms are way to small, when asked to upgrade the hotel staff came back with a ridiculous add on fee to the high room rate (250 Euros per night) I am paying anyway. The hotel bed is way to light so it moves around while sleeping. The in-room wifi is way to slow to get good connection. The staff at the hotel bar was not attentive at all Hope that the Majestic staff will come round this week with a better upgrade because this does not live up to the standards of business travel..",2,2014,12,01
11,Magnificent old world charm and the most comfortable beds!,"Having been once before to Barcelona and stayed at a lovely small boutique,   I decided to stay at the Majestic while passing thru Barcelona for just one night given it’s convenience to my meetings.  This is an elegant property, with a true Old European charm that was delightful.  The room was beautifully appointed, somewhat small but absolutely ideal for my time there.  The bathroom was gorgeous marble with a large soaking tub – always a plus on business travel, along with the rain shower head.

While service was good at reception, the best service was to be found in the lobby bar area where I ate both a light dinner and breakfast the next morning.  The staff there offered outstanding service and the food was very good.    I did first attempt to go to the breakfast buffet but for the insane price of 59 Euro (!), even on business, I just couldn’t imagine spending that much money on breakfast.

The best part of the hotel was the actual bed.   This is probably the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on!   I couldn’t tell if it was a tempurpedic with extra cushioning or what but it was divine.    For someone who suffers from chronic backaches, this was pure heaven.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Barcelona who wants a grand experience at reasonable hotel room prices, barring the breakfast buffet.",4,2014,11,24
11,"Great service great location,a classic in Barcelona","This is the second time I stayed in this hotel. The first time was in 2005 and since then it had a major renovation. The hotel is now more modern but with a classical style. Beautiful in and out. 
Service is impeccable from the moment you arrive. Check in was easy with a smile. We had a junior suite with a view of the paseo de Gracia. This boulevard is the classiest area in Barcelona a leisure walk to the ramblas and most tourists destinations. Beware that most of the stores are luxury and will put you back a few dollars. The room had a great bathroom full of amenities,very comfortable bed.there was a comfortable lounge area with a sofa and a desk.  A complimentary bottle of white wine was brought. Turnover service was impeccable. Requested a late checkout and granted with a smile.
Concierge was eager to please and most of the restaurant recommendations were on the money. 
The buffet breakfast was one of the best we have had. An excellent selection,even pan con tomate,a Catalan classic. 
The only negative was the service in the 10floor veranda that has a fantastic view of Barcelona including la Sagrada Familia,mountjuich,tibidabo mountain,the harbor....beautiful at night with the palacio national lights searching the sky. The service was slow and erratic. 
This is a luxury hotel,and priced accordingly,but believe me this hotel is worth every penny. Definetly coming back. ",5,2014,11,24
11,Great Location. Beautiful big Room!,"I had a quick pleasant stay at Majestic. The rooms were large and laid out quite interestingly! There is a rooftop bar that overlooks Barcelona which is absolutely beautiful. The staff went over and beyond to open a room early for me as it was a long flight in. 

Nothing over the top but very clean, nice and beautiful with good service!

I have no complaints and will certainly stay here on my next trip to Barcelona!",4,2014,11,22
11,Excellent hotel in a great location.,"The Majestic Hotel was very nice, & we stayed a relatively large room with a large bathroom & comfy bed. The hotel was clean & the free wifi worked well.
The hotel was located in a lovely area with plenty of restaurants & upmarket shops nearby. It was also very close to two of Gaudi's main attractions as well as just a few minutes walk to the Hop On Hop Off Bus stop. 
The only downside that we experienced was the cost of the drinks at the rooftop bar. But other than that it offered a great view and lovely atmosphere with great music playing from the DJ.
We would definitely stay there again.",5,2014,11,16
11,Best handicap room I have ever seen,"This is a luxurious hotel  within walking distance of Las Ramblas, La Sagrada Familia and many, many other attractions, places to eat, stores and museums.  Don't miss the opportunity of having  cocktail on the roof terrace while enjoying a gorgeous view of Barcelona's skyline (day or night).  Just a few of the features in the handicap room:  (at the touch of  button) you will be able to open the room door, adjust the height of the desk, control all the lights in the room and even open and close drawers and armoire doors!  Service is instant, courteous and efficient,",5,2014,11,15
11,Great place to stay in Barcelona,Wonderful hotel close but not too close to major tourist attractions. Excellent staff to help you with find the best way to get around and see the city. Availability of transportation and help with luggage is superior.,5,2014,11,14
11,Comfortable luxury in excellent location,"From the moment we arrived 
tired after a long transatlantic flight overnight we found comfort in a warm welcome and an easy check in with a room ready hours before usual check in time. Though the room was small it accommodated our needs and had an oversized luxurious marble bathroom with wonderful amenities. The wonderful and unexpected surprise was the outdoor private terrace overlooking the city with a view of the sea. It had a comfortable sofa and table which provided us a wonderful place to unwind after hours of walking in the city. And it expanded the space of a small room. We requested a quiet room away from the noisy main street in front of the hotel and were given a room which was totally quiet ! 
Our breakfasts in the hotel were excellent with a huge variety of fresh and healthy foods, excellent freshly baked breads and pastries, cheese selections, yogurts, fruits, eggs, and much more! 
All the staff were friendly and accommodating and attentive!

When we return to Barcelona we will definitely return to The Majestic Hotel.

11,End of Cruise,We finished our Seaborn cruise at Barcelona and we stayed at Majestic Hotel for three days. The room was very nice and big. The look at the Penthouse Lounge was magnificent. We could see the Sagrada Familia Basilica among other beautiful views,5,2014,11,11
11,Very Impressive,"We arrived having had 7 days on a MSC Cruise and was just using the hotel as a stopover............
We arrived, Reception were polite, attentive, efficient.... you couldn't draw breath
Whisked up to our room by the Concierge, given a whirlwind tour of the room, it was informative and friendly. The only downside was the view , but that did not effect our stay.
Room Service, was excellent, prompt, food quality great, attention to detail amazing.

The Roof Terrace, YOU MUST GO HERE. great views, interesting menu, attentive staff, food cooked on the terrace was interesting. Great pool area.
Stay again.. You bet
They arranged our early morning taxi to the airport after a great 'Room Service' breakfast.",5,2014,11,11
11,Wonderful Hotel,"We stayed here last week, for 3 nights.  Lovely hotel.  We had a charming room with a small balcony.  The room was quiet, even though the hotel is on a main thoroughfare. The buffet breakfast, included, was excellent.  More than enough choices for any traveler. The hotel is centrally located, one block from the Metro stop (Passeig de Gracias) and down the block from Gaudi's Casa Batllo.  The reception staff couldn't have been more helpful. There is a beautiful rooftop terrace, with a pool, where you can have a drink and look out over Barcelona.  And the entire hotel has free wifi, including in the hotel rooms. All in all, a great choice for a visit to Barcelona. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,11,09
11,"Great location, large , quiet room, but poor wifi","The hotel is probably at the best location in Barcelona, close to all major sights and shopping, in a chic and beautiful area. The room was large and very quiet, well appointed. The wifi was good enough for the mobile but not if you need any work done on the PC. If there was a concierge, I could not see him.",4,2014,11,09
11,First Rate Hotel in a Superb Location,"Definitely the best hotel we stayed in during our two weeks in Spain. Traditional luxury, fine staff, great breakfast room, outstanding location on Barcelona's best avenue. Only quibbles: odd layout on some floors where you must walk up or down stairs to access the elevator; a surfeit of mirrors on the ground floor that are truly confusing. ",5,2014,11,06
11,Amazing Hotel,"This was the most amazing hotel we have ever stayed  at. The location and amenities were incredible. The service and attention to detail was without equal. The staff was courteous and helpful in every way possible.

 We especially appreciated working with the concierge staff to plan and book our tours. They provided invaluable help that made our sightseeing even better than expected. We hope we can return there one day in the near future.",5,2014,11,06
11,Beautiful Hotel,"The hotel was beautiful, the rooms very clean , although a little small , very nice bathroom . Very comfortable bed.
Make sure you indulge in breakfast. So many choices and all delicious . 
Good location with a lot of attractions within walking distance .",4,2014,11,04
11,Well understood luxury in Barcelona,"Superb location downtown, while providing isolation to those real conoisseurs of true luxury (distinction).
Service is trained in the ancian palace hotels style, making one feel as a real special unique guest, while staying far away enough not to be invasive of your desired privacy.
Rooms and premises have been very recently refurbished to Today's good taste still on a classic style, but with all necessary modern requirements.
Small enough to keep that personalized attention, but big enough to offer any imaginable 5-stars luxury amenity.
Rooms are large enough (in European standards) to make one's stay extremely comfortable, including fully equiped modern-classic bathrooms.
Still, for the expert traveller, some things to be improved:
Bath ammenities from Bulgari are good, but one would miss simple things like a comb, toothpaste, toothbrush, etc. Such missing complements are unforgivable in such a high standards hotel.
Recently (2 weeks ago) there has been a change in assignment of frequencies to TV stations. Nobody at the hotel seems to have taken care about it, so most of the Spanish channels were simply not available.
On the other hand, they have one of the fastest room services ever experienced. In slighly more than 5 minutes our order arrived. Unfortunately, speed and quality do not match very well, and, while for most tastes food was above average, those more educated would find it below what one would expect in such excellent hotel.
Hotel housekeeping lacked of certain details, such as folding the pijamas, which I never forgive in a 5-stars luxury hotel.

In summary, the cons could be considered just minor details that should not affect the global outstanding appraisal, although for some such details do really make the difference.",5,2014,11,03
11,Majestic charged onto my credit card for I did not used on their service 1 week after I checked out from the hotel,"I stayed Majestic hotel & spa 3 nights, checked in September 24, and checked out September 28th, 2014 with my sister and my niece. While we were in Barcelona, the location of the hotel is good.
When we were checked out at the early in the morning of September 28th, the concierge at the front desk gave me a breakfast bill which we never ate in the hotel. I explained that we did not ate any breakfast at the hotel, then the concierge confirmed that it was hotel's mistake and I needed only pay for the local hotel tax at that time.
However when I came back to U.S., after I received my credit card bill, I found that Majestic charged onto my credit card for the breakfast we never ate at 1 week later of the check out date on October 6th, 2014.
I made a reservation of this hotel through my employer's employee discount plan.
Majestic hotel charges you on the service that you have never used.
It's the worst experience I ever used any of hotels.
2 years ago, when I took a vacation alone to Barcelona, I stayed at the hotel Next To. I did not like the cleaness and the size of the room of the hotel Next To. I only stayed 2 hotels in Barcelona. Though I disappointed both. 
I love Gaudi's works, but I hate the hotels in Barcelona.
By the way, I used to stay Royal York hotel in Toronto, Back bay Hillton in Boston, Hillton at the Disneyland in the orange county California. The most of the hotels I used to stay, I satisfied, though none in Barcelona.",1,2014,11,02
11,"Faultless service, luxurious room, great location","Stayed for 3 days in October half term. Concierge incredibly helpful and friendly, nothing too much trouble. Breakfast was the most amazing I have ever had ! Everything you could ever want- cooked bacon ,eggs etc, pancakes ,omlettes, fruit , pastries, meat and cheese .....the list goes on . Great complimentary toiletries each day,smelt beautiful. Bed easily the most comfortable I have ever slept in.View from roof top terrace was indeed amazing,  views of the  the Sagrada Familia .A fabulous place to relax at the end of hard days sight seeing , but extortionate prices ( 34 Euros for x 2 G and T's ). Go up and take in the view but choose to drink elsewhere .",4,2014,11,01
11,Absolute gem in Barcelona ,"The whole experience at the majestic was superb.  Rooms were luxurious, staff was very attentive.  Everything was perfect.  The upstairs pool and bar was fantastic great views of Segrada familia.  Excellent location walking distance to all sites!!!!  The concierge gave us excellent attention and recommendations. ",5,2014,11,01
11,"Great location, great hotel","Stayed for a week and found it excellent.  Great service and rooms are lovely.  Only negatives: our view was of the building right next door and the concierges were a bit variable, though I did depend on them for helping me quite a bit.  I even was able to take a spanish lesson with a wonderful professor named Xavi through their assistance.",5,2014,10,31
11,First class hotel in good location,A top class full service hotel right on Passieg de Gracia. The staff was very helpful with great suggestions and reservations for dinner. Roof top bar offers spectacular views of Barcelona including La Sagrada Familia. Room was large and clean. We had a balcony offering great views. ,4,2014,10,30
11,Shame about the bed,"Hotel location was excellent, close to the Metro and near excellent shops and restaurants.  We could not fault the service, as the staff were extremely helpful and friendly.  My birthday fell on one of the days of our stay and we were very surprised to find a bottle of sparkling wine and a birthday cake left in the room.  We were even more surprised to find that they were free!
The roof bar had superb views over the city, but the food was of moderate quality and expensive for what it was.  Also, the pool is only suitable for children.
Lastly, the double bed comprised of two single beds pushed together, leaving an uncomfortable gap in the middle. An attempted cuddle with my wife resulted in the beds moving apart, depositing me on the floor!",3,2014,10,30
11,Simply Superb,Everything about the majestic was perfect. We were fortunate in getting an upgrade to a Junior Suite. The location was perfect. We were able to walk to mot everywhere. Deightful roof top bar with a great view. All the employees were very accommodating and really cared about the guests.  If you are going to Barcelona... stay at The Majestic!,5,2014,10,29
11,"Fabulous hotel, wonderful staff!","We came here to celebrate my 60th birthday and it exceeded our expectations in every way.  The hotel is superb, the service is excellent and the attention to detail is second to none.  Plus it is in a great location for sightseeing as it is close to many of Barcelona's attractions, and there is a metro station close by, and also loads of bars and restaurants.  The weather was glorious even though it is the end of October, which made going back to a freezing Scotland a bit hard!",5,2014,10,29
11,Fantastic location and hotel,"Booked as a treat and the room and service was excellent. We also loved the rooftop bar with a stunning view of the city.
We didn't eat any meals in the hotel as there were so many exciting places to try in the city. The hotel is in a great location for several of the Gaudi houses. Everything is walkable and we went straight down the street into the gothic quarter most evenings. Barcelona itself was great, did a lot in a few days. Apart from the art and architecture we enjoyed the beach area and cablecar and just generally wandering around. Will definitely be back and would stay in the hotel again",5,2014,10,28
11,Best location ever,"Majestic hotel was'nt my first choice in barcelona to stat in!! But after being 4 nights in those big, comfort, clean rooms and getting good advices from conceirge, i don't think my next trip to barcelona i will choose another hotel specially that having everything handy and nearby..",5,2014,10,28
11,Luxury Plus,"Loved everything about this hotel. Beautiful rooms, well appointed (including Bvlgari toiletries). Great location for high end shopping and good restaurants. Staff is over-the-top helpful, just as you would expect.",5,2014,10,28
11,Smart,This is a landmark city hotel that offers superior service and quality in all areas of its operation. It's been refurbished and yet still seems a bit decoratively tired. Roof-top terrace is fab for a drink and snack.,4,2014,10,26
11,Total satisfaction,"My wife and I agreed that our experience at the Hotel Majestic was the best we have ever had. The staff is uniformly competent and pleasant. They set the tone by taking care of details, maintaining an elegant, yet intimate atmosphere. We were especially impressed by the concierge who provided wonderful recommendations about where to eat, how to traverse the city, and how to best understand Barcelona cultural and historical sites. We can enthusiastically encourage anyone considering a stay in Barcelona to book a room at the Hotel Majestic.",5,2014,10,24
11,Heaven in Barcelona,"I have traveled and stayed in Barcelona many times, however this was our first stay at the Majestic.  Everything about this hotel was perfect!  The location, the rooms, the service and the food were fantastic.  I can't wait to come back.",5,2014,10,23
11,excellent,"Excellent stay at the hotel, arrive at 0900 hour in the morning and room was already ready for us!
big room ( standard room ) nice bathroom and very good bed! everything was in the room, enough space for clothes and suitcases.

Breakfast is really a must! fantastic! 

toproof terrace is very nice, small pool but that's not the reason you will go up there....have a nice beer and enjoy the view!",5,2014,10,23
11,A beautiful hotel in a beautiful city,"My husband and I just got back after a 10 night stay at this hotel. I can't say enough great things about Hotel Majestic. Firstly, location was the best. It is on the Passieg de Gracia and surrounded by beautiful cafes and retail stores. The hotel has wonderful service, super friendly staff (especially the assistant captain, Fernando) and the rooms are nicely appointed although a bit on the small side which is typical in Europe. The breakfast is a bit pricey at 29 euros each but well worth it. The lobby bar also serves great drinks and has a small menu. Food is excellent. The roftop bar is not to be missed as it has a 360 degree view of Barcelona. I look forward to returning to this beautiful city and this wonderful hotel. Loved it!",5,2014,10,22
11,Not 5 star service,"This hotel is beautiful and is ideally located. They offer all the amenities that you would expect from a 5-star hotel, but the service was not very friendly.

The room we stayed at was very nice, but with all the marble in the hallways the sound carried. We were first given a room with a view of Passieg de Gracia, but even with the windows closed you could hear the street noise. The second room was an interior room, but there was still a lot of noise from the hall and even the adjoining rooms..the walls are thin.

The hotel is very centrally located and there is great things to see and do all around. I wouldn't recommend eating at the hotel, it is very expensive and there are plenty of great restaurants close by. Our favorite tapas restaurant was Catalana just a couple of blocks away. 

What disappointed me most about the stay was the front desk service. When we first checked in they were very friendly and welcoming, but not much after that. Whenever we would have a question or need to ask something we would often have to wait a while till one of the front desk staff (and there were usually 3-4 of them) decided to acknowledge us. It was a busy hotel, but you would expect a friendly ""hello"" or ""how are you"" once in a while. The bell staff were great and the doorman would on occasion say ""hello"" but most of the staff did not. 

We ended up staying at another 5-star hotel for the second half of our trip to Barcelona and had a much better experience... beautiful scenery, quite rooms, and fantastic staff. The Majestic is a good hotel, but there are better in Barcelona.",2,2014,10,22
11,Business in Barcelona,Great location.  Breakfast had plenty of choices.  Walking distance to everything.  Staff very attentive.  Roof top bar/restaurant is an awesome venue.  Room was noise free but bedroom area was small.  Great bedding.,4,2014,10,21
11,"Great Location, Great Service","Couldn't have been more please with Majestic Hotel.  Right in the heart of Barcelona, within walking distance to many of the major attractions.  The staff was excellent, and you can't beat the roof top bar restaurant at sunset.",5,2014,10,20
11,Excellent location in the heart of Barcelona,We ended up in this hotel in Barcelona as we had to disembark our cruise ship due to ill health however we were not disappointed. Yes it was at the top end of our budget but the suite with the super super King bed was fantastic as was the bathroom and all other facilities and it was also very quiet. Staff were exceptional and so helpful and they all spoke English which made things easy. Location was tops and we were able to walk to everything.,4,2014,10,20
11,Perfect location in a gorgeous city!,"We stayed at the Majestic Hotel for 7 days. The hotel is perfectly located in an elegant part of the city. It is within walking distance to the old city. The rooms are beautifully appointed. The decor is elegant and classical. The bathrooms are practical as well as attractive. The hotel has a stunning roof area with a pool,bar and lounge areas. The staff could not be nicer. The concierge desk is very helpful. Breakfast was outstanding. I highly recommend this hotel as being the perfect spot to enjoy your time in Barcelona",5,2014,10,19
11,Perfect location - top breakfast ,"Located between Perdera and Casa Battlo, this luxury hotel offers high quality accommodation with one of the richest breakfasts I have seen - it's location is perfect for Barcelona and you can walk around all the places easily - tip: ask for rooms on high due to the noise",5,2014,10,18
11,"Good Location, big hotel","The Majestic is a very nice large hotel.  The location was good for us as we tend to walk long distances, but with a very handy Metro station as well.  It is on the edge of a large shopping area with all the top stores, although all the top stores seem to be in every city and we are not big shoppers.  The rooftop bar and grill were very interesting - good views and a nice retreat after a long day.  The gym was well equipped. The breakfast was fulsome if predictable but we were able to get some fruit - surpirsing that southern Spain with the large selections at the market still does not seem to serve fruit or vegetabels at meals.  The rooms are the trick - each one seems a bit different.  When we first checked in we asked for an alternate as the one assigned to us (executive deluxe) was inches from the elevator.  The bellman who accompanied us mentioned that he felt the original room was much larger and he had not had complaints on elevator noise.  He also said the rooms are not standard sizes or shapes due to the age of the hotel - obviously two buildings joined at some time. After looking into it we did select the original room - much better in terms of size and windows; he was correct and there was no elevator noise.  Our friends stayed in a junior suite on the 8th flooor - no windows only skylights! Also a tip - DO buy your tickets to the Sacrada Familia in advance to avoid the long line up but they only let you in at your designated time - and the audio guide was really good.",4,2014,10,17
11,Great Location,"Beautiful traditional hotel in the heart of Barcelona. Guest Relations Manager excellent : Alvarado. Rooms comfortable, with Bulgari White Tea nice bathroom amenities.  Breakfast good. Internet got interrupted some times during usage.",4,2014,10,16
11,Wonderful location !,"This hotel is lovely !  We enjoyed being in such a great area so close to many places.  The room was very comfortable  with a very large bathroom.  The staff was friendly and helpful. The lounge off the lobby is a great place to stop and listen to a piano player  and plan out your next  tourist destination!  

The hotel also has a roof top bar and small pool. Where you can take in the view and relax .
     ",5,2014,10,16
11,Majestic Hotel Barcelona,Great Location in the heart of Barcelona.  First class hotel. Service was excellent. Concierge very helpful in choosing dinner reservations. Food at the upstairs restaurant by the pool was only fair. Buffet breakfast was excellant.,4,2014,10,16
11,Not Worth the Price,"We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights prior to boarding a cruise and we booked it because it was an American Express Luxury Hotel and we were supposed to get certain perks.  One of the perks was an upgraded room if available.  We arrived at the hotel really early around 10:30 am and we were pleased that we were able to check in early.  We were disappointed that we were not able to get an upgraded room.  The room we were assigned (750) was pretty bad - it was on a floor that you had to go up and down around 6 steps to get to the room, which was not fun when carrying luggage.  Please be aware of these steps if you are disabled and ask for a floor with no steps.  The room was a typical tiny European room with an awkward layout with a two foot high platform that took up 1/3 of the room.  The bed, which was very comfortable with plush duck feather pillows, took up the rest of the room.  The platform had 2 chairs and a small table close to the closet, so it was difficult to access the closet and there was no where to put our suitcases, so we had to open them over the chairs.  I keep tripping over the platform and fell off of it once and luckily landed on the bed.  The décor was pretty in the room with soothing white and sea foam green.  The bathroom had beautiful white marble, but again an awkward layout.  You could not turn on the water in the shower without getting wet and as the shower door opened in, you had to open the door, get in and get hit by the door as it you shut it - all while the water is running.  The bathroom was tiny, so room for only one person and not much space to lay out your stuff.  The towel racks were in the adjacent space where the toilet was, so if you forgot to get the towel and put it near the shower, you got the whole bathroom wet as you walked to the next room for the towel.  I saw that other reviewers got turn down service, but we did not.  Breakfast was pricey at $30 euros and was a buffet with eggs to order, pancakes, cereals, breads, pastries, fruits, delicious homemade yogurt, cheeses, ham, bacon, juices, coffee, tea, etc.  The gym was good and had cardio machines, some free weights and some machines, so I was able to get a decent work out.  The location of the hotel is ideal as it is near shops and restaurants, the metro, walking distance to a Gaudi house and the Las Ramblas neighborhood.  Overall, I have stayed at better hotels for a lot less and frankly I did not think this hotel was worth the price tag.  I expect a lot more when staying at a 5 star hotel and this one did not deliver.  The hotel may have nicer and bigger rooms, but unfortunately ours was not one of them.  We tried for the upgrade as AMEX Platinum customers, but were told no and to complain to American Express.",2,2014,10,15
11,Thank you for a wonderful stay,"My wife and i stayed for 1 night before joining a cruise sailing out of Barcelona.We were able to get access to our room at 11.30am which was wonderful.Room was spacious although there was no view.Beds were so comfortable that we enjoyed one of the best night's sleep ever.Like many couples we ""dumped"" our clothes in the evening before going out to dinner.We asked for turn down service and were stunned to find not only the turn down service completed but all our clothes were folded and pressed.Breakfast was excellent,great choice accompanied yet again with faultless service.I had a minor problem with adjusting the temperature for the shower as it tended to fluctuate - upon reporting this to reception they were very apologetic and took my comment very seriously.I thoroughly recommend this hotel and would have no hesitation in staying there again. Congratulations and thanks to all the excellent staff and a very special thanks to Susana and Ingrid.",5,2014,10,14
11,OK Hotel.,"We arrived quite late to a warm reception but we did object to being asked for a 300 euros deposit or credit card against any purchases. We declined to pay, and this was accepted. 
Our room was very nicely decorated and very clean. Not the biggest of rooms we have stayed in but adequate. The bathroom was gorgeous but no walk in shower, just a large bath with shower over. The windows were triple glazed but we could still hear the traffic, but not enough to annoy us too much. There was only a coffee machine, no kettle. We had read this online so took a travel kettle with us. 
When we went down for breakfast on our first morning, after giving our room number at the desk, we were left standing not knowing where to sit. No one approached us to direct us to a table so we found one for ourselves. Coffee and tea were offered, and we were left to find the buffet on our own, no help offered. There were two buffet stations, both too small for the size of the room. One of these stations was closed quite early, so the other station was quite crowded and difficult to get to all on offer. For a 5 star star hotel we thought the food on offer was well below par. The cereals were very limited indeed. Apart from a poor muesli, (hardly any dried fruit/nuts in it) there were no other wholewheat cereals. As I only have fruit and cereals for breakfast this was a big letdown. On the plus side there was soya milk. Usually at 4 and 5 star hotels there is smoked salmon, sadly for my husband, none here. He tried the sausages and bacon were cremated and not to English tastes.
The service in the breakfast room was very patchy and decidedly 3 star. I inadvertently knocked some dried cereal onto the floor by our table. I told 3 members of staff but was ignored. It was only when another guest walked through the cereal and complained that a member of staff arrived to clean it up. All in all an underwhelming experience. The door men were always on the ball, helping us get taxis etc.
We wouldn't stay here again.",3,2014,10,13
11,Very good hotel in the center of Barcelona,"Paseo de Gracia in Barcelona, center of the town, very close to some Gaudi buildings, shops, restaurants, public transport. Great, professional and helpful staff, breakfast buffet one of the best I have had in the last years (however, breakfast room too small when hotel is fully booked). Great views from roof terrace. Gym was ok, pool on roof terrace was the size of a big bathtub, no separation from bar. Wifi too slow. Room size towards the smaller end, Nespresso machine available and capsule at €1 - that is odd for a 5-star Hotel.",4,2014,10,11
11,Fabulous hotel in fabulous city,"6 of us stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in September. Perfect location and it's old world charm was only enhanced by the modern vibe in the decor. The only problem we had was that I had booked 3 rooms with upgraded status through American Express. When we got there we were supposed to have early check in but only one room was ready. We put all the bags in that room - Room 723 - which was beautiful, spacious, facing the street...in short perfect. It took about 4 hours for the other 2 rooms to be ready. Rooms 722 and 721. Can I just say, not as nice as 723. That was a great room. We were in 721 which was a corner and everything was squished and there was no way to see out the windows from the bed. When I expressed my displeasure to the front desk, I was told that my substandard room had been graciously upgraded by them and basically I should be happy with what I got. Very rude, very unhelpful. Bottom line, we were offended but decided to stay in our rooms and I felt responsible since I had made the reservations for the group at least 4 months ahead. The concierge on the other hand was fabulous and recommended a great tapas restaurant in a little neighborhood locale - one of our best meals. So, to sum up; great location, really nice hotel, rude front desk staff with no one capable of handling room issues, and if you want a really nice room, ask for 723! Oh and I have to say The Majestic has one of the most awesome complimentary breakfast I have ever had. Amazing room filled with made to order eggs, etc and the finest hams, cheeses, breads - amazing and delicious. Almost worth the room disappointment.",5,2014,10,10
11,Another great hotel in a super location,"My travel agent found this hotel for us in the shopping district of Barcelona.  Like the Ritz in Madrid, this hotel is deluxe and has great customer service.  The front door staff were always pleasant and happy to help out.  The concierge staff was professional and always gave us great directions and restaurants.  Our room was upgraded and had a balcony facing the street.  Great views and a nice place to sit and relax in the afternoon.  Everything in the room was deluxe.  The breakfast was also excellent with a full menu.  Would highly recommend this hotel!!!",5,2014,10,09
11,The only place to stay in Barcelona,"Stayed here for a long weekend last year and was just blown away with the standard of the hotel and the quality of the staff. The Rooftop bar and pool,are great you can have a relaxing swim followed by a quiet drink while enjoying the panoramic views of the city. The location of the hotel makes it ideal for visiting all the sights and leaves the whole city at your feet. Great rooms with good facilities and reasonably priced .",5,2014,10,09
11,Probably the nicest!,"We recently had a wonderful four day break in Barcelona and did all of the expected touristy sight seeing and city tours. However the high point of our stay was the Majestic. We can only echo all of the fine remarks made by other satisfied guests. I say satisfied we were far more than that. From the moment that we arrived we were overwhelmed by the helpfulness and politeness of every member of staff we met. Nothing was too much trouble and what a change to see smiling faces to greet you every day. The hotel is every inch five star as are the staff. Our room was perfect, comfortable, clean, tidy and with many lovely creature comforts. The owners, management and every person employed at the Majestic should be very proud of the atmosphere which they have created. If or when we go back to Barcelona this will be the only place to stay. Thank you all so very much.",5,2014,10,09
11,Magnificent hotel!,"We spent the last night of our three week European vacation in Barcelona and had a reservation here. I emailed ahead and mentioned that we love an upgrade, if available. We were given  a Penthouse suite! The hotel was elegant, 5 star+ in every way. The lobby, the concierge, the dining room, the food-- supreme! Our suite was huge with a tremendous balcony and views of the city, 1 1/2 baths with jetted tub, divine and comfortable decor and attentive service.The roof top bar is fantastic, too.  It made a terrific night all the more ""once in a lifetime""!  This is truly a special hotel that I would recommend to any and everyone.",5,2014,10,08
11,good city centre hotel,We recently stayed for the weekend with three other couples. The hotel is  well positioned near  a the top of the ramblas. The beds are exceptionally comfortable and our room was small but perfectly OK. The roof top bar is excellent with great views over the city and a pool. The hotel boasts a michelin star chef although we never dined in the evening. Breakfast was excellent and the concierge most helpful. overall very good.,4,2014,10,07
11,A Wonderful Stay,"The Majestic Hotel was all that it was reputed to be and more.  From our first welcoming greeting at the front desk (Maria), to our final check-out and farewell, the Majestic was a wonderful beginning to a lovely Land/Cruise tour of Spain and Portugal.  I must make special mention of our Junior Suite - so beautifully appointed and comfortable that I didn't want to leave the room.  I am now in my Twilight Years, but if I am fortunate enough to return to Barcelona, I will most definitely return to The Majestic.  Thank you one and all for making our stay so memorable.

11,Absolutely fabulous!,"The hotel was amazing. The room was spacious and immaculately clean. The staff were beyond friendly, especially to our toddler and could not do enough to help. The bed was comfortable, the only negative was it was two beds pushed together on wheels which would cause it to separate easily. Next time we go to Barcelona we will  definitely stay here.

11,almost 5 stars,"We booked this hotel as a package via Expedia.  I'm not usually a fan of booking via internet companies because I feel you don't get treated as well by the hotels.  Anyways, the Majestic is in a great spot, centrally located in the shopping district and close to the metro.  The staff is really friendly and try their best to make things perfect.  The concierge was helpful in planning my walking route and made some great suggestions.  The bellman were helpful and didn't seem to be tip seeking.  The rooftop bar gives a really pretty view of the city and service is quite efficient.  So, why not 5 stars?  We arrived after 10pm our first night.  We returned from dinner and prior to going to sleep, we noticed that the small hallway lights wouldn't turn off.  I called down and was told they were emergency lights.  I found this hard to believe but was too tired to argue and asked them to check it in the AM.  I reminded them the next day, and that evening, the problem wasn't resolved.  Finally, on the 3rd day, I asked for the technician to come up.  He was befuddled and had to call in backup.  So, there ended up being a problem with the wiring etc.  I spoke to the front desk and explained my frustration.  They did send me some chocolates and comped some of my bar charges.  Aside from the lighting issues, I would recommend this place quite highly.",4,2014,10,06
11,Good location. ,"The hotel is well positioned for exploring the city. As to the hotel itself it's difficult to say. We were put in room (312) with practically no light and a view of a wall! So avoid this room if you're feeling depressed! Bed was comfortable albeit expect to be woken early by the sound of doors banging. The room top bar area is the main feature is the hotel. Overall, I was a bit disappointed. ",3,2014,10,04
11,"Good location, good service","We took the kids on a cruise and stopped over in Barcelona for 2 nights, this is a lovely hotel , staff are helpful and always polite. Central location with easy access to the hot spots and shopping area very close to La Ramblas. The rooms are revamped quite spacious , enough to hold two baby cots. Breakfast buffet was very good, nice selection of all the favorites , the kids were happy with their pancakes and croissants.",4,2014,10,02
11,A Wondeerrful Place to Stay in Barcelona,"A beautiful hotel on probably the most attractive street in the city.  The rooms are fine, the staff very attentive, the location just minutes from everything you want to do 

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the majestic.  If, and I hope we will, we ever return to Barcelona, there is no question but that we will stay at the Majestic.",5,2014,10,01
11,The staff make this hotel,"two night work related stay on my own.  staff were some of the friendliest and most helpful I have encountered in any city in the world.  great location in Barcelona just a block or two from the Pedrera (Gaudi) apartment building and a ten minute walk to La Rambla.  My room was perhaps a little smaller than expected for five star (twin beds - I hate twin beds!) but I think I was just unlucky.  The bathroom was good - excellent high pressure shower. Rooftop cocktail bar is worth a visit, breakfast was excellent - decent bottle of Codorniu Cava open and waiting, good quality breads, cakes, pastries, fruit and juices (I didn't try the hot food but there was a chef on duty behind a hot plate if you wanted fresh eggs).  I was there for a conference and the facilities for this were also excellent.  I didn't eat in the hotel restaurant except breakfast so can't comment on it.  For designer shopping this is an excellent base with all major brands from D&G to Burburry within yards.",4,2014,10,01
11,A Classic.  A true Gem of a hotel.,"The location is only surpassed by the service !  A true gem in every respect.  Suite was very well appointed, up to date, with one of the most confortable beds anywhere.  A classic hotel that honors it's history by continuing to provide superb service.  An asset to this magnificent, beautiful city.",5,2014,09,28
11,Fantastic,"A wonderful 6 day stay at the Majestic in Barcelona.

Started with a very relaxed check-in, not rushed and making sure every detail was addressed. Room amazing, nice and big but wait!!!!! The bed......amazingly comfortable - never slept so well away from home.

Toiletries were very descendant - BVLGARI, felt very spoilt.

Staff very friendly, always smiling, accommodating and friendly.

Only down side, being a non-smoker, there were too many smokers near the main entrance, the hotel should move them further away to ensure non-smokers are not subjected to constant smoke every time you enter or exit the hotel.",5,2014,09,28
11,Great location for Gaudi lovers,"The Majestic has much to commend it.  The rooms have been very comfortably refurbished.  The rooftop bar is a relaxed place to go for a drink and light meal at sunset as the lights come up around the city.  The staff is friendly, helpful, and accommodating.  The only negatives have to do with the size of the hotel.  The breakfast room is cramped and hectic as the staff runs around trying to serve coffee to everyone and the guests trip over each other going to/from the buffet.  The front lobby is also very busy.  For those of us who prefer small, boutique hotels, it's best to retreat to the peace of your room.

One other great feature of the Majestic is its proximity to two of Gaudi's residential masterpieces which bracket the hotel a block away in either direction.  Both can be visited and are well worth seeing.  The metro is also a block away and will quickly take you anywhere in the city you'd like to go.",4,2014,09,27
11,Stunning,"We arrived early the staff  were excellent, giving us access to internet and hotel amenities, and rushing to get us a room.
 The location is great with easy access to all the city has to offer. Excellent restaurants nearby. The room are contemporary with historical fixtures which give the rooms a stately feel  with quality amenities, House keeping is with out reproach attending to every need, if fact all the staff was exemplary. This hotel is truly five star, the roof top pool is excellent offering stunning city view and extensive bar.",5,2014,09,26
11,stunning rooftop,"rooftop is the main attraction in this hotel, absolutely beautiful. rooms are big but very noisy, also plumbing systems deserves renovation and upgrade. a bit decadent to some extent, but an excellent location.",4,2014,09,24
11,Great location in Barcelona,We stayed at the Majestic for two nights prior to our cruise.  The locations is great to get out and tour Barcelona.  The staff were extremely helpful and nice.  They made some suggestions about getting around and seeing as much as possible in our short stay. The swimming pool on the roof is very small; we didn't see anyone swimming.  The roof top view was wonderful however it got very crowded close to sunset.,4,2014,09,24
11,Great location for sightseeing,Lovely hotel right in the heart of Barcelona. Attentive staff and the hotel is well kept. Breakfast choices were very good and there are lots of good restaurants nearby for lunch/dinner. The rooftop bar is lovely but the pool is tiny so don't think about swimming!,5,2014,09,24
11,Good...Has potential to be great...,"We stayed 4 nights...always wanted to visit Barcelona, and here we were...
Let's break it down...

what did we like about the Majestic?
1 = The staff are very nice, very helpful, especially the guest relations lady (Ingrid)...the guys at the entrance, the cleaning ladies, reception staff...all sweet, all down to earth
2 = Location...it is on the Paseo de Gracia...popular and busy street...if you like to shop, eat, walk...it is convenient...close to the major pedestrian area...close to beach (20 or so minute walk)...in general it is at the heart of Barca...if you want peace and quiet when you exit the hotel, this place is not for you...
3 = Amenities in rooms are my fave (Bulgari!), cleanliness is very good, beds comfy, spacious and well designed
4 = Breakfast buffet is generous and nice
5 = Free WIFI
6 = Good value for money...would come back...

What did not impress us?
1 = Consistent unpleasant smell/odor in hallways on room floors
2 = Pool on roof top is pathetic...at best a larger than normal bath tub
3 = Whole set-up on roof top is overrated, i wouldn't waste an evening there, find somewhere else...Barca has a lot to offer
4 = Our room overlooked an ugly building, cannot tell you much about other rooms
5 = You can hear TV from adjacent rooms at night
6 = Entrance and reception not so pretty....for a 5-star hotel

The Majestic is a nice hotel with plenty of potential to become a great hotel...if only....
I recommend it if you want an easy base from where you can start your day across Catalonia...",3,2014,09,23
11,Best corner in town .,"The bar on the roof was a gem, with panoramic views of the whole city , the Estrella beer is a real treat and the roof top view is also good day or night , and the Water board building is much better at night lit up .",5,2014,09,23
11,OK....roof top was stunning..,"Location was ok, service was ok, everything was ok. Roof top was stunning but you felt like a sardine packed on the roof waiting for the sun to go down. Rooftop pool cannot be described as a pool as it was about large enough to dip your feet in after shopping all afternoon / and people did....perhaps best not swimming in the pool on that basis ! 

Overall, a very solid choice that worked for us very well, staff we well trained and the concierge at the door (very tall guy) made the hotel a he was brilliant.

Worth the money but wouldn't rush back...",4,2014,09,22
11,"Perfect Location, Great Comfort and Amazing Food!!","I stayed with my wife for two nights at the Majestic and we both loved it! The hotel itself is very grand, free fast WIFI is always a great plus. The rooms are spacious and the beds are very comfortable. The breakfast buffet is fantastic, lots to choose from and everything tastes great. The staff are the best I have seen, very friendly and always willing to help. The roof top has a breathtaking view, its great for sunset and even lunch, just be careful only a small section is in the shade, so if your there in the summer you might want to go early to escape the sun. They have a small pool which is good for cooling off but too small for a swim. The location is perfect, you are in the middle of the shopping area and you have many famous buildings within walking distance. The only draw back is that the hotel isnt by the beach, if thats what your looking for. We loved it and we will be back for sure!",5,2014,09,22
11,Majestic lives up to its name,"Wonderful location on a tree-lined street with high end shops between 2 of Gaudi's signature buildings in Barcelona.  The hotel offers superb accommodations and excellent service!  Our room was beautiful with a large sitting area, as well as a quiet reading nook, walk-in closet and marble bath with soaker tub and shower.  And, the views from the roof-top terrace can't be beat!",5,2014,09,20
11,5 star hotel,We stayed for 7 nights during our first trip to Barcelona as tourists. Everything was perfect from check in thru our entire visit with the minor exception of numerous water stains and scratches on the side table- we notified the front desk immediately so we wouldn't be found to have additional charges.,5,2014,09,20
11,Experience matches the price,"A nice 5 star hotel in Barcelona. Close to one of the Gaudi houses, very nice decor and good service.  The pool on the roof is not really a swimming pool, too small, and in the middle of the bar, so not really suitable for children.  The bar on the roof is very nice but, as you would expect in a luxury hotel, outrageously expensive.  We had one drink there to enjoy the ambiance and then a 5 minute walk to a street with plenty of reasonable places to eat and drink.
Breakfast was good
There are 2 set of lifts, one only goes as high as the 8th floor and the other goes to the roof.  Location is ok but not walking distance to the sea front for most people.  The free wifi worked well for me.",5,2014,09,20
11,Wonderful 5-night stay in Barcelona,"My husband and I loved the Majestic Hotel. It is conveniently located to everything, the room was spacious and quiet, and there is a wonderful turn-down service. The hotel has a roof-top bar with spectacular views of the city. But what really made this hotel stand out was the staff. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. It was our first time and Europe and they made us feel right at home.",5,2014,09,19
11,Barcelona hotel at it's best,"Great hotel and service.Rooms are well presented,and front desk as well as porters etc ready to help,close to everything,concierge service very well informed,front desk manager helped us even with early arrival.Tapas recommendations GREAT",5,2014,09,18
11,Wonderful hotel in a fabulous city,"Very elegant  hotel with a real attempt to make  each guest feel special.Beautifully appointed rooms.Bulgari  soaps and amenities. Very warm,efficient and professional staff. Romantic  roof top bar and pool.
Wish our stay were longer.",5,2014,09,18
11,second visit to Barcelona and first visit to Majestic Hotel,"Before our trip to Barcelona, i enquirer with the hotel on may aspects of our travel. they were very responsive to my requests were ALL attended to by Johan Jarno. i was so impressed by his interest to make our stay there welcome, i decided to book the 3 rooms there instead of the Mandarin Oriental where we last stayed 6 months ago. the location of the hotel is excellent and
and overall ambience gave us a very ncie and warm feeling as well. however and unfortunately the front desk bungled our check in after we went for a walk to wait for our rooms. after this little episode was over, the sales director i believe ms Susan compensated the ""'bungle'' with a little discount for our breakfast. anyway the rooms were very nice, clean and elegant and big enough for us. very comnfrotable bed and also a nice size and adequately furnished bathroom too.",4,2014,09,18
11,Elegant hotel in an excellant location,"We stayed at the Majestic as members of a tour organized by AHI Travel. While the rooms allocated to our group did not have prime views, the rooms were superb.  They were spacious and well appointed.  Our room had a king size bed with room for a night stand and chair on each side.  In addition the room had 2 arm chairs and a small round table for in room dining. a desk with a comfortable chair, a good size flat screen TV.  The closets, minibar, safe and expresso machine were fitted into a storage unit on one wall.  The Nespresso coffee machine was a favorite feature of ours and we enjoyed the coffee it offered during our stay. The bathroom was gorgeous.  It was all done in marble.  The WC was in a separate room with a sliding door for privacy.  The vanity area was equipped with a magnifying make-up mirror which my wife enjoyed using. It also had a hair dryer and a complete offering of soaps, lotions, shampoos and more. The shower/bath was one of the best we experienced during our entire trip.  It offered the option for an overhead rain shower, a hand held shower head or a bath. Room cleanliness was superb. The room was freshened twice a day and the staff accommodated our schedule very well. The breakfast buffet was huge. It offered meats that included Spanish Hamon, salami, copa cola, mortadella. All kinds of breakfast breads, rolls and croissants (some filled with fruit or chocolate, some not). Fresh fruits on offer included melons, figs, pears, orange, peach and more.  They also had a hot area which offered fried eggs, omlettes, pancakes and waffles. The staff were very attentive and to our delight most spoke some english.  The hotel had a delightful rooftop terrace which housed the pool and a cafe. The view from the roof was stunning.  From the roof one could see Sagrada Familia Cathedral, Montjuic, La Farinera and the buildings of the Olympic Village.

We throughly enjoyed out stay at the Majestic.  The beds were extremely comfortable, the rooms luxurious, the staff attentive and pleasant, and the location in L'Eixample outstanding. When not with our tour group, we could walk to so many attractions from the hotel.",5,2014,09,17
11,A lot of positives,"Our initial impressions were negative following delays to our room being ready. We arrived before the check in time of 3pm so a wait for room availability was fair enough, the problem was being given false promises and a complete lack of urgency or concern to two exhausted travellers. Eventually Fransisco, a manager,rescued us and quickly arranged for an excellent room to be available and he accompanied us to our accommodation to ensure that we were satisfied.
The hotel is in a first class position within easy walking distance of the old town and las Ramblas etc also close to the Metro.
The hotel is well equipped and stylish with a comfortable bar and a good but expensive breakfast buffet (25€ per person). We did not try the other restaurant facilities in the hotel there are so many good alternative restaurants in the area but based on the general standard of the establishment one can assume they will be good.
This is a classy hotel with a lot of clearly wealthy patrons, it's in a first class location and is very comfortable. We would stay here again but would leave with an even more positive impression if the reception staff could have been a little more empathetic. (the notable exceptions were Fransisco and Olga who were both very helpful)",4,2014,09,17
11,"Great staff, great location, great hotel","Awesome location close to a variety of neighborhoods and only a short walk to La Rambla and everything Barcelona has to offer. 

We had an awesome experience as we were upgraded when we arrived and shortly after we settled in the staff brought a nice bottle of Cava. We look forward to staying here again the next time we are in Barcelona!",5,2014,09,16
11,A City Gem,"This hotel is located in the best and most convenient part of Barcelona. Passeig de Gracia is just where you want to be for all the Gaudi  exhibits and much of the sightseeing. It is a lovely part of the city, interesting and full of energy. Great shopping as well. La Rambla is nearby and not to be missed.
  The hotel provides great service at the front desk and is very comfortable. You do not need a room directly on the main street; in fact, side rooms are quieter and have lovely views of he city as do some of the rooms in back. We loved the roof top for drinks but did not partake of the small pool but many did.  Breakfasts were very complete but rather pricey at 29 eu a person. Try to get the breakfast included in the room rate if possible. 
 We were there 5 nights and booked three rooms for our party and were pleased with all of them. We tired of tapas and were directed to several wonderful restaurants by the staff who made reservations at all of them for us.. They also confirmed our flight reservations which is essential as the flights from Barcelona are often overbooked. Ours was.
  We were happy with our stay at Majestic. The Majestic is rather expensive as hotels go but well worth the cost in our view. Highly recommended.",5,2014,09,16
11,Great place to stay,"We stayed here for 3 days following a cruise. The hotel is centrally located in the heart of the upscale portion of Barcelona and within easy walking distance from Placa de Catalunya and Las Ramblas as well as several Gaudi structures. The staff were pleasant and helpful. The food was excellent.  The only con was that our room faced an opposing wall so we had no view at all, but that's the luck of the draw. The hotel's not cheap, but it is an upper tier establishment so expect to pay for that level of service and location. Would certainly stay here again.",5,2014,09,16
11,Very nice hotel in a great location,"This wonderful hotel provides all the comforts and amenities that one associates with a true five star hotel.   After having stayed twice, in two different executive rooms, I can attest that rooms are beautifully appointed, (see photos) extremely quiet, and comfortable.   The public areas, including the gym, lobby bar and especially the roof top terrance/pool are superb.  I found the staff here both friendly and helpful.  

The hotel is centrally located and within walking distance to major metro-rail links, some of the best restaurants in Barcelona, and major tourist sites such as La Rambla, and the Barri Gotic.  Four Gaudi masterpieces, including La Sangrada Familia, are within walking distance.   

I would gladly stay here again!
",5,2014,09,13
11,A Great Hotel in the Best Location,"My wife and I just stayed a week in the Hotel Majestic and enjoyed it very much. We stayed in Room 731, which had a partial view of the street, with a door leading to a small balcony on the façade of the hotel. There were two single beds side by side. The beds were very comfortable. Each bed had two pillows, a large one and a smaller one. The headboard was made of black leather. On each side of the combined bed there were two wall mounted lamps, one of them for reading. There was a small table on each side of the bed.

The room had a wall to wall carpet with a gray color. The room was decorated with a striped wallpaper and one side of the room had blackout drapes with a similar design of stripes. There was a black classical desk with convenient electrical outlets over it. Beside the desk was an upholstered chair covered with a grey fabric. Over the desk were two wall lamps. There was also a large Samsung flat TV set over the desk and the TV had many international TV stations. At one corner of the room were two upholstered arm chairs with a grey color. There was a small round wooden table beside these chairs.

The bathroom had a toilet, a sink and a large walk-in shower. The bathroom was clad with grey marble, making it elegant. However the marble could also have been ceramic tile that simulated marble. Nowadays one cannot tell the difference. The shower had a hand held shower and also a very good rain shower. There were two closets for clothes and these had many hangers. One of the closets had a full length mirror. A third closet had the minibar.

The room was quite large and comfortable. There was no noise at all from the street and we could sleep well in the room. We were very satisfied with the room. 

Beside the elevators were large spaces with side tables that had two large Chinese vases, with blue and white designs. These vases were quite beautiful and elegant. Another place had a large Chinese dish with a beautiful design.

The El Patio Restaurant was where the breakfast buffet was served. This was a large salon adjacent to the garden, with plenty of greenery. The salon was light colored and the columns were faced with mirrors,  that made the room quite elegant. There were two side rooms where the food was kept. At one corner there were two cooks, making the fried eggs or omelets that the customers wanted. There was a very wide variety of food and bread, fruits (especially strawberries), and pastries. A very special pastry was the pistachio torte that was topped with strawberries. This was very delicious and a cook told me that this was a special recipe invented at the hotel. There were many waiters and waitresses who were very attentive and gave very good service. There was also cava for those who wanted it. At the entrance desk there were many Spanish and English language newspapers. This was one of the best breakfast buffets I have experienced in Spain and Europe.  

There was a rooftop terrace with a very small pool. There were very comfortable chairs and tables on the terrace where one could order food and drinks. The views from the terrace were very impressive. On one side you could see the outline of the Sagrada Familia Basilica.  

The staff of the hotel impressed me because they were very friendly, attentive and helpful. All of them had smiles on their faces. You could see that they were all very well trained. I did not see any grumpy person on the staff. All of the staff wanted us to have a good time at the hotel. I think this factor is the most important for me when I judge the quality of the hotel I stay in. All of them were dressed in black uniforms. All the staff spoke English. There were several young people from other countries who were trainees, and they were all pleasant to talk to. 

The hotel is located at the Passeig de Gracia, the most sophisticated street in the city, with many fashionable stores nearby. The street is the 5th Avenue of Barcelona. This is the best area to stay in Barcelona and it is the reason I chose this hotel. It is completely safe and one can walk to the Plaza de Catalunya, which is downtown. The side streets are filled with small and interesting boutiques. The street also has many of the important modernist buildings that the city is famous for. Among them are Gaudi’sLa Pedrera and Casa Batllo. Near the hotel is the Casa Lleo Morera (Passeig de Gracia, 35), which has recently been opened to the public. This building is one of the masterpieces of Lluis Domenech i Montaner, and I urge readers to see it. 

I have two other places to recommend to readers. One of them is Enric Rosich Macarons, located at the small Bulevard Rosa mall (Passeig de Gracia, 53), which is across the street from the hotel. The store has the best macarons in Spain! The best buy is the box containing 24 macarons with many varieties, and this costs 30 euros. I am a macaron fan and buy them everywhere I find them. I was recently in Paris and bought boxes from three famous brands. I have to say that the macarons from Enric Rosich are better!

The last place I recommend is a tapas restaurant located about three blocks from the hotel. It is the Cerveseria Catalana (Calle Mallorca, 236). This restaurant is famous for its tapas and the service is very good. It is not expensive and we paid about 40 euros for two persons. The place was so good that we went back a second time to try the other tapas we had not tried. 

In conclusion, I will definitely stay again in this hotel on my next trip to Barcelona.",5,2014,09,12
11,A gem in a small package.,"I was skeptical at first with a four hour wait for a small room that was right next to the elevator. The room was clean and quiet. The bed was excellent! I don't sleep well away from home but did very well here. If you plan to spend a lot of time in your room this might not be for you but a spacious lobby, excellent breakfast service,  friendly accomodating staff and great location more than makes up for less square footage surrounding the bed.",4,2014,09,10
11,Great Hotel in a Good Location,The hotel was very well appointed and suited to both the business traveler and holiday traveler alike. The service was excellent and the front desk staff were very helpful. The location of the hotel allows a short stroll down to the Rambles and the many restaurants in that part of Barcelona.,4,2014,09,10
11,Fabulous hotel and service!,"I stayed here for three days in September before leaving on a cruise. The room and amenities were superb and the bed was super comfortable. I have been to many 5 star hotels and I can say that the employees here make this one of the best hotels that I have ever stayed at! Everyone is always very friendly and helpful and they all seem to be able to converse in multiple languages. Even when I had a problem that was my fault, the manager Juanjo was so courteous and amenable in getting everything fixed to my benefit. I could not be more pleased and would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to be well located in the city who wants a fabulous experience!",5,2014,09,10
11,Excellent location and excellent service,My wife and I stayed in Majestic Hotel 4 days in September 2014. The hotel is in fantastic location. Staff is very friendly and service is excellent. We were very happy and felt very welcomed. We recommend to everybody.,5,2014,09,06
11,"Nice hotel, cruise ship crowds","Hotel Majestic is a very nice hotel, but could definitely use an update.  Hotel is in a very good location, lots of restaurants and shopping nearby and walk to many sites.  Best thing about this hotel is its staff.  Very warm, friendly and efficient.  The biggest drawback to this hotel is that it is a cruise ship hotel so each day the lobby is filled with bus loads of cruisers.  At these times, there are lines 15 people deep for front desk or concierge help and it is very difficult to move through the lobby, but the attentive staff made sure to post several people in strategic places throughout the lobby to either assist the non cruiser or escort us through the lobby.  Also, if you stay at his hotel, be sure to visit the spa.  Although the spa is very small, I had the best facial ever!  The buffet breakfast was included in our rate and it was amazing!",4,2014,09,05
11,This is a great Hotel in a Great Location,We arrive at this beautiful property a little early and went around the corner to an exceptional wine bar for lunch.  After lunch we went and checked into our room.  Every thing about the room was perfect.  The bathroom was large and the towels and linens were what you would expect at a five star hotel.  The room was very quiet at night.  The daily breakfast was like Easter Sunday Brunch! The location was great.  The best part of Barcelona was right outside your door.  We walked everywhere.  If you want to stay at a truly great hotel this is your spot.,5,2014,09,03
11,5 Star experience,"Having two months ago stayed in the Mandarin Orient a hundred yards down the passéo de Gracia (see poor review) we chose this hotel having walked past it and vowed to stay here on our next visit. We were not disappointed at all.  Even though we could only book a junior suite as the double rooms were all fully booked. Our suite was decorated to a very high standard with quality fixtures and fittings, products and Egyptian cotton sheets, together with a welcome bottle of wine, biscuits and cheese. The reception staff and concierge were enormously helpful and provided us with two great restaurant recommendations. If you want a high end experience in the top location in Barcelona, then look no further.",5,2014,09,03
11,Genuine 5* quality,"My wife and I stayed here over the August bank holiday weekend. The hotel is superb in every way. A genuine 5 * hotel in a great central location with discreet but attentive staff. We had a executive double room which was spotless and clean. This was a good size room with all the facilities you would expect at such an establishment. The rooftop pool is only small but provides a welcome respite after a days sight seeing. Drinks and food were beautifully presented and served. This is by no means a cheap hotel but like many things in life, you get what you pay for. We would definitely return.",5,2014,09,02
11,Very nice,"I was responsible for picking a hotel for my group of friends for our trip. I picked this hotel based on a few things: location, luxury, amenities, and its reviews.
First, it's in a great spot. It's convenient to all the major attractions because it's centrally located. That said, it's not like you can step out the door to a breathtaking view. It's very much in the heart of the luxury boutiques. If you're a gay traveler, it's VERY convenient to all the night spots.
Second, it's very, very luxurious. The bathroom was like nothing I've ever seen. Our room was plush and comfortable, and completely silent. You'll be very comfortable.
Third, the amenities are great--for a price, though. Everything you see costs money. Even the coffee in the room will appear on your bill if you make yourself a cup. The rooftop lounge has an unbeatable view, first-class service and delicious treats, which was all worth it, but nothing up there is cheap. Nothing.
Last, the reviews are mostly honest I'd say. Some people seem upset by the front desk staff, but I'd chalk that up to people being difficult. We dealt with many front desk staff, and all of them were perfectly reasonable and very helpful. 
Overall we were very impressed and I'd gladly book here again.
One last tip: There's a great little coffee shop across Career de Valencia which is awesome for breakfast. We ate there every morning and truthfully, it was nicer to eat there than in the hotel since you can sit outside and take it all in.",5,2014,09,01
11,Perfect location,"We stayed at The Majestic for 2 nights prior to our cruise in August, and it was the perfect place for us.
It has totally been redone, and the rooms are immaculate, charming, although ours was a bit small. 
The location was perfect for exploring Barcelona....we even walked 15 minutes to the Sagrada Familia!! 
Definitely worth staying at The Majestic!",5,2014,08,31
11,Great hotel!,"This hotel was beautiful, luxurious and perfectly located. Walking distance from mostly everything you want to see. The staff was helpful and courteous. The rooms were big and comfortable. A perfect hotel for a trip to Barcelona. I would definitely go back! ",5,2014,08,29
11,Very nice but not amazing.,"I had very high expectations based on prior reviews, and the reality did not quite match.  Although most of the staff I encountered during our three day stay were relatively nice, several were not particularly friendly and a couple were not helpful at all.  Our experience at check in was particularly frustrating.  We arrived a little early and our room wasn't ready.  It turned out to be a 3+ hour wait. The guy initially working with us was not helpful at all, and he seemed quite put out when we checked back a couple of times as to status, and he would not provide any meaningful information.  (It was unclear why there was such a hold up with our room, when we could see that people arriving after us were able to get rooms.). Also, he was quite dismissive when I attempted to confirm the details of our room configuration.  Finally, I approached a different desk person when he stepped away.  It was night and day. She was very welcoming and attentive, and she was able to immediately identify an available room that met our needs.

Hotel location was great. Concierge had fantastic restaurant recommendations and was great at handling reservations.

11,LOVED!!!,I loved everything about this hotel. Our room had a private balcony with couch and lounge chairs. The bathroom was large and clean. The shower was one of the best I've ever had! I would stay here again in a heartbeat!!!!!,5,2014,08,27
11,WOW ! Amazing hotel and Service,"The Service there is really amazing. Everybody is smiling and people are really  well taking care of us
I Especially enjoyed the bar at the 10th floor. This is the Most beautiful view i ever had in my Life. i had a signature cocktail the majestic which was really tasty. our. Server Max was very professional and very Nice.
I hardly reccomend this Hotel to make your trip unforgettable. 
One more Time thank you !",5,2014,08,27
11,Small room,This hotel is in an excellent location. It is within walking distance of most of the attractions in Barcelona. The roof top bar has panoramic views and is a nice place to relax at the end of the day.  However the room I stayed in was very small with only a few feet surrounding the bed and not enough space to put a second suitcase.,3,2014,08,27
11,Better than  best,What a great place and great location. The roof bar is a must.  We had a family apartment.  It was across the road from the main hotel but nothing else was lost.  The apartment was a lovely size. 2 bedrooms and bathrooms a lounge and kitchen with all the mod cons.  We will definitely be returning.  A truly unique place in one of my favourite cities. ,5,2014,08,26
11,FULL OF CHARM,"this hotel is simply amazing.
I highly recomend it for those looking towards luxe and personal attention and wondering to be in the most beautiful avenue in Barcelona.
If i come back to Barcelona I will be back to the Majestic.",5,2014,08,25
11,A great location and excellent staff,Location couldn't be better- right in the heart of Barcelona and walking distance from most anything. There are tons of tapas choices within minutes. Staff is excellent and takes wonderful care of its guests. Don't miss the rooftop bar!,5,2014,08,24
11,A wonderful stay,"The hotel was beautiful with excellent accommodations and attentive staff. Its location was perfect.   A special thanks to Guest Relations Manager Francisco Camello who cheerfully and graciously helped move us to a quiet room away from the noise of hotel renovations, made dinner reservations for us at wonderful restaurants, and helped us find tickets to the Picasso Museum.  We appreciated the help of Carlos, a bell-hop, who ensured that the the move from one room to the next was made quickly and smoothly.",5,2014,08,22
11,Location,"Well located,in a respectable area,the hotel offers a lot of benefits.
Obviously price are  a bit high for the summer season,,but it is worth it.
SPA facilities are perfect.
The only proble is the check in and check out,very,very slow!",5,2014,08,20
11,Great Hotel,"This was a great hotel for our family trip to Barcelona. The rooftop deck was incredible and a great way to start your visit to this city.  All Majestic employees were helpful and courteous.  Our room was right on Paseo de Gracia which made it nice to view from an open window but when you closed the window, most noise from the street was eliminated.  Beds were comfortable and bath was spacious and nice.  The cost was high but I believe worth every penny.  When I return to Barcelona, I will be coming back to the Majestic.",5,2014,08,19
11,Location and Luxury,"Fantastic location on the Passaig de Gracia in between the two Gaudi houses.  Modern, well-run comfortable hotel.  Incredible rooftop bar and pool area with a full city panoramic view.  Helpful concierges, service all over. Lots of good restaurant choices within walking distance. Highly recommended in all respects.",5,2014,08,17
11,"""Majestic"" Majestic Hotel","It is an elegant European Hotel centrally located, yet away from all the buzz and fuzz of a Tourists Barcelona. You can always take a taxi to visit the major attractions and the ""hot spots"" then, return to an enclave of peace and luxury. Beautiful rooms filled flowers all around, white marble bathrooms, crisp linens, fluffy towels and bathrobes allows you to relax after visiting all the ""must see"" sites.
Major Gaudi buildings are steps away. The Sagrada Familia Church, an absolute must to visit, is a mere 15 min walk. 
Fabulous tapas bars filled with young locals, just a block or two away.
We loved the hotel and will definitely stay there again.",5,2014,08,15
11,rooftop view!!,"O haven't stayed in the hotel, but i have been with my friends on the rooftop of it, which is open for everyone. 
The prices are quite high, but the view is worth the money. They have a pool as well, which anyone can use. Is better to go there at the dawn:) ",4,2014,08,12
11,Good hotel ,"Perfect location, Gaudi house as front windows view, nice breakfast, cozy gym, good roof terrace,  nothing else to ask for during your trip to Barcelona :) service was also good, consierje job is quite quick.  I recommend this hotel ",5,2014,08,12
11,"Location, location, location!!!","We stayed for 5 nights in this hotel during our recent visit to Barcelona.  The hotel is centrally located on Passeig de gracia and met all our expectations. The ambience was great, service was excellent, the conceirge was very helpful with good meal recommendations in the neighborhood. They also helped us with booking a car for a day trip to Girona. The deluxe room was quite spacious. They have a Nespresso machine in the room, which is great for morning coffee (although they charge for the coffeepods, which is quite surprising for such  an elegant hotel). The rooftop, although sounded romantic, was quite underwhelming when we went to relax and get some overpriced drinks in the evening, and we didn't find the views to be impressive!  However, despite these small negatives, overall our experience was good and so would recommend it to others!",4,2014,08,11
11,Great Hotel,"Had a lovely time in this hotel, the location is absolutely perfect. The rooms were nice if a little small & we had 2 single beds pushed together with double sheets even though I had requested a double room, however t was always spotless. The rooftop terrace is wonderful with the most impressive views over Barcelona. I would definitely return to this hotel.",5,2014,08,11
11,One of the best Hotels in Barcelona,The entire hotel is of timeless elegance. Our spacious room was thoroughly well-conditioned and clean and the beds were very comfortable. The staff was always very kind and helpful. The hotel is well-located regarding any trip to the old town of Barcelona. I can highly recommend the rooftop terrace of the hotel; especially by night.,5,2014,08,10
11,Top of the Top!,"In a few words, the hotel Majestic is the Top Of the Top! I stayed for 2 nights after a Mediterranean cruise, in this elegant and stylishly appointed hotel, located in the ultra-chic Paseo de Gracia . From the moment we stepped out of the Limo, the hotel staff was there to make us feel special, and took care of our every need. The bar staff was always gracious and the Restaurant served a colorful and delicious daily gourmet breakfast, like I have never experienced before!!! As well, the guest room was very comfortable and beautifully designed.. And may I say, the bed was amazingly comfortable! The spacious marble bathroom was wonderful, complete with an oversized bathtub and rain shower. I always felt safe and loved the neighborhoods' chic boutiques and sidewalk cafes. I will surely stay there again, the next time I am lucky enough to visit Barcelona!",5,2014,08,09
11,A majestic hotel,"Superb location, very comfortable rooms, excellent staff and service. The terrace is a great place to enjoy at dusk with a wonderful 360 vista of the city. The pool on the terrace was smaller than expected but that aside it was a top hotel.",5,2014,08,08
11,Fantastic Hotel in Barcelona,This was our second stay at this wonderful Hotel in Barcelona. Fantastic service. Our suite was not ready upon arrival so they did all they could to accomodate us while we waited. We booked through American Express Plantinum Concierge Travel service and received a room upgrade--had a very nice view of the Passieg de Gracie and euros towards our spa treatment. The spa treatment was worth half a million euros. Mireya did a wonderful job--probably the best massage I have ever had!!! You will truly enjoy the stay at this hotel. The breakfast is definitely worth every penny(ours was included--another American Express perk). The Terrace Patio is wonderful in that you have beautiful views of the city.,5,2014,08,07
11,Beautiful Majestic Hotel,"This was my second stay at the hotel which was just amazing. I loved it 5 years ago but loved it even more as there have been some improvements to the front of house, the pool and bar area and the bedrooms. It is very clean, tidy, with the most comfortable hotel bed ever and exceptional service by all the staff that I met, it totalled up to being the perfect stay. Even silly things like not having to wait ages for lifts was brilliant. It is a beautiful hotel with some amazing staircases which are worth wandering up or down! I chose to stay here as its location is perfect. You can easily get to the underground which is very straight forward and easy to use or the bus stops for the bus touristic are very close too.  The area feels very safe and as I went with my teenage daughter that was very important to me. It is full of top branded stores which is very nice to wander around early evening. The hotel Wifi is free but a little hit and miss at certain times of the day which left my teenage daughter feeling frustrated at times but like I said its free so cant really complain.  I chose not to use the dining facilities as I wanted to make the most of my time in Barcelona, but I heard comments from other people staying there that is was lovely.  The roof terrace bar and pool area is perfect, early morning its empty but as the day goes on it gets busier and in the evening it has an amazing buzz and the most beautiful views of the city both day and night.  It helps you to get your bearings of the city. On my departure I received a lovely little gift for completing the hotel survey which was nice.  The concierge were also really helpful when my transportation to the airport didn't arrive and they contacted the company I had chosen to use and got it sorted quickly.  All in all it certainly lives up to its 5 star rating and I will most certainly be returning (hopefully very soon!!). As i wandered around Barcelona i didn't see anywhere else i would have rather stayed.  It really is just perfect.",5,2014,08,07
11,"Fantastic, will-return stay","The Majestic is a marvellous hotel we would recommend to anyone going to Barcelona. Hotel is spacious (we travelled with 2 infants and two baby cribs easily fit in a standard Deluxe room), staff is absolutely awesome, friendly and great at what they do. Breakfast has its own chapter - we have seen a lot of breakfast buffets all over the world and this is among top 3 (if not #1). Location is great and nothing beats sitting on the hotel's roof top terrace over viewing historic Barcelona, including direct view to Sagrada Familia. Pool is small and does not work for swimming but works fine if you just need a quick cool off. This is where we will stay next time in Barcelona, that's for sure.",5,2014,08,06
11,Barcelona Family Fun,"Hotel Majestic in Barcelona is in a great location. We enjoyed our stay very much. The beds are comfortable, and the hotel staff are most accommodating! They even sent me a bottle of champagne and lovely birthday cake when they realized it was my birthday!

Wifi is spotty at this hotel.",5,2014,08,06
11,Excellent stay,"We stayed for two nights and had three rooms.  The rooms are in excellent condition and the beds are very comfortable.  Bulgari provides the toiletries.

The service was of the highest order.  The bellman and valets were professional and readily available.

Check in was efficient and pleasant.  Fernando, the concierge, was knowledgeable and could not be more helpful.

We ate snacks and drank wine on the rooftop terrace.  I highly recommend a visit as the views must be the best in Barcelona.  It was a great way to unwind after an overnight flight.  It was a perfect way to start our visit.",5,2014,08,05
11,wonderful celebration of ours 50 years wedding,"After  a 7 days cruise on the Mediterranean we made the check-in at 09.00pm and our room was already prepared. The room was excelent and we enjoyed it very much.Concierge and staff on reception was great.
We would like to came back , and we will recomend the Majestic to our friends-",5,2014,08,05
11,Great location in Barcelona!,"We stayed here after a 7 day cruise on the Mediterranean.... We arrived at the hotel at 8:30 am and they had a room ready for us by 9 AM.  The room was very clean, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was spacious... The terrace was beautiful at night.  We would stay here again if we return to Barcelona.  

Our only issue was the gentleman employed by the hotel who greeted us when the taxi pulled up.  The taxi driver ripped us off - we realized that 5 minutes into our trip b/c he was heading in the wrong direction.  Well, the driver charged us 25 Euros from the port to the hotel (way too much) and when we gave him 40 Euros and requested change, the gentleman from the hotel blocked us from getting to the driver for our change.  We practically had to push him out of the way.  They definitely work together against the tourists... That being said, this was our only bad experience in all of Spain and Italy...",5,2014,08,03
11,Stunning!,One of the best hotels in Europe !we stayed 3 nights. Travelled with our 3 boys. 2 spacious rooms. Immaculate. Decor is timeless elegance. Location is perfect.some say pricey but compared to 5 star in US it is reasonable.stunning views from rooftop pool.Everything you want on a luxury hotel.,5,2014,08,03
11,Best ever,"Fantastic.  Our room had a Juliet balcony large bathroom, and the most comfortable bed.  Not enough words to describe what a ""majestic"" stay we had.  From breakfast to drinks on the roof top everything was perfect.  ",5,2014,07,31
11,"Fantastic hotel, but pricey!","Loved staying in this hotel. We were fortunate enough to stay here when we booked a two day pre-cruise tour which turned into four days when the ship was not ready. Being part of a cruise tour, the price was great, but if we had stayed on our own, I am afraid that we would not be able to afford it.
Our room was super luxurious and we even had a tiny balcony, which is plenty when you just want to get a good view of life on Passeig de Gracia. Have I mentioned before that Passeig de Gracia is one of my favorite streets to date? 
The service was impeccable. When you arrive, there are fabulously dressed men waiting to open the doors for you and to take your luggage. Felt so rich. :)
We stayed in November when it was too cold to swim, but we visited the rooftop pool several times to look at the view. Seems as if you could see for miles.
If I could afford it, I would probably stay here every time I visit Barcelona, but alas, my lottery tickets have not come through for me .... yet!
Don't hesitate to stay here.
I stayed here a lot earlier than what it will allow me to choose, but it is still just as wonderful.",5,2014,07,31
11,The rooftop bar makes it!!!,"The people here are gracious, friendly and incredibly helpful.  The doormen, client services, concierge, wait staff, housekeeping, did I forget anyone?  Perfection!!!!  Stellar all-around.  That being said, the rooftop bar/pool is the best kept secret in Barcelona.  If you are hitting most of the touristy spots this may be a little further away than El Palace or other hotels but the people and the rooftop make up for it.  You may do a little more walking, but then you can treat yourself to the yummy food and cocktails on the rooftop.  One thing....  If you are on the 8th floor with a view, it is a dormer size window.  But still a nice view.  You may want to request the 7th  floor.  Don't hesitate.  Book it!!!!!",5,2014,07,30
11,Wonderful stay !,"We were a large family group and stayed for 3 nights before setting on a cruise from Barcelona. First of all, location, location, location! what a great area to enjoy Barcelona on foot. There is so much to see nearby ( Casa Mila, Casa Batllo by Gaudi) are only a few blocks away. Paseo de Gracia is a lively and elegant avenue full of nice shops and restaurants. On to the hotel itself, service was outstanding. From the moment you arrive, there is a doorman promptly ushering you inside ( I noticed he had a mic connecting with the hotel staff inside and requiring help with luggage, and monitoring the busy lobby, and also offering directions and even watching people walking by so that the guests were not bothered in any way). The only downside I could mention would be the breakfast area. The selection of food is impecable, but it is very crowded and the room is rather small.  I found this to be somewhat annoying since I prefer to have breakfast in a more relaxed setting. Overall, the hotel is great and we would certainly stay here in the future.",5,2014,07,30
11,Majestic hotel Barcelona,"This is a very well run operation with great personnel, it has that ""x"" factor - I'm a business owner with multiple locations and hundreds of employees, we've had the privilege of staying in the best hotels all over the world, so to impress me you have to be good, and these people truly are.  Every last person was competent, sincerely interested in our needs, and polite without pandering. For example, we never saw the cleaning staff but on our second day they carefully folded and arranged all of our two year old's clothing and diapers we had scattered around the room.

The property was remodeled in 2012 which shows, it is fresh, well maintained and sophisticated with a very good art collection.  The room size is very generous, we had a Junior suite which was perfect for closing off our toddler at night.  The breakfast buffet is extroidinay albeit not cheap.  The only points off would be a very small roof top pool if you have older kids to amuse but that is otherwise offset by a great view of the city from the roof.

The location is 20 minutes from the airport, door to door, and at the epicenter of the high end shopping district and pretty central to all the major attractions from what I could tell, two great Gaudi building within two blocks to start with.   Enjoy!",5,2014,07,29
11,"A 5 star, but not an amazing 5 star","Good location in a more ""quiet"" and nice area with all the brand stores really close. Chanel and more is in the same building. 

Nice welcome and very nice staff over all. 

The lobby and the lounge and bar area is very nice. So is the roof terrase with the bar, pool and beautiful view. The rooms feels a bit ""old"". There are often compensations like if you have a balcony, the room is smaller and if you have a larger room, there is no balcony. Larger bathroom has bathtub and no seperat shower. Smaller bathroom has only shower. I am sure there are suites and the best rooms that has both. We stayed in both the seventh and eight floor, both in upgraded rooms that were like this. I personally don't prefer to shower in bathtubs. So if you want something spesific, make sure to ask for it when you make the booking. The cleaning staff of the rooms are very polite and friendly, and the cleaning of the rooms are good. The roomservice is also very good. Very serviceminded people there too. 

The elevators are few, small and runs slow. Around breakfast, during checkout and by dinner time in the evening, you often have to wait a long time for the elevater. I often took the stairs even though we stayed on the eight floor during some of the time.

There is often a line waiting to be served at the reseption. Mostly during checkout, but also because the people staying there have questions and needs help and guidance with different things. There should be one seperat desk with at least two people just for information during the busyest times. And one seperate place for checking in and out. 

I find the Hotel a ""commercial"" 5 star hotel. By that meaning that it is large, typical american (not the pitoresque and charming type), there are many families with children which causes more noise both around the rooms and at breakfast. If you have a ""later breakfast"", there are not so many families with younger children. 

There could be a seperate area or floor with rooms for families with children so that the rooms next to them would be more tolerant and patient regarding noice etc. 

The breakfast area has a little ""cold"" atmosphere. I think this is because you have no view and there is no light or morning sun coming in from outside. It actually looks like there is bad weather outside when you look to the windows. The breakfast is on the 1st floor, so I am not sure why it's like this. The breakfast buffe is very nice. I missed vegetables like tomatoes, salad, carrot, paprika and quecomber. There are fruit, but other than that there are only warm food, bread and pastries. The staff and service at breakfast is very nice.

I used the gym in the basement several times. It's very nice and clean. Enough and good equipment, very fresh toilet and shower facilities and always fruit, towels, headphones available. 
",4,2014,07,28
11,"Nice, but pretentious","This hotel is in a great location that is far enough from Las Ramblas that is peaceful, but is within walking distance to shopping and the Barrio Gothic.

The building itself is beautiful and our room was very tasteful.  By American standards, it is on par with a Four Seasons. I would really like to know who does the interior design for this property because everything was modern, but had an easy elegance that is hard to achieve. I could not have been happier with my room and the ambiance.

There is a rooftop bar and pool area that is very chic and a great spot to see the skyline of Barcelona. I would recommend going upstairs just for the pictures.

The service was good, but some of the guests seemed to think they were pseudo-celebrities with the way that they walked around the place with a sense of entitlement. I am not enamored with those who think that highly of themselves and it seemed to me like there was a high concentration of these types at this hotel. If you like a hotel that is the place to ""see and be seen"" this is for you.

There was a minibar and nespresso machine in the room, which were both really nice touches.",4,2014,07,26
11,"5 star Service, Quality and Location","The family of 4 spent 3 nights at the Majestic and we were all very pleased with the service, quality and location of the hotel. In particular the service is of really high and proffesional quality. 
Rooms as spacious and clean and one reason for chosing the Majestic was that we could get the whole family in one room - not many European city hotels do this. 
I also have to mention the rooftop pool/bar. From here you have a very good view of large parts of Barcelona. After a long and hot day in the city it's really nice to return to the hotel, get up to the rooftop bar for a drink and a cooling bath overlooking the city. 
Highly recommended. ",5,2014,07,26
11,Finally Found Excellent Hotel in Barcelona,"Before I stayed at the Majestic, I had concluded that Barcelona had no true 5 star hotels.  The Majestic is beautiful and clean, the location is perfect in a safe part of town surrounded by exceptional shopping (we even felt safe walking in this neighborhood after dark), and the staff is very friendly and accommodating. My room was not what I would consider large but it was certainly larger than most European hotel rooms.  The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable.  The housekeeping staff was very friendly and helpful -- even giving us extra chocolates when we told them how much we loved their chocolates.  We had a spacious closet with a safe and a mini bar/refrigerator.  The bathroom was well appointed and beautiful in white marble. My only complaint was the safety bar in the tub was loose but I failed to report it to the staff and should have brought it to their attention to prevent a possible fall in the tub/shower. The breakfast buffet was included with my room and it was delicious. I found almond cookies on the buffet that were fantastic and I wish I had the recipe.  I also found strawberry juice which was delicious, as well as Cava on ice.  When I experimented with a mix of the strawberry juice and Cava, I discovered a wonderful new drink that I will definitely try making at home.
If I am fortunate enough to return to Barcelona in the future, the Majestic is the only hotel I will consider.",5,2014,07,24
11,Wow!,"This location is about the best anyone could ask for.  Right on the heart of Paseo de Gracia shopping district and within walking distance of a million small shops and store chains, eateries, bars and so many things to do.  All the action in Barcelona is right here within a mile of every direction of this hotel.  The hotel is very nice, clean, huge rooms and such nice bathrooms, well maintained.  I am very sure the hotel is quite old but kept in pristine condition as it appears to be some kind of historic building of some sort.  But it has been here a long time.  Not a better place to park while in Barcelona for shopping or touring.",5,2014,07,24
11,LOVED it!,"What's not to love about the Majestic Hotel? Besides the convenient location on the fashionable Paseo de Gracia, the hotel is beautiful and elegant.  It's always the little things that matter while traveling and the Majestic makes sure it is five star on all levels.  

Besides the spacious rooms with a lovely balcony view; the beautiful top floor spa, cool bar area and the lavish, fresh breakfast buffet which has something for everybody (plus some)...the Majestic has Ingrid in Guest Relations who made our trip to Barcelona even more amazing and memorable.  She is THE best ever. Thank you, Ingrid, for ALL of your suggestions...from the fabulous restaurant choices to helping us navigate our day trips, please come visit us while in California :-)  Thank you also for our anniversary surprise. You truly helped make our trip so special.  

Another thank you to Eugenia in the restaurant.  She is such an asset to the hotel...and one of the most professional and delightful servers ever! I am forever hooked on carrot juice!

We are already planning another trip to Spain...and will certainly recommend and stay at the Majestic again...and again!",5,2014,07,22
11,Right in the heart of a shoppers paradise!,"The hotel was beautiful. The rooftop lounge/pool was an amazing place for viewing the entire city and landscape, taking pictures, having a glass of wine and relaxing. This was definitely the highlight of staying here! Rooms were smaller than I expected, but still nice!",5,2014,07,22
11,In the midst of everything!,"The Majestic was a very clean, convenient hotel. It is right on one of the main streets running through the middle of Barcelona. It is walking distance to Las Ramblas, the Sagrada Familia, shopping and so much more. The staff were very helpful and accommodating. It is always bustling with people coming and going but there are always plenty of staff to help. The rooftop terrace has a very small pool. Not a favorite for the kids but great for lounging and having drinks during the day. At nighttime there is a DJ playing a variety of music, drinks and a remarkable view all around Barcelona. My husband and I enjoyed having a drink there in the evening. We also ate at the rooftop terrace for late afternoon tapas and enjoyed. It is not the place to get a meal but perfect for creative, tasty tapas. I definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling through Barcelona!",4,2014,07,22
11,Best location,"Wonderful experience. The location, the staff, the rooms, the atmosphere, all add up to a great stay. 
Important landmarks such as the Gaudí houses are within walking distance. The concierges are very helpful in guiding you.
There are also very good restaurants and cafés around.
I highly recommend it!",5,2014,07,22
11,"Great Hotel, but...","Excellent Hotel with fabulous rooftop bar and lovely rooms. Only 2 issues:- 
1. our standard ""double"" was a twin pushed together, which quite often moved apart. 
2. From the floor plans, only the suites have external windows that look out onto the street, our window looked out into a 2m square ventilation shaft with 4  windows per floor looking in, so the drapes had to remain closed with air con on, which made this lovely room feel a little claustrophobic and dark.
I guess if you can afford a larger room it would be perfect",5,2014,07,22
11,Excellent Hotel in Great Location!,"Our family of six spent two nights at this hotel in June. The rooms were well designed, decorated, and clean. Considering the age of the hotel, I was surprised by the larger size bath area not to mention strong water pressure from the shower which has been a rarity on my travels through Europe over the years. The hotel staff was both friendly and professional. The food was also very good. They offer an outstanding breakfast buffet each morning which was also popular with the family. The roof-top bar/ restaurant with swimming pool offered amazing views of Barcelona and surrounding areas. We were tempted to go with the Mandarin Oriental hotel because of brand familiarity but I am really pleased that we choose the Majestic as it offers its own, unique, five star experience. My only gripe would be with the business office where the computers for guest use were incredibly slow along with inoperable printer. I had to have the front-desk print our boarding passes. All in all, however, I would highly recommend this hotel as everything else more than compensated for the business office nuisance.",5,2014,07,22
11,Great Hotel,"Fantastic hotel in a perfect location, the roof terrace/Pool is great in the evenings. The room service food was the best I've ever had!
The staff went out of their way to help you with anything you wanted, including reserving a table on the terrace if your a resident there. ",5,2014,07,22
11,Awesome!,"My husband and me come to Barcelona for 3 days escape from our kids and routine, just to have time for ourselves. 

From the very first moments in Majestic we enjoyed the very special atmosphere of the hotel. Located in the very center of Passage de Gracia, hotel is being a calm cool island of royal serenity.

All our inquires were addressed with a kind attention. Unbeatable views from the roof bar with menu specials, beautiful room, and, most of all, a team of delightful people who made our stay an ultimate success - that's all we would remember from that trip. We'll be back :-)!!
P.S. Special appreciation to Mary (front desk) who gifted our stay with so many precious hints and help. Thank you!!!

11,Wonderful hotel for our honeymoon!,"I wish there was some way to give the Majestic Hotel 6 or 7 stars instead of 5. I have traveled all over the United States and Europe, and this was easily the most wonderful hotel I've ever stayed in. The location, the staff and the hotel itself all far exceeded expectations. My wife and I stayed here on our honeymoon earlier this year, and everything was absolutely perfect! We had a lovely room overlooking the Passeig de Gracia. Every morning, we'd enjoy an espresso from our in-room Nespresso machine in our room's sitting room with the windows open. The hotel staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. We were greeted by a bottle of champagne and some cake to help us celebrate. And the concierge recommended a fantastic restaurant for paella. We enjoyed a very relaxing day at the spa. The hotel is very centrally located in the Eixample. Walking distance to Sagrada Familia, Las Ramblas, Casa Batio and a warren of lovely neighborhoods filled with beautiful buildings, tapas bars and high-end shopping. Perhaps our favorite part of the hotel, though, was the rooftop deck. Once we discovered it, we'd retreat here every day for an afternoon cocktail and snack while enjoying the spectacular views of every part of Barcelona. It was incredible!

We loved the Majestic Hotel and will surely be back! Thank you for helping us make our stay in Barcelona and our honeymoon so spectacular!",5,2014,07,21
11,Cannot Fault It,"We stayed at the Majestic Apartments and not the Hotel, but wow... Excellent.

Great rooms, great suites, very modern and clean.
Location was exceptional, right in the heart of the shopping district and not far - 15 min - 20 min walk to landmarks.

Cannot fault these Apartments.. 
Security is great...
Concierge was great
Service was great.",5,2014,07,21
11,Amazing,"We travel quite a bit and I would have to say this hotel was amazing! The linens were soft the room was clean, the ice buckets were always filled. Water and chocolate were always left by our bedside. This hotel has everything one could ask for. The soaps were especially wonderfully smelling. The staff seemed to go out of their way to help us. They were always smiling when we walked in the door, and acted like they knew us. I would stay here again and again! ",5,2014,07,20
11,First impressions count!!!!!Greeted by 3 staff before even getting to reception,"This is my first ever review but I think is worth reviewing. I only arrived today and as soon as the taxi stopped out the front and opened the boot a man was there to greet us. He got our bags before I could get them out, that's never happened before. As my wife and I walked towards the door the doorman said ""good afternoon Mr rowe"". I was shocked he new my name then after walking through the doors there was another employee standing there who also welcomed us to the hotel.

Once we got to reception at 1315, check in isn't until 1500, however we could still check in straight away, we received an upgrade with our own terrace on the 7th floor. By this stage I was amazed at the service and I've stayed in some pretty good hotels from Vegas, Berlin, Sydney you get my drift, then Carlos from concierge showed us all around the lobby, bars, gym & business center. He than took us up to our room and showed and explained everything in the room in detail. Normally hotels let you find your own way around or you have to ask. NOT THIS ONE!!!!!!! The spa was explained to me and the roof top area as well. Not long after this my bags arrived, none of them hung around awkwardly waiting for a tip so I gave them one. The hotel is centrally located with plenty of shops nearby. I'll make another post after my stay but based on this experience so far I would come here again.",5,2014,07,20
11,Excellent Location!,"Stayed in a suite in this majestic hotel. The suite was spacious and clean. Our room overlooked Passage de Gracias! 
The location of this hotel is excellent as it's just a stone's throw away from the famous attraction - Casa Batlo. 
Beach area is about 20 minutes walk from the hotel. And so is Sagrada Familia. 

Breakfast was a good continental spread with a live egg station. 
We stayed here for 5 nights but during weekends there was a long queue for breakfast as mentioned in other reviews too. Sometimes the waiting was as long as 30 minutes. Not acceptable for a 5 star hotel of this reputation.

Service staff were good and friendly. My 4 year old son was happy to receive colouring pack from the reception staff. We also received a nice welcome pack in our suite of a wine bottle and some local biscuits. 

Special mention of Mr Alvaro - guest relation manager - who went out of his way to make our stay more comfortable and enjoyable. 

Would surely stay here again if we visit Barcelona again. 

",5,2014,07,20
11,Great set up for family of four,"Excellent stay here last week with my wife and two teen daughters.  We stayed in a beautifully appointed corner suite with the girls in an adjacent room.   The nice part is that there was a separate third door to the hotel hallway.  Therefore, you could keep the outside door locked, while leaving the two interior doors open to move freely between the rooms.  Also kept the rooms very quiet at night from hall traffic.  A/C and bed were great.  A little shaky on the water temperature control in the shower but that would be my only complaint.  Staff and service was extremely professional as you should expect in a five star hotel.   The concierge was fantastic.  Total cost for three nights was about 1/2 of what it would have cost me at the mandarin oriental two blocks away. Happily spent my savings on wine.",5,2014,07,17
11,Great Hotel and Location,"A very nicely appointed room and hotel.  We arrived a day late due to a cancelled flight and they had a room with an upgrade waiting for us.  The service was excellent as were the location, the rooftop bar, and breakfast buffet.  The only drawback for us was the very busy checkin period when we arrived but later learned there was group from a cruise that were checking in as well.  We only wished we had arrived the day we were supposed to, having 2 nights there instead of one and we nearly rebooked from their sister hotel to stay there again on our return from the countryside.",5,2014,07,16
11,Great Service,"We stayed at the Majestic for 2 nights prior to a cruise and felt it was a great choice. Having never been to Barcelona we were unsure of where to stay, but found the Majestic to be just great. It is in a very upscale part of town within walking distance to many of the popular landmarks. The hotel is clean. The rooms are very comfortable and large by European standards. The rooftop pool was a great place to cool off, relax and have a drink overlooking the city. The staff really made the stay for us. They were very helpful in recommending and arranging tours, dinner reservations as well as transportation. Always friendly. We will go back.",5,2014,07,16
11,"Great Hotel, Great Location, Great Service","We stayed in one of the apartments for 4 days while my husband was attending a conference. The apartment was very comfortable, with everything we needed - loved the Nespresso machine and Nespresso coffee shop next block along. The location is fantastic - very central, close to good transport networks, shopping and interesting attractions. Staff are very helpful - they helped my husband get to & from his conference - made it so easy for him. Unfortunately I had my handbag stolen near the old part of town and after 2 hours at the police station, and with no money or phone, luckily I was able to walk back to the hotel, and a welcome sight it was too. It was so nice to return to a peaceful, gracious, retreat where I felt safe. The police found some of my belongings and returned it to the hotel and the guest relations staff were very helpful, arranging to have them sent back to me in England. I would definitely stay there again.",5,2014,07,16
11,The very best in every way,"Great service, location, and cleanliness. Near all attractions and fantastic restaurants. Great shopping in the area. Near all public transportation. I loved my stay for 2 nights and will be back again in the future. The concierge desk was most helpful with planing our sightseeing and dinners.",5,2014,07,15
11,Our stay at the Majestic Hotel,"The Majestic Hotel's staff made our trip that much more enjoyable.. Their professional and courteous team behind the desk was very attentive and helpful at all times.   Maria, helped us to plan our week, suggesting restaurants, day trips and making reservations for us...every detail was taken care of...Geraldine at Guest relations confirmed plans for us as well.

Everyone was extremely helpful... The dining room staff even helped with access to the hotel's free wi-fi  and directions to sights.                           

The hotel is accessible and in walking distance to many of the sights.  It is in the midst of beautiful stores and great shopping...",5,2014,07,15
11,It's a nice hotel but I don't know if the service was 5 stars,"My friend and I stayed here for 5 days in two separate rooms. During our reservation, we requested for one bed instead of 2 twins for both rooms. We took a taxi from the airport and it was about 35 euro. We arrived in the morning but the rooms were not ready. We were told the check in time was 3pm and the rooms would be ready by 3pm. We also asked to make sure the room has one bed instead of 2 twins again.We got back to the hotel at 4pm but only one room were ready. We checked in to one of the rooms and of course there were two twin beds. The other room were finally ready after 4:30pm and again two twin beds! We asked the house keeping to move the two twins together for one bed for both rooms but they only did one room. We ended up one room with 2 twins since it was just way too complicated to ask them. 

The room itself was nice. It was clean and the bed was comfortable with nice bedding. The location is very central (if you love to shop, for sure its the hotel you should stay). It has many nice restaurants in the area. We also enjoyed the roof top. It has a nice view of the city. The staffs were extremely friendly but don't ask them to recommend you a restaurant. We asked concierge to recommend us a restaurant for dinner. The concierge recommended one with the and he wrote it on the map with the actual address but we walked back and forth a couple times and the whole block had no restaurant. 

Overall, I do think it's a nice hotel but for a 5 stars hotel, it should has better service. I also want to mention that the wall is pretty thin and my friend can hear my TV even tho the volume was very low.",4,2014,07,14
11,Simply outstanding!,"Stayed just 1 night then onto sister hotel Mur Muri closeby. Fantastic service and a great experience. Great room and wonderful breakfast which is a must. Roof top bar is great to soak up the sun or enjoy a great G&T sundowner. Staff all so helpful in particular special thanks to Susana Onos, Director of Client Relations who went out her way to recommend & book a great tapas bar for me which I would never have discovered. Thank you for making my stay extra special! ",5,2014,07,13
11,Excellent Service,"Everyone we dealt with on our brief stay provided wonderful service.  But kudos goes to Almudena in Guest Relations who helped me so much when my husband was sick.  She was so kind - provided us with a doctor from their 24 hour on call service - and gave me a phone to call Delta to change my flights.  In addition, she sent us water and chocolates to our room. 

I had time for one drink on the rooftop bar and it provided my only chance to see Barcelona - what a beautiful view!

 It was a very brief stay, due to the circumstances, but we will definitely return to this fine hotel.",5,2014,07,13
11,Majestic lives up to its name,"Fantastic property with a first-class staff. Located in the heart of Barcelona, these people are professionals at their job and very attentive to detail. The rooftop bar is breathtaking and the gentlemen who runs the guest pick-ups and drop-offs for the taxis/private vehicles is a real professional. One of the best properties we have stayed at in Europe.",5,2014,07,10
11,The Majestic Hotel and Spa Barcelona is named because it is majestic.,"I loved so much staying at your hotel because it was so delightful, clean, decorative.  Service at front desk could be improved (I am referring to attitude by one person, whom I will  not describe).  Other than this I have no further complaints and staying at your hotel was a dream come true.  I will return to your splendid hotel all the time when I am in Barcelona.

There is a painting on the first floor of a young girl reading a letter while an old man is by her side.   I understand that this painting was inspired by Ernest Hemingway's book Moby Dick.  Could you send me  the correct spelling of  artist's name, the name of the painting and when the work was completed.  I LOVED IT.  

Again, your hotel is splendid, and the city of Barcelona is also a work of art.   I never knew Barcelona was so beautiful.  How marvelous it must be to live and work in this city.

Thank you for everything.

Sincerely,
Vivian T. Costagliola",5,2014,07,10
11,Unsurpassed!,"My husband and I just returned home from an incredible 5 night stay at The Majestic and I cannot say enough positive about our experience.  From the moment we arrived the greeting, service and attention to our comfort was unsurpassed.  Each and every member of the staff went out of his/her way to greet us, inquire as to how they could help us and answer any questions.  Of course, our expectations were far exceeded when the hotel upgraded us (with many thanks due to our incredible travel agent, Nicole) to a penthouse suite with a terrace overlooking the paaseig de Garcia.  Coming ""home"" to these views each evening and relaxing with a glass of cava and Jamie iberico (a we,come gift from the thoughtful manager) was magical.  Breakfasts were sumptuous and the service efficient.  The location of the hotel cannot be better-- we love to walk (if we didn't we'd need to be rolled home given all the unbelievably inventive and delicious food in Barcelona) and from The Majestic we walked everywhere in the city-- our only non walking day was when we took the speed train to Figueres to see the Dali museum (a very enjoyable excursion) -- and a taxi once up to the Miro Foundation ( exquisite!).  Many thanks to the wonderful staff for giving us a most memorable experience.  Can't wait to return.",5,2014,07,09
11,Classic Elegance Updated,"We just spent four nights in Barcelona and loved the hotel. Located in the middle of everything, right on Pasei de Gracia the hotel is wonderful. Rooms are a bit smaller than usual for this price range but very nicely done and a great bathroom. The gym was perfect and breakfast was excellent. The rooftop pool and terrace were lovely to end the day with a nice drink and a great view of Barcelona.
Will surely go back!",5,2014,07,08
11,First trip to Barcelona,"Hotel Guest Services had communicated to me prior to our arrival date inquiring about any special needs or requests.  I very much appreciated this attention to detail.  Upon arrival we were greated and made to feel very welcome.  The location of the hotel is in an excellent location.  What set the hotel apart is the superior services from the staff.  The concierge went out of way to deal with my request and then found me at the rooftop bar to advise me of the situation, he was very sweet.

Loved the location, I would stay here again, with a balcony whew.",5,2014,07,07
11,"Majestic, classic and trendy","The classic Majestic Hotel is a truly luxurious yet trendy hotel. The location is convenient - just a shopping street up from Placa Catalunya.

There is really not much not to like about this grand hotel. Fresh and clean room that had all the comforts, including free safe and wifi.
The breakfast buffet was impressive, including a wide variety of baked goods, pastries, made-to-order omelettes, etc. Only surpassed by the legendary Champagne Breakfast available on Sundays.
A perfect place to spend time between bouts of shopping, sight-seeing and restaurants.

Make sure to have drinks and a snack on the rooftop terrace bar La Dolce Vitae, with a spectacular view of all of Barcelona - a comfortable lounge outside.",5,2014,07,07
11,Great stay in renovated hotel,"The hotel has been compltely renovated and is only a please to live in. Rooms were great, food,breakfast and Brunch on Sunday was outstanding. Drinks in the lounge a bit pricey, but the snack food menu is great. Top service all round. Room checked and refreshed twice a day.
Main restaurant in cellar is a dull room and we did not eat there.",5,2014,07,06
11,Majestic Hotel,"I just stayed at this beautiful hotel and absolutely loved everything about it ie.:  location, service, food. service.  The hotel is beautiful.  We had a beautiful room with a large balcony overlooking the city.  The roof has the most fabulous view of Barcelona.  They serve drinks, food and also have a swimming pool.  The spa is also located on the roof.  I loved everything about this hotel and will stay again if I am in Barcelona!!",5,2014,07,05
11,Excellent,"My husband, daughter and myself recently stayed at the Majestic Residence Apartments. We were very pleased with the apartment. It was a lot larger than expected and everything was clean. The kitchen is completely fitted with large fridge/freezer, microwave, oven and  washer/dryer.We were only there for 4 nights so did not use any of the appliances. My daughters flight back to the UK on the Monday night was cancelled due to the French Air Traffic controllers and the front desk were very helpful and allowed her to use the phone to sort out her flights. The staff were all very efficient and extremely helpful with any questions that we had. It was a great weekend, fabulous weather and the hotel is perfectly situated for transport and restaurants. The roof terrace is a great place to sit and chill with a glass of wine and the views were amazing. We shall return.",5,2014,07,05
11,Elegant accommodations in the heart of the city,"My husband and I just finished a 6 night stay at the Majestic and we're very happy with the accommodations.  The hotel is located in the heart of the city on a street that is comparable to mid town 5th ave in NYC.  There is no lack of high end shopping, cafés and restaurants.  It is right in the middle if everything, but amazingly we didn't get any street noise in our room.  Our room had a cute little balcony over looking all the action.  Too small to sit out on, but nice enough to share a glass of wine and take in the city.  The hotel has a roof top bar with a pool that is one of the highlights.  It was a great place to go for a drink before dinner.  There is also a nice piano bar in the lobby if you don't want to be outside.  The service was great and all the staff speaks English.",5,2014,07,04
11,A True Pleasure,"There is a bit of the grande dame about this property - emphasis on the ""grande"". There is something absolutely old world here, though I'm not sure exactly what.  Perhaps it’s that certain style and sense of refinement. I can say that whatever it is works and works well. The rooms and hallways are large, quiet, and well laid out. The bathrooms are roomy, modern, and fully equipped with premium fixtures and amenities. The beds are comfortable and the closets are generous. The neighborhood is fun and filled with wonderful shops, crowded cafes, and just the right amount of people. But the real secret to this truly five star experience, as it ultimately is in all of the best five star experiences is - service. And the service is truly something of which to take note- absolute professionalism, genuine warmth, a constant desire to get it right and when something is not quite right, an equally strong desire to make it right. Outstanding. 

Under the “nothing is perfect” category, the deep, flat, rectangular design of the bathroom sink keeps it from draining properly which is a relatively small annoyance for which nothing can be done. The breakfast buffet was, for me, a mixed bag. The good of it is that there are a very large number of options, each more delicious than the next – a large variety of eggs, meats, cheeses, fruits, yogurts, breads, breakfast sandwiches, and desserts. I did not taste anything that I didn’t think was both fresh and well prepared. The service, like everywhere else in the hotel, was superb. What then makes it a mixed bag? A lot of it is personal taste. I don’t like buffets. Yes, I could have eaten in my room, but one of the other good things about the buffet breakfast and one of the things that persuaded me to eat there every morning, is that it is included in the price of the room – which is probably what leads to the my other issue - it’s very crowded and somewhat chaotic – a lot of people rushing around, getting their food, coming and going. That’s not going to bother a lot of people, but I prefer my breakfast in peace. So, it was a challenge for me. 

Other than those two quibbles (and really, that is what they are, quibbles) this is an absolutely wonderful, very well run property. A true pleasure and highly recommended.",5,2014,07,04
11,Very good hotel in great location,"We just arrived home after our 10 day trip to Spain. Stayed at the Hotel Majestic for 2 nights. Hotel is in a great location on the main shopping street, just a stones throw away from two Gaudi houses you should visit. There was construction going on on the street below and so it was a bit noisy especially early in the morning.
They upgraded us to a suite upon arrival and the room was very nice. We told them it was our 36th wedding anniversary and when we got to our room, they had a bottle of wine and some biscuits were there waiting for us. coming back from our evening activity, when we arrived in our room, there were rose pedals on the floor to our bed which had rose pedals in the shape of a heart on our bed. Nice touch.
Breakfast was good. Concierge was very helpful arranging restaurants and theater tickets for us. Good location right in the middle of things. Could even walk to La Sagrada, a 20 minute walk. 
There was a taxi strike and we were staying at another hotel in Barcelona near the beach and they were very nice to allow us to keep our bags there until we could pick them up another day.",5,2014,07,04
11,Best location,We stayed in the majestic residences for five nights. Huge two bedroom apartment with a view of Paseio de Gracia. No complaints except that the Wfi service was poor and we did not get out towels changed daily as promised. The main dinning room dinner menu was not inviting and two other guests left as soon as they were also seated. Spectacular view from the 10th floor bar.,5,2014,07,03
11,Easy apartment in Barcelona,"Our family stayed at the Majestic apartments (across street from Majestic hotel) for 4 nights.  The apartment was large & well appointed.  We loved having the kitchen and laundry.  And the location was perfect.  Our two teenagers had plenty of space, which made my husband and I really happy!  And the wifi was good.  It was cheaper that two hotel rooms because it didn't include daily maid service, but we didn't want service for a 4 night stay.  Our only issue was the missing curtains in the inner (kids) bedroom making the room too light at night;  we solved this with eyemasks and everyone was happy.  I'd highly recommend the Majestic Apartments.",4,2014,07,03
11,Excellent,"My boyfriend and I stayed at this fabulous hotel from 27 till 29th of June 2014. It was his birthday week - end and for him it was full surprise. I made a booking a month ago , throw Karlson - Tourism company, where I  worked for many years. My former colleagues requested for me an upgrade and hotel kindly provided it. We had a Deluxe Passeig de Gràcia room, which was really nice, comfortable, full of light and with marble bathroom with rain shower.
I've requested a special birthday cake with a special title , they have kindly prepared it. They are very attentive to the details , a nice card , which we kept for a memory and a bottle of Brut embellished our romantic gateway. I have to admit, I traveled a world and stayed in luxury hotels due to my previous work, ( I spent in travel business 10 years of my very interesting professional life ) however the STAFF of Majestic deserves a special standing ovations. They all are professionals multiplied to a Spanish hospitality. My special thanks to Christina, who was there for any request we had. Unfortunately , I don't remember all the names of receptionist and guest relations, but they all were very helpful . Whether we needed to book a restaurant, or to eat tapas, or to book a ticket to Sagrada de Famiglia they were at our disposal. What I have also noticed, which is very important in ""our"" business, ( yes, I still belong in my heart to this hotel business community people ) :)) is that they love the work they do. Whether it was a waiter , or portier, or a housekeeper, they were happy to do their work. We have asked for a late check out, they have kindly provided a room till 2p.m. , after that ,we have been kindly offered to relax near the swimming pool which has  fantastic view and  very comfortable sunbeds. The pool is small, so if you are really looking for the hotel with big pool , it is not for you. We are not a great swimmers, so it was fine for us. After the swimming pool , we were kindly offered to take a shower in the gym. They have all bathroom amenities in the gym shower. 
To sum up , I can say that the minute you enter to this hotel, you don't need to think about anything. Whatever you want to see, eat, drink  - the staff is there at your disposal. That's how real luxury hotels has to function. 
p.s. The rates are given with and without breakfast, please book with breakfast. It is just lavish.on sweet and sour food. 
I can say that I would recommend this hotel to everybody, despite of your social or family status. It is good for single person, couple, kids , teenagers or mature people. 
I have been recommended to stay there by my former colleagues, who know a lot what real luxury is, so I can recommend as well to whose who are ready to pay and get a classy attitude.",5,2014,07,02
11,Terrific hotel centrally located,"Stayed at the Majestic Hotel last week and thoroughly enjoyed our time in Barcelona and our time at the Majestic Hotel.
The staff were attentive and most helpful,  from the front desk to the housekeeping staff.
The inclusive buffet breakfast was terrific!
We would definitely return to the Majestic on our next visit to Barcelona! ",5,2014,07,01
11,Loved the residences,"I just returned from a 5 night stay at the residences owned by the majestic hotel in Barcelona.  It was an excellent way to ""live"" in the city with all the conveniences of a wonderful hotel across the street.  We had a two bedroom/one bathroom apt on the 6th floor on the back of the building.  The terrace had a large ta;b;e where we had breakfast each morning (a lot less $$ than the 29 euro per person hotel breakfast).  In the afternoons we would go to the roof top pool with our kids and relax overlooking the city below.  

The caveat on the apts is that you need to be willing to spend a couple of hours at a store stocking up.  They have washer/dryer, dishwasher, utensils, and basic kitchen supplies but you will need;

-paper towels
- salt, pepper
- nespresso pods (store is one block away)
- Great fruit/veg market 10 min away (mercad de la conception) open til 1pm
- napkins
- we had no spatula

Wifi was pretty good during our visit though we did need to sign back on repeatedly.  
Fresh towels could be requested daily for no additional fee
one maid service cleaning is included each week.  45 euros for additional cleaning.

We had a wonderful babysitter for two nights from tender loving canguros.  Her name was Marija.  

The hotel staff was extremely courteous and helpful.  Highly highly recommended.  Much better than anticipated.",5,2014,07,01
11,The Barcelona in-crowd hotel,"Stayed there first time while on an alumni group tour. Then twice again. Rooms are impeccable, modern and pretty soundproof. The staff is very pleasant and professional. The main restaurant is among the best in this great food town. The roof top terrace is one of the in-places in a city known for out of this world roof top dining and lounges. The CiU, the party in power in Catalonia has held their victory parties here for decades. Has a history and is in the middle of Passeig de Gracia, the grand boulevard of Barcelona, with beautiful people, sidewalk cafes and steps from many of the central city attractions. Highly recommend. Did not get five stars because I am very picky.",4,2014,06,28
11,Excellent Hotel Centrally Located in Barcelona,"Located on large blvd, but near many attractions, the Sagrada Famila is amazing, the Casa Mila and Casa Batllo are also close by, Antonio Gaudi's influence is everywhere. Tip: Near tourist bus line that provide access to entire city. Rooms are nice but very straight laced, nice views of city from rooftop pool.",4,2014,06,28
11,Good location and courteous Staff,I stayed for 3 nights in Majestic with family and My family was very happy. The rooms are spacious. The food of Room Service was good. The concierge was very courteouse. Sure to come again. All the Big Brands are in walking distance of the Hotel. ,5,2014,06,26
11,Beautiful hotel restaurant well located on passage de gracias with incredible views!,"Did not stay here but enjoyed the roof top terrace with the incredible views of the Barcelona skyline.
We had the wine and salmon tartare.  Incredible.  Service great and very enjoyable time.
Recommend?  Yes.",4,2014,06,26
11,"The mighty Majestic Hotel across the ""pond"" is a perfect choice.","My sister and I stayed in one of the apartments across the street for five nights during June. We absolutely found the Bellman, concierge, room service, housekeeping and everyone wonderful. The Spa was great. We had at least one or two services every night.It was relaxing and so personal that upon departure we were all hugging and kissing goodbye. We would like to recommend this hotel to all mankind who pass thru Barcelona. With much Love and respect, the girls from New Orleans.",5,2014,06,25
11,Stunning Hotel,"We loved the Majestic-loved the location-loved the rooms(a little bit small but it didn't matter because they were so well appointed). It's a beautiful hotel. We stayed there 4 nights. At first we had reservations at their apartments, we didn't like those but loved the hotel. The other added bonus was the bar on the top of the hotel. Magnificent view & lovely addition to the hotel. Definitely would stay there again & recommend it to friends.",5,2014,06,25
11,One night after a cruise,"When we check into The Majestic Hotel Barcelona, we were offered an upgrade to a larger room, of course we gladly accepted the offer. The room was large and comfortable, nicely laid out with everything you would need, it really was beautiful, except for the view, we upgraded to a larger room looking at a parking lot. We really wanted a room facing the Passeig de Gracia, but this room was too nice to switch.
The rooftop terrace bar was perfect, with views to die for, location is on the Passeig de Gracia with restaurant’s and attractions all around.
The Majestic is a beautiful hotel in a beautiful city",4,2014,06,24
11,Unforgettable stay at Majestic Barcelona!,"My husband and I would love to thank ""The Majestic Hotel and Spa Barcelona"" and their staff for making our stay here magnificent, one that we will always remember very fondly, and tell our friends and family about. Everything about this hotel was perfect, our beautiful suite was so well appointed, the attention to detail was more than one could wish for on a romantic holiday. All the beautiful drapery, the huge four post king bed with beautiful white linen and a wonderful bathroom. The amazing study area with its scalloped bay windows that overlooked the main street. Everyone said it was very noisy but the double glazed window kept all sounds outside. The next morning we made our way to the restaurant for our breakfast…WOW! My husband and I have stayed in a lot of hotels with breakfast included but the selection of delectable food was truly unexpected. I so wanted to take a photo because we are foodies and love seeing food presented so well. The roof top bar was a fantastic place to visit, the atmosphere was perfect day and night, the panoramic views were a great place for a photo opportunity and of course a glass of vino or anything else you felt like, including food. The hotel was perfectly located for high end shopping, restaurants, and every corner had magnificent architecture to photograph. Finally I would like to thank the staff at the front desk and throughout the hotel, nothing was every too much trouble. Thank you again, we will definitely be back!",5,2014,06,24
11,Great hotel,"Good location and kind service.
They always helped and gave us advices and it made our trip great
Room is also awesome and fashionable. Good location so it is easy to go everywhere.
If we visit Barcelona again, we definitely stay this hotel
      
      
      ",5,2014,06,23
11,Best location!,"At the time the hotel was under renovation and the entrance was not as nice but the staff more than made up for it, there I give them Excellent!t I would go back this fall and have recommended to friends,",4,2014,06,23
11,"Great Hotel, Amazing Roof-Top Bar","A 2 night business/leisure trip at this hotel. Elegant hotel and well-trained, professional staff throughout. Classy. The roof-top bar makes this hotel - it is sensational. The views are not seconded in Barcelona - even from the cable-car. Very spacious room and excellent bathroom. Both well-kept. The only snag, and it is quite an annoyance, was no bottle water in the room. This is very disappointing for a 5* hotel as you would expect it in a 3. Business facilities were great and staff were on-hand for refreshment breaks. Breakfast was OK, but not fantastic. Plated breakfasts are preferred opposed to buffet, but I suppose this is the way all hotels are going now. Plated breakfasts would not be hard to administer here and would make a big difference. Overall a pleasant stay at a lovely hotel in a great area of town.",4,2014,06,22
11,Not a Five Star Hotel,"Roof top bar and lounge offered the best city views,  Service was excellent, rooms clean and comfy.  I give the hotel only 4 stars as the rooms are very small and the bathroom in our originally room only offered one old pedestal sink, not the large marble or stone countered sink a five star hotel should offer.  This is the first year the Majestic was listed as a luxury platinum American Express Hotel so I was disappointed.  The dinning room was small, dark, and located in the basement, no windows with just plain average over priced food, no decor.  Breakfast and lunch served on the second floor in a nicely appointed large room, great breakfast buffet with lots of gluten free options. 
The Majestic is more of a discount large group hotel rather than a unique luxury hotel.  To make matters confusing, I booked a premium room only to discover that the hotel has five categories of premium that are not listed through American Express or other sites, it's up to the hotel at what level premium room you are assigned as they all cost the same.  TO be on the safe side, book a suite, perhaps that is more like a 5 star luxury hotel.",3,2014,06,19
11,NIce hotel in good location,"I like to start with the positive aspects of any stay in a hotel. The hotel is attractive, in a safe and nice location and our rooms were bright and comfortable. The bed and linens were very nice and 100 cotton.  The breakfast served in the hotel was very good and we had nice service all three mornings of our stay. We enjoyed the roof top pool and it was nice to be outside looking out over the city. 
Why not 5 stars? We had a hideous check in with an intern-- 30 minutes of slowing entering data for 5 passports and two rooms-- only be to be lost again when we returned 5 hours later. We received wifi codes that needed to be reentered every time we needed wifi. On our last day, the wifi code stopped at 9 am despite a 12 checkout. 
We had to call 3 times for a rollway despite telling the front desk that we needed one at both check ins! . It was then determined after we unpacked that we would have to move rooms to accommodate the rollaway-- and two more phone calls for the bed. We started this process at 3 pm and received our second room and rollaway at 515. 
Housekeeping was spotty. Excellent and then dirty classes and plates left the next time. There are no complimentary classes of water or coffee and this somehow feels rather cheap given the rates and the suite we were staying in. 
A minor complaint but one to mention given the difference in concierge recommendations for restaurants versus our experience in Madrid. We were sent to touristy, average restaurants that were overwhelmed by non Spanish speaking guests. Our best meal happened quite by accident in a small much more local restaurant with great food. A concierge at a hotel of this caliber should inquire about the type of experience you want before sending you off with the cruise ship crowd!.
I would stay again and I would recommend the hotel but it needs to improve its front desk efficiency, wifi issues, provide water and coffee and some more informed concierge recommendations.",4,2014,06,19
11,"Great Hotel, Great Location","We have stayed at the Majestic on several occasions over the past few years and it does not disappoint.  The rooms vary in size but all are well appointed and immaculately clean. The beds are some of the comfiest I have slept in. Service is friendly and welcoming and the reception team very helpful. The rooftop terrace bar is an ideal place for relaxing with the first drink of the evening with views over much of the city. Decent aircon and good Wifi. 

Location wise this could hardly be better. Paseo de Gracia has several bars and restaurants within a couple of minutes of the hotel and even better ones can be found in Rambla de Catalunya - which is literally one road back from Paseo de Gracia.",5,2014,06,18
11,small rooms but great hotel,"We stayed 3 nights in May and really enjoyed the hotel. Excellent concierge, lovely roof top restaurant and huge selection of breakfast items in a lovely sunny room. Other than breakfast we only ate in the roof top restaurant, all open air with great views and a pool. We had tapas that were delicious.
The service is excellent, Bulgari amenities in the bathroom, newly renovated with a good bed and pillows, but the room and the bathroom were small, hard to find places for our suitcases.  It is a great location across the street from Gaudi's Casa Batllo, on a beautiful tree lined blvd. We would stay again..",4,2014,06,17
11,Great Hotel well located,"reception staff+concierges are rather helpful, the rooms are very nice, especially balcony view on Passeig de Gracia and very cool rooftop with miniature pool. Very good level of servicebreakfast is fantastic",4,2014,06,17
11,"Excellent location, food and atmosphere","Excellent hotel and excellent location. All the shopping is on the same street as the hotel which was very nice. The food was fantastic especially the breakfast! We also used the Spa for a massage and also the private sauna, ice bath area was great as well. After our massages we went out to the roof top terrace for drinks by the pool overlooking all of Barcelona. It was such a magnificent sight! Really wonderful food as well. And the service was top notch! We will definitely stay here again the next time we are in Barcelona.",5,2014,06,16
11,"Excellent service, very nice rooms and good location","We stayed four nights at the Majestic Hotel. Very good hotel with newly and nicely renovated rooms. Receptionists, concierge, restaurant and spa staff provided all a very competent, quick and kind service. Hotel has a wonderful terrace where one can enjoy a little swim, sun, food and drinks with great views to Barcelona, the sea and hills. Breakfast was in general of very good quality and had a wide selection of items. Food and drinks aren't cheap, but still at a reasonable level for a five star hotel in Barcelona. Rooms facing the wonderful boulevard Passeig de Gracia have nice views to the boulevard, but expect also to be exposed to some noise from it. We had one problem with the quality of one room service delivery, but the staff was very regretful for this and quickly brought us some new dishes. If we return to Barcelona we will definitely consider staying at Majestic Hotel & Spa again.",5,2014,06,14
11,Great Hotel for Business or Pleasure,"This hotel is a little pricy but worth every penny.

The service and hospitality I received were second to none and the rooms were tastefully decorated and spotlessly clean. A particular highlight is the rooftop bar and pool area which offers fabulous views of the centre of Barcelona. 

I would also add that I travel a lot and I really struggle with any bed that is not my own however in The Majestic I slept like a baby.

Location wise I would suggest that the hotel is perfectly placed with easy access to Las Ramblas the old town and good shopping streets.

I was in Barcelona on business but have vowed to return to The Majestic with my wife.",5,2014,06,14
11,great hotel,my wife and I just returned from a 6 night stay at the Majestic Hotel.  the entire experience was outstanding.  the staff was excellent and very attentive.  additionally the location was perfect for touring the city.  we look forward to our next stay,5,2014,06,10
11,"Crowded, noisy, not meant for vacation travel!!","I have wanted to stay here for many years. So was willing to pay the hefty price tag, what a mistake. The hotel caters to the business traveler and if you are looking for a quiet vacation do not stay here.. The hotel is beautiful and rooms are very comfortable, however when I am paying over $500 a night I should not have to make my way thru a crowd in the lobby getting ready to board a cruise ship, should not have to wait for three elevators while bellman cut in front of me to stay with their guest to ensure their tip, should not have to pick up cleaning rags left in my room and should not have to answer my door at 9am to a maid wanting to clean my room..I think
When anyone is paying that kind of price tag, we should be offered some type of hospitality.
We were ignored by an overwhelmed staff.. And to top it off I had to ask for a roll away 3 times and then told I was to be charged $60 a night!!!!!! The roof top bar is nice if you aren't mowed down by people trying to  get a seat next to and if you're  fortunate enough not to sit next to a table of chain  smokers.. Never again!!",3,2014,06,10
11,"Lovely hotel, great location","This is an absolutely beautiful hotel on what they consider,  The Rodeo Drive of Barcelona area. Rooms are lovely, comfy beds and within walking distance Gothic, Rambla, many shops and restaurants. Rooftop terrace has wonderful views but very spendy if you plan on sipping cocktails all afternoon. 

I took in a facial & pedicure at the Spa and it was just okay for the money I spent. The spa is gorgeous, the gal was super sweet but she basically just rubbed lotion on my face for 45 min and my pedi was average. I've had better but it still felt good after so much traveling and walking. 

The only negative I can think of is they don't offer any kind of happy hour specials in the hotel bar or terrace, but plenty of places nearby do.",4,2014,06,09
11,Perfect Hotel,"We stayed at Majestic Hotel for 4 nights and we thougt it was just perfect. The location is good in the upper-class neighberhoods and yet not long Walking distance to la Rambla, the Gothic area, the harbour and the beaches.

The hotel have a wonderful roof terrace were you can sunbath or take a drink Before the dinner. The service from the friendly staff was excellent.

We can highly recomenned Hotel Majestic and we will for sure stay here nexta time we are in Barcelona.",5,2014,06,08
11,Amazing rooftop terrace and bar,"We cruised out of Barcelona twice and both times we stayed at the Majestic. I absolutely love this hotel. The rooms are very nice, especially for European standards. The staff is very helpful and friendly. The best part is the rooftop terrace which has a 360 degree view of the city. You can go up there, listen to music, eat and drink. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,06,08
11,Majestic Hotel...Perfection Personified!,"The Majestic is an impressive building in a great location.
The trompe l'oeil paint effect stone work in the lobby and other areas is artistic and exquisite.  
Registration on arrival was quick and efficient. We were kindly upgraded to a city view room which was fortunately situated on the side as there were major roadworks in operation along the length of the Passeig de Gracia. Rather noisy and messy. This was the only negative point and not the fault of the hotel. Let's hope the work is completed soon.
We were celebrating a special weekend prior to a cruise. A bottle of cava was sent to the room with a letter of congratulations from the manager. Thank you so much for that.
The room was spacious, elegantly appointed and extremely comfortable. 
Breakfast buffet was very good with lots of choices, though expensive.    
Service throughout the hotel was impeccable and definitely 'with a smile', somewhat of a rarity these days. Nothing was too much trouble. 
We would not hesitate to stay at the Majestic Hotel on our next visit to Barcelona. Living in Mallorca this is an easy trip and we can hardly wait to return to one of our favourite cities and now favourite hotels.
Thank you for a most pleasant stay. You deserve all the accolades you receive.",5,2014,06,05
11,A wonderful stay!,"This was a first visit to Barcelona and we could not have chosen a nicer place - the location was excellent too. Rooms were very comfortable. Our bathroom had a spacious walk-in shower- excellent for someone with some mobility difficulties. Breakfast was also excellent - as I need a gluten free diet,  they were easily able to accommodate. The only disappointment was the restaurant in the hotel.  It was in the basement and seemed claustrophobic- especially with a heavy curtain cutting the room in half...although it wad unclear why. The food was ok - but not good enough for a 5* hotel.  However,  we would definitely return- positives definitely outweigh any negatives! ",5,2014,06,03
11,THE GOOD LIFE IN BARCELONA,"The Majestic is the type of hotel that brings you back to the elegance of the past . It's location is primo. Located in one of the most upscale parts of Barcelona and a 15 minute walk to the tourist mecca of the old town. What you will be impressed with is the level of service and the friendly nature of their staff. Wouldn't think of staying anywhere else. 
I bought the breakfast package and that was good value. The array of food and quality is excellent.
The package also included a massage for each of us at their spa, which we used the afternoon of arrival. 
I would also compliment the high level of service from the concierge desk, whether getting a last minute dinner reservation, directions or getting online tickets to popular tourist attractions.",5,2014,06,01
11,Excellent,Fantastic hotel in the center of Barcelona. Great service and the top floor gives a nice view over the city where you can also enjoy a drink as the sun goes down over the ocean. Its easy to get to where ever you want to go.,5,2014,05,31
11,The Right Place to Stay in Barcelona,"If your looking for a top of the line hotel in Barcelona, you need go no further than the Majestic Hotel. The service is incredible and the rooms are wonderful. We booked through American Express and were upgraded to a suite. It was wonderful and spacious. It had all the amenities. If you needed something from housekeeping you hung up the phone and there was a knock on the door. They aim to please.

There is a pool and deck on the 10th floor that has the most spectacular views of the city. There's a wonderful bar and pool and if your a guest you must use it. there's also a wonderful spa which you get a credit for on Amex. The concierge is very helpful and even arranged for box breakfasts for us in the car on our way to the airport for an early flight. 

Your right in the middle of town with shopping and restaurants galore. There's Gaudi to the left and Gaudi to the right. One block in either direction. The roof view makes the Segrada Famiglia seem like it's in your own backyard.

The only drawback at the hotel is the breakfast service. It was slow and tedious. The food was ok but not great. The chef is friendly but the attention to detail is lacking. Again, through Amex, breakfast is included.

We had a wonderful stay and would recommend the hotel to everyone that wants something special. And try Servicia Catalanya for Tapas. It's crowded and it's reasonable. The front desk recommended it.",4,2014,05,30
11,"Superb service and location, location, location!","This hotel surpassed our expectations in everyway.  The service from the moment we arrived, was impeccable.  The staff did everything to make us feel welcome, excited to explore the city and very much at home in the hotel. The rooms are spacious, nicely appointed, and quiet, despite the fact that it is located on a large bustling avenue.  The concierge helped us with restaurant reservations, directions, sight recommendations, and helped us reserve connecting rooms for our return leg of the trip after visiting the Costa Brava for the weekend.  We will definitely return and suggest it highly to others.  It is a reasonable place to stay for the level of service and accomodations.",5,2014,05,29
11,Amazing Find in Barcelona,"We were lucky enough to spend a week at the Majestic Hotel in April, 2014. Even after conducting some pretty intensive research, we weren't 100% sure of our choice of hotel when we arrived in Barcelona. As soon as we stepped into this beautiful property, all concerns were set aside. This hotel is stunning. Sure, it's not the Mandarin Oriental or the 4-Seasons, but we weren't willing to pay those insane prices. However, this place did not disappoint. The service... impeccable - the room... stunning - the location... ideal. The rooftop pool/bar/terrace, with it's stunning views of the city, is not to be missed. My husband and I have stayed in hotels all over the world and we can easily say this is one of the nicest hotels we have ever had the pleasure of staying in.

We booked a Deluxe Executive room. It's a little pricier than the standard room, but it was huge and well worth the extra expense.",5,2014,05,29
11,Lovely hotel in all respects,"The hotel is beautiful; the staff is welcoming and helpful, the room is comfortable, the location is great.  This is a 5 star hotel and it's obvious why---it's elegant and located in a snazzy part of Barcelona.  The concierge made reservations for us at 3 outstanding restaurants we had selected for our 3 days in this beautiful city and the hotel was a delight.",5,2014,05,28
11,"Great place to stay, could be the best location!",Its a great hotel (not the Ritz or four seasons) but very European and in an excellent location.  The staff is awesome!  Had a suite with a balcony which was nice.  The rooftop pool and bar is very cool with a great view!,4,2014,05,28
11,"Excellent Hotel, First Class Location","We loved this place. It was extremely easy to walk around, a block away is a building by Gaudi, about 15 minutes away is the Sagrada Familia. 
What amazed us about this place is the housekeeping. We've never had our room tidied up with this much attention and care to our things. It was certainly appreciated.",5,2014,05,28
11,Lovely Rooms,"This is a lovely hotel, situated in a very busy, noisy area of the city. We had a Junior Suite and it was a very smart, well appointed room, with a lovely spacious bathroom.
We found the area very busy and noisy but everything was easily within walking distance which was great. Staff at front desk were helpful and pleasant. 
Service in the bar was a little erratic, but the food was ok. Breakfast was lovely with a great selection to suit all tastes. We had a lovely bottle of wine and some local biscuits delivered to our room - which was a nice touch. Free Wi-fi as well, which was another bonus. ",4,2014,05,28
11,return visit,"ended a cruise in barcelona and stayed at the majestic for 2 nights.  has been remodeled since my last stay in 08, but as always a GREAT place.  Staff is very anxious to accommodate your desires.  Will return again next time in Barcelona. A perfect location to explore Barcelona.",5,2014,05,28
11,Fantastic Location,Beautiful Hotel.  We got off our cruise in the morning expecting we'd have to wait until 2 PM to check-in.  To our surprise our room was waiting and we checked right in and were able to site see earlier.  Good restaurants in the area and fantastic views from the roof bar.,5,2014,05,28
11,Left feeling a little underwhelmed... ,"The furnishing are lovely - as is the roof pool and the bell boys. The rest kind of left me underwhelmed. The location isn't great and the front desk/concierge were rude. There are a few great cafes in the adjacent streets to check out.
However, for a little more $, I'd go back to Campa Casa next time (which was fantastic during a stay in 2010!)",3,2014,05,27
11,Great place to stay,"Spent some five nights in this hotel and there's no doubt it's top end. The location alone is brilliant, just across the street one of the most beautiful buildings in Spain, Gaudí's Casa Battló, and five blocks away of the old city center. Holding a glass of Rioja while admiring the Sagrada Familia on the rooftop bar, one could do worse. Unluckily I was in Barcelona on business so most of the time i stayed in the hotel's business center, restaurant, bar or in my room, but that allowed me to get a thorough experience of the hotel, and i can confirm, it is excellent.",5,2014,05,27
11,"location, decency, quality",Expertly located combining history with the latest amenities.  Walking distance from commercial or historic  highlights. Expert service and the finest of views. Bars and restaurant facilities are commendable. The breakfast ranks superior. The clientele is not pronouncedly skewed  modern or arrogant. An excellent choice overall.,4,2014,05,27
11,Truly Majestic,"With Chanel and LV located at the lower floor and prime location on on Passeig de Gracia, the hotel spells class.
The rooms are nice, comfortable and well appointed and the breakfast was nicely arranged for choice.  The highly reviewed hotel rooftop bar closes at 9pm,  so we couldn’t visit. The neighborhood includes classic Gaudi building like Casa Batillo and La Pedrera  and is a 10 minutes walk to Plaza Catalunya and the crazy Las Ramblas. The walk to Plaza Catalunya has lots of Tapas bars, restaurants and shopping. 
For some reason, our double bed was 2 separate beds with wheels, which kept moving apart through the night, not very comfortable. There is also street noise on low floors, in case you are a light sleeper. The breakfast spread on weekend was amazing but with long queues every morning. Hmmm.
We bought a 2-day hop-on-hop-off bus ticket which covered most of  Barcelona – stop is just outside. Must see places include : The stunning Sagrada Familia (do not miss) La Ramblas (always crowded and very touristy), Spanish village (all of spain in one place!), Camp Nou (FC Barcelona fans), the beach with its high energy restaurants, Gothic quarter and the La Boqueria food market at La Ramblas (awesome)! 
Barcelona is a lovely city with many experiences and the hotel has classic old world charm. We enjoyed our stay.",5,2014,05,27
11,Apartment review,"Just returned from a 5 day stay at the Majestic Residences.  Check-in was very easy and our apartment was ready early which was great since we came from the US.  We were escorted across the street to the apartment building and shown how to get into the building, etc.  We were surprised at how big the apt. was!  A very large living room with dining area, a decent size kitchen, large master bedroom suite, a smaller 2nd bedroom and 2 decent size bathrooms was more than enough for the 3 of us!  The view would have been great if not for the construction on the street below.  Balcony was tiny but typical for Europe.  The 2nd bedroom had a window into a concrete ""courtyard"" and you could see into another apartment so the blackout shades were put down and never opened during our stay.  If you stay in the apartments, ask for one on a higher floor (we were on the 2nd floor) because during the night you could hear the Metro.  Also, we could hear the construction going on which seemed to begin around 8:30 am.  Banging seemed to be coming from inside the building but we never confirmed that.  As stated in other reviews there is a Nespresso machine but no coffee pods.  (There is a Nespresso store on the next block up.)  The apt. had plenty of toilet paper but no tissues and no paper towels in the kitchen.  It did have dishwasher tablets, shampoo, conditioner and lotion.  Towels are changed on request but there is not any housekeeping.  We loved the roof top area and although it was pricey, it was a great place to hang out in the late afternoon enjoying the sun and views!  Everyone at the hotel was wonderful and took care of us.  We would definitely stay here again, even with the little quirks!",4,2014,05,23
11,Gorgeous rooms and responsive management,"We arrived to Majestic in the evening and were offered an upgrade. How lovely! When entering the room we were surprised to see one huge beautifully appointed room but it was not what we booked. One room for a family of 5 is not an option. Clearly it was an executive room and not a suite we booked and were promised at check in. We had to stay there first night and I sent complaint to reservation department. Next morning we were contacted by duty manager and eventually moved to a suite. I was were happy that they listened to the complaint and acted swiftly. The rest of the stay was faultless. Rooms are truly beautiful, views to die for, food was good and location cannot be better in Barcelona.  I would highly recommend this hotel, just look careful what you book.",4,2014,05,23
11,Lovely Hotel,"We recently stayed here prior to a cruise in May for 1 night. Check in was a breeze, we arrived early and both our rooms were ready. The rooms were very spacious and extremely clean. We loved the shower! Gym was a nice size with good equipment. We felt the hotel location was perfect for our short time in Barcelona. A major plus to this hotel is the rooftop bar and pool area! It was a great place to relax after a long flight. Everyone at the hotel was extremely helpful and kind. We would recommend this hotel to anyone and plan to stay there again if we return to Barcelona.",5,2014,05,22
11,Complete Luxury,By far the best hotel I have stayed in. Barcelona is my favorite city and the view from the roof top pool at the Majestic really cements this! Rooms were spacious with large bathroom with rainfall shower over a huge bath. Staff were attentive and couldn't do enough for you. Only problem now is trying to find a hotel that delivers as much as this in other locations.,5,2014,05,21
11,Great experience,"This is the only hotel to stay in when in Barcelona
They have renovated the hotel and it is now a WOW experience
Beautiful rooms and lavatories
The hotel is magnificent and the service is superb
The roof top pool and view are outstanding
When in Barcelona this is the 5 star place to stay",5,2014,05,21
11,Majestic is an understatement,"This hotel is a classic grande dame, recently renovated and absolutely beautiful. If you want the experience of what really classy, professional and hospitable service is, just like it was back 100 years ago, try the Majestic.
My room was tastefully decorated and quiet. No particular view as it faced an inside courtyard and not out onto the street. It was spacious and comfortable and I got an uninterrupted night's sleep. 
Breakfast is excellent, lots of choice, everything fresh, service attentive and pleasant.
The location is excellent, easy walking distance to some of the Gaudi buildings, great restaurants and shopping nearby.
I was traveling on business so did not get a chance to rate the spa. I had a peek though. It looked gorgeous!",5,2014,05,20
11,An amazing magical retreat,"A beautiful retreat, magical, just like the amazing city of Barcelona. I can not conceive this Magical city, without feeling that Majestic Hotel was in the essence of a beautiful and unforgettable one of the best life journeys. The rooms are eloquently delightful. The food is great. And I think I can say, it was one of the cleanest hotels I have been to.",5,2014,05,20
11,Fantastic,Absolutely fantastic hotel.  Beautiful rooms with very modern bathrooms and comfortable beds.  Great staff and very convenient to get around the city.  I would without a doubt stay here again and it is one of the best hotels I have stayed in Europe.,5,2014,05,18
11,Lovely Traditionally Styled Hotel,"We booked this direct with the hotel - a suite offer which included breakfast - though when I first emailed them for availability and prices they didn't mention this offer but I found later on their website.

Well positioned, smart and safe area of Barcelona with no problem wandering the neighbourhood on an evening.  Shops nearby include including Chanel, Bvlgari, Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Hermès plus your high street shops Timberland, Mango, Zara etc.  Close to metro and only 25 minutes by taxi from main airport.

Our suite was very nice. Large bathroom with double sinks, separate shower and jacuzzi bath with Bvlgari bathroom amenities.  Walk in wardrobe with robes and slippers, umbrella too if you need one during your stay.   Lounge area converted to bedroom for the children and had flat screen television though it wasn't used.  Our room had huge bed and flat screen television.  Sliding doors between lounge and bathroom.  WiFi was good in the bedrooms, code for the duration of your stay and its best to tick the box that states 'remember password' as you need to re log in each time.

Complimentary wine and biscuits acknowledging husbands birthday was a lovely gesture from the hotel.

Our room wasn't ready when we arrived mid morning so we had a saunter and then had lunch on the roof terrace which has fabulous views of the city.  The hotel spa is also on the top floor so I had a nail republish after lunch.  There is a roof pool but it was too chilly to dip into during our early May visit.  Roof terrace food was very nice indeed.  We shared cold meats, olives, breads, small bowl of chips and crisps which came with our drinks.

Breakfast on our first morning was extremely busy (Saturday), there are two open rooms to select your cold breakfast from - an excellent choice - but the rooms aren't large when breakfast is busy and once somebody is in a corner nobody else can get near the food.  There is also a hot food area with chef and assistant chef who cater for personalised omelettes, eggs, pancakes etc.  There are hot lidded trays of sausage, bacon, scrambled egg, tomatoes and beans (not Heinz our children informed us). There was also a Cava selection where - if you needed alcohol for breakfast - you could help yourself.  Waiters and waitresses took hot beverage orders and these were served in hot thermos jugs.  The Sunday and Monday breakfasts were a lot less busy thankfully.

The ground floor bar was very nice, almost like a gentlemen's club in decor.  Staff were very attentive.  I did try the Ultimate G&T - huge glass and couldn't finish it but there was a lot of ice too, very nice drink though.

We really liked the style and ambience of the hotel.

We would definitely return here.",5,2014,05,18
11,Great experience,"This is a perfect place for a stay in Barcelona. Staff are friendly professional and helpful. Only complaint was a tour of artistic sights that was disorganized. 
Hotel in a great location. Nearby is the very popular Cerverceria Catalana which was a blast w great tapas wine and interesting people.",5,2014,05,17
11,Majestic Hotel & Spa Barcelona,"My wife and I stayed at the Majestic, great location with exceptional service from the staff, especially at the front desk. The Deluxe Double  room was small with a very small window and balcony. When we visit next time I would opt for a larger room. We arrived at 10:30  from the United States, and were able to have a room upon arrival so we were able to freshen up. The hotel is ideally located for a tourist's sightseeing. The one negative was the the outside roof top bar with a great view of the city closed by 9 PM, it would have been great to have visited the roof top bar for a night cap.",5,2014,05,16
11,Wonder trip,"The hotel is wonderful! Everyone who worked there was very helpful, from getting up tickets to attractions to dinner suggestions. It's in the perfect location to explore everything Barcelona has to offer. You can walk everywhere from it's location. The room was very clean and was kept tidy daily for us. Also if you're someone who needs a reliable wifi connection theirs works wonderfully. This hotel is definitely one I'd recommend to others traveling to Barcelona and will go back to myself!",5,2014,05,15
11,"Centrally located ,good hotel","The Majestic hotel & Spa is centrally located in one of the nicest areas of Barcelona . It's on Passeo de Gracia which is a wide road with wider pavements with pavings, street lamps & seats designed by Gaudi . It has impressive array of shops as it's neighbours : Chanel ( next door ) Gucci , Bulgari, Louis Vuitton to name a few . Numerous restaurants , Tapas bars & street side cafés are nearby . The tour bus stop is 5 minutes walk from the hotel as are tourist attractions such as Casa Battlo , a house deigned by Gaudi . It is also just next to the Metro station .
Unfortunately there are road works going on outside the front of the hotel so they do not have their private parking spaces anymore at present & the drilling noise cannot be pleasant for the guests staying in the rooms  facing the street . However we had a room at the back which overlooked a very neat & clean staff car park , was very quiet . The room was very comfortable & spotlessly clean , with all the 5 star facilities . The his & hers bathroom , especially the showers were superb . The staff were all very well trained , courteous & helpful . Especially Christina at the front desk who was extremely resourceful & got us tickets for the Flamenco show & dinner at the nearby Palace theatre ( walking distance ) made sure they made vegetable paella for my husband who is a vegetarian , also got us tickets for entry to Sagrada Famila , Casa Battlo & Park Guelle ! I would strongly advise this advance booking as without it it is impossible to see all these places during a short 4 day break over a packed long weekend stay due to  the  long queues for entry tickets at the gates .
The hotel restaurants were good . The rooftop poolside bar on the 10th floor provided a panoramic view of the city stretching to the sea !
The pool itself was quite small , almost like a paddling pool ! The service was slow there but food when it arrived was good . 
The breakfast buffet was extensive & very good . The service by waiters & waitresses is excellent there. However for some reason , breakfast is not included in the room charge , which I found strange ! The breakfast charge was 29 Euros per person which I thought was quite high . 
I didn't use the Spa so I cannot comment on it . 
I would definitely go back to this hotel if I visited Barcelona again ! ",5,2014,05,14
11,Perfect location,"This hotel is the perfect one for exploring Barcelona. It is a beautiful hotel in the most desirable location in the city. Close to all the great sights, restaurants and shopping. The rooms were very clean and the staff was amazing. I'd definitely return...",5,2014,05,13
11,4 day break,"We had a short break at the hotel in the Easter holidays, I booked it for my husband & son who are huge football fans. It was our first visit to Barcelona and I would definitely return, we took the metro from the airport which was clean and efficient in no time we arrived at our stop and straight into the hotel. The hotel is situated within the shopping area - shops for everyone ( high class & modest incomes). We had a junior suite and were impressed with the whole thing - clean & modern, we also received a bottle of bubbly on our first night - little touches you remember. My son loved the pool in the rooftop bar ( even though cold, I wasn't brave enough!) but we enjoyed relaxing and the view was amazing. All the staff were pleasant and couldn't do enough to help - the sweets on reception were another hit! 
We did a bus tour we stopped not too far from the hotel, a great way to see the area and get your bearings. As well as the football stadium ( even a non football fan enjoyed) we were able to walk down to La Rambla and the harbour.",5,2014,05,13
11,Barcelona trip,"There four of two couples and we decided to spent three nights in Barcelona before we set off on our cruise. This hotel property is in a great location for shopping and restaurants. The moment we pulled up in our cab the staff was there to assist they were outstanding all three nights we were there. The rooms are impeccable,although small by American standards. Their breakfast buffet was great and had foods for any nationality you think of and again the service was outstanding.

Great hotel, great location and fantastic service, what a way to start a vacation.",5,2014,05,13
11,Highly Recommended,"Terrific hotel -- accommodations, service, location, amenities, everything was first rate. The hotel is very centrally located, and in probably the nicest part of the city.  The rooms were spacious, new and well appointed.  Service from top to bottom was fantastic.  

I highly, highly recommend it.",5,2014,05,13
11,Perfect Hotel,"The Majestic Hotel was elegant with excellent service and in a great location.  The room was larger than most European Hotels and was very clean.  Toilet was also large with a separate bath, shower and toilet area.  A double sink was also provided.  Would highly recommend this hotel",5,2014,05,12
11,Lovely hotel,"My husband and I spent 4 nights at this hotel.  The hotel itself is in the ""ritzy"" area as it is mixed with high end stores.  We felt like royalty at accommodating prices.  The room was clean and very modern.  It is within walking distance to La Rambla and other tourist attractions, including the beach.  We took advantage of the spa and had a very relaxing massage our last night.  We will definitely stay at this hotel the next time we travel to Barcelona.",5,2014,05,12
11,Well deserving of 5-star rating,"Pros- Location -walkable to everything, Interior, Quality of Room, Water Pressure, Rooftop Pool & Bar, Amazing Breakfast Buffett, Attention to detail by staff, Good money exchange rate, Quality of linen/bed, Attention to detail by housekeeping staff, daily chocolates with each turn down service, bathrobe usage, bathrobe for our baby, complimentary bath slippers, Bvlgari shower/bath amenities, exquisite lounge in lobby with piano player, attention to detail for our baby and were very pro-child, high bandwidth Wi-Fi included.  High-quality iron and hair-dryer, wonderful guest relations team (ie- Almudena).

Cons- Pricy, Weird water temp fluctuation during shower once.  Also our 3 night stay was part of larger vacation package so unsure which of the above amenities would be included.",5,2014,05,12
11,"Perfect location, elegant hotel","My daughter and I stayed at Majestic Hotel for a week.  We wanted to visit as many Gaudi sites as possible and this was the perfect location.  We could see Casa Batlló from our room and Casa Milà was just down the street.  We walked to La Rambla, Gothic Quarter, the beach, and it was a quick and easy metro trip to anywhere else in the city because the metro stop is right across the street.  

The staff was always friendly and helpful- the breakfast was a sheer delight as it is my favorite meal.  Definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2014,05,11
11,Did not meet luxury expectations,"We stayed at the Apartments of the Majestic Hotel, which are located in a building across the road from the Hotel, right on Passeig de Gracia. We stayed as a family of four in a two bed apartment. The location was superb. The experience of the Apartment was mixed. The living area was terrific. Large, light-filled and comfortable with a balcony out over the street. It was delightful looking out onto the Passeig de Gracia and for me there is no better location in Barcelona. The kitchen area was fine in itself, and decently equipped, except that nespresso capsules were not provided for the coffee machine (we had to go down the road to buy them) and there was no dishwasher powder/tabs provided to use the dishwasher machine or any powder/liquid provided for the washing machine (we had to go to a supermarket to buy these things just to be able to use the kitchen/laundry properly). There was no complimentary apartment cleaning provided or even a change of towels for a 5 night stay. These could be obtained for a pretty ridiculous additional charge. All of these things were poor, I thought, for a property promoted as luxury and charging premium rates accordingly. The bathroom products provided were minimal. The shower temperature was temperamental and difficult to control. The bedrooms were dark and could feel pretty gloomy. As if to emphasis their lack of natural light, the bedroom lighting was dull. There were strange noises in the very early morning, as if there was a water pipe running through the wall of the bedroom carrying the water discharged from the apartments above.  It was disconcerting at first, and just annoying after that. The staff across the road at the Hotel were pleasant and helpful. The rooftop pool area at the Hotel was wonderful, with stunning views over the cityscape. Overall, though, at their premium price point, I am afraid I just couldn't recommend the Majestic Apartments.",3,2014,05,08
11,Lovely stay,"Enjoyed a lovely 3 night weekend for a birthday celebration. Chose the hotel as we ve stayed 2 x before and it's my partners favourite. Previously in winter this has been a bit better value and I do think even with a upgrade to a city view it's pushing the limit of value . I m sure others will disagree.
As definitely expected at this level nice toiletries turn down service with chocolates good hair dryer - tho I assume they must expect to have them pinched as they are plugged permanently into the bathroom plug where you have no option but to stand and dry your hair - a man with long hair has not tried this out!?
The 1e charge for an nespresso pod is really penny pinching surely they could run to a couple a day - I m sure the Nespresso flagship store can do a great deal or already has for having the machines  in the room. We just did without I d rather pay 1.3 e at a cafe!
The roof deck is lovely for  a relaxing chill out - tho we were not offered towels which was a slip on service. 
I confess having notified the hotel and being return guests I probably hoped for some birthday touch after all it was my partners 70th - a card saying happy birthday would have shown some personal service which I thought was lacking . In many hotels across the world I ve had various celebratory occasions marked and just a small gesture makes you feel special 

29 e for breakfast is top end and we chose to save ourselves for leisurely lunches in the sun at Barceloneta 

I will say the staff were very friendly with out exception 

We come to Barcelona every year - have stayed at most of the top rated TA recommendations - we love the location of the Majestic but for us at this price it will only be for a special celebration",4,2014,05,08
11,"""Good Hotel For A City Break""","As a reasonably well travelled reviewer I have given my mark as 3 on the basis of The Majestic pricing & advertising itself as a luxury 5* hotel. Whilst a lovely hotel & in a great location it simply does not compare to other 5* hotels I have previously stayed. 
The rooms are perfectly nice with excellent bathroom facility & very comfortable beds. But,why as other reviewers have commented on are there not complimentary bottled water & coffee in rooms. These little things are really standard in most hotels now & a simple cheap compliment to the room. 
I think the main feature of the hotel has to be the rooftop bar. Stunning & a fabulous location for a chilled glass of wine. Excellent views across the city. 
Would happily stay again but it really did not feel a luxury hotel.",3,2014,05,08
11,Great Hotel,"We were at the Majestic Hotel for two nights and had a wonderful experience.  The check in
process was fantastic and quick.  The staff were very helpful and seemed to really like their
job of making us feel at home.  Our rooms were small, very nicely decorated and the bathroom all white marble.  They provided the amenities one expects at a luxury hotel.  They have a 
lovely rooftop garden bar.  Fantastic views.  The concierge made our reservations at two
different restaurants which they recommeded to us.  We were very pleased with both 
meals.  Would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again.  Great location to walk to most of the
important sites.",5,2014,05,07
11,Choose your room well,"We stayed four nights at this ideally-located hotel. Rooms are very clean and spacious, but I must warn readers NOT to book any odd-numbered room on the first floor. They face either a blank wall or a drab concrete courtyard. Indeed, suite 147, good for 3, had frosted windows that were sealed shut. It was like being in a cave. Room 149, my friend's room, felt like the inside stateroom of a cruise ship. I transferred to room 136 on the third day, and it had a nice view of a tree-lined street. Wifi connection was fast and free. No complimentary water, but you can easily buy water in the convenience stores- 60 cents for 3 big bottles. The room amenities are Bulgari and smell heavenly, and the housekeeping staff would bring whatever else I needed, within minutes. The front desk and concierge try their best; they got us tickets to Camp nou and a concert. But 3 out of 4 of their restaurant recommendations were duds. The gym has all the standard equipment, & is just the right size. We went up to the rooftop terrace and took some amazing pictures of the Barcelona skyline. My biggest beef with this hotel is the very rude and brusque service at breakfast, every day of the four mornings we ate there. The food is good and the chef making the eggs was very courteous. But the place was just too cramped & busy, and the waiters too harassed, to make eating there worth your while.",2,2014,05,07
11,Not cheap,"Just spent three nights at the Majestic in a standard room, its quite a walk to La Rambla but in a quiet area which you need after a day of sight seeing and any closer would be very noisy and hectic. The staff were fantastic and nothing was to much trouble my only complaint is the shower it goes hot cold hot cold and dont flush the toilet when someone is in the shower, nearly scolded myself several times. Our room was very small but very functional room 750 view was horrible but who sits and looks out the window on holidays. Lots of restaurants nearby for breakfast and dinner we didnt eat at the Hotel. DO NOT try the tapas down the road on the same side of the hotel I think its called Tapa Tapa just horrible. We would not hesitate to stay again but we paid something like $450 a night, it was a holiday weekend so the prices went up.",4,2014,05,04
11,Top class hotel,"My wife and I and our two children stayed here recently. Having been to Barcelona frequently over the last few years we normally stay nearer the beach but this trip the city stay was brilliant for shopping (Wife & daughter) as well as being close to so many cultural and interesting districts. The service in the hotel was at all times friendly and attentive, the food fantastic and the services and amenities was first class.
The only downside we found was the noise levels from the street are still pretty loud, even with the hotels double glazed windows - we frequently awoke in the middle of the night to ambulance noises and garbage collections, so you will have to take that into consideration if you are bringing children. Aside from that the rooms were stylish, we had in-room mini bar service, Nespresso coffee machine and capsules, wide screen TV, complimentary wine, rose and gift etc, and the hotel offers Spa treatments and lovely breakfast offerings. All in all a great place for a break, just bring earplugs if your room faces the streets!",4,2014,04,30
11,"Location, luxury, rooftop view of Sagrada Familia","We stayed here for three nights over Easter vacation. This was our twelfth trip to Barcelona, but our very first time to try the Majestic. We loved the Paseo de Gracia location, the highly comfortable and spacious room, the attentive, excellent service, and the amazing rooftop deck with views of the Sagrada Familia! We'll definitely stay there again.
Our room was on the second floor (201), overlooking the Paseo de Gracia and directly above the Chanel store (room was so well-insulated that street noise was never a problem). There was a king-sized bed, separate sitting area, and two televisions. The bed (and pillows), among the most comfortable ever.
The Nespresso machine in the room was a huge plus. Bulgari White Tea bath amenities were lovely.
Because we were so busy doing tourist activities, we didn't use as many of the hotel's amenities that we usually do (Fitness Center, spa, restaurants) but did check out the rooftop bar (amazing views, as mentioned earlier) and the breakfast room (fine, but go early because it gets really crowded).
Very international personnel and clientele.

11,Jan and Yvonne: Excellent  hotel. The employees are very kind and deliver a high-level service,"This 5+ star Hotel is on the best location, near to the centre in a high-end area.
The rooms have a high-level quality and the space of the room you will like it. 
Roof terrace is wonderfull, the view on Sagrada Familia and the rest of Barcelona is perfect.
The staff is from a high-level service and very kind. Bathrooms are very nice. 
The building is in the heart of the exclusive shopping area. Also have a diner on the restaurant Tragaluz. 
When you visit Barcelona, do not forget to go for a drink or diner to Plaza Reial, near to La Ramblas. Have a walk in the El Borne area. 
Also in the evening diner on Opium Mar and stay there in the club you will enjoy.",5,2014,04,24
11,Perfect base for a city break,"My wife and I recently spent 5 nights at the Majestic - a rare treat to get away without the kids! We were delighted with the quality of service we received at this hotel. The location is first class: you are straight on to one of the classiest streets in Barcelona and a short walk from the main square, Ramblas and also 2 Gaudi attractions. The staff looked after us superbly well, with special mentions to Tim, Norman and Carlos on the door. Using the concierge to book restaurants and advising on trips, etc was really useful. Another highlight was the roof terrace, which was a great place to chill out with a drink or two at the end of a busy day, before getting ready for dinner. Would definitely recommend this hotel - you will not be disappointed.",5,2014,04,23
11,Heart of the action !,"An excellent stay at Majestic hotel! The hotel is perfectly located on the most exclusive shopping street in Barcelona, Passeig De Gracia. Fantastic roof bar and terrace with views of La Sagrada Familia. Helpful concierge which arranged a private tour guide and a VIP table at a great club called Opium. Make sure you try and get a reservation at the 2 star Lasarte and have a drink at Boca Chica which are both just a few minutes walk from the hotel!",5,2014,04,22
11,"Fantastic hotel, fantastic employees made for a memorable stay","I would highly recommend this hotel to all. I stayed here last week for 5 ngts (leading up to Easter) and from the moment I arrived I was treated like a king. Everyone was very friendly and very helpful. The people at the frontdesk book all my tickets for the area attractions along with making my nightly dinner reservations at area restaurants. The hotel is located within walking distance to many attractions, but at times just opted to jump into a taxi for the short inexpensive ride. The metro station is also nearby.",5,2014,04,22
11,Nice...,"A very nice hotel located in a good location for transportation and shopping (to and from airport, metro and tourists hop-on-hop off buses.

Couldn't fault the service from the front desk to houskeeping.  

The only fault is the room - the walls were quite thin and was able to hear next door neighbour's TV and door closing.

It wasn't cheap as it was based on room only so ate breakfast at the cafe/bar next door to the hotel (which was very good). There are lots of tapas bars/cafes in Barcelona so shouldn't be any problems in finding something to eat but we got caught out once where we had the wrong dress code so one would need to check.

Bought a 2-day hop-on-hop-off bus ticket which covered east and west of Barcelona so no problems in covering the main tourist sights.

Local transport to and from airport takes 30 mins.",4,2014,04,22
11,Easter holidays with a baby,"Great hotel at a great location in Passeig De Gracia only 10 minutes walk from Placa De Catalunya. It is located in a area with lots of bars-restaurants and shops and close to Casa Batillo and La Pedrera. Sagrada Familia is a 20 minutes walk away from the hotel and that is a recommmended trip in Barcelona streets in beautiful weather. 
 
The hotel offers great services and is very helpful. We got a free upgrade as we stayed with our 6 months old baby with a trolley and that is great service. The hotel prices is a bit expensive, but thats something you must expect at a Gran Luxe hotel. The breakfast was great and offers good choices. The rooftop bar is fantastic and the view is great. The pool is small, but its ok.",5,2014,04,22
11,"Great hotel, great location, great service",A wonderful hotel perfectly located on the most exclusive shopping street in Barcelona. Fantastic roof terasse with a view of both water and La Segrada Familia. Fantastic service and very friendly staff. Will definitely come back!,5,2014,04,21
11,Superior hotel in a central location,"Visited Barcelona 3/23-3/31 for a week's vacation and stayed at the Majestic.  Found the hotel to be in a great central location and within walking distance to most attractions.  The service was excellent overall and the staff very helpful.  We were granted early check-in on arrival and provided with complimentary champagne which was very nice.  Hotel has free wi-fi which and a terrific lobby bar with a chef which were also great.  Only disappointments were that we requested double bed but was given 2 singles pushed together, and being sent by concierge to some unimpressive restaurants (including Telerific and Barceloneta), as well as a dreadful Flamenco performance at El Cordobes.  I am sure that the concierge was just being helpful, but I would advise that you pass on these very tourist oriented attractions.",4,2014,04,20
11,Luxurious," It was luxurious, friendly staff,great management , great location and simply amazing. It was what we were looking for. We do recommend the hotel rooms more than the appartments. However, they may be a good option for people staying for a month or longer ",5,2014,04,19
11,Love love love this hotel! :-),"Myself and my partner stayed here for 3 nights, we have just returned from a first visit to Barcelona and I can highly recommend this hotel. The breakfast was the best selection I have had abroad,  staff were friendly and any time we asked about places to visit, full details we printed off for us in English. The hotel is very nicely decorated, and has a welcoming homely feel, water was always hot and room and bathroom were both immaculate.  Surprisingly quiet at night considering it is right in the heart of the city, beds were very comfortable,  my only negative was that the beds were twins pushed together and so you had to be aware of the gap.....not what you want when your away for a romantic break. ",4,2014,04,18
11,Exceptional & Indulgent,"The Majestic is a beautiful and very special hotel, just perfect! We received an email a few days prior to our arrival requesting that we complete a questionnaire so they could prepare for our arrival. In response I asked for extra pillows, an iron and ironing board and these were provided instantly on check-in.

I had requested an early check-in as we arrived after a long haul flight from Australia.  The staff were so friendly and accommodating and we were quickly shown to our room. Problems that often spoil a hotel stay for us even at the five star level were nowhere to be found. The air conditioner worked, was not noisy or too warm to sleep under a duvet. The windows can be opened if desired but the room is completely quite if you keep them closed. The pillows were comfortable and the bed (although 2 pushed together) was wonderful. The bathroom was large with a separate toilet, plenty of vanity space and a huge tub with a rain shower over it. And definitely indulgent are the Bvlgari bath products just divine and these were generously replenished daily! There was a kettle in the room as well as a pod coffee machine. The only thing missing was a full-length mirror as the mirrored doors are set into wooden decorative frames.

We have travelled extensively around the world and the Majestic breakfast buffet is possibly the best we've experienced. So much choice of fresh high quality and artisanale produce and the chef personally delivered my poached eggs to our table.

The hotel is very well located and there is a taxi rank virtually at the front door. It is convenient to many restaurants and attractions.",5,2014,04,18
11,Unforgettable,"We spent 4 days at Le Majestic Hotel & Spa in Barcelona. This was our first time at the hotel. From our arrival, all of the staff were warm and welcoming. After check-in we were escorted to our room, which was elegant, by the manager on duty. We had a beautiful and very quite Junior Suite overlooking the street La Rambla. 

We enjoyed the bar on the rooftop, which had excellent drinks, service and an amzing view. 

The service was excellent in other areas too. The concierge was outstanding and advice us for a flamenco show and very good tapas restaurants.

Each morning we had breakfast in the main restaurant. The buffet is very qualitative and you can find whatever you can expect in a 5 star hotel.

This is not an inexpensive hotel but the staff, hotel and location have made it our hotel of choice when in Barcelona. We're already in the process of planning our next trip there. 

Don't hesitate, just go for it !",5,2014,04,18
11,Fabulous Hotel,"Have just spent 4 nights at the Majestic and loved everything about it. From the moment we arrived we were looked after by friendly, helpful and enthusiastic staff. Their eye for detail is exceptional and the breakfast cannot be beaten. 
I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel, especially for couples.",5,2014,04,17
11,Hotel customer service as it should be..,"Stayed here on vacation to celebrate my wife's birthday. I had never been to Barcelona before and checked out all the best hotels on TA. This one stood out for me in terms of location and previous reviews. I was pleased I made the right choice and this was a great decision. From the minute we turned up in a taxi from the time we left, the hotel staff were truly excellent. The check-in was best described as 'personal' and I felt that I was being welcomed into someones house. We were upgraded to a room with a tiny balcony and a birthday card and bottle of Cava was on ice for my wife which was a nice touch. The room is luxurious and the bathroom too with high end shampoos and soaps etc. It also had a Nespresso coffe machine too. The rooftop bar is impressive with a small pool (too cold for a dip at that time) The bar is luxurious with excellent service. The breakfast was superb with a lot of local food (bread, cheeses, hams and fresh tomatoes) We didnt have time for the Spa due to sightseeing and of course shopping! When we left, the manager came along to personally say goodbye and thank us for coming to the hotel. We have already recommended this hotel to our friends (who stayed here last week and loved it too) We will be back for sure! This is a luxury 5 star +++ hotel!",5,2014,04,17
11,Majestic Hotel,"We adored staying here; a tad expensive but worth being in the lap of luxury plus being able to walk to Gaudi's Expiratory Temple, Barri Gotic quarter, palace of music, Rambla Blvd, La Boqueria - the market hall and so much more.  It is central to everything with a bar on top with a view to die for.  We even walked to one of our favorite restaurants, El Tragaluz, which was a treat all in itself. You'd be missing out on a lot if you didn't pick this hotel for your stay in Barcelona!!!",5,2014,04,17
11,Wonderful experience in Barcelona,"Best location on Gracia street, Champs-elysee or Rodeo drive in Barcelona. Bottom floor is Channel store. Roof top terrace bar is beautiful to look high line of Barcelona including Sagrada Familia. Service is perfect and friendly. room was elegant and spacious. My first choice when I go to Barcelona. One thing disappointed was that they even charged nespresso capsule in the room. ",5,2014,04,16
11,Six stars,"One of the finest hotels I have ever stayed in.  The entire staff has the service excellence approach to everything. Everyone smiles, and greets you. The manager we met Fernando, set the tone from the beginning.  Rooms well furnished, food and drinks great and perfect location. It is expensive but you truly get a great experience here.",5,2014,04,12

11,Beautiful hotel in a beautiful city,"My mom and I stayed 2 nights at the Majestic.  We arrived early on a Saturday morning and were warmly greeted by the hotel staff.  They held our bags for us while we enjoyed the city until we could check in at 3pm.  When we arrived back to the hotel, we received a pleasant surprise that they had upgraded our room. The room was lovely and had plenty of space. The rooftop bar was quite the scene with a fantastic view of the city. This was one of our favorite hotels in Spain and would highly recommend it to our friends and family.",5,2014,04,08

Hotel and staff extremely accomodationg.  WORTH YOUR STAY.",5,2014,04,08
11,"Excellent location, but sorely lacking in personability","We stayed at the Majestic Hotel for a total of 6 nights on our recent trip to Spain.  Barcelona was our first stop.  Our stay at this hotel is a somewhat mixed bag of good with the bad.

Arriving at El Prat early in the morning after a 13 hour flight, a taxi ride took us to the Majestic Hotel in a short 30 minutes, €34 inclusive of airport surcharge.  The taxi dropped us at a pedestrian curb just outside of the hotel's front door.  Strangely, no one seemed to be attending the front door, perhaps too early in the day?  My spouse and I were wheeling our 2 large suitcases towards the hotel when we were finally intercepted by a doorman, who took over our suitcases and alerted the receptionist to our arrival.  But there you have it, our first impression of this hotel has just been somewhat dented.

I can only describe our check in experience as strange, this being a 5 star luxury hotel.  Check in was somewhat slow.  Strange because we were the only guests being attended to at that time.  We were told to wait, while the 3 receptionists at the front desk were shuffling around and talking to each other.  We were finally attended to, paperwork was completed quickly and efficiently, but very much lacking in a warm welcome.  The gentleman attending to us did so almost begrudgingly.  He then informed us that our room was not ready yet, he does not know when the room will be ready, check in time is at 3 pm, maybe the room will be ready by then, maybe not because they were running at full capacity, and told us to check back in with them.  This very uninviting information left me somewhat speechless. I then asked for a map of the area and maybe some ideas of what we can do during this period of time.  A map was produced, X marks where were are, he suggested we pay €29 (?) per person for breakfast at the hotel, and that was all the information we received.  Again, perhaps too early in the day for friendlier and more helpful service?

We returned a few hours later, and this time a young lady attended to us.  She informed us our room was now ready, apologised for the wait and we were escorted us to our Deluxe Executive room.  Our luggage was brought up a short while later.  

The room itself was very nice, spacious, twin beds put together.  Separate entrance to the room, and large seating area complete with Nespresso machine.  Coffee pods were placed such that they looked like they were complimentary, but they are not and were chargeable at €1 each. No complimentary mineral water was provided.  Beds were comfortable and afforded a good nights' sleep, but they were on wheels, so have a tendency to move apart.  Bathroom was spacious and clean, toilet area was separated by a mirrored sliding door. Amenities provided were generous and from Bvlgari. Handheld shower and rain shower over the bathtub, shower somewhat lacked consistency, pressure or temperature. Towels hung neatly on a heated towel rack.  Turn down service was provided every night and standards were consistent.

What was incredibly disappointing was, at booking, I had indicate my wish for a deluxe executive room away from the lifts, and one which comes with 2 sinks in the bathroom.  Were my requests completely misread?  I received exactly what I did not want, our room was the first one immediately outside the lift, and the bathroom had 1 sink. 

Our stay was broken up in 2 tranches, and we returned to the hotel 2 weeks later and rechecked into a standard deluxe room.  Thankfully, re-check in was a lot smoother than our first experience.  Our taxi was greeted by a doorman even before we alighted.  The standard deluxe was actually almost as spacious as an executive deluxe, with the same amenities and almost the same layout, minus the leather sofa seating area.  It was however incredibly noisy due to a persistent fussing baby who was being walked along the corridor, but the hotel cannot be faulted on this. 

I had picked this hotel primarily due to its location, and in this at least we were not disappointed.  Incredibly centrally located, right on the beautiful tree-lined boulevard, close to all the shops on Passeig de Gracias, Casa Batlo and Casa Mila were both within walking distance.  The Passeig de Gracias metro station was almost right outside the hotel, so transport around the city was incredibly convenient.

Our interaction with the concierge was minimal.  Concierge assisted us on one night, when we asked for dinner suggestions.  We were directed to an extremely crowded, noisy touristy tapas bar near the hotel.  When I inquired on some restaurants around the city, which I understand are rather famous, whether they were any good, I was informed that she had never heard of them.  

So, overall, not a bad stay, just not a very good one.  With this hotel, for us at least, location was really the only thing the hotel had going for it, there are lots of other hotels of the same standard in the area.  I was just surprised by the lacklustre service at a hotel of this calibre.  Maybe our expectations were too high, maybe we were just unlucky, maybe the hotel staff had an off day.  Would we return?  Maybe not, since there are other equally good alternatives in the same area.",3,2014,04,07
11,Highly Recommend!,"My husband and I spent 2 nights at the Majestic, and we wished we could have stayed longer!!!
Beautiful inside and out.  Loved the hotel from the moment we walked into the lobby and reception area, where we were greeted warmly by the attentive staff.  Our room had every amenity and was very attractive and comfortable.  The first floor had a bar lounge/piano bar area that we thoroughly enjoyed.  We had planned to go out for a quick bite and drink in the afternoon, but the piano bar lounge was so inviting that we decided to try it. We were glad we did as the food, music, and service was wonderful.  This hotel concierge was helpful with dinner reservations, and we could not have been more pleased. We highly recommend the Majestic based on our personal experience there.",5,2014,04,02
11,Luxury with a smile,"Four times we have stayed at The Majestic. Four times The Majestic has delivered on its promise. This is a luxury getaway that improves with each new tasting, and always welcomes you back with warmth. The rooms are beautifully appointed, the bathroom accessories all quality. The baths are BIG - great way to relax after a day of walking Barcelona. The roof bar the perfect end to a day, whether with a cigar and scotch or a simple, ice-cold beer.

From the moment you arrive, a doorman greets you from your taxi, takes command of your luggage and escorts you to the lobby for an expeditious check-in. Its efficiency with a smile, and luxury to papmer yourslef when you most need it.",5,2014,04,02
11,5 Star Excellence,"Fabulous is the description that comes to mind for this hotel!

We stayed for four nights in March 2014 for our 40th Wedding Anniverary. This our first visit to Barcelona, it was a true delight.
 
The 5 star luxury Majestic hotel stands majestic in the Passaig de Gracia, probably the most prestigous and attractive tree lined street in Barcelona. A variety of restaurants and cafes to choose from without over stretching the legs. Away from the noisy Las Ramblas, but within a 10 minute walking distance. With Gaudi buildings sharing Passaig de Gracia, a busy but elegant street and a 20 minute walk from the fabulous Sagrada Familia. The Plaça Catalunya is a few minutes walk away, where you will find the tourist bus and metro connections. Also metro stop metres away from hotel, on a bus route and with a taxi rank directly outside the hotel, this makes this hotel is very accessible!  

We recommend this fabulous hotel 100%, its facilities, its position, but most of all the friendly and accommodating staff, the customer service is in our opinion sets this hotel apart the rest.

We lovely the facilities, attentiveness of the staff, and would fully recommend it. We are not able to comment on the breakfast or the spa. For breakfast we eat out at local cafes and a tapas bar. Although I believe the breakfast is very good.",5,2014,03,31
11,WOOW - THANK YOU!  - ALL - It's worth reading my review!,"I have two words to say about this hotel.
""Woow, Woow""!.

In Details:

We spent 7 days in the hotels, so it's worth to read it!.

Service:

Best Ever - 
Our vacation started two weeks before our arrival, when I called them to verify our reservations and to request from special treatment because my spouse birthday.

The very same day the guest relation department reply back within email and re-confirm all of my requests and started to offer me some attraction which some was free of charge even.

One day before our arrival, I called again just to ensure they didn't forget me, (Sorry, I am like that), when I just said my last name ALL of the conversations that I had with them two weeks before popped up and they just re-confirm that I have nothing to worry about!.

Our Arrival:

Well, The moment we stepped in to this magnificent hotel, the front desk person (Mr Carlos) was very much nice to us, he introduce use to 
Mr. Alvaro 
from guest relation and where he (Alvaro) was one of a KIND. 
THANK YOU!. 
He let us feel like we ""own"" the hotel and answer all of our requests even when he didn't promise anything it was felt like he is going to do all in his power to make our vacation the best ever. He also ""reminds"" me that my spouse has a birth day in few more days and everything is cover. Indeed, few days later, we came to our room and a nice gesture waited to my wife from the hotel with printed card. 
I didn't even have to remind it. Mr Alvaro also came to our hotel and they (Guest Relation) provide us a very nice gift to our upcoming maybe. He and the entire team make our vacation the BEST ever. 
And we didn't even pay for it!. Well, we thought that it was because I asked it but when we checked with some other guests in the hotel, it seems that Mr. Alvaro treat to everybody like that!. I have no idea how he has the energy but THANK YOU again, and thank to the entire guest relation to Ms Susana, to the front desk Mr Carols, and security team (sorry didn't get all the name) from the entire hotel that helped us and make us feel special and 
THANK YOU AGAIN Mr. Alvaro Canales.

Rooms:

We booked the standard room. 
We got a Standard room with a balcony facing the street. 
The size of the room is good size for 7 days stay! The bathroom is very big with two sinks, (I think its in all rooms), also the bed was OK. (The only downside was that it was two beds combine into one bed, but the hotel put some strong cover on top of the two beds and it felt like one).

Cleaning: 
I am not sure why they clean the room twice a day. I am use to have one time cleaning and at night just fresh towels and checking if everything is OK, but in this hotel, they put extra thought about cleaning and about the service that provide of the room. Well done!. Bathroom tub is very big and comfortable for standard room. 
There is an iron board and an iron, safety deposit, mini bar, coffee machine and coffee (The coffee cost money), and if you want you can ask for a kettle and they will provide you free of charge. (For us it was awesome). Overall rated of room is fantastic. For 7 days it's more than enough so just imagine for those who come for day or two…

Location:
It's in the center of the center. Some people might get mistake that La Rambles it’s the center, well it is, but in our opinion, this location is much nicer, first of all its only 7 min walk to La Rambles and this location is in the middle of one of the biggest (If not the biggest) shopping street. 
Close to all major attraction by foot. Metro station just crosses the corner. 

$:

The hotel is not cheap but it worth EVERY DIME!. You get what you pay for! No Tricks.

Summary:

It might sound from the above wordings that we are too excited about the hotel, well, first of all yes! But it is imperative for me to indicate that I traveled in so many places around the globe and stayed in a lot of exotics places and nice hotels and I don't write very often and not enthusiastic about services or locations or nice rooms, BUT this hotel was indeed one of the best places that I stayed.  
We defiantly come back to this chain and again from behalf of my spouse and me. 
THANK YOU for wonderful 7 days!",5,2014,03,31
11,Real 5 star experience,"Recently stayed at subject hotel and received true 5 star treatment.  Even before we arrived (hotel contacted us prior to arrival to inquire on our interest), they catered to our every need.  We were quickly greeted by doorman and bellhops as we departed our car and after checking-in, we were escorted to our suite and provided instructions on all facets of rooms.  Hotel provided us a bottle of champagne (maybe because we were in a suite??) but since it was not very cold, we found another bottle in our room upon returning from dinner.  Champagne breakfast every day was excellent and plenty of items to choose from.  Concierge was very helpful as was all of staff.  Great location in center of city just steps from underground, many nearby restaurants and plenty of high-end shopping.  Easy walking distance to La Rambla and 2 Gaudi house.  Spend the extra money and stay at this hotel and maybe even upgrade to a suite.",5,2014,03,29
11,Perfect service,"One of the best experience I had in a 5* in Europe!

The service quality in this hotel is really good. The employees are all kind and ready to help you - no matter what is your request.

Room is great with a huge bathroom and confortable beds, good wifi connexion.

Hotel is near everything you need to visit when you don't have a lot of time. All good shopping addresses in the area.

Will definetly come back!",5,2014,03,28
11,Amazing!!!!!,"We stayed at the Majestic for two nights leading up to our Cruise which left from Barcelona, and it was the best decision we ever made.  It was our Honeymoon and we were upgraded to a Suite which was incredible.  The service was fantastic, the amenities were great, and the rooftop bar was a pleasant place to go for a drink before heading out to dinner.  The location is perfect, a decent walk to La Rambla and other attractions, and the hop-on hop-off tour buses stop right outside.  This is not a hotel for the thrifty, but it's well worth the price.  We loved our stay at the Majestic, and would go again in a heartbeat.",5,2014,03,28
11,Unfriendly service,"Stayed in the Majestic for a business trip recently and rarely encountered a worse concierge service  team in all my life. Unfriendly and not at all cooperative, giving wrong information about restaurants and booking tables for the wrong amount of people, etc. Reception staff is much better, but upon arrival we received an extremely dark room, with water stains on the walls and only after we asked for another room, we were given something ok.
Given the pricing of the location and the various alternatives in town, I would not book this hotel again.",2,2014,03,28
11,Delightful 4 days at the Majestic in March with two teens,"Our family of four includes two teens and we just got back from a wonderful visit to The Majestic.  Each staff member was smiling, delightful, welcoming, gracious and helpful.  Our rooms were lovely and overlooked the Sagrada Familia.  The hotel's location is ideal and the breakfast is outstanding.  We were all particularly impressed, however, with every hotel employee with whom we interacted.  Everyone was terrific.  This is a wonderful and especially well-run hotel and we look forward to returning.",5,2014,03,27
11,Family of 5 with teens 3/16-3/21,"We checked in on Sunday morning to find our Junior Suite and adjoining room had been upgraded to a suite and an executive room..  It was on the seventh floor overlooking Passeig de Gracia and it was stunning. The rooms were very quiet while taking our daily siesta.  The concierge was on point on all directions to events, restaurant recommendations, and how and when to best traverse Las Ramblas.  We used the rooftop lounge daily for drinks and snacks enjoying the view of Barcelona.  We would stay here again in a heart beat.",5,2014,03,25
11,Modern Comfort,"My husband and I recently returned home from a trip to Barcelona where we spent three nights at the Majestic Hotel.  The hotel is located in a very upscale area of the city with wonderful high end shopping nearby and, for added convenience, there is a Metro stop just a couple of blocks away for easy access to some of the sights a little further away.  Our room was a little small but well appointed with a private balcony and a nice bathroom with a rain shower and separate water closet.  Be sure to check out the terrace bar on the 10th floor for a spectacular view of the city!",4,2014,03,24
11,"Great location, Friendly Staff, Luxury Hotel","My husband and I just returned from our honeymoon and our second stop was in Barcelona.  It was our first time there and this hotel was such a treat.  We arrived early (around 11am) and we were greeted by a friendly gentleman with a top hat (I wish we asked for his name) and he escorted us to the lobby and had our bags taken care of.  We were checked in by Fernando.  He was extremely friendly and warm and our room was ready for us.  Then, Carlos accompanied us and our two large bags to our room as he gave us tips on the hotel (spa, brunch, business center, rooftop bar).  He even showed us around the room and was so helpful.  The room was immaculate and clean.  We only stayed for two nights but wished we extended our stay because we felt so spoiled.  Since our departure flight was in the evening and we were scheduled for a morning tour, we were in a dilemma on when to check out and where to put our bags, but Cristina gave us a late check out at 2pm with no problem.  

The hotel is right in the middle of Paseo de Garcia with all the fancy shopping and restaurants just steps away.  Chanel is right next door and Casa Batilo is less than two blocks away.  

The only thing I wished they had was an actual ""couples massage"" because the hotel is so romantic.  We asked for a couples massage, but we were in separate rooms.  I don't think the rooms are big enough in the spa to accommodate for a couples massage, but that is one thing I would suggest.  It was really expensive, but relaxing.",4,2014,03,24
11,Hotel majestic,"Very nice hotel.  Great location.  Rooms were a little small, but ok.  Hotel staff was exceptional with assistance on site seeing and information. Great rooftop pool and bar to see the entire city. Only major drawback was the price of the morning breakfast, but there are many places around to get something.",4,2014,03,23
11,called 5 star for a reason,"The Majestic Hotel, besides for its ideal location, also offers the most perfect amenities within the hotel. Everything is open late, the patio is beautiful, and the front desk could not be friendlier. The only pick -- the wifi was not PERFECT. We had to insert our code in everyday. 
They said that this is about to change. So if your going to stay there in 2 months or so -- even more perfect.",5,2014,03,23
11,Lovely hotel in convenient location,"This is a lovely hotel situated in an ideal location to see the sites in Barcelona. We stayed here for two nights.

We took a taxi from the airport to hotel which cost just over 25 euros, and arrived at our hotel just after 12 in the afternoon. We were checked in straight away and show to our room. The room was lovely and spacious, with a lovely big bath. The bed was really comfortable and I had a good nights sleep on both nights we stayed here. The only downside and the 2 reason's I have given it a 4, is that the you have to pay for the coffee in the room. This is the only hotel I have ever stayed in where I have had to pay for coffee in the room - 1 euro per pod. The other reason is that the wi-fi (even though free) did not work very well in the room.

We found all the staff very friendly and helpful. The roof top bar with its 360 view of Barcelona is a must and was an excellent place to have a drink in the evening.

The location of the hotel is also excellent, about a 15/20 minute walk from La Ramble and a block away from two of Gaudi's houses. We took a taxi to the Sagrada Familia (about 10 minutes) which is a must see.

We did not eat in the hotel so I cannot comment on the food, but all in all an excellent place to stay.",4,2014,03,23
11,Most luxurious place to stay in Barcelona,"You can't get any better than the Majestic Hotel. The rooms were spacious and spotless and the location on the Passeig de Gracia, was perfect. It is walking distance to the important Antoni Gaudi houses and La Rambla, the main walking street. The staff is accessible and helpful with all your touring needs. Their breakfasts were a wonderful blend of hot eggs and cold hams and pastries….and great American coffee.",5,2014,03,22
11,"Great hotel, but with sick building syndrome.","
I don't know why this has not come up in other reviews, but I'm allergic to mold (pennicillin, blue cheese, etc) so perhaps I'm more sensitive. Everything about this hotel is great except for one thing. 

Stepping off the elevator, I was almost knocked over by the smell of mildew. When I got into my room, I thought it had faded, but turns out my sense of smell had been overwhelmed instead. 

Within the room, I could never figure out where the smell was coming from, but it made my nose stuff up and made my eyes burn. I could still sleep in the room if I kept the window all the way open and got a breeze to clear out the mold, but it was tough going. I've never before had asthma, but during my stay here I surely did.

Notice that none of the rooms (from what I can tell) have any real ventilation. All the air conditioners just circulate moldy air within the rooms. If you don't open the window there will be no fresh air at all.

This hotel needs to get some ventilation and get the mold problem under control. 

If they do that, I would recommend this hotel. If you are immune to mold, four stars, otherwise one star.

11,Majestic Hotel Barcelone,"We stayed at the Majestic Hotel for 5 nights on a recent trip to Barcelona. The service, location and attentiveness of the staff was excellent. We did not use the spa but the roof top bar, with its 360 view of Barcelona was a welcome respite after full days of sightseeing. We would return to Barcelona any time, and would always want to make The Majestic Hotel our hotel.",5,2014,03,20
11,birthday weekend away in Barcelona,"This hotel is divine..... after checking out a few on trip advisor, I noticed that the reviews all mentioned how amazing the staff where. Within a day (or less) of booking, I had received an email from Senor Camella, the guest relations manager with answers to all my queries and requests (train station to/from aiport 5 mins away), room with a view, feather pillow, checking out time etc. On arrival we were by the assistant manager and taken to our fabulous room over the main strip with a balcony.  We had drinks on the rooftop terrace (don't miss it either in the evening or in the morning), then wandered off to a local restaurant which served great food (by the way, the tapas bar 2 mins away from the hotel really recommended).  The staff were friendly, helpful and courteous without being stuffy or over bearing.   We had an absolutely wonderful time, completed with a day on the beach, sightseeing, paella and then back to the majestic to pick up luggage for our late night flight home.  I would totally recommend this hotel, for its central location, attention to detail, comfortable and elegant ambiance, but most of all it was the staff that really made our weekend away, together with the fact that they took the time to upgrade our room.  Will always go back there when ever in Barcelona again.",5,2014,03,19
11,Majestic hotel,"I had a wonderful experience at this hotel in Barcelona. It was my first time In Spain and I was traveling solo. They made it luxurious, and try rooftop pool and bar are wonderful. Great view from there of La Familia.",5,2014,03,19
11,Classy Luxury,"We stayed here for 3 nights during our trip and loved every minute. Hotel is located in great neighborhood on paseo de Gracia about a block away from one of the Gaudi houses and metro stops. We never rode the train but I did pick this hotel parking because of its location to transportation. We used the double decker bus as our taxi so to say. With stops all over the city and on/off privileges it just made sense. Majestic is 5 Star all around: Bell hops/concierge/made service/ bath robes to the restaurants. Only flaw was we tended to be more night time people, which I thought most of Spain was too??? In eating dinners around 8pm we never got to experience the roof top bar....which closes at 9pm we found out. Other than that this place was classic elegance at its finest. Would definitely recommend. My 2nd choice was going to be the W, but you'll see once you're there the W location is not walking distance to all the restaurants/shopping like the Majestic is.",5,2014,03,19
11,Absolutely fantastic from start to finish,"My boyfriend and I have just returned from a 3 night break in Barcelona and are so pleased we stayed at the Majestic. Our whole experience was brilliant. Our room was beautiful and attention to detail and cleanliness were second to none. We loved the amazing roof terrace and the staff, without exception, were excellent in every way - so friendly and helpful and couldn't do enough for us. It was the best hotel experience we have ever had and will definitely be back!",5,2014,03,19
11,City break to Barcelona,"My wife and I have just returned from a short break to Barcelona, having stayed at The Majestic Hotel and Spa. Fabulously located in central Barcelona the hotel boasts great staff, great facilities, stunning rooftop terrace bar and super rooms and services. My wife insists that we won't be staying anywhere else when we return! Fabulous experience from start to finish.",5,2014,03,17
11,Excellent hotel in a great central location,Visited twice in 2013 and both times the staff and food were excellent. The rooftop terrace was great fro relaxing with a cocktail and a light bite to eat. Breakfast was the highlight of the day with a great choice of food which kept us going through the whole day.,4,2014,03,17
11,Amazing Experience ,"Stayed in this hotel in February 2014 for my 50th birthday and 25th wedding anniversary.  What a fabulous place we were upgraded and treated to a complimentary bottle of champagne for the occasion.  The staff were fantastic and extremely helpful. We had a fabulous time here and would highly recommend this 
hotel it ticks all the boxes. Well Done. Can't wait to return.   B ",5,2014,03,15
11,Lovely!,"The property is beautiful and the service impeccable.  Great location.  The rooftop terrace is perfect for a sunset cocktail or just to enjoy the view.  I recommend a suite on the 2nd floor, which have balconies.",5,2014,03,15
11,Currently staying - Wonderful hotel!!,"My son and I are currently staying at the Majestic for a four night stay.  The room is very nicely decorated and comfortable.  Typically a smaller room than you might find in the U.S., with twin beds.  However, our experience has been that the staff here is wonderful-very pleasant and helpful.  We ordered room service for dinner and the food was surprisingly delicious.  The wait time for the meal to be delivered was minimal.  The location of the hotel is perfect for shopping or seeing the sites. AA++. If we we return to Barcelona in the future, I would be very pleased to stay here again.",5,2014,03,14
11,Great roof top terrace,"A really nice hotel in the centre of Barcelona with a brilliant rooftop terrace with views across the city roofline.

Efficient and helpful staff, comfortable and well proportioned rooms.

There is little to fault in this hotel except maybe that the food on offer is often a bit too ""international"" rather than Spanish.",4,2014,03,14
11,Fantastic hotel,"My partner & I stayed in the Majestic Hotel & Spa on a recent trip to Barcelona for a long weekend.

It was a fantastic location for sight seeing & extremely close to the metro for trips further a field - You could even see Case Battlo from the roof terrace, which had some spectacular views of Barcelona too.

It was my birthday on our arrival day & the hotel surprised me by upgrading our room & leaving some champagne for us to enjoy.  My partner had also arranged for red roses to be left in the room (which were beautiful) & Ppa treatment - The Spa experience was really positive & the lady was lovely!

It was a wonderful stay & we would not hesitiate to go there again",5,2014,03,14
11,Excellence in every way,"The Majestic has the perfect location. The rooms are very clean, with comfortable bedding.  The breakfast (included) has everything that you could ask for and some things that you may not even think about. Wi-Fi is very fast.  I never lost the connection. All of the services are 5 star!  Keep up the great work.",5,2014,03,13
11,"Great service, great view, great location!","We love our corner room, 722, with a balcony and a great view.  Can see Casa Battlo from the window.  Breakfast is included and is quite the spread!  On the street with the designer shopping and great restaurants are near.",5,2014,03,12
11,Great Experience,"We´ve been in Majestic for one week in March scaping from carnaval in Brazil. The experience was amazing the staff is very kind, the executive room (231) was impecable, amazin localization in Paseig de Gracia, surrounded by the main luxury stores (Channel, Hermes, etc). Amazing experience, for sure we´ll be back.",5,2014,03,11
11,Excellent Hotel and Service,"We spent 4 nights in March 2014. Passeig de Gracia is a perfect location for sightseeing and shopping. The front staff were excellent and very friendly and we were upgraded when we informed them it was our Wedding anniversary. The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable. The suggestions of suitable restaurants in the locality proved to be well chosen also.
The outdoor cocktail bar on the 10th floor looked very inviting however the temperatures at night were still on the cool side so we didn't stay long. All in all highly recommended and we would definitely go back  to the Majestic for our next Barcelona trip.",5,2014,03,11
11,Lovely hotel in fantastic location,"The hotel is perfectly located on Passeig de Gracia.

Room was clean although we did change as original room didn't have queen bed. Note that none of rooms do - they push 2 singles together. 

Our room was on corner of main road & had a balcony.  The windows weren't completely sound proof so you could hear the outside busy road but you got used to it.

We didn't eat in hotel apart from one evening we had room service which was really good and promptly delivered.

All hotel staff lovely & thanks to Angel for his recommendation for dinner reservation.

Rooms have built in safe & fridge but unfortunately no tea making service. Coffee machine didn't make great coffee either.  Toiletries were really nice!! TV channels could be better! Free wifi in room bonus.

I would recommend this hotel & would definitely stay here again.",4,2014,03,07
11,Majestic by Name .... Majestic in every way,"We had already booked another hotel for our trip to Barcelona but i was persuaded by my realtionship manager Elliott Of American Express to go to the Majestic Hotel , ""you wont be disapointed "" he told me and how right he was , 
I have nothing but praise for this Wonderful Hotel and all of the staff who assisted us during our stay , nothing was to much trouble no matter how small our request was 
Great central location ,lots of places to visit all within walking distance, The rooms were great , clean and modern and good value . We even got an upgrade on arrival , the bathroom was full of all the little ensentials that my wife and daughter would wish 
In short Well done Elliott & American Express and Well Done the Majestic Hotel a great combination 
we shall be returning very soon",5,2014,03,06
11,Wow,"This is one superb hotel

The staff are so attentive to your needs and nothing is too much trouble. 

My room 272 was a delux and to be honest nothing short of quality can describe it better. 

Does not have a great view bit to be honest for me I never open the curtains anyway. 

It is located in the best part of the busy high class shops of Barcelona and not far from many of the sites, attractions or metro system. 

It is a beautiful hotel with elegant decor that is matched with staff who are attentive, pleasant, cheerful and sincere.  

I would recommend this hotel to stay at for a break and for business

Also provides free wifi which today in today's hotel industry is a rare feature. 

I would say it is not the cheapest hotel but definitely value for money. 

It has an outside heated roof top pool with outside cocktail bar, granted the pool isn't large but useable. 

There is a lovely spa if you require pampering and by what I have heard it is very good with reasonable prices. 

The hotel is worth a stay for anyone with a reasonable budget and so use their website for booking online for good rates or speak direct. ",5,2014,03,05
11,"Good Location, but you pay too much for it!","Is an historical Hotel & you pay its location. Other hotels just in the area are less expensive and, I would say, more interesting... Majestic has been renovated, to my opinion too the extreme of being to impersonal...  loosing its charm. Barcelona is known by modernist buildings "". And even the hotel Majestic is located in the best area & sorounded by the Amazing Gaudi Buildings,still a bit ""cold"" as Hotel. I suggest you look for other hotels in the area who have amazing interiors and you breath & feel the "" authentic  architectual Barcelona""",2,2014,03,05
11,"Superb location, excellent hotel","The location of the Hotel Majestic cannot be beat. If you are into shopping any high end job you could want is within a stones throw. It was a nice stroll to the markets and the water for some lovely seafood. The room in the hotel was superb and the fitness center was well equipped, clean, and quiet. The rooftop bar has an excellent view of the entire city and a lovely place to sit and have a drink and watch the sunset. The hotel is quite expensive, but it did not disappoint and I would definitely recommend it.",5,2014,03,05
11,"Great hotel, good service, but even better location!","I found out about this hotel through the Amex Platinum program, and it looked nice, but the price I was being quoted was  a bit over the top. So I was pretty excited when I was able to book it through Expedia at a significant discount. 

Well we were pleasantly surprised. The hotel was recently renovated so the facilities are impeccable. The lobby is a bit small, and can get crowded during peak check-it/check-out hours, but the room was fine, and the service excellent. 

However, the best part of this hotel is actually the location. Right smack in the middle of Passeig de Gracia, Barcelona's equivalent of Fifth Avenue, centrally located from anywhere in the city, and with fantastic shopping and dining just steps away in any direction! Honestly it was like a dream come true! 

We did not try the restaurant because there are just too many options nearby.

Highly recommendable.",4,2014,03,03
11,"Great hotel, great location","Very nice hotel central for shopping and sightseeing in Barcelona. Super clean, very good breakfast, good service (almost too good). Nice and confortable rooms. Nothing to complain about.
We did not try the SPA.

11,Excellent,One of the best city hotels I ever stayed at. We got a beautiful room (903) with a huge terrace overlooking Barcelona. Excellent staff and service. I can highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again.,5,2014,03,03
11,Superb hotel in a wonderful location with outstanding service,"I took my wife away for our tenth wedding anniversary to Barcelona as she had been wanting to go there for some time. I had a look at a lot of good hotels in the city and eventually settled on this one. I'm so glad we did - in almost every conceivable way, it lived up to our expectations. I won't dwell on the major benefits - lots of reviewers have covered these. But worth mentioning are a few things, not least the superb service, right from the moment of arrival until we left. Definitely a five-star experience with friendly, efficient staff. I had let slip in a request email that it was our tenth anniversary when I requested one of the larger deluxe rooms (they range in size from 20-25m2) if possible. They exceeded this request - on being shown to the room, it was a really decent size with a walk in closet and a big bathroom and when I looked at the H&S floor plan on the hallway wall our room was considerably bigger than most of the others on the floor. It was only then I realised that they had upgraded us to the Executive room (and the web photos confirmed this): but the service here is so wonderfully discreet that I guess that rather than tell us at reception, they just left us to discover this as a wonderful surprise!

A further massive - and very pleasant - surprise was the complimentary bottle of (very good) cava left in our room on the first day of our stay to help us celebrate! 

I can also highly recommend the rooftop bar - we had a wonderful afternoon up here sipping cava and eating lloncanisa pages sausage on the traditional bread with tomato. The seats are really comfortable, with great service and a simply incredible view aross the city.

Room service food was unbelievably good and well-presented (breakfast).

A final example of the class of this hotel is that they email you before the trip to ask you about your preferences, and they email afterwards to thank you for staying.

Thank you to all the staff at the Majestic who made this such a wonderful break for us. Three nights was not enough and my wife could not have been happier. When we go back to Barcelona (and we will), my wife and I agreed we will definitely stay here again.",5,2014,03,01
11,nice hotel,"Majestic is very good situated, close to Ballio house and Square of Catalonia. Room was not so large but comfortable with nice marble bathroom.The stuff is friendly. Lobby bar is great.There is also a bar on the top with breathtaking city views.We stayed for 2 nights and definitely we ll choose this hotel for our next visit.",4,2014,02,27
11,Great hotel in the perfect location!,"The best features about this hotel were the excellent service (especially the concierge) the wonderful breakfast buffet, the beautiful room and the perfect location. What else is there? We walked to Las Ramblas, Casa Botlle, along Passeig de Gracia, very centrally located to lots of sites!!!! The bathroom was roomy and the shower was excellent, not like some hotel showers where the water dribbles out! I was going to stay at another hotel, but my travel advisor suggested the Majestic and I am thrilled that I took her advice! We loved staying here!",5,2014,02,24
11,Superb hotel,"I stayed for a week during a business trip. The hotel has a perfect location.  My room was really nice, good size and a really nice bathroom.  The training facilities in the cellar was fine and the rooftop terrace with a small swimming pool and bar was perfect.",5,2014,02,23
11,"great location, luxury hotel","Very well located for all of the sights - we walked to all of them, and to the beaches. The hotel staff were very kind and even gave us a bottle of cava to celebrate our anniversary! The hotel is extremely comfortable, with good size rooms and great bathrooms - our bath was enormous! We also had a lovely balcony, complete with furniture.The gym was also great and with well thought out toiletries in the gym as well as the rooms. The only slight annoyance was having to pay for the coffee in our room. This seems unusual for a hotel of this standard.The hotel restaurant is very good and the chef clearly very talented - fantastic flavours! The hotel staff should advertise this more as it was very quiet. In fact the staff recommended other restaurants and tapas bars nearby, which were also very good. On our first night we ate in the bar as the restaurant was closed. Our meals came separately and the food, though good, could have been hotter.
Overall a great stay and I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. (Even a direct train ride away from the airport - very handy)",5,2014,02,20
11,Small room but excellent,"We arrived early after dragging our bags from the airport by means of the metrorail - an adventure.  The front desk staff greeted us and checked us in with a friendly and efficient manner.  We were early, of course, after flying all night; so they stored our bags as we began our walk through the elegant Passeig de Gracia neighborhood.  Later we returned and were quickly escorted to our room where we took a needed nap. 
The room was small but very clean and well appointed.  A quick check of the to-scale emergency exit plan showed that we had the smallest room on the floor.  We somewhat unpacked because we would board a cruise (Wind Star) on Saturday.  The front desk staff graciously helped us purchase on-line tickets to Sagrada Familia when we could not negotiate the website ourselves.  We did explore the hotel facilities to find a beautiful view from the roof-deck bar and pool.  The weather was too chilly in late October to really use either.  We did not use the hotel dining room, but went around the corner to Nata da Lisboa for breakfast and took advantage of many other excellent restaurants in the area for other meals.
The hotel is located in the middle of three main Gaudi architectural sites.  A beautiful and well appointed hotel right on the Passeig de Gracia (Every international designer has at last one store on the avenue.  Take money if you want to shop), the rate was well worth the expense.",5,2014,02,19
11,Excellent hotel!,"We stayed here after a cruise and had a junior suite which overlooked Paseo de Garcia. The room was large and very spacious. It had a separate living room/study. And the bathroom was large with a separate tub and rain shower. The location is great, easy walk to Las Ramblas and only steps away from great shopping. The service was superb and everyone was very helpful.",5,2014,02,15
11,Fabulous hotel in great location,"My husband and I stayed in Barcelona at The Majestic in Passeig de Gracias. The hotel, without doubt, was one of the nicest we have stayed in. From the time of arrival to our leaving four days later we were treated well by staff from the concierge and reception desk to the room maids. The cleanliness and style of the hotel was excellent - could not be faulted. The pool on the roof would be brilliant in the summer. We may have to return!! 

Only downside would be that we were surprised to be charged for making coffee in our room using the Nespresso coffee machine. In a five star hotel this cost really shouldn't be added. 

The breakfast is worth tasting at least once. It's expensive but lovely!! For a cheaper alternate  we found the best cafe in the Carrer Pau Claris called Jaime Beriestain. This is a beautifully elegant cafe with superb food. Worth a visit and possibly the best croissants in Barcelona!! 

We also had dinner at the Argentinian restaurant in the same block as the hotel. The Nueve Reinas serves lovely food and is a true Argentinian menu!! Lovely! 

Wifi was good and strong but irritatingly we had to log in each time we returned to the hotel with login and password. Rather painful but at least it worked!! 

We loved this hotel and would recommend it to anyone.",5,2014,02,13
11,"Great hotel, great staff","Just returned from a weekend (first) trip to Barcelona. From the moment we arrived at the hotel, Juan on reception made us feel welcome and proactively checked to see if there was a room with a view available to move us to (thanks Juan). All of the front-of-house guys were exemplary in their attentiveness and courtesy (without overdoing or forcing it). Not once did the guys outside fail to acknowledge us leaving the hotel or returning to it - little things like this make a difference. I went to the lobby toilet on one occasion and would have been happy to eat my dinner off the floor, it was that clean. Room was clean and nice little touches like slippers placed next to bed, a chocolate on the pillow and bathroom products re-stocked when we returned each day . Lovely rooftop bar with great views and the hotel holds a good location, next to the metro-line and a relatively short walk to Las Ramblas. Would definitely stay again if visiting this fantastic city another time.",5,2014,02,11
11,Excellent hotel in a heart of Barcelona,"Room was super clean every day.  Accommodated most of our request, a crib, extra towels, extra amenities,  etc.).  Great suggestions on restaurants.  Barcelona itself is very baby-friendly; this hotel is superb.",5,2014,02,10
11,Amazing Summer Break,"Myself and my boyfriend stayed at the hotel back in August of last year on a last minute getaway.
We had the most amazing time, if you are thinking of booking this hotel do it! As a Travel Advisor my expectations of hotels can be pretty high. This hotel was completely faultless and nothing was ever too much trouble for the friendly staff, they were brilliant. Our flight from London landed quite early and our room was not ready. They could not be more apologetic they had taken details from our passports so check in was quicker upon our return. This was not an issue for us as we were looking forward to exploring the city. We came back to find we had been upgraded and a few moments later after heading to our room we received a small celebration cake and bottle of champagne. Much to our surprise they had noticed it was my birthday a few days later and we received a greetings card from the hotel. What service and attention to detail! The location is fantastic, easily accessible to the Sagrada Familia and the Casa Batllo as well as a wonderful wine bar down the road and all the top brand shops .The rooftop bar was lovely to head to during the evening for a cocktail or 2, it had such a laid back atmosphere. The views from the top are picture perfect and the view of the city is breath taking. I could not recommend this hotel enough, we will definitely be back again in the future.",5,2014,02,06
11,Superb Hotel,"Just returned from a 3 night stay where we were celebrating my sisters 30th birthday. The staff at this hotel are what truly make it special. They are courteous, polite, helpful, knowledgable and have a ""nothing is too much"" attitude. The hotel it's self is immaculate, fresh, modern and very comfortable. I cannot fault anything. Perfect holiday, perfect location, perfect hotel. Be sure to make time for the spa....60 minute massage...heaven!",5,2014,02,06
11,Great location,"This is a great hotel. Very clean and modern. Location is excellent as you can walk to Sagrada Familia, Las Ramblas, old Barcelona (barri gothic) and many more attractions. The hotel has a rooftop bar with a pool which is amazing. ",4,2014,02,05
11,Beautiful hotel!,"My husband and I have just had two nights in this wonderful hotel celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary.  Our daughter and son had arranged for a bottle of champagne for our arrival as a gift and the hotel decided upon hearing this to upgrade us to a penthouse suite which was absolute luxury, with a huge terrace and view over Barcelona.  It made for a truly memorable stay and celebration for us.  The staff were very helpful and friendly without being stuffy.

We have stayed in many lovely hotels around the world, but the Majestic Hotel Barcelona is certainly one of the best.",5,2014,02,04
11,Impeccable! Don't know why it isn't number one on Tripadvisor!,"We are staying at the Majestic and everything is perfect! Service impeccable and rooms very comfortable, clean and luxurious. 

When we arrived our room wasn't ready so we were shown to the bar , met by the general manager and offered a drink. We ended up ordering a Caesar salad and wine and beer and when we asked for the bill were informed it was on the house.  Weren't expecting that at all but it really made an impression!  This was typical of the level of service for our entire stay. The staff are extremely professional and friendly. 

We stayed in a junior suite overlooking the Paseo de Gracia. Beautiful and not noisy at all. Separate living room and beautiful bathroom with double wash basins, separate rain shower and bath tub. Big fluffy towels, slippers and Bulgari bath products. We returned to our room first night after dinner to a complimentary bottle of wine and a box of cataluynian cookies. 

Went to the rooftop bar and had the most delicious mojitos- mango ( me) and strawberry ( husband) - best I've ever had - maybe a bit too much ice. 

Didn't really eat here- went to Emma's cafe around the corner for breakfast but if the food is like everything else it must be delicious! 

Great location- all three Gaudi houses, Las Ramblas, opera, within walking distance and shopping right outside the door (Burberry. Chanel, Stuart  Weizmann , Diesel etc. also great restaurants. Hop on and off bus station across the street. Also subway practically outside the door, although we didn't use it. 

We will definitely stay here again. If we come with our teenage kids we might try the Majestic Residences- right across the street.",5,2014,02,02
11,Fab staff and location,"We stayed two nights in this hotel, the size if our room was normal comparing the other part of Europe BIG!!! The staff are very friendly and the location of hotel is very good.we had a very good memory from this hotel and I recommend this hotel for sure.",5,2014,01,31
11,A must stay in barcelona,"Stayed last weekend at this stunning hotel! Service, location, customer services were all top class!

The hotel couldn't do enough for us. Thee most comfortable beds ever! Free wifi. 

Would love to return to Barcelona and definitely this stunning hotel. ",5,2014,01,28
11,Five star quality with friendly and attentive service in heart of the city,"This hotel is in the heart of Barcelona, on a pretty upmarket wide boulevard with lots of high end shops.

The hotel does not look like much from the outside but inside it is very impressive.  It seems to have been recently re-furbished with a lot of attention to detail and high build quality - lots of marble everywhere, for example.  

I stayed in a huge corner room with a wrap around balcony and sun loungers (although in January it was a bit cold to use them).  The wifi worked well and allowed for up to five devices.  The bathroom was sumptuous with a huge bath and shower and twin handbasins.  Bathroom amenities were nice.

The public areas were very comfortable and the staff very friendly and attentive; if at any time you looked a bit lost they were very helpful.  

The only slight niggle I can manage is that there was a lot of slamming of doors (presumably from housekeeping) in the morning.  This rather disturbed my lie-in, but I suppose I should have been up and about by 10 a.m.

Of course, this is not the cheapest hotel in town - a coffee in the bar was EUR6 - but you get what you pay for.  

I would definitely consider staying here again on another visit to Barcelona.",5,2014,01,25
11,A wonderful experience,"Just spent the weekend with my husband and my one year old and all I have to say is thank you to all the hotel personnel for making our stay unforgettable and very pleasant. They made our life so easy with the baby. They took care of everything, made sure we had his baby food heated in record time, and even had special toiletries for him. We definitely recommend it and we will come back again as soon as we can! ",5,2014,01,21
11,"ok, nothing special","Well, the location is good for high-end shopping and for seeing the Casas. However, there are no good restaurants or cafes in the vicinity, and if you don't want to pay the hotel's 29 EUR fee for breakfast, you will have a hard time finding a place to eat nearby. The hotel is also quite a bit farther from the Old Town than I had expected. Barcelona city blocks are huge, so the Old Town is maybe a 20-minute or so walk away.

The room was surprisingly noisy for an upscale hotel, too. The walls are thin, so it's easy to hear your neighbors. Also, the door handles are fixed in place, and so unless you take special care to close the door slowly, it closes with a loud slam. (Nobody made the effort to close them slowly/quietly.)

Also, wi-fi is not free, and it is fairly expensive. I'm used to hotels at this supposed star rating and cost providing free wifi access, instead of gouging their customers.

However, the room was spacious, and the concierge and the people at reception were very nice and helpful. Even so, I would opt to stay someplace closer to the center next time, unless I got a really good rate here.",3,2014,01,19
11,Majestic - The name says it all!!!,"I just dont know where to start with my review. 

What an amazing way to end our Honeymoon in Spain & Portugal!!

Last stop - Barcelona and certainly finished our Honeymoon in style!!

This hotel is simply fantastic, from the staff, to the rooms the location EVERYTHING!!! 

The moment we stepped out of our car, we were welcomed by the friendly hotel staff who ensured our bags would be removed from the car and dropped off straight to our rooms. 

He coordinated so well with the reception staff with their earpieces etc. We got into the reception area and we were greeted by the reception staff and they acknowledged us by our names - shows that they are so attentive to every guest checking in and out of their hotel.

They already knew we were on our honeymoon and had us upgraded to a room with the street view, we walked into our bedroom and we were welcomed with a bottle of Champagne!!! their service and attention to detail was simply amazing!!

The rooms are gorgeous, well spaced and cozy and classy. The mini bar is well stocked, but a little pricey, but i guess it is excepted from a 5 Star Hotel. 

Beds well done with little chocolates left on the side of your pillow :)

Bathroom - I could live there!!! amazing clean white marbled bathrooms with a nice spacious bathtub, Bulgari bath products - now this is pure Luxury!!! 

Bath towels are hung on warm railings so your towels are nice and warm in the cold winter.

rooms are cleaned twice a day - a full clean during the day and at night they come back to prepare your bed for sleep!! curtains are drawn by the housekeeping staff and toiletries are stocked up if required - OH I could get used to this lifestyle!!

The breakfast is amazing, such friendly staff to welcome you and who assist in clearing the table - very attentive. amazing sandwiches, and a good spread of yummy food.

Wifi is free and the user name and password can be collected from reception - which is valid for 3 days, but once the validity expires, the reception staff will assist you with more details for the remainder of your stay. I had issues connecting and the Guest relation staff comes to your room to assist.

Location is fantastic, stores such as Chanel, Gucci, Chopard are all along the hotel. Few blocks away is La Rambla and Familia Sargada, Gaudi House etc.. The hotel also assists in getting tickets to popular tourist spot so you avoid waiting in long times or if you have not gotten them online - now that is some service!! 

The terrace bar on the 8th or 10th floor is beautiful with panoramic views of the city.

We checked out at 3am in the morning and even at that off time in the morning the staff were so so friendly!!! Well trained staff and great hospitality! 

All in all I would go back to this place in a heart beat!",5,2014,01,17
11,LUXURY ALL THE WAY,"We travelled to this hotel in January for the winter sales.
This hotel is by far one of the best ive ever stayed in.
Staff, service, rooms, location, everything.
If you going to barcelona, this is the hotel you have to go to.",5,2014,01,14
11,Great rooms,"We very much enjoyed staying at this hotel in Barcelona back in 2011. Nice rooms, clean, good service. It was walking distance to downtown and had a great view of the pier and all of the cruise ships.",4,2014,01,13
11,great hotel!,"We traveled husband/wife and a baby, spacious and comfortable room, little to no noise. Great service from everyone.
Quite complete breakfast service. The swimming pool was outside and uncovered which was not suitable for use during month of January but good facilities overall
location is great close to plaza de Catalunia",5,2014,01,13
11,EXPECTED RECENT TRAVEL,"I had planned a trip to Barcelona with my Granddaughter over Xmas. We were booked to stay at the MAJESTIC - this would have been my 4th stay at this hotel. I did prepay the stay for 4 nights.
Unfortunately, my husband became ill, and we were unable to go. Had to cancel- tried very hard to do so. Called, and called- e-mailed, and e-mailed- finally the answer.
NO REFUND- TRUE- IT SAID NO REFUND BEFORE- BUT!!! Plan to go back when my husband is better, and would have liked to stay there- but find the answer terrible!!
I believe the hotel should have refunded my money, given a credit, or something!!! FOURTH TRIP TO SAME HOTEL!!!  Where are the customer relations? NOT ONLY WILL I NEVER PREPAY A STAY- I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN! FOR A 5 STAR HOTEL, I FIND THIS INEXCUSABLE.",1,2014,01,12
11,GREAT Place for a woman traveling solo,This hotel deserves all of its' 5 stars.  The service is great.  A front desk with at least three Clefs D'Or Concierges - who are extremely professional and helpful.  The rooms are wonderful.  The bathtub in my room was so big I could swim in it.  I has the flu for most of my trip - and the room service made a special soup for me - and it made me feel very cared-for and looked-after.  The Spa is AMAZING!!!   The best manicure and pedicure I've ever had.  I also had an algae wrap and a wonderful lymphatic drainage massage that was remarkable.  It was worth every penny.,5,2014,01,11
11,Incredible experience in Barcelona,"We had an amazing 3 days stay at the Majestic.  We stayed in the apartments across the street which gave us 2 bedrooms and a full kitchen and living room for a family of 4.  The space was large and beautiful and the hotel staff was excellent.  We liked it so much that we found a way to get a reservation again for the last 3 days of our stay.  I would not stay anywhere else in Barcelona.  The location is perfect and whether you stay in the hotel or apartments, the service is outstanding.  We had a wonderful vacation!",5,2014,01,07
11,Getting what you pay for,"We specialise in getting great deals on quirky, boutiquey hotels but after wading through the myriad of options in Barcelona and -- it has to be said -- some scary reviews on Tripadvisor I decided to splash out on top end for a pre-Christmas weekend away. The Majestic is perfectly situated, equipped, decorated and staffed. From reception to restaurant staff did not put a toe wrong and their friendly, can-do attitude lacked any pressure for unending tips. 

Some Five Stars appear to be out to milk their customers for every penny and the Majestic is at the other end of the spectrum: free wi-fi, free gym, breakfast included, complimentary and totally unexpected chilled sparkling wine in the room. We had perfect cocktails on the roof terrace served by a shivering Spanish barman to the hardy British and American clientele and then an early dinner in the beautiful restaurant with perfectly judged cooking and service; so relaxing not to have to semaphore waiters.

The location is idea for visiting the best Gaudi sights and at no point did I feel threatened in any way in this beautiful town after some worrying accounts of Barcelona crime. The only downside will be trying not to use the Majestic as a benchmark for other hotels. In the end although it cost a lot more than some other hotels in theory, we got a good deal on a suite on the hotel website and had a picnic style supper to enjoy our lovely room watching TV the first night after a hard day of sightseeing so I am not sure it was that much dearer in the end; worth every euro!",5,2014,01,03
11,Best Hotel In Barcelona!,"The Majestic Hotel & Spa is all anybody could ask for & more!! 
Great location, Great service, Great breakfast, Great Facilities!

From the first impression at the front desk, there was nothing more refreshing than beautiful service after arriving from a 26 hour flight!
We were provided with a generous room (number 408 - see room tips!)
The rooftop pool is wonderful, however would refrain from ordering food or drinks as they are extremely overpriced (as expected at such a beautiful hotel). 
The breakfast is extremely lovely! In comparison to other European hotels, it excels in all aspects! 
The concierge went above and beyond to assist us, as it was our first time Barcelona. From printing us maps for desired locations to booking us bicycles to rent for the day, we would have been lost without them. Also, the business centre was perfect as it provided free printing and internet. 

The location is spectacular! Many people say that the beach in Barcelona is beautiful, which it is, but for shopping and sightseeing, The Majestic is right in the centre of it all!
We purchased our hop-on hop-off bus tickets from the front desk but made the error of only buying a one day pass. A two day pass is required to see the beauty of Barcelona. 

Overall, it was a wonderful experience. We hope to stay here on our next visit. 

Thanks Majestic!",4,2014,01,03
11,Great hotel,"The Majestic was recommended to us by AmexPlatinum. We experienced great service, there's an awesome rooftop bar, breakfast was amazing (included in our package), fantastic location. We highly recommend The Majestic.",5,2014,01,02
11,Good boutique hotel at a great location,"Just returned from Barcelona after a 7 day trip. Did not encounter any rudeness nor arrogance with any of the hotel staff. They were courteous and helpful. Breafkast was a blast. Missing the fresh strawberry juice.
The downside of the hotel is the gym. Though it is satisfactory, it is a little too small and tucked away in the basement. Location is strategic as it is within walking distance to most of the Gaudi's architecture.",5,2014,01,02
11,"Great hotel, but.......","For the last four Christmas & NY holiday we visit Barcelona. It's become tradition. As a Centurion card member with American Express I'm usually guided to the Mandarin Oriental. I have always found the service at the MO OUTSTANDING!! This year AMEX gave me the option to try the Majestic. We arrived on 12/25 and departed early on the 28th. The service and the accommodations was very, very nice. I would say outstanding only because they were genuine in their apologies when it came to the important stuff. Twice I left the room at 10A to return at 5 or 6 with the room still not made up. Of the three nights, had to call for turn down service the day the room was made up, received turn down service an hour after the room was made up the second night, making it impossible to rest up before an early dinner and on the last night I just gave up. For close to 2,000 dollars for three nights, it's the ""small stuff"" that makes a HUGE difference. We are scheduled to stay there again upon our return from the Basque region on January 4th before we head back to the US on the 5th. I'm hoping they get it right this time because I think it's a great hotel. If not, it's back to the MO next year. Will update in a week.",4,2013,12,29
11,Luxe,"The Majestic is a beautiful hotel, the staff is attentive and the treatment of guests is first class.  The area is very central so everything is in walking distance.  
 I found the rooms to be quite large and clean.  It's a nice touch to have the nespresso machine in the room but beware you pay for the coffee, we heard a few people complaining about that at the front desk.  Still cheaper than going out for an espresso though.
I was really looking forward to their breakfast (especially considering the price) and although there were a lot of choices and it was beautifully presented, the food was nothing special. There are plenty of cafes around the hotel to enjoy some other breakfast options.   
The gym is great and the equipment is state of the art!  
All around a great hotel!  We would definately return for another stay.",5,2013,12,28
11,Outstanding service and comfort,"The Majestic is a fabulous hotel!  The room was clean and spacious, the bed very comfortable, and the staff always friendly and helpful.  It's on Paseo de Gracia, with Gaudi architecture just blocks down the street both directions.  If you love to shop, it's a great location.  It's a bit of a hike from the Gothic district and the cathedral, but worth taking a taxi for such a comfy hotel.

The breakfast buffet was terrific too - and a bargain at only 11 Euros.",5,2013,12,28
11,Great place to stay,"Just spent five fantastic days here.  The rooms were outstanding, the staff really helpful, it's right by the best shops and some of the Gaudi buildings.  You can easily walk to the main tourist sites.
It's all been recently refurbished so the bathrooms are excellent too.",5,2013,12,27
11,HOLIDAY SPIRIT EXEMPLAR,"Visiting Barcelona for the holidays, residing at the Majestic Hotel on Avenida de Garcia.  It is impressive - inside and out.  Huge glowing ornaments on the outside, exquisite arrangements inside.  Very responsive staff.  Comfortable, quite room.
Christmas Eve dinner was wonderful.  Clearly, local citizens enjoy the presentation. The service and food are equal to other special properties we experienced during the holidays -- from  California to Catalona and Canton.",4,2013,12,26
11,Beautiful Hotel,"When I travel, I look for first class. I sometimes get a little nervous when traveling to a new destination where I don't speak the language or have any idea about the area/neighborhoods. However, The Majestic was in a prime location surrounded by luxury. Walking distance to many of the sites. The hotel itself was beautiful with amazing service. The concierge got us into an upscale restaurant without advance reservations. (I saw the list... people were waiting to be seated at the bar.)

Overall, I was very, very impressed.",5,2013,12,17
11,Earns its 5 stars,"I was fortunate enough to stay here on a business trip. The service is incredible and friendly. The buffet breakfast was one of the best I have ever seen, with a huge variety of delicious foods and drinks--even things like soy milk, flavored butters, and homemade jams. The location is ideal for being a tourist, as it is right in the middle of one of the city's best shopping and eating areas, and walking distance to the Sagrada Familia, Barcelona Cathedral, Boqueria, etc. The rooms are lush and spotlessly clean. They are small compared to US standards, but that is typical in Europe. I was in a room that faced a busy intersection and yet my room was very quiet and peaceful. 

I happened to have my birthday while I was at the hotel and they must have known by my passport because at breakfast on my birthday, they brought me a cake and caba! Later that afternoon when I returned to my room, I had another gorgeous and delicious cake, a birthday card, and a bottle of cava on ice. I felt to special and was so touched by their kindness. It was a wonderful way to spend a birthday while on a business trip and just exemplifies the service this hotel offers.",5,2013,12,15
11,Great Location,"I stayed here for two nights at the end of November 2013, prior to leaving on a cruise.  The hotel staff were very helpful and we were very pleased with the accommodations.  The hotel is very conveniently located easy walk to Plaza Catalonia and right on the hop on hop off bus tours.  I would recommend this hotel for its service as well as its location to anyone staying in Barcelona.",5,2013,12,14
11,Excellent,"This hotel is excellent from type to bottom and left to right. The door staff upon arrival are superbly efficient and professional. They actually want to help you. The reception staff couldn't have been nicer and more accommodating in getting me the exact room type I wanted.

The room itself is beautifully appointed and decorated. A recent refurbishment has left this place 'majestically' elegant. (I had stayed here before several years ago and it's much better than it was.) the bar and restaurant are excellent two, as are their staff. Drinks priced appropriately for a hotel bar, but €6.50 for a coffee at the rooftop terrace is a little off the mark. The breakfast buffet is stupendous: try the omelettes!

In summary, I loved this place. It's not cheap but it is excellent in every respect, from service, to rooms, to food, to location. ",5,2013,12,14
11,Classic and confy,"Spacious rooms with a classical décor. The bathroom is also spacious and very complete.  Breakfast is good, tasty, varied and focused on Spanish cooking. The front desk staff and Concierge were allways  very helpful and  available to give information.The hotel's location could not be better, in full Paseig de Gracia,  front of the ""Casa Batló"" and very near the ""La Pedrera"" major urban works of Antoni Gaudi and of course within a walking distance from the Plaza Catalunya and the ""Ramblas"".
The hotel atmosphere is very serene. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay and will be my next choice when I return to Barcelona",5,2013,12,13
11,Fantastic location and a very good brakefast,"A perfect location for busines or romantic weekend in Barcelona, can heartily recommend.
Super service throughout the hotel. Will definitely use this on my next visit to the city.
Husk og nyte frokosten på hotellet.",5,2013,12,13
11,Fabulous hotel a real must.,The hotel is absolutely brilliant. The room was super we were upgraded to a junior suite . The bathroom was luxury at its best also the bulgari products made you feel pampered.the Christmas lights were very elegant and people walking by we're always taking photos it looked magical.,5,2013,12,11
11,"Great location, service and so 5 star",I arrived and the staff was so helpful and welcoming.  I enjoyed the Spa and rooftop terrace.  Nice room too. Staff continually friendly.  The bar was nice and again when I had questions on what to do the recommendations where perfect.  This hotel has a great location and the whole experience was so 5 star for me. Easy use of internet.  The bathrooms and amenities perfect.  I travel a lot on business but this short trip was a pleasure and it was excellent!  I will be back!,5,2013,12,08
11,The best of Barcelona 5* all the way,"First ever written review that I felt compelled to leave after a fantastic weekend at the Majestic,we had a room upgrade and a free bottle of champagne as it was my wife's Birthday .The service was the best we have ever had and we have stayed in many 5* hotels around the world.
We wish all the staff a very merry Christmas.",5,2013,12,08
11,"Great service and location, but wouldn't spend my whole trip here","I think whether you like this hotel or not depends a lot on you. 

It's great for business travelers who want the quick items: good service, decent breakfast, free strong wifi, easy location for taxis and going to work, very functional work space, easy walking to basics, etc. I was here for business so it suited me well. The staff were very very nice. The reception is a bit slow since it can get clogged quickly in the mornings with tourist groups (not a good thing for business types) so that would be the biggest negative. No express check out so work around that if you can.

Considering Barcelona has great boutique hotels, I would opt for one of those if I was traveling for vacation. This hotel is well maintained but you don't feel the Barcelona design aesthetic at all inside.

One tip: don't book a hotel taxi - 100 Euros for most trips. Just grab a taxi outside, there was always plenty when I was there despite it being a busy time for the city with lots of Expos happening around town.",3,2013,12,07
11,7 nights of extraordinary service,"The front desk staff was exceedingly friendly and helpful. They helped us buy tickets online and even helped us retrieve an item we forgot in a taxi.  Everyone from the doorman to the waitstaff made us feel like we were valued guests. 

We stayed in a comfortable, quiet 2-room suite on the 8th floor.  The large walk-in closet was a great bonus! 

The location of the hotel is ideal for exploring the city. The metro stop ""Paseo de Gracia"" is 1 block away from the hotel and a taxi ride to the Gothic quarter costs around 6 EU. 

The views from the rooftop terrace are breathtaking.",4,2013,12,07
11,Loved the location,We loved the Majestic Hotel.  The location was great.  We were able to walk to all areas of the city.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Our favorite spot was the rooftop terrace.  It was really beautiful up there.  Great views of the city and a nice place to relax.  We would definitely go back.,5,2013,11,28
11,"Style over substance, so poor value for money","This is a beautiful hotel in a great location. But for the price it doesn't compete with other hotels of this level. The customer service is poor. Also beware some of the rooms are really quite small. You'd feel very short changed in one of those.  You also have to pay for wi fi (!) for every device, per day. I spent £120 on wi fi! And it didn't work properly. I was told support IT  would call me but they didn't. They do have a good gym - nice and new with small but modern changing rooms.",3,2013,11,27
11,"ABSOLUTE 5 STAR HOTEL, BEST LOCATION",THIS HOTEL WAS AMAZING. We could walk everywhere in the city. The rooms were gorgeous even down to the Bulgari soaps and shampoo. The bed was great. The roof top patio should be in a magazine. The lobby and bar are fantastic. This was our first time in Barcelona and I would 100% stay here again. We loved coming back to the room. The location was walking distance to everything that you want to see. I highly recommend this hotel.,5,2013,11,25
11,Good location but small rooms,"I choose this hotel for its location . The location on passieg de Garcia is the best one can find in Barcelona .Its a shoppers Mecca but Sunday the streets are deserted as all shops are closed . Gaudis casa batlo n casa milo are just a block away . Las ramblas is just a10 min walk even the sagrada familia is just a very short ride by taxi . I'd say a 20 min by foot ..

I found the rooms extremely small for a 5star hotel .  Yes they provide bvlgari amenities n nespresso machine in room but it still does not make up for the size . .

Having expressed my disappointment about the room I have to compliment the hotel for its beautiful rooftop deck . It's a great place to unwind over cocktails n the views of the city are breathtaking . .",3,2013,11,23
11,Your home in Barcelona,"Amazing hotel, very friendly staff, excellent location especially for shopping lovers, make sure to try the buffet breakfast as well as the breathtaking roof top lounge. Our room was around 35 sq.m large enough for a couple. I recommend this hotel to everyone wanting to feel at home 😎",5,2013,11,21
11,Excellent,"Can't say enough about the service at this property. Got great deal through my AMEX Platinum. From door men to concierge were always extremely courteous (without being fake about it). Yes regular rooms can be a bit small, but everything else makes up for it (and then some). The rooms are very well soundproofed. Great bathrooms. Spa is small but effective. Rooftop bar/pool offers great views. Will recommend to friends and family. And probably the best feature is the location relative to most of the best attractions of Barcelona. Go to the cafes along Paseo de Gracia and people watch while having a drink. You wont regret it.",5,2013,11,21
11,"Fantastic location, fantastic service","Spent 3 nights at the Majestic Hotel with my sister in law celebrating her birthday and seeing the sights of Barcelona.  It was my second trip to Barcelona this year.  Previously we stayed at the Melia Sarria hotel which was classed as 4 star. The Majestic is a 5 star rating but felt so much better and a huge improvement on the Melia Sarria which though good, was more of a business hotel.
From the moment we arrived at The Majestic we felt cosseted. The staff were attentive but not overbearing.  Nothing was too much trouble. We were delighted to find our room had been upgraded and a particularly nice touch was a note from the hotel management wishing my sister in law a happy birthday together with a bottle of complimentary cava.  
We had booked bed and breakfast and are very pleased that we had. Breakfast was fantastic. So many fruit juices, yoghurts, fresh fruits, nuts, meats, cheeses, breads, cakes etc. etc. and also the option to have whatever your hearts' desire of cooked items. It certainly set us up for the day.
Our room was delightful and on the 7th floor, we had a balcony from which we could watch the hustle and bustle on passeig de gracia.  
We found this hotel to be in an ideal location for everything - shopping, sight seeing, restaurants. We plan on returning again next year and will certainly book The Majestic again.",5,2013,11,18
11,Amazing Experience ! Great Value for money !,"After couple of worst Hotel experiences in Barcelona , for final night I checked in Majestic Hotel. Was welcomed by Pascal Billiard - General Manager at Lobby where I understand he does this for most of his guests checking - in. 

What an Amazing Hotel is this and how famously it has been managed. The luxury and hospitality is hidden in every detail your eye can catch. I was thrilled to have the red roses in every where , orchids placed in every room. The staff starting from reception are great , Guest Relation Manager Ingrid , how welcoming and attentive she was to make me feel comfortable and feel at home. Always on alarm waiting for guests to ask something so that they can make it happen. 

I only stayed one night and given the limited time frame , I had a fantastic sleep, the bathroom was large and rain shower experience was remarkable. Breakfast is something every guest should enjoy and taste before they leave. Wi-Fi in the room was fullest and so satisfactory. Hotel has the best location looking to one of the richest and famous streets in Barcelona. 

Bathroom amenities are Bvlgari and it is a real treat to your body and hair. Next time , will ensure to stay couple of days more. 

Thanks to Majestic for making me feel special.",5,2013,11,17
11,WONDERFUL CHARM AND GREAT LOCATION,"We just got back from Spain! We stayed at the Majestic for 4 days and we loved it! The location is fantastic, about a 15 minute walk to Las Ramblas, on the Passeig De Gracia which is a main street with great shops. You're not right on top of Las Ramblas, but you can walk over to the 2 Gaudi residences in the neighborhood. The hotel has a great rooftop deck, pool, bar, with great views of the Sagrada Familia. The staff is great, very helpful. The room was beautiful, 3rd floor overlooking a quiet street. We loved everything about the room except that it is a tad on the small size, and had twin beds.  It was all beautifully done. There is a big gap in price from our room to the rooms with the king size beds, probably another $150-$200 a day, not worth it to me...",5,2013,11,16
11,Almost perfect,"The Majestic was recommended by an American executive stationed in Barcelona.  It is elegant, perfectly situated, rooms are up to date and even the small standard one was adequate with a great bathroom, large screen TV with a huge channel lineup, good turn-down service, AC works great, Concierge was excellent, very attentive staff: friendly doorman, front desk personnel, bar staff, and even the bellman bend over backward for you.  My understanding is that they are trying to become a five-star hotel.  With the number of Americans we met while staying there the only thing I can recommend would be someone always on duty on the rooftop bar (which is not to be missed) who is fluent in English.  The other thing is the grossly inflated breakfast price of 37 Euros.   Really?  You think any breakfast can be worth that much?  That is one way to cut out the common American tourist as I didn't meet a single one who ate there, but as with anything, someone will pay the price (if they are on company money especially).   I also lacked any success getting an email reply as I read about in other reviews.  In this day of internet that just should be a priority to fix.",5,2013,11,14
11,Absolutely perfect,"Such a wonderful hotel. Amazing staff. Breakfast buffet was wonderful and the very nice lady who was at the egg station couldn't have been sweeter.  We ended up with an upgraded room and it was absolutely fantastic.  

The rooftop bar is not to be missed. I would say that my one caveat was that the service on the rooftop bar was a little slow. Not a problem for us as we were in no hurry to leave. But I did hear other patrons complaining about the service.  Guess I was too relaxed to care all that much and was enjoying myself too much.  So if you are in a hurry for a quick drink, I'd say stick to the bar on the main level. It was wonderful and I highly suggest getting the  Parmesano-reggiano appetizer to nibble on with your wine. It was heavenly.

Majestic Hotel - you outdid yourself. Thank you. We will definitely be back.",5,2013,11,14
11,Magnificent!,"Just returned from an amazing stay at the Hotel Majestic. Beautiful room overlooking Passeig de Gracia, gorgeous marble bathroom, HUGE breakfast buffet, breathtaking views from the rooftop bar. All incredible. But it is the STAFF that made our stay. We had a series of emails before arrival helping us with restaurant recommendations/reservations and a hair salon appointment for me.  When we arrived we had early check-in - an unexpected but very welcome treat. Every day the concierges helped us with maps, directions, a car rental, etc., We were greeted personally and warmly - we felt like royalty!  Marta in guest relations was especially kind to us - she made us feel like we were the only guests at the hotel.  We bumped into the GM - Pascal - as we were leaving, and he too, was gracious and warm.  The neighborhood is upscale and all that, so I should mention that, too AND you can walk to La Padrera and Casa Botllo - STAY AT THE HOTEL MAJESTIC you will be thrilled you did. We were and we are already planning to return.",5,2013,11,14
11,One of the best hotels I've ever visited,"Great location. Very attentive and friendly staff who are all willing to do anything you are asking for. I stayed here for five nights, and every single night was more than great. The hotel is quite small but that doesn't mean they have something missing. They now offer you free Wi-Fi from this November after all the negative comments written here. Breakfast buffet is not huge, but the selection was just enough for me. Amenities are from Bulgari with great quality. Very comfy beddings. Rooms are with style. So I should say I was very much satisfied with this hotel!",5,2013,11,13
11,Lovely hotel,"Thoroughly enjoyed our 2 night stay.  Staff welcoming on arrival.  Room clean and light with a nicely renovated bathroom.  Location also favourable, being within walking distance to the Gothic area and nice shops along the way.  Good breakfast.  Very nice clean restrooms and well appointed.  Comfortable roof terrace a welcome addition.  Free wifi.  Not far to walk to a great local restaurant - la culinary d'en garriga.",5,2013,11,12
11,A memorable stay,"Hands-down, cards-on-the-table, honest-from-the-depths: best place to stay in Barcelona. Everything, including a remarkable rooftop terrace and incredible staff, points to excellence. Luxury at it's finest.",5,2013,11,11
11,Perfect Hotel to start off  a Meditterenean cruise,"Great Room and Service at this hotel. It was a perfect hotel for every tourist in Barcelona. It is just walks away to a lot of sights, cafes and restaurants in this city. The bed is uber-comfy and the living room was cozy too. My wife had a really good rest after a 17 hour flight from Asia. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,11,09
11,Great city break,Impressive hotel close to many designer shops. Ten minutes walk to la ramble and most attractions within 30 mins walking distance.  Staff very friendly and welcoming and roof top bar was lovely. It is expensive but in keeping with the surrounding areas. You get free wifi if you ask for the code at reception. Lovely spacious rooms and maids left chocolates and slippers before bed! Would recommend to anyone.,5,2013,11,03
11,No free Wifi in this day and age!,"I had a brief stay for two nights with my partner, and enjoyed the hospitality. However, the biggest disappointment was the lack of internet in the hotel. There was no free wifi in this day and age, which I was really unhappy about. You could get wifi, but you had to buy it on extortionate rates! 
There was free internet on age old desktop computers in the business centre, but those computers were very slow. 
One side of the bed collapsed during the first night into a bowl like hole! Not impressed. 
Location is pretty decent enough, but sadly I wouldn't recommend the hotel.",3,2013,11,02
11,nice location,"The ""hardver"" is great (location, room quality) but the software is not...(The wifi is not free, the breakfast is simple and the stuff is not so gentle. )The pool on the roof is way smaller than I thought.",4,2013,11,01
11,Great city center location,"Great central location. friendly staff. Clean.
nice bar on roof top (a la Gansevoort in NYC, but not as noisy).
Would go back. Cannot accurately review breakfast, given that we went out each morning to local café. However heard it was ok but pricey.",4,2013,10,30
11,Look no further....,"My husband and I just returned from a week stay, October 21st to 27th at the Majestic Hotel.  Having never been to Barcelona before and after reading many review, we decided on the Majestic based on the location.  We couldn't have been more pleased.  The hotel is central and convenient to everything the city has to offer.  The hotel was beautiful, our room was a bit small as we booked a standard room but it worked perfectly for two of us.  The marble bathroom was well appointed and the shower was amazing.  The rooms were quiet and we really enjoyed the Nespresso coffee maker as it is what we use at home.  Service was excellent, the staff was friendly and helpful.  It was just a pleasant stay all around in an amazing city.  With so many reviews and options, feel positive that you will enjoy your stay at the Majestic.",5,2013,10,30
11,Great Hotel - Excellent Location,My wife and I spent 4 fantastic days at this hotel while visiting Barcelona. The location is great and provides a great base from which to explore every part of the city. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful and interested in our plans each day and where we were going. The room was good and the bed very comfortable. We really enjoyed finishing each evening with a cocktail (or three) on the rooftop which had great views over the city.,4,2013,10,29
11,Majestic indeed,"Perfectly located on Barcelona's finest street, this is a first class hotel, with beautiful rooms and a dedicated attentive staff. We had a ""Paseo de Gracia room"" with a little balcony and a lovely view.  For those who, like me, appreciate a strong shower current, bathroom was amazing with Bvlgary amenities. The room had a Nespresso machine and twice a day maid service. Concierges were extremely helpful with everything we needed. We skipped breakfast and opted for the coffee shop across the street. It wasn't cheap (EUR400 per night) but it's worth it. Think I found my place in Barca.",5,2013,10,28
11,Beautiful hotel - perfect location,"We just got back from a trip to Spain, and Barcelona was our second stop (in between Madrid and San Sebastian). We were SO pleased with the Majestic Hotel! We were greeted with a complimentary bottle of champagne and upgraded room -- which is always appreciated! The room was beautiful -- large and comfortable, and the property in general was gorgeous. Staff is friendly, and helpful. Breakfast is over the top delicious -- i would suggest getting it included in your rate. The location was perfect for us. We did a ton of walking and exploring, and the location was central to everything. I visited the spa -- which a nice (and expensive treat), and the rooftop bar is a great perk as well. The view is unlike any other! Would absolutely return to the Majestic!",5,2013,10,28
11,Excellent location,"Excellent location! This hotel is beautifully situated and is very central. So central that it pretty much houses the Chanel boutique. It's clean, rooms are great, hotel staff is very friendly. Breakfast was rich with a variety of things to choose from. What was disappointing was the daily 15 euro internet service. Paying for wifi at such a hotel is ridiculous.",5,2013,10,28
11,Very Good Location!,Very good location.Comfortable.You can easy go to famous place etc by walk.,4,2013,10,24
11,Majestic in location only,"My husband and I spent two nights at the Majestic, prior to a cruise.  It is in an ideal location for seeing sights and upscale shopping.  Tapas restaurants galore were in close proximity to the hotel.  We went to the first floor cocktail lounge for a drink while waiting for our room to be ready.  While the menu indicated they had our gin brand, the bartender said they were out.  So, he gave us a more expensive brand and charged the higher price.  Essentially, we paid $40 for two gin and tonics!  Check in was fine.  Despite ordering a double room, we were given twin beds.  When we inquired about another room, we were told there weren't any rooms available, and they would ""fix"" the bed situation.  So housekeeping came upstairs, pushed the twin beds together, and put a sheet over the merged twins.  There was still a gaping middle hole.  Unfortunate, since we were celebrating our wedding anniversary.  The shower water temperature was inconsistent, and surged between hot and cold.  For the very expensive cost of this hotel, it is shortsighted and stingy to charge 15 euros for internet use.  The rooftop lounge has a fantastic view of the city, and the food was quite good and creatively prepared.  The buffet breakfast was diverse in its offerings, and many items were very good.  The omelets cooked to order were very dry.   We would not likely stay here again.  While there were some 5 star components to this hotel, it falls short of being worth the price.",3,2013,10,22
11,Breakfast buffet heaven,"The rooms were lovely, if a bit smaller than expected.  Very quiet, well sound proofed rooms.  But the breakfast, oh my word.  Our lad had 4 courses, mostly chocolate based and it was a great way to start the day",5,2013,10,21
11,oasis of calm,"We recently stayed for a few nights at the Majestic during the La Merce folk festival in Barcelon and it was superb. While most of the areas of Barcelona were teeming with tourists, the Majestic offered an oasis of calm. The rooms are lovely, but best of all is the roof terrace with pool and bar. In the evening, the terrace was full  and a deejay played great tunes until 1am. We had beautiful views of all of Barcelona. When we returned to the Majestic for an additional night after a cruise, we were upgraded to a Penthouse Suite with a jacuzzi pool, lounge chairs, dining area and chairs and umbrella, again with views of all of Barcelona. What a special hotel!!!!",5,2013,10,20
11,Summer in the city,One of the best hotels we've ever visit. Excellent breakfast in quality and choice. Bar at the  top (10. floor) with a wonderful view over Barcelona. We did enjoyed very much the outside bar every evening. The hotel is optimal located for sightseeing tours and you need only 30 minutes by train from the aeroport to the hotel. Staff is excellent,5,2013,10,19
11,Our favourite hotel in the world,"My husband and I have stayed here 3 times. Twice on our own and once with the children. Every stay has been exceptional. Our flights are always in the morning ancestry arrived before the 3pm check-in time she reception staff put our luggage in a secure hold so we can go out and enjoy the city without our bags. 
Our room has always been large and clean and the bathroom luxurious. 
Our favourite part of the stay is the breakfast. There is so much choice. Nothing is to much trouble for the staff.",4,2013,10,16
11,one of the best hotels  in barcelona ( highend class),"majestic is a five star hotel on a very good location .its in the middle of high end shopping where its not as crowded as rambla.if you want to be in the city  close to everything and if you are ready to pay  the price of a five star this is the hotel ..
first class service ,excellent  staff ,very special reception and concierge .
dont miss the bar at top teras with city view.
worth to mention breakfast  bufet 
rooms  very  comfortable and  nice new furniture . bathrooms  worth to mention .",5,2013,10,12
11,Majestic Hotel and Spa Barcelona,We arrived at the hotel in the morning to drop our bags off with the concierge and were told we would be able to check in at 3pm. We were kept waiting until close to 6PM along with two rooms filled with other travelers waiting. I don't know what the hold up was...possibly short housekeeping staff...as we were never offered an acceptable explanation. The rooms themselves were clean and the location of the hotel is optimal but the service was certainly NOT 5 star!!,3,2013,10,12
11,"Aside From the Check-In, a Very Good Experience","Back recently from 12 days in Spain, including 3 nights at the Majestic Hotel & Spa in Barcelona.  We arrived about 2 hours before the official check-in time and were told that our room wasn't ready.  So, we freshened up in a lobby restroom, checked our luggage, and headed out for some mid-day touring.  We returned to the hotel 3 hours later -- 1 hour after check-in time -- and were told that the room still wasn't ready and we should come back in 1/2 hour.  We went up to the rooftop bar for a drink and came back in 40 minutes, only to be told that the room was still not ready.  We waited in the lobby for another 1/2 hour before I lost my patience and got rather aggressive at the front desk.  And Presto!  Within 10 seconds of raising my voice, our room became available.

It wasn't a good start for such a highly-rated and rather pricey hotel, but I must admit that it got much better after that.  Our junior suite was spacious, it offered an outstanding view over the busy street below (while still being very quiet), it was nicely appointed (looking perhaps newly refurbished), and it was exceptionally clean.  The bathroom is good-sized, with ample counter space, a stand-up shower, a whirlpool tub, and a separate toilet/bidet room. The rooftop bar is beautiful and includes a small swimming pool, which is pretty unusual in Europe.  And our interactions with hotel personnel after our initial encounter were all very positive, and at no time did we think that our same-sex couple status mattered at all to hotel staff.  Importantly, the hotel's location could not be more centrally located in relation to the city's principal tourist sites.

Aside from the check-in experience, my only other quibble is that the shower water temperature fluctuated perpetually between cool, just right and very hot, forcing each of us never to stand under the rain shower when not using it to rinse.  But, in fairness, we found that precise issue in nearly every Spanish hotel at which we stayed, so that may be hard to avoid.

Overall, we liked the Majestic and would stay there again.",4,2013,10,12
11,Great Location!,"I stayed at the Majestic earlier this year for a conference and had an enjoyable stay. The location of the hotel is ideal, down the road from the famous Casa Fuster hotel, around the corner from the remarkable Gaudi buildings and close to the best shops, restaurants and the buzz of the city.

The staff were friendly, well presented and super helpful.

My room was perfect, a great size with good light and a nice comfortable bed.  The bathroom was perfect and very clean.

Breakfast was good and with plenty of choice.  The rooftop bar is also an added bonus!

I really enjoyed staying here as a base for a business trip.",4,2013,10,11
11,Wonderfull location and great hotel.,We enjoyed our stay. Room was clean and good size. Location was excellent.  Breakfast was great. Very friendly staff.  Overall amazing hotel close to city Centre.  Will definitely stay here again next time.   ,5,2013,10,09
11,Great Location,"This hotel was right in the heart of Barcelona, with a lot of attractions within walking distance.  The room was clean, but pricey.  The staff was not overly helpful.  I would probably try a different hotel if I returned to Barcelona.",4,2013,10,08
11,Nicely Located and Wonderfully Appointed Hotel in Barcelona,"We enjoyed our stay at the Majestic Hotel & Spa.  The hotel is very conveniently located to shopping and restaurants. The hotel has been beautifully maintained and is very well decorated. The rooms are large and well appointed.  We really enjoyed the rooftop restaurant where you can enjoy the views of the city in every direction.  The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. The only drawback that I can think of was that the check in for people arriving from a cruise took a very long time.  We were not a on cruise, and checked in the day before my elderly mother who was arriving via cruise ship.  She was able to use our room and not wait in the very long line of people arriving from her ship.",4,2013,10,06
11,Location! Location! Location!,"This hotel was perfectly located in the heart of Madrid. Tons of shops and restaurants at your doorstep. The staff were fantastic and very helpful! I must say that the breakfast was absolutely perfect each morning as well. If you're feel adventurous, the local metro is one block from the hotel and easy to take. The rooms were very nice and clean and the bed was comfortable. Great water pressure in the showers as well.",4,2013,10,03
11,5 star but missing the mark at times,"A smart, elegant hotel. In general, the staff are very helpful. Every time you leave/enter the hotel you're always greeted by some of the most friendly doormen I've ever met!   

For us this was the right area to stay - slightly away from the hustle and noise of bring in the middle of town (eg Le Meridien), but only a short walk (10-15mins) to nice cafes/restaurants etc.

We were a little concerned when we checked in. Despite booking a double room we were given a twin one. We were informed that that ""most of our rooms are twin"". A few hours later housekeeping had pushed the twin beds together and provided a large mattress. It was fine, but by the morning there was a little dip in the middle of the mattress.

We booked an executive room, which was tastefully decorated and very quiet. The bathroom was also very nice. The roof top bar is fun - well worth sipping a glass of cava and enjoying the views over the city.

Despite being a 5 star hotel, with prices to match, Majestic let itself down in a number of areas:
> Internet connection - 15 euros a day; really, for a 5 star hotel? In 2013? 
> The hot water in the shower is quite temperamental. Every few minutes it would go from the temperature I had set it to, to scalding hot for 5-10 seconds, before going back to the desired temperature.
> I'm don't think that a 5 star hotel should charge it's guests for using the coffee making facilities in the room. This, along with the 15 euro/day charge for wifi, left us feeling that Majestic was trying to squeeze as many euros as it could out of its guests. 

Would we stay here again? Probably not; we'd probably try the Mandarin Oriental or Hotel Claris.",4,2013,10,02
11,Majestic is very good,"Concierge service was excellent.  Only issue was check in not until 3pm, so so if you get there early from international travel you are sort of stuck for a few hours.
Yet, the terrace was an excellent place to sit back relax and enjoy the beautiful view of the city.",4,2013,09,29
11,Apartments,"We stayed in an apartment here, having booked in a sister hotel initially but our booking fell through. The apartments are lovely, balcony excellent kitchen and sitting room is very comfortable. my only complaint would be the cost of wi fi.....9euros. As we hadn't initially booked here we couldn't complain and certainly weren't prepared to pay that price, one would expect a 5 star establishment to have it as part of the room price. The booking desk at the main hotel had long waits, and eventually we got to the head of the queue only to be told we had queued for the concierge and not the booking in. A minor frustration but it was not clear which Q was which.",4,2013,09,27
11,Lovely but ......,"I've just spent 2 nights at the hotel hosting a group of 36 people I flew to Barcelona from South Africa. My check-in experience was frustrating and annoying. We arrived at the hotel at 10 am having just completed a 7 day cruise on the Mediterranean. We'd been advised in advance that our rooms would only be available at 3 pm and it came as a pleasant surprise that some rooms were actually available when we arrived ...but not mine (which wasn't a problem for me as I was keen to get out into the city celebrating the La Merce festival). I returned to the hotel at about 3.15 pm and was told my room would be ready in 20 minutes ...... 30 minutes later I was told the room was ready but they were checking the mini-bar and it would be ready in 10 minutes .... I finally got into my room (suite 325) at about 4.30. The receptionist apologized but told me that they were only expecting my group at 10 pm. Can't figure that out because the booking was handled by the same people who collected us from the port at 9am that morning. But gripes aside .........
The hotel is lovely but not on a par with other 5* luxury hotels in which I've stayed (my reviews of some of these are on tripadvisor). My suite was spacious and comfortable, super bathroom, excellent breakfast, etc, etc .........but I agree with some of the other reviews that suggest that the hotel just doesn't live up to one's expectations of a hotel of this class. 
The location of the hotel is good but not wonderful. My group of 36 were mostly women over 55 years old and they found the walk to and from the Pl. Catalunya a bit much the second and third time round. My advise would be that if having the Chanel shop in your hotel is not a priority - find a hotel closer to the centre (there are other 5* and 4* options that I would choose in preference to the Majestic).",3,2013,09,26
11,Lovely and perfect location,"The hotel is located on a main street in an upscale area right in the middle of two of Gaudi's main residencial sites. The staff was helpful and friendly and the rooftop bar/pool has fabulous views. Although busy during the day, reasonably quiet in the evening. Good access to metro, tour buses and restaurants as well as high end shopping.",5,2013,09,24
11,Not a proper spa hotel.,"Don't be fooled, this isn't a spa hotel. There is a tiny plunge pool on the roof and a roof ""hut"" with a couple of small treatment rooms offering expensive massages/facials etc. It is misleading to think of this hotel as a spa.

The location is very good and the rooms are large and very well equipped with Villeroy & Boch bathroom fittings, a Parlux hair dryer (world's best) and Bvlgari products. ",4,2013,09,20
11,Relaxation at its best,"Truely Majestic. Caring staff, wonderful food, excellent location. What more could one want.
Barcelona is a fun city with a variety of Spanish Cultures, great innovative architecture, sandy beaches and great food experiences. The Majestic is ideally centrally located to facilitate easy access to all these pleasures.",5,2013,09,20
11,Fabulous,"Beautiful hotel in perfect location. Really plush room with stunning bathroom and the biggest bathtub I had ever seen. Well stocked mini-bar and delicious food. Gorgeous lobby. Was amazed there was no free wi-fi, thought that was a bit stingy. Great roof top terrace with pool and bar. The spa wasn't what I had hoped for, small and disappointing 
Otherwise recommend this one especially off season as it didn't cost as much as you'd think.",5,2013,09,20
11,Wonderful & friendly,"I have stayed in March 2013 at the Majestic, and it was a wonderful, classy and very friendly stay, staff are polite & professional.
Breakfast is a delight, but you have to come early, as with Barcelona, this hotel is a prime property in Barcelona and you will be amazed at the number of guests arriving for breakfast.
Location is equally important, and nothing equate to the Paseo de Gracia, superior in every sense.",5,2013,09,19
11,A True 5-Star Experience,"There is a small sign out front of The Majestic that says “gran lux.”  It’s not an exaggeration. 
 
This is a classic, stunning hotel, located on the prestigious Paseo de Gracia, amidst all the high-end stores and within easy walking distance of the main attractions in Barcelona.  Service is exceptionally friendly, thorough and attentive, in the classic European tradition.

Our room was the real surprise.  We’d stayed at the Majestic before, and it was very, very nice, but there has obviously been an even greater upgrade since then.  Our accommodation was spacious, quiet, beautifully designed and . . . most important to a tired traveler . . . had a marble clad, spa quality bathroom that was just spectacular.  

The Majestic staff took care of everything for us . . . from making dining reservations to having cabs waiting, with proper directions to the driver, when we wanted to go out to various parts of the city.  They made our visit pleasant and effortless.  Very impressive.

A final note . . . we thought that, based on the overall experience, costs were exceptionally reasonable:  a great value for the money.",5,2013,09,19
11,Great hotel in a great location,"We have just returned from a 6 night stay at The Majestic Hotel.   The hotel is located in a fantastic area, close to great restaurants, high street shopping, tourist hotspots, bus tour stops and within walking distance to La Rambla and further on to the Gothic area and beach.    We had a junior suite which was perfect for us with 3 very small children (all under 6).     The rooftop terrace and pool area is great for a bite to eat and a dip and the view of an evening is wonderful.     Service at breakfast can be a little hit and miss however overall, I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel.",5,2013,09,19
11,Laxury,"The problem is the will not give you a late checkout at all.......
And no free wifi which is suppose to be a free service as five star hotel,,,,,,,,,
If you will ask for an ironing table you have to wait for a very long time because there is only one table for all of the hotel rooms,,,,, ",4,2013,09,17
11,Perfect 5* experience,"We booked one night at the Hotel Majestic, we chose this hotel because of its location for the old city and great shopping area, we booked a junior suite which was very spacious and very clean with a very nice comfortable bed, our suite overlooked the main street but even so was very peaceful at night.

One thing you do notice at the Majestic is the staff are very polite and always give you a smile and if that is not enough to tempt you to this hotel, the breakfast is one of the best we have experienced with plenty of choice for all requirements, there is also a first class egg chef to hand. We did not dine in the hotel as there are so many restaurants nearby.

The Majestic is a first class choice of hotel when visiting Barcelona, yes it is at the expensive end for a hotel but this is luxury at its best, we will be back for sure",5,2013,09,17
11,Majestic stay,"We stayed at the Majestic in August prior to our cruise on the Royal Princess.  The location is perfect, lots to do and see nearby the hotel.  La Rambla is an easy walk from the hotel and there are numerous great places to eat.  The rooftop pool and bar was a great spot to regroup after a long day - beautiful views and a relaxing atmosphere.  The rooms were well appointed and comfortable and did not disappoint.  We would gladly stay there again the next time we are in Barcelona.",5,2013,09,16
11,Not for me,"Not sure if this hotel is in Cairo or Barcelona. Outside its definitely Barcelona. Inside the hotel it looks like Cairo which if you want to visit Spain makes the experience a little odd. Also the main lobby is under repair so the entrance is now a small lobby on the side of the hotel.
I liked the pool and the bar on the roof - its a cool space with great views of the city.
Frankly the rest is not for me.",3,2013,09,16
11,Very Nice hotel in central Barcelona,"Clean, friendly hotel in central Barcelona, not far away from the most popular sightings. We had to arrange a special event for some clients, and the hotel helped us out in a perfect way. The SPA is good, but small. Nice roof terrace and pool for relaxing.",5,2013,09,13
11,No Sleepless Nights In Barcelona,"I'm actually staying in multiple hotel rooms in Barcelona during my 10 day visit not because of choice; however, there seems to be allot of conventions in town during my stay and because I sometimes get only 49% percent voting majority in my relationship; well, maybe it's most of the time. 

My partner wasn't to arrive to Barcelona for the first 5 days of my stay so I set out to research the perfect hotel and unfortunately of the 4+ star hotels I was researching most had not availability or were filling up quickly.  I therefore narrowed it down to the Hotel Claris for my friday and saturday night stay; then over to The Majestic Hotel for my stay sunday through wednesday stay.  After that I'm over to The Mandarin Hotel down the street, review coming on that one as I'm only one night into our 4 night stay.

Well I'm reluctant to write this because I'm about to add one more 5 star review to it's pile and I'm afraid if these reviews keep up I won't find availability next time I'm in town; however, I think there service has quite a reputation in Barcelona so it wouldn't matter what my review was.  By the way I reserved the prepaid Junior Suite.

Positives:

1) Incredibly attentive, helpful, and professional staff.
2) Rooms are very quite, even, on the street side.  When I awoke I often wondered if it was 3:00 AM but it was 10:00 AM and incredibly quite even though the streets were very busy outside.
3) The rooms were a great mix of traditional and contemporary elements, very clean, and well taken care of.
4) The bed was incredibly comfortable, mattress and box spring (many hotels have a stiff mattress on a frame), and down comforters and pillows.
5) The bathroom was very nice, shower and tub, Bulgari Toiletries (one of my favorites) and thick towels and robes.
6) The roof top terrace pool and restaurant.  One of the best in town with views that will blow your mind.  The cocktails spot on and the tapas cooked right there next to the bar.  Fully staffed all day long, great service, rain or shine.
7) I used their spa service for a 90 minute massage and it was very good and reasonably priced.
8) I used the breakfast service downstairs twice and the layout was very extensive; omlet and pancake station, numerous meats and cheeses, incredible array of pastries, and various fruits.  
9) The internet service was complimentary 2.0 MB down / 1.0 MB up and all apps supported.
10) I used the dry cleaning services and the cost wasn't out of line with what I've experienced at other 5 star properties.  Same day service is standard.

Negatives:
1) Minor rough handoff during check in when I left my bags and later returned when my room was ready.  A bell man stepped right in and saved the day; when a couple of others just looked at me.  No big deal, ""when in rome"", chill.
2) Very tight check-out time.  Was reminded 15 minutes before with a party of two at my door; and later when I was just wrapping up but it was 10 minutes past checkout time I received a call and was asked if I knew what time the checkout time was.  I understand that they get into trouble if the next guest doesn't have their room ready in time so I wasn't too bothered.

And that's about it.  I would definitely recommend, definitely return, and when traveling I'm going to see if they have another one of their properties in the city I might be visiting.  I'm really going to miss that roof top terrace bar, the mojitos were one of the best ""scratch"" drinks; and I wear two hats at home, bartender and chef.",5,2013,09,12
11,Superb!,"Superb hotel, staff, rooms, location, views and breakfast.  

Beware... if you have kids and they get out of the pool with wet feet, the  pool area can be slippery. My daughter slipped and was fine, no fuss made or needed, but another older girl fell over and really hurt herself. If you're careful, you will be fine. On that occassion I noticed that the staff were really attentive and helpful.",4,2013,09,11
11,Best hotel ever!,"Every time I visit Barcelona - there's only one hotel - Majestic! Great location in the city next to Gaudi's masterpieces, amazing design, awesome room service, perfectly clean rooms, friendliest staff!",5,2013,09,10
11,Fantastic hotel,"Excellent hotel very nice,helpful and lovely staff,realy it is amazing hotel.The service is high quality.The location also in a very nice place.The price is excellent.I know this hotel before,
the rooms very big and the sweets are fantastic with jacouzi.Expresso machine in every room.Cleaning also very good.Very nice roof swimming pool.",5,2013,09,10
11,Great Location and a great Hotel!,"Wife and I have stayed here four times over the past five years, and have never been disappointed ... which is why we keep coming back!  Very luxurious and very classy.  Prices seem reasonable - especially for a prime hotel!",5,2013,09,10
11,Excellent Hotel,"All stuffs are well trained. Location is perfect. Aroun hotel there are many restaurants, many shops and near from many sightseeing points and subway station. I want to stay again.",5,2013,09,10
11,Love this 5-star hotel!!!!!,I believe this is an amazing hotel with impeccable service.  We stayed there for 4 nights.  The staff is very accommodating.  Location of the hotel is awesome.  The rooms are very nice and clean. Beds are very comfortable.,5,2013,09,10
11,This is a beautiful 5 star hotel located in the heart of Barcelona,We loved everything about this hotel. We arrived in Barcelona a day before our cruise left. I booked this hotel thru bookings.com at an excellent rate. When we arrived we were thrilled with this hotel. The rooms were very large by European standards. There is a bar on the roof of the building with breathtaking views of the city. The hotel is very centrally located and the staff was great. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. ,5,2013,09,09
11,"Great Location, fantastic hotel","This is my first trip to Barcelona and it was by luck that i booked this hotel. the location is awesome, the staff were very friendly. you have to have a drink and a swim on level 10 the views are not to be missed and at night we always enjoyed a drink on the roof top before bed. Our breakfast was included and worth having at the hotel as the food was very nice and they had a good selection. but there is heaps of cafes outside that do breakfast as well. The beds were very comfortable. the only issue for me was we booked 2 nights but i now wish we stayed for 5. oh well always next time and i will be staying here on my next trip to Spain.",5,2013,09,09
11,"Beautiful hotel, amazing location, amazing city!",Stayed at the majestic for four nights and had a marvellous time. Perfect central location on passieg de Garcia. Staff were really sweet and helpful. Love the rooftop pool and the turn down service. Expresso machine and mini bar was a little treat. Only critisim would be that the there is no free wi fi (€16 for 24 hours) and eating at the hotel is quite expensive (€6 for a soft drink).,4,2013,09,05
11,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED HOTEL IN GREAT LOCATION, GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY","The lobby was being renovated but this caused little disruption (I usually ask in advance , it would have been nice to know). We stayed for 4 nights and were delighted with our beautifully renovated suite, although it had no view it was quiet, spotless, well furnished and had a very comfortable king size bed with great pillows. Staff were professional, helpful and friendly. Sundowners were perfect at the lovely roof top bar with panoramic views of the city and La Sagrada Familia. Great location on the 'Fifth Avenue' of Barcelona with high end designer boutiques on the doorstep as well as Gaudi architecture. Breakfast room service was perfect every day, delivered promptly. As a highly discerning guest, I recommend this hotel and would stay here again on my next visit to Barcelona.",5,2013,09,04
11,Best Hotel in Barcelona,The hotel has the best loation as it's on Passeig De Gracia where all the shops are located and Plaza Catalunya is 5 min walking. I will definitely book my stay in this hotel the next time i go to barca :),5,2013,09,04
11,Great Luxury Hotel with excellent service and beautiful room,"We arrived at this hotel after a very long journey and were initially disappointed in our room
because it was not what we requested and were too tired to make a change. The following day
the hotel manager took us to another room which was twice as big and moved us in.
Thereafter our experience was beyond all expectations. The staff is courteous, helpful and friendly and guided us to nearby restaurants and other attractions. The breakfasts were splendid with excellent service and variety.
Our room was beautifully appointed and featured Bulgari toiletries. The room and bath were spotless and the beds very comfortable.
We will return without hesitation to visit  Barcelona again- a great hotel in a great city.",5,2013,09,03
11,Fabulous room upgrade,"We booked a junior suite at the highly recommended hotel for a 1 night stay. When we arrived we knew we were early as check in was from 3pm and we arrived at 1pm, so we did not expect the room to be ready. We had planned to eat lunch in the hotel dining room to pass some time for the room to be ready. Lunch was amazing. We were the only people eating lunch which we could not understand as the food was really good and so was the service. Its now 3pm and the room is still not ready reception estimated another 1 hour. So we are starting to feel a bit peeved now. We had coffee in the bar then went back to check reception. Without even saying one word they upgraded us to the penthouse suite 3k a night !!!!! (no charge to us of course). Like I said Fabulous room upgrade. Loved it. Thank you Hotel majestic.",5,2013,09,02
11,Renovations improve on historical excellence!,"Our third visit to Barcelona and our third stay at the lovely Majestic Hotel. While the lobby is still being renovated and the final configurations of the main floor are not clear, the renovations to the rooms have made an excellent location even more comfortable and beautiful. Received a lovely room overlooking the Passig de Gracia which was comfortable and offered a terrific nights sleep. Hotel staff are extremely friendly and helpful.  The remodeling of the rooftop bar is quite impressive and the views from this sanctuary continue to dazzle. We cannot wait to return!",5,2013,08,31
11,Great hotel.,"Everything was great - other than waiting 3 hours past check in for our room. The remodel up front is causing some problems, but the hotel is beautiful and the suites spacious and elegant. Standard rooms are a bit small. The check in process and mass confusion of the front desk staff was very frustrating and poor customer service, but Francisco Camello saved the day. He stepped in, made things happen and turned what would have been an awful experience into a very positive one. He had only been at the hotel a week, but understands customer service. Thanks Mr. Camello. Excellent location.",4,2013,08,31
11,Great Hotel,"This hotel was in a fantastic position - make sure you book off a third party website as booking direct with the hotel is really expensive!  The rooms weren't as big as I thought they would be but they were extremely clean and modern and really high quality, the bathroom was brilliant aswell.  Breakfast is really expensive but very good although I would say go elsewhere for less than half the price!  I would definitely go to this hotel again if I was going to be in Barcelona.",4,2013,08,30
11,Muy Bueno! :),"I really enjoyed our stay at the Majestic in Barcelona this August!   The staff there was fantastic!   Helping me find a grocery store, get a taxi, find a Laundromat, carry my bags, etc etc.   It was obvious that they were all working hard to make the guests feel welcome and at home.   I have stayed in this hotel several times since 1999 (the last time in 2010) and the hotel rooms have been updated a few times over that period of time.   I found the most recent update to be fantastic...  The bathroom in particular was beautiful.    The rooftop has a beautiful pool and bar.   The location of the hotel is perfectly located on Passage de Gracie, out of the crowds of Las Ramblas, but close enough to walk there, super close to the metro and close enough to two of Gaudi's houses to walk.    Overall.. simply amazing!",5,2013,08,29
11,Perfect Location!,Very good location to explore the whole of Barcelona.  Located right next to high end retail stores and just a short drive to the beach. The hotel has a wonderful rooftop pool with a nice view as well as another bar downstairs at the reception. Nice rooms and well furnished. The front entrance was being renovated so service was slightly tacky due to the disruption. (Would have been nice to get a warning),5,2013,08,28
11,Quality,"We stayed here for 3 nights and had a amazing time.Perfect location for just about everything barcelona has to offer.Staff are friendly and helpful,hotel is spotless even though there is work being done to the reception and the rooms are kept to a high standard of cleanliness.Our only gripe was that 2 single beds pushed together do not make for a comfortable king size bed,but other than that an exceptional stay and I would highly recommend to anybody.We shall be returning in the future.",5,2013,08,27
11,Excellent location to visit the city,"- very clean rooms
- top quality roof top bar with fantastic views over the city
- very friendly staff
- the pool is rather small but very convenient after a hot day in the city with a lot of sightseeing: the location is just perfect for shopping, culture and business.",5,2013,08,26
11,Beautiful Barcelona Hotel!!,"This is my second stay at the Majestic. Located a block off Las Ramblas... Close to all the shopping and wonderful restaurants. Very nice modern accommodations, very comfortable and clean. I would definitely stay here again!!",5,2013,08,26
11,Four stars for five star billing.,"Stayed for four nights having booked an Executive Deluxe room.
The quality of the room presented was excellent as five stars would suggest in the centre of Barcelona. In fact location proved to be fantastic as very close to both the metro and local trains; also a short walk to Ramblas.
Main entrance was still under going renovation - much of the hotel was already completed. However this meant thet the reception and concierge were at a side entrance and very crowded whenever passing through.
Check-in was fine and told us that we had a lovely room overlooking Passeig de Gràcia - true (7th floor). However no mention was made that this was a change to the booked room. A Deluxe Executive (30m2 to 40m2) changed to a Deluxe Passeig (20 to 26 m2) - the difference was a much better view in exchange for much reduced living space !  Bathroom less than half the size - this matters to a woman - and much less easy to relax in hindsight without a sofa or easy chair - despite website photos. Yes the price is slightly higher on the website ! We felt that this was a hotel weaze.
We stayed as had already unpacked, but felt disappointed throughout our stay even though we could have moved. The disappointing aspect was that this wasn't even mentioned at check-in and we had to discover the difference - definitely not 5 a star approach.
It was a busy time (August) for the hotel and the breakfast area was inadequate for the number of guests. At times it became a melee trying to access the buffet breakfast - with at times a  wait in a queue for up to ten mins for a fried egg. Breakfast food quality was excellent, with a superb choice, but too many people in such a small space, relatively speaking, to select from the buffet and constant movement did not make for a relaxing experience. Waiters were a mixture of consideration and disgruntled, whilst cooked egg/omelette chef were considerate and apologetic about the wait.  
The roof top terrace had a fine view over the roof tops of Barcelona but the pool was rather small - not a swimming pool.   
The Concierge staff were very helpful with car parking and general advice and should be complimented.
For five stars there was that something lacking - not helped by annoyances such as charging 15 Euros/day for wireless internet or even worse 1 Euro for a Nespresso coffee capsule !",4,2013,08,24
11,Great  location for visiting Barcelona,This is an excellent hotel very centrally located and is ideally located for visiting Barcelona.The hotel throughout is very clean and the service is excellent.The pool however is no more than a plunge pool.Excellent breakfasts.,5,2013,08,23
11,Lovely experience,Couldn't be happier with the Majestic Hotel. Stayed in a junior suite with our teenage daughter for 1 week. Great location for all the sites. Can easily walk to Las Rambles and many of the Gaudi museums. Beautiful spacious room. Huge bathroom. Great service. Would definitely return to the majestic if we are lucky enough to return to Barcelona. Roof top pool was amazing!,5,2013,08,20
11,Lipstick on a Pig.,"We just spent four nights in Barcelona at the Majestic Hotel and found it to be a poor value for the price we paid.  We opted for an advance-purchase rate of €220 per night (~$290 per night) through the hotel directly for a deluxe room, which we felt (at the time) was a good price for a “five-star hotel” in Barcelona.  

If you decide to this hotel, I would encourage you to sign up for LMT Club, a travel club that offers amazing hotel deals.  We later found this property for under €200 per night with free breakfast and a complimentary room upgrade, but since our reservation was prepaid, there was nothing we could do to change it.  A note: LMT Club membership is usually $50/year, but if you do a google search for “LMT Club Free Membership,” you’ll find a link on the first page of search results that will waive that annual fee.

We took a cab from the airport which was quick and relatively inexpensive (€30).  The porters were quick to take our luggage, even though we each insisted that we could manage our carry-ons.  No big deal, just an unneeded tipping expense when you’re traveling lightly.

When we booked the room, we noted that we were celebrating a special occasion and also mentioned this to the concierge when making reservations for a day trip to Montserrat.  No acknowledgement of said occasion was made at check-in, nor at any point during the trip.  No in-room amenities, no upgrades, no nothing.  We asked about the availability of an upgrade, they insisted that the hotel was full.  This really gets to me, being that their website showed availability for every single room class on all nights of our stay (I looked in the cab on the way from the airport that day!).  We saw maybe 10 guests during the entire duration of our stay.  I would rather they offer the upgrade to me at a ridiculously obscene surcharge than LIE to me about it.  I would describe the service we experienced throughout our stay as being consistently cold and unwelcoming, making the new renovation feel like lipstick on a pig---a pig that really doesn’t understand hospitality to begin with.

Our Deluxe Room with 2 Twin Beds faced the rear of the hotel, overlooking a parking garage and surrounding buildings.  The room was the SMALLEST I’ve ever encountered in any “five-star hotel” at just 215 square feet.  The bellman couldn’t even find a place to put the luggage stand to put our suitcases and left them at the door in frustration.  Also worth noting, the beds were pushed up against each other, though this is common in European hotels and wasn’t a big deal for us.  

With that said, the room was excellently furnished.  The upholstered walls were elegant and richly laden with thick wood moldings.  The closets, albeit small, offered enough shelves and hanging spaces for two people to unpack comfortably.  The bathroom was beautiful, as well.  I really enjoyed the excellent sound system in the room that allowed you to listen to the TV programming while in the bathroom.  With a variety of music stations in the upper channels, it made the morning routine enjoyable, especially because I could have the sound off in the bedroom and on in the bathroom so as not to awake my sleeping traveling companion.  The Bulgari amenities were also top notch and the shower had excellent water pressure.  However, the glass partition is a bit poorly designed, causing the whole bathroom to get wet when you use the shower.

Besides this, there were some other poorly designed elements to the room.  First, the walls are EXTREMELY thin.  We could hear the entire conversation of the guests in the adjoining room while we were trying to fall asleep at night, which was quite annoying.  Second, there was no iron or ironing board in the room, so we had to call down to get one.  While annoying, this wasn’t a huge problem.  What made it into a problem was the fact that each day, the housekeeper took it away so we had to call back down and ask for it to be sent up again.  Additionally, for the first three nights of our stay, there were no notepads or pens in the entire room, which again is something I expect a hotel of this caliber to have.

We didn’t have breakfast in the hotel.  Instead, we opted for coffee and pastries at the cafe across the street at Il Caffe di Francesco which were excellent.  Their glazed donuts were the best I ever ate in my life.

We had dinner one evening on the rooftop of the hotel, which was disappointing.  Most of the restaurants on Passeig de Gracias closed by 11pm and with few other options, we opted to give it a try since it was open until midnight.  The food was decent, but WAY overpriced.  I wouldn’t go back, nor would I recommend it.

I came down with a pretty bad head cold, so we had room service one afternoon.  The food was excellent, but a bowl of spaghetti, a turkey club sandwich and two bottles of still water came to over €60.  

Where the hotel cannot be beat is LOCATION.  It is located on the “Fifth Avenue” of Barcelona with great shopping and restaurants right outside the front door (to put it in perspective, Chanel and Brunello Cucinelli have boutiques in the hotel).  You can walk to most of the main sites, including La Sagrada Familia and the attractions in the Gothic Neighborhood.  Park Guell and Barceloneta are a short, cheap taxi ride away.

We also hired a car to Montserrat through the hotel, and while it was pricey (€105 per hour for 4 hours...), it was well worth it.  Our driver was excellent and passionate.  He even gave us a tour of Barcelona on the way back.

All in all, its a four-star property at BEST, and that is being generous.  They missed the mark on all the little things that separate a “good” hotel from a “great” hotel.  If you’re looking for luxury, I’d recommend the Mandarin Oriental three blocks south on Passeig de Gracias.  Had my cold been so bad that I couldn’t fly to Seville for the next leg of our journey, we would have moved there.  The Renaissance is also a solid property that is a good value in the neighborhood.  Hotel Arts looks great, but we don’t care for its location.  But with all these other options to choose from, I’m not likely to return to the Majestic or recommend it very highly.",3,2013,08,20
11,A great place to stay.....,"We spent 5 nights here from August 13th onwards. My 60th birthday was on August 14th and when we came in from our travels that day, there was a bottle of champagne on ice in our room, together with Chocs, etc. What a superb gesture and a wonderful surprise. But that aside, this is a lovely clean, efficient hotel and if there is any negative at all, it would only be its prices which are high. I'd say to you, go on and pamper yourself....",5,2013,08,20
11,"Very friendly staff, Nice hotel.","We stayed at this hotel for a week and we were very impressed by the customer service level. The AC in our room had a problem 1 night, they dealt with the situation very well. They gave us another room to continue sleeping while they sent a technician to the room. The problem was fixed when we woke up. They sent us a box of chocolates and a letter saying they were sorry. They also wiped charges to compensate us for the inconvenience. And we didnt even have to ask. 

Minibar, roof bar and internet prices are high. But the service is truly brilliant. If you are a couple you have to ask for the twin beds to be joined into a double bed otherwise beds move apart. But when ee asked this was done in no time. Actually every request was dealt with very quickly and we were very impressed overall. Thanks guys for making our stay pleasant.",5,2013,08,19
11,Wonderful even with contraction,"We arrived at the side entrance, since the main entrance is under construction.  Our rooms were beautifully designed and comfortable.  The location can't be beat and the hotel has several amazing features.  First is the roof top bar for evening cocktails, with views of the whole city if Barcelona.  Next is the breakfast buffet - wow, what a way to start the day.  Next is the roof top pool and deck.  Even our showers were masterpieces of design.  I took pictures of the shower drains for the next house we build.  The renovation will make this hotel even nicer and we look forward to coming back.",5,2013,08,18
11,It's the little things..,"Like the sad faced girl who checked us in and didn't as much as a grin, just was going through the motions like a robot. I'm surprised she didn't yell ""next"" when she was ready for us. More of a government office vibe than a 5 star hotel. 

Also I understand charging for the internet because it's so profitable, but in this day and age it's a necessity and not a luxury. Just like you, we use it to check reviews on restaurants, destinations, Google maps, buying tickets for events and even used it to book this hotel. Every nice hotel has Wifi in the lobby for free (at least for guests) but for some strange reason, not here. And if you do buy the overpriced internet (which I was practically forced to) it's only for one device at a time which means if I need to do work (which I do) and my wife wants or needs to do something online, she has to ""wait in line"" until I'm done or pay for another separate connection. I can stomach $15 euros per day for internet but $30 euros daily is pushing the limits of principle. For some dumb reason I will never understand the management here must be so nervous that a user might steal an occasional internet session here or there, that they inconvenienced everyone by having a stone age ""one at a time"" policy. 

Aside from those gripes it is a nice but ""under construction"" hotel. The main entrance is under construction and we have to go through a side entrance which of course was not mentioned when the reservation was made. Don't get me wrong, I'm not in Barcelona to sit in my room and surf the web but in the evenings when we return, I have to catch up on work as this is a working vacation. My wife also likes to visit Trip Advisor to plan our next days but has to wait until I am done working which again is a teeny tiny little thing, but so unnecessarily old fashioned and easy to fix that it should not be happening.

I'll never stay here again nor recommend it to friends and we will stick with (for example) the 5 Star Westin (like we stayed at in Madrid) that includes Wifi in the nicer rooms, includes a buffet and they make you feel fantastic from the moment you enter the hotel for the first time till the moment you check out. This is NOT a 5 star hotel but in all fairness has 5 star potential. If they worked out these little kinks, it would be much closer and a step in the right direction.",2,2013,08,18
11,Great place at a bargain price!,"After a recent cruise we spent two nights (8/15 - 8/17) at The Majestic.  One room was a junior suite and one was a standard room.  Both rooms were excellent, the location is fantastic and the staff was great.  We upgraded one of our standard rooms to a suite but when I saw how big and nice the standard rooms are I regretted spending the extra money.  The junior suite was fantastic and included a very nice breakfast for two each day.  The upgrade really was a bargain, a very nice suite with a large outdoor deck overlooking the City.  If you go to Barcelona put The Majestic on the top of your list.  Last time we were in Barcelona we stayed at the Hotel Arts - Ritz Carlton.  Next time I go back we'll be at The Majestic!  Air conditioning was great, nice and cold.",5,2013,08,18
11,We stayed in their Residences apartments across the street - SUPERB,Amazing value for a luxurious 2 bed apartment overlooking Passieg di Gracia...all one could wish for. A very short walk across the street and we enjoyed the rooftop pool & bar in the afternoon with the children. Wonderful find of a hotel for families.,5,2013,08,18
11,Excellent hotel,"I stayed for 5 nights, Location is superb, you almost at the footsteps of all attractions of the city, almost o taxi  needed.
Rooms will decorated, seems over used but they are keeping maintainance, but 3 meters wide!!!!
Bathrooms are excellent, new, all marbles even with all needed perfect small things.
New Samsung TV, and nespresso coffee maker, but watch out , it is not free, one euro per shot, strange, if i used 4 shots means nothing to the hotel but means lots to the coffee addict if complementary.
No complementary Internet, 
Note, you can hear people in the other room talking, even their phone
Staff are great
In room dinning is OK reasonable from all prospectives
Beds are Ok, but not the best, they slide.
Over all is Very good hotel.

11,wonderful stay,"We have just spent 4 nights at this hotel and could not fault a thing, yes they are renovating but certainly did not cause us any problems. Staff are so helpful and pleasant, the doormen, bellboys, reception staff could not do enough for us, at breakfast, which is a vast selection of wonderful treats, the restaurant staff work so hard at keeping the selection well stocked, the tables clear, nothing goes unseen, the chap who oversees this ( looks like Freddy Flintoff) and as for the 2 wonderful smiley pleasant  girls on the desk of the restaurant help to make it a joy. Barcelona is a place I have wanted to visit for a while now, it was worth the wait, expensive but worth it. All courtesy of Jet2.com holidays will certainly go back and will use jet2 again.",5,2013,08,16
11,Not a great experience for me,"I have spent one week in Majestic for business reasons. The hotel is very centrally located on the beautiful Paseig de Gracia, walking distance from La Rambla and Plaza de Catalunya. It is an elegant hotel, looking calm and refined. The Standard room I stayed in was quite small but nicely decorated in neutral tones, clean and cozy. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was a pure heaven, very spacious and well designed, with quality toiletries from Bulgari. A nice touch that I appreciated was the Nespresso coffee machine. The only downside was the lack of storage space in the room, which forced me to hang my clothes in the bathroom. I was quite disappointed but I didn’t want to change the room as it was the fourth room which was offered to me and the only one that (partially) met my expectations. People might believe that I’m very fussy and difficult to please but the only thing that I requested was a quiet room as the qulity of sleep is important to me. The first room that was assigned to me bigger and had storage space. Unfortunately it wasn’t very quiet so I requested to see another one. I was presented one under the roof, having above the window the very noisy air-conditioning unit. Then I have been shown another room (superior category), which was large, had a separate dressing but it was located near the elevator and was facing the parking (so not quiet at all…). Finally I chose the first room…big mistake. When the family (two parents + two small children) accommodated in the room next to mine returned to the hotel, my nightmare started. The kids were screaming and running around, the father was shouting at them and the mother was talking on the phone on the corridor. On top of this, the TV had the volume at maximum. I was desperately trying to sleep for more than two hours but it was impossible so I went to the Reception, explaining the situation and the begging the person on duty to give me a quiet room. The guy was very nice and understanding; he immediately found me another room and sent the bellboy to help me with the luggage. In ten minutes I was moved but it was 1 am in the morning. There were no other problems during my stay, except at the check-out when my bill was charged with various minibar things that I didn’t consumed. After discussing with the Receptionist, these were removed but not all so I had to request again until all were removed. After three changes, I finally got the correct bill. I didn’t have breakfast in the hotel but I had tapas and drinks at the bar on the roof, which was lovely, with a great view and the food was delicious. The hotel staff was mixed: while some people were efficient and helpful, others were less focused and a bit affected. To conclude: I’m not sure if I will stay again at Majestic as my experience was not a pleasant one.",3,2013,08,15
11,Nice hotel in a good location,"I enjoyed my time the Majestic Hotel! The front desk staff was very, very helpful, which was great. Also, they are located near a subway stop, so we were able to get on the subway to get around Barcelona and do our site seeing. I agree with previous reviews that the temporary lobby is small and crowded etc, but that's ok, it's just temporary after all!

Our room was nice and quiet. Note that even though we took an elevator to our floor we still had to go down/up a couple of steps to get to our room, so if you have a wheelchair you will want to make sure that you are in a room that doesn't have that.",4,2013,08,14
11,Fantastic hotel,"Hotel staff were fantastic with all staff knowledgeable, friendly, helpful and professional. The rooms were great definitely worth including breakfast. Breakfast was really good, especially the iberico ham.",5,2013,08,12
11,Majestic luxury,"A five star hotel in every sense. Perfect location, peace and quiet inside, Barcelona's most comfortable bed, a really nice roof bar, breakfast is more than you can dream of. It is expensive, but worth it.",5,2013,08,11
11,Nice hotel but....,"At the time we stayed in the hotel they were renovating so there was a side entrance into the hotel, of course we were not advised of this prior to booking, the current lobby is tiny and over crowded especially if people have their luggage with them. Good location on the main  Shopping strip and 4 blocks away from center. Perfect if you plan to take the hop on hop off bus tours.
1 block away from la podrera ( building designed by Gaudi) and 1 block away (3mins) from la basilica also designed by Gaudi.

Originally we stayed in room 840, this room had no windows which is rather disappointing for a room in a 5 star hotel. My husband found it claustrophobic but given we only planned to stay in the room for sleeping we didnt complain. The room did have two sunlight windows, however to close the blinds on these i had climb on the bed and reach the ceiling. The automated button for the blinds did not work. This was also disappointing for a 5 star hotel which we paid about $200 per night.

On the other hand, the rooms were lovely and the bed was comfortable, the hotel provides bvlgari toiletries and travel adapter for non European travellers.
The rooms are cleaned up twice per day and in the evening you are give two little chocolates on your bed which is a nice gesture. The hotel also provides slippers and robes.
the hotel rooftop bar is nice and  has a lovely view, though poor service we had waiters walking past us at least for 15 mins before one bothered to ask if we were ready to order. 

So why have we rated the hotel low? Despite the little things already mentioned which would drive most people crazy, this holiday for us is a 6 week, go go go holiday and the last thing we wanted to do is waste time complaining and what really meant a lot to us is having a good nights sleep.
 So give us a good nights sleep and we will give you a great rating!

Nevertheless on our second night we had a visitor at 4am. Yes, a severely drunk man entered our hotel room... How?? Well it turns out our hotel room door was faulty, so with a couple of tries anyone could enter our room at any given time.
So of all rooms that this man could have entered he decided to try ours, the room on the second highest level and the last room in a windy corridor. How did he get past security? Yes we asked the same. 
We then called security and my husband went out into the corridor to find a drunk man, security advised us to go back to our room and talk to management in the morning. ( Firstly i dont think this is even good enough, go back to your room? really? after what just happened?) Needless to say neither of us slept that night.. What if we hadn't woken up upon the man opening our room door?

Management were actually really good about the incident. We requested to be moved to another room as even if they fixed the lock we would not stay in that room given the horryfying experience. they moved us to a penthouse room with our own balcony and where you actually could not get onto the level without scanning your room key. The room was lovely, however, once again on our final night we were unable to sleep and given the room was directly under the rooftop bar, every noise we heard scared us. We are now in Paris and are still very paranoid about sleeping in our hotel and the fact that at anytime a stranger could walk right into our room..

The hotel waived some costs for our breakfast and dinner, attempting to compensate us for the inconvenience, but the fact that they let a severely drunk man enter the hotel, not knowing where his room was and wonder around the corridors is just not good enough. It is a question of safety and the incident took away our feeling of safety at any hotel.

How often would this incident occur at this hotel again? Probably not very likely, but what we experienced was beyond scary and not acceptable. If it had not happened even with the minor issues with the room having no windows etc, we would have given the room/hotel at least a 4. However even with the hotel sorry for the incident and their attempt to rectify the situation, we could not look past what happened and the fact that anyone could have walked into our room at any time, take all our things or even attack us.",1,2013,08,10
11,A very pleasant experience,"Very friendly and polite staff; Excellent location ( near Casa Pedrera and Casa Batllo and also in the best shopping area), very confortable, elegant and nice Suite. All staff speak English very well and are really helpful; high quality of breakfast.  In the evening recommend the pool bar from the 10th floor for a special view over  the city. Internet îs free and works very well in the rooms.",5,2013,08,10
11,Good location but comes up short on details,"Second time I have stayed here, the hotel is being rennovated, the front entrance is temporary, no indication given beforehand was anegative.

The rooms are nice and the staff friendly but there is nickle and dime feeling.

Coffee machine in the room but you have to pay for the coffee! Internet was included but on arrival only one code allowed so we could not use more than one device. To the minute after we had checked in after 2 days it stopped and you had to pay extra, parsimonious!

Also the laundry charges at Euro 10 to wash a short sleeve casual shirt seems very high.

The roof pool was nice but always overcrowded. They have another hotel without a pool and allow those guests to use this pool. Given its small size this is unfortunate.

The hotel lobby was also often crowded they seem to have large groups staying before going on cruises.

Overall I think it was ok but not great. It was much better last time pre renovations. I would look for a smaller hotel next time.",3,2013,08,09
11,"Great hotel, great location","Stayed for 11 nights this July; my second stay at Majestic - and I will be back again. This is truly a five star hotel, with excellent service and standard. The rooftop terrace is wonderful, though the ""pool"" is way too small for swimming and the prices in the bar are quite expensive (even for a Norwegian like myself!), still, it offers a breathtaking view of the city. The gym is also nice, and offers fresh towels, fruit and water. The only downside is that you have to pay for your wifi, 15 EUR (!!!!) pr 24 hours, which not only is extremely expensive, but something that should have been free in a hotel like this. The location is great, a ten minute walk from Placa de Catalunya, and 15 mins from the old town. Pg de Gracia also offers great shopping, all the designer brands as well as more high street brands. Casa Batllo is only 1 block away, and you walk to Sagrada Familia in 15 mins. I'll definetely be back for the third, forth and fifth time.",5,2013,08,08
11,Fabulous location,"Traditional hotel in the heart of Barcelona. Great location for hop-on-hop-off, shopping and rambles. Staff are exceptionally helpful and friendly. Live pianist every evening. Rooftop pool lovely chill area with great cocktails and club sandwiches. Turns into lounge with DJ and fantastic views by night. Room was lovely, spacious with very comfortable bed. Huge TV and bath. Fresh linen twice daily with lovely turn down service at evening time. I would highly recommend. Moments from the Mandarin Oriental, and above Chanel and Burberry. Wouldn't hesitate to return.",5,2013,08,08
11,The place to stay in Barcelona!,Very nice hotel. We arrived around 1:00pm after flying in from the USA and they quickly got us a room so we could get some sleep. The hotel is locate in a good area and close walking distance to many city attractions and restaurants.  We had a meal on the top of the hotel with great views of the city.  Would stay here again. Room was clean and comfortable.,5,2013,08,07
11,"Great Location, Rooms need a little work","This hotel is in a fantastic location. A short walk to the heart of Barcelona and the best shopping in the city. The hotel was nice. Rooms were clean, in need of a little update, but overall, very comfortable. We were staying in a room with 2 twin beds that were pushed together to make a ""king"". However, the beds were on wheels and would frequently roll apart, Most annoying! The hotel had a rooftop bar/pool which was lovely. The pool was a small splash pool, most suitable for children. Overall, the hotel was nice and the staff were pleasant. Great location. Good restaurants nearby, would not advise eating at the hotel for dinner, menu was expensive. Nice three night stay!",4,2013,08,07
11,Almost perfect but...,"Fantastic location on P de Gracia, so central.
Staff couldnt be more friendly.
Beds v comfortable, air conditioning wonderful.
Roof terrace a haven during the day and at night.
Treat was my free 10 min foot massage whilst I had morning coffee.

Only downside, much renovation taking place, so drills to be heard, areas closed off and we had to look out to scaffolding and workmen until the day we left.
We had 2 rooms but second was tight in size.
A lot to pay with no reference or allowance or this which left a slightly sour note for the price we paid.",4,2013,08,04
11,Incredible hotel in a great location!!,"I just came back from traveling through out Spain and I stayed at the Majestic Hotel in Barcelona. It truly is a five star hotel and the staff could not do enough to go out of their way to make me happy. The location is ideal and the rooms are beautiful. The bed is very comfortable as well as the pillows. I worked out in the gym as well and it was adequate. One of the best features about this hotel besides it's location is that it has an incredible roof top bar/pool/lounge. The hotel is under going a new lobby now, but that still did not take away anything from this truly gorgeous 5 star hotel. I have traveled the world and it's a MUST!!",5,2013,08,02
11,Majestic Experience,"Excellent location, lovely neighborhood complete with shops and cafes.  Easy to walk everywhere, even at night.  Doorman eager to get cabs for us.
Room was gorgeous, nespresso coffee maker a plus!  Bathroom was lovely and good air conditioning a plus.
Concierge was very helpful and our trip began with a 3 hour private tour he arranged for us within an hour of our arrival.",5,2013,08,02
11,Excellent hotel,"Great location walking distance to lots of attractions, comfortable beds and quiet rooms, excellent breakfast and the roof top pool and bar amazing. Would love to return one day to explore this city further.",5,2013,07,31
11,Great location!,This hotel is in a great location and the rooms are very comfortable. We had a suite and it was very spacious. The children were very comfortable in the sofa bed and we had a door that would close so we could enjoy our privacy. Would stay there again. Walking distance to a lot.,5,2013,07,29
11,Favourite roof-top bar in Barcelona,"Probably our favourite roof-top bar that we visited in Barcelona. Sophisticated, nice layout, live DJ, big comfortable seats, relaxing atmosphere, good views of Casa Batllo (Gaudi house)  in one direction and of Sagrada Familia in the other. The Pina Colada is to die for!",5,2013,07,29
11,Fab hotel,"This hotel is fab
We were upgraded to a room overlooking the main street which had a balcony and was totally soundproof.
The room was lovely  with amazing views, fridge, coffee machine etc etc
Breakfast was excellent with fresh pancakes , bacon , all sorts of breads , cakes, all sorts of Fresh fruit and juices, homemade jams and Cava, great start to the day!
The staff are very helpful and front desk  especially so , note david, thanks.
The rooftop bar and pool have views all over the city and is very hip at night.
I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2013,07,28
11,Great Location,The front desk and door staff are exceptional. Roof top terrace has a great view. Spa not so great and could use improvement. Rooms redone and lovely. Get one with a terrace. Breakfast buffet amazing.,5,2013,07,28
11,"Fabulous Location, Fabulous Service...a couple small things too","Just home from a 4 night stay at the Majestic and I would saw we were super pleased with everything. For me the location is perfect right on Passeig De Gracia and not stuck in the packed touristy La Rambla....not to mention one street from nearly every amazing food choice you would ever need. We had a basic room and upon arrival the bed was a bit off. We tried one night of sleep on it but it simply was not right. We mentioned it to the front desk and they moved, upgraded us instantly. The upgrade was overwhelmingly awesome. The overall service was top notch. The breakfast was over top great too. It was my partners BDay and the staff help arrange a cake and beverage treat in our room after we came home from the beach as a surprise. All in all everything was great. My 2 tips: Anything but the lowest end room and if some service personal gives you information get their name. We were told we could have a very late check but in the end that was not true...blame myself for not remembering who told me.",5,2013,07,24
11,Great location,"We had an amazing room with a private terrace overlooking the city, the sea, and the Sagrada Familia. The concierge staff was very friendly and made some ok suggestions for dinner. It's hard to get them to send you to a very local hangout, as they favour the more expensive and trendy spots. Aside from that, they were lovely. The location is perfect and I'd stay here again.",5,2013,07,24
11,"Rooftop pool and view, WOW!","Worth staying here just for the rooftop view with a view over Barcelona and to the sea in the distance. only 6 sun beds but we got one each time we went up. plenty of chairs and sofas as well, and a bar with lovely bar staff. we stayed in the cheapest room and it was fine, rubbish view, but we went to the roof for that. very poor amount of complimentary products for a 5 star, just shampoo and conditioner, although you could ask for others if you felt so inclined. brilliant location, only 5 minutes direct walk from the mainline railway station (direct from airport - half an hour -4 stops) we got a 3 day Barcelona travel card, which you could use for this train to and from the airport and the metro and buses - all for the same price as a one way taxi from the airport. from the hotel we walked to the gothic quarter and las Ramblas (although it took a while). very close to a metro station with trains going in all different directions, so you could get anywhere fast. don't use the bus tour company recommended by the hotel though, it was the slowest, worst bus tour i have ever been on. there is a different company and 5 of their busses passed us we were so slow! Best shopping on Barcelona right on the doorstep. defiantly would recommend the hotel if the above points are important to you.",4,2013,07,22
11,Room for improvement for a 5 star hotel,"We stayed in the Majestic for 4 nights after travelling around Spain staying in 3 and 4 star hotels. We wanted to splash out a little by staying somewhere fancy wi a roof top pool in Barcelona, however we were overall very disappointed with the Majestic Hotel given its ""5 star"" status. The rooms were a decent size and the amenities are comfortable. The housekeeping was fantastic. But that that was about all. The room service menu was heavily overpriced (approx 20 euro for a club sandwich). We tout the prices were inflated in Madrid but this was worse. The location is good and easily accessible to metro and shopping but we found the concierge/s unhelpful and gave us wrong information. Knowing that we had to ate the airport train from Passeig de Gracia, the concierge directed us to Catalunya. We also asked for assistance posting items back to Australia to which we got no answer/feedback to. And when we asked about seeing Salvador Dali in Barcelona, we were told that the museum was 1.5 hr away and never mentioned that there is. Salvador Dali art museum in the heart of Barcelona (which we found on our own accord). There was no free wifi, the supplied PC's were clunky and froze all the time and no free water supplied in the rooms (something that we would get in every other room in Spain which was not 5 star). We expect more given the price of this hotel. Very disappointed.",3,2013,07,20
11,Exceptional,"The service here was one of the best I have experienced. Stayed at the Majestic's Residence. It was possibly the best residence accommodation I have stayed at. 2 very spacious bedrooms, with very spacious lounge/dining and eat-in kitchen. Siemans appliances and a wonderful Nespresso coffee machine. And set on the main fashion street in Barcelona, the Passeig de Gracia. Doesn't get much better.",5,2013,07,19
11,"Excellent location, beautiful hotel, friendly staff",We stayed at the Hotel Majestic for four nights in a junior suite. Two adults and two children (ages 13 & 7).  It was very good value for money. One child was on a sofa bed and they gave us an extra bed for our second child free of charge. We shared a bathroom between the four of us but it was not a problem as it was large with two hand basins and the toilet had a door.  The rooms are beautifully decorated and we were given a welcome bottle of wine and some biscuits. The buffet breakfast was also included in the price.  The food was delicious and there was an excellent variety.  The concierge and public relations staff were very helpful in booking sightseeing tickets and giving directions.  Overall the location and value for money was surprisingly good and we would definitely go back there.,5,2013,07,18
11,Perfect stay,"Just returned from a 5 night stay at The Majestic.  Had booked a Junior Suite but on arrival were informed we were being upgraded to a full suite. 

Beautiful room - seventh floor, totally soundproofed.  Large entrance hallway, guest loo, separate walk in dressing room, large lounge with 40 inch flat screen (all English channels available) French doors to balcony, all marble bathroom with huge jacuzzi bath & separate shower, separate loo/bidet, separate bedroom with French doors and second balcony with great views over the city and another 40"" flat screen TV.  Room service very good with turn down service in the evening and towels, bathrobes, sheets changed daily. Internet access not an issue as is included in room rate for junior suites & above although you would think these days would be for all.  Wonderful welcoming and cool space to return to after long days pounding the streets in the heat. 

 Only used roof bar once, quite small but hip - prices high though at 6.50 euros for a beer & 14 for cocktails.  Main entrance currently under renovation so temporary side entrance being used as main foyer which does get congested.

Location is perfect for accessing all areas and so glad we chose the classier Exeimple area to stay - it felt safe at night to walk around with plenty of decent places to eat within easy walking distance.  

Would recommend for those seeking classic 5 star luxury in central, safe location. 
",5,2013,07,18
11,Nice location,"There is nothing much wrong with this hotel but I wouldnt rush back either. It is undergoing lobby construction at the moment and very crowded as a consequence in the breakfast room...but the rooms are very tasteful and the location is quite central if you are coming to Barcelona for shopping. The pool/roof deck is also nice for an afternoon. Perhaps it just doesnt capture the Barcelona spirit enough for me. I would definitely stay in the El Born area next time at Hotel Ohla, which is much more boutique in size and feels a lot less touristic than Majestic.",3,2013,07,17
11,Wow Everything and then Some More...Amazing!!!,"Well this hotel is beyond Class from the moment you enter it and until the very moment one leaves.....from the food to the panoramic view from the lounge/restaurant/bar on the 10th floor and the rooms are perfect...very serene!!
When you go to your room the hallways are this just beautiful color and one already gets a great feeling of what is to come...it lives up to everything that they say and well and just so much more!!
The location is fantastic and I walked everywhere from the hotel and I did not want to leave because one gets the feeling of ultimate luxury and total comfort there...",5,2013,07,17
11,Fine hotel in middle of the city- but a little blah?,"The Majestic is a large, seemingly run-of-the-mill hotel in Barcelona. Granted we had just arrived from a stunning hotel in Marrakech, this was a bit of a let down. The price was pretty cheap (under 300$) but there wasn't all that much unique about it?  The main entrance was under construction but the lobby is still very lackluster. The rooms were fine- not bad not good- just blah? The service was also just so-so- nothing all that unique and when we lost a cell phone there was zero attempt to help us. The main redeeming quality of this hotel is the rooftop bar. Great views of the city with a cool vibe and a mix of people- but we should have stayed somewhere with a little more soul or identity?! We thought of hotel Neri and walked by it- sooo different, sexy and romantic. Next trip to Barcelona we will be there!!",3,2013,07,15
11,Fabulous,"This hotel delivers, it's centrally located and has terrific services. The cocierge was always helpful w/great retaurant choices and arranged anything we wanted. The rooms are spectacular and breakfast was amazing. The best buffet and quality. The common spaces in lobby and bar are beautiful and had music at night. The rooftop bar is really spectacular and has great food if you want to stay in for a night(we did after our flight). Really special and has great views of the city. This was our 1st trip to Barcelona and so glad that we didn't stay at the beach side. It would have been very difficult to get back and forth for sightseeing. Hotel is close to everything and also has a great spa.",5,2013,07,14
11,fantastic stay,"The hotel is located in an excellent location at the centre of city. The room is spacious with good facilities. The buffet breakfast has a good variety of fine food that should not be missed. European style gives me a very comfortable and relax stay. It is good for business stay, too. The service is of high quality. Highly recommended!",5,2013,07,12
11,"Majestic it is, but needs to move with the times","Just reading previous reviews and this hotel has the ability to be outstanding except for a few minor and irritating faults which are easy to fix. 

Firstly, older staff should have some training in how to be friendly.  Younger staff were excellent, but older staff have that old world arrogant approach to service that lacks warmth and seems designed to make you feel they are doing you a favour by assisting you. 

Secondly, penny pinching. Internet at EUR15 per day! Tried to charge EUR4 for two nespresso capsules on check out. Over charging for every little thing went out of style with five star hotels about 10 years ago ... move with the times!

Aside from the above, everything else was outstanding; sleep quality, softness of the beds, shower was a treat, rooftop bar has fantastic views and good pool (but don't go up in swimsuit after 5, you will be seriously underdressed!, younger staff very helpful, breakfast varied and excellently presented, location fantastic.",4,2013,07,12
11,Brilliant Stay,"I just returned from a 3 day stay in a Junior Suite on the 4th floor of this lovely hotel. The hotel is a traditional European style hotel with old world service and it is GRAND! The staff, food, beverage, and amenities are TOP DRAWER! I recommend this hotel to any guest wanting the BEST location, excellent value, and superb overall experience. The rooftop pool and bar are a fun and happening scene and add a contemporary flair tot his GEM in the heart of Barcelona... I will be back and highly recommend Hotel Majestic for a VIP experience...",5,2013,07,09
11,Luxury in the perfect location,"My husband and I spent several nights at the Majestic Hotel in Barcelona.  The hotel is in the perfect location... easy walk over to Las Ramblas, sites, shopping and able to hop on and off buses one block away. The hotel is a beautiful, older hotel that has been updated. You can feel the history as you walk through the halls. It has a great roof top bar... we were able to have cocktails while enjoying all the sites Barcelona has to offer. We loved everything about this hotel.  One small complaint ... they did not offer free wifi in their lobby. This seemed pretty silly considering there were SO many professionals staying there.",5,2013,07,09
11,Fantastic hotel,"One fabulous hotel , so well placed in the city centre, this hotel is one of my favourite hotels in Europe, from arriving at the front door the doorman , receptionist to the porter , they are all so efficient  at looking after you, the hotel is spotlessly clean and finished in a very high standard , restaurant food is excellent, as for the breakfast it was fantastic with a formidable choice looking for an excuse to go back to Barcelona just to stay in the hotel again",5,2013,07,08
11,Great location ...that's it,"The hotel location is great no doubt .

But this was the only hotel on a 5 country Europe trip that made us pay for Wifi and we had to wait on our room. 

If you're paying for a room upgrade above the standard room , your room should be ready by 1pm latest . Not 4.

Hotel checkin was a cluster . Was not offered map of city . Very smug attitude hotel staff . I paid more money in Paris and Munich for better hotels than this . 

Roof bar is nice but drink prices are insane .

Overall , good location , but this hotel is behind the times ",3,2013,07,06
11,Great location!,We stayed here after a cruise and upgraded to a suite after our first room only had a view of a rooftop and we wanted to overlook the street. The suite we had had was very spacious and had a separate living room area and large windows that overlooked the street. The shower had great water pressure and there was a separatr tub as well. Best of all it was centrally located to great high-end shopping and a close walk to Las Ramblas. We will definitely stay here again! ,5,2013,07,06
11,The best!,I had an excellent experience at this hotel. The rooms are very nice with comfortable beds. The bathroom was not only gorgeous but super clean. The customer service was the best! I highly recommend this hotel.,5,2013,07,04
11,“Fantastique”,"Barcelona is a wonderful city and there are many fine hotels.  You need to choose whether you want to be near or on the coast and stay at a W or the Arts, or be a little more inland, but close to the Diagonal with better access to more sites.  For me, this was a business trip and chose to be more centrally located, which helps a lot with travel times.  The hotel is rated five stars and I agree.

The building itself is classic, but with modern amenities not such as a fitness area, spa, lovely rooftop bar with stunning views, a terrific breakfast buffet with made to order omelets, and a lot of rooms with balconies.  Now to the nitty gritty:

Reception Area: The area is very large and a nice place to meet with friends, but it could use a bar.  I think they prefer you go the rooftop, which is a great recommendation.  My party had little wait to check-in from the very English fluent staff. 

Room: I was in an upgraded room (103).  The room was very large, was clean and comfortable.  There is a couch, a large bathroom, rain shower and spa style tub.  The lighting was quite good in all rooms with a usable work area, but if you need more than one outlet at the desk, bring an extension cord and don’t forget an adapter if you are coming from the U.S.  For some reason in Europe, even the nicest hotels put two double beds together to form a king size bed, but there is still a crack, no matter how much padding they put underneath.  The bed itself was a 4 post style with curtains that provided a sense of opulence.  Pillows were large and comfortable.  A coffee machine and safe is provided.  Some rooms, though not all, have a balcony.  Mine looked over the Passage de Gracia.  I was concerned about noise, but the room was very quiet.

Location: The location is right in the heart of one of the more expensive areas of Barcelona.  You will find high end shops, plenty of restaurants and bars as well as easy walking distance to the subway.  We never really traveled more than 15 minutes to anywhere other than the beach area, which took nearly 30 minutes due to bad traffic, though we were going during rush hour.

My overall experience here was great, and I would recommend this hotel to my friends.  I am trying to add additional checklist information for those that are interested:

Check in
My reservation record was accurate.
The check-in process was timely and efficient.
The check-in staff was courteous.

Check out
The check-out process was timely and efficient.
I received a complete and accurate bill.",5,2013,07,04
11,"Beautiful hotel with a great location, but lots of street noise","My first impression of the Majestic was that it is stunning - a truly beautiful hotel.  Our room was a decent size by European standards.  The bathroom was gorgeous with a wonderful (high pressure) shower.  However, I would have traded the historic details and the marble bath for a good night's sleep.  The bed was comfortable, but the noise from the street made it nearly impossible for me to sleep.   My husband and I kept checking the windows to make sure that they were all the way shut.   Also,  while there was a/c, it was not particularly strong (even when we moved the thermostat to its lowest setting).  So the room was a bit warm at night.   

The roof terrace is fantastic.  It has a small pool and a bar area.  The views of the city are tremendous.  However, both times we were on the terrace, we had to beg for bar service.  We found service elsewhere in the hotel to be better (courteous and helpful - although not overly friendly).  

The location is great - in the midst of wonderful sites, dining, and shopping.  Also, very close to the metro and walkable to most sites.",4,2013,07,01
11,No free wifi!! A five star in 2013!!,"It doesn't matter how lovely your hotel is-there is no excuse for not having wifi free and easily available for your guests. I was here on business recently and was due to bring a group back here in October-now that I see how un-modern this hotel is I shall be cancelling this reservation. 

No excuse!-get up to date general manager. Everything is done via wifi Internet nowadays and a charge is going to seriously reduce your attracting guests",3,2013,07,01
11,Fantastic hotel-stunning views,"We have just returned from a 5day break in Barcelona. The Majestic was fantastic, the rooms very comfortable and the roof top bar offers relaxation, and wonderful views of the city. .The only down side is the price of the breakfast-29 euros each for a continental breakfast-outside 
The hotel you can get cheaper cooked breakfast for around 8 euros. Watch out for taxes and prices of drinks. I would advise the open top bus to sight see the city, and a BIG must is the Magic Fountain at night. Staff at the Majestic are friendly and very obliging. We had a lovely stay",4,2013,06,27
11,Excellent hotel and service,"This hotel was exactly as described. Excellent service from the moment we walked in. Perfect pool area for relaxing in the sun whilst still enjoying some sights with the view. Amazing cocktails too! 

The location was right in the heart of the city with easy access to all the main sights and tube stops.

Coming away for our 30th it was the ideal place.

I'd highly recommend staying here and enjoying fist class service.",5,2013,06,24
11,Very busy hotel well located,"its hard to beat the service breakfast, rooftop terrace etc

This hotel has been packed every day which has a lot to say about it as it is a historical gem like many hotels in Barcelona and that always costs more money  to maintain 

A couple of sore points that should really be addressed. International communication at a five star 
Hotel  in 2013 should really be readily available. Even though I have had to pay 15 or so Euros a day this really should apply to all devices in the room such as I phone, I Pad I Phone PC Tablets etc as you seem to be stuck with one and may have to disconnect and restart another device if possible.

this means that  you will receive excellent data for Find It technology but the other devices will be on 3 G or otherwise and show your devices up to two blocks away

Elevators seem to be full most of the times and they could really use a third

Other than those comments, this Hotel is first rate for location service and quality",5,2013,06,23
11,Four majestic nights in Barcelona,"I reserved a deluxe room and junior suite for my wife and daughter in Spain's leading city and enjoyed a fabulous time at its finest hotel.  Our rooms overlooked the Paseo and had balcony views of the beautful modernista streetscape.  Room decor and appointments were excellent.  Service, especially, room make-up and evening turn-down were truly exceptional.  All other staff and concierge services were also excellent -  knowledgable, energetic, and friendly.  I recommend this hotel most highly!",5,2013,06,23
11,Amazingly awesome,"We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights, and must say the location, and the hotel and its staff are excellent. U simply can't miss the terrace bar they have, a splendid view. The rooms are pretty decently sized, and clean. The location of this hotel ensured that we need not take any cab or bus to go to catalunya, la rambla, as they were hardly a 5 mins walk. I had placed a request for a free upgrade of room but as that was not available with them, they did give us a nice present in place for it which was a nice gesture from their end. All the shopping places,are around it, and the casa Battlo is just one block away from the hotel. I really loved the stay at Majestic, and must say this city is a place to fall in love with !!",5,2013,06,21
11,Outstanding Breakfast,"We stayed one night before taking cruise. The location is great and the most landmark buildings are within walking distance. We checked in after noon time and took the nap right away because our flight was cross Atlantic but I constantly heard the noises, slamming doors; night time was quiet. The rooftop is very beautiful. The breakfast is superb; waffle and omelette are the best I ever had have; and the service is excellent; sometime I just want to take a trip to Barcelona in order to have breakfast in this hotel. Hopefully I will be back soon.",4,2013,06,20
11,If you want luxury and people who care stay here,"Last Sunday, after getting off the Oceania cruise ship, my husband and I went to the Hotel Majestic for our one night stay in Barcelona. My husband wasn't feeling well, however, when we arrived at the hotel quite early before most guests had checked out. When the reception desk found out my husband was ill, they managed to check us into a room very quickly. The room was beautiful and included a large terrace. We were brought up to the room by the manager on duty who had such a lovely smile and caring way about him. He informed us that the hotel is one of the oldest (if not the oldest in the city), but recently underwent a total renovation which modernized the facilties, but kept the charm of the original building. In addition to very comfortable bedding and seating in the room, the bathroom is quite large and luxurious. Another friend had a much smaller room, but she said it was very cozy and well appointed. She also mentioned that her bathroom was as large and lovely as ours was. We all felt very well taken care of at this great hotel.  Although my husband couldn't enjoy this beautiful city, he was able to rest comfortably in our accomodations. I found the location of the hotel to be perfect, a very safe and upscale neighborhood, also close to the La Rambla..this city is made for walking and the Hotel Majestic is centrally located to walk to all major sights. While my husband was resting and I was out exploring the city, the hotel left us a complimentary gift of a large bottle of water and some delicious candy. All of the staff was concerned about our welfare and we can't wait to return to Barcelona and this magnificent hotel.",5,2013,06,20
11,Great weekend stay,"Stayed at the Majestic two weeks ago for four nights.  The hotel is in a good central location about a ten minute walk from La Rambla
Booked with Easyjet the flight and hotel.  Do not use the shuttle service they offer though we were kept waiting for nearly an hour and finished up taking the taxi into Barcelona which for four of us turned out to be cheaper.
Had a 'deluxe city view room' which in fact looked across to another building along the side street, but it was a good size and kept very clean every day. Staff could not be more helpful. Breakfast were fantastic, with lots of fresh fruit, wonderful cakes and the traditional eggs and bacon.  
We had several rounds of drinks on the roof garden, which gives a super 360 view of the city.
It was a great stay and managed to do lots of things.  Would definitely come back to this hotel, and the couple we went with this is their second time here.",5,2013,06,12
11,Majestic Apartments Barcelona,"HI, we stayed in December 2012 in the Apartments of the Majestic Hotel in Barcelona - in just one word - A M A Z I N G!
We received a two bedroom apartment with huge living room and fully equipped kitchen with everything you need for a longer stay in the city (including washing machine and dryer, nespresso machine, microwave etc.). 
The location is simply the best in the city, a 10-minutes walk from the old city but with everything you need just around the corner. 
I will most definitely stay in this hotel / in the apartments in my next stay in Barcelona.",5,2013,06,12
11,Great Location fabulous Hotel,"You could not ask for a nicer non flag hotel in the heart of the shopping district of Barcelona. The staff was great and they were able to get us early check in which was very helpful given the long flight from the United States. This hotel reminded our family a lot of the NY Palace in NYC which is also a five star non flagged hotel.

I would highly recommend this hotel to couples and families of four. Get the junior suite it was a perfect size hotel room that comfortably handled our family of four.",5,2013,06,11
11,"Lovely hotel, great location","We loved this hotel--which is in a high-end shopping area. The rooms are well appointed and the staff is very helpful and accommodating. They have a small but very nice roof top bar / pool area that is a great stop for a drink --with a beautiful view of the city and out to the sea.  Also, the breakfast is wonderful, don't miss that part.",5,2013,06,10
11,"Location, location, location....","The hotel is excellently located in the middle of Passeig de Gracia, which is lined with all the high end boutiques. It is also 2 blocks away from 2 of the Gaudi attractions, La Pedrera and another one, as well as the bus-stop for the Barcelona open top bus tours.The hotel interior is fairly chic, modern and clean. We had a deluxe room which was pathetically TINY given the rate we paid. They gave us two single beds pushed together when we had booked a double. The bathroom was small but nice, modern and clean. Wasn't impressed by housekeeping as they took away the used bathrobe but did not replace it with a fresh one. Other problem with the room apart from the size was the pillows. All four pillows smelled really bad.. the smell got into my hair! .I told housekeeping to change the pillows which they did and the second batch was a bit better. Simply inexcusable ! Also when we exited the elevator to our floor, there was a stale/unfresh smell. There is a Nespresso machine in the room but they charge one euro per capsule. One of the days we couldn't gain access to our room because of some battery issue with the scanner on the door. They took about 2 hours to resolve the problem.  I went shopping but my husband was peeved so they did offer an upgrade to a suite but as we were leaving the next morning, we took free wifi for the day instead. There was no free wifi, not even in the lobby. It was charged at 15 euros per day. There is free internet access at the business centre only, using the hotel's computer. Can't comment on the food as we didn't eat in the hotel. Can't comment on spa either. For breakfast, there are nice cafes very close to the hotel where u can get breakfast for a fraction of the price. Overall, I would say the hotel needs improvement.",3,2013,06,07
11,First Class Experience,"The Majestic was our last hotel after spending 11 days in Spain in mid-May, 2013 and it was the best of the lot.  We were two couples and a single in our 70's but still agile and eager to explore.  The hotel is located in an upscale area with fine shops and restaurants but also near enough to walk to outdoor cafes and tapas bars.  While our wandering on foot did take us to the old city which should not be missed, a cab ride back to the Majestic was welcome.  
Our rooms on the 6th floor were large and luxurious with well-appointed, clean and functional bathrooms.  Two of the couples had adjoining rooms with a private locked hallway between, separate from the main hotel hall.  This kept any hall noise out, providing a quiet night's sleep........a nice touch.
We requested a queen or king sized bed. However, the room came with two singles pushed together and the beds were individually made up as two separate beds.  WiFi at some 15 Euros/day for access in your room is a bit unreasonable for a five star hotel where it should be part of the rate.  There is no wifi in the lobby either so you have to go to the lower level business office to wait til others are finished to use the hotel computers.
The hotel decor is first class all around including a top notch staff and you really feel like you are in a five star accommodation.
The breakfast room is quite large with an attentive staff.  The selection of food is very extensive with stations at each end of the room to prevent crowding.
We all had a first class experience during our three day stay at the Majestic",5,2013,06,05
11,Greta location and facility - but very poor customer service,"We came here for a long weekend 30th - 3rd June. The location of the hotel is amazing - right where the shops are. This can also be said for the junior suite we had - again, very nice. We used the Spa twice - fantastic reception and service. The problem (and where this no longer deserves any 5 starts rather 3 or 4) arises when you start talking about the customer service. Upon arrival the reservation had managed to forget to add the third person to the booking. Once we rectified this (to an additional cost) we went for dinner - only to discover when we came back that no third bed or amenities had been added to the room. Also we had asked for a bottle of Champagne to be waiting in our room when we arrived as we were celebrating a birthday (but received none). The reception responded to this by asking to see my original email ordering the champagne to prove that I had done it - rather than apologise, I felt that the 5 star rating was sinking. We then went on to ask the hotel to make a lunch booking in the morning before we left for some shopping. They advised us that it was too early to do so, but promised to try again. When we arrived at the lunch place we were told that no one had called from the hotel, but luckily they had a cancellation. As we were having lunch, (half an hr after the lunch was due to commence), the hotel called to make the booking! Breakfast is beautiful, but the staff managed to mix up our coffee order three times. Once replacing tea for coffee and espresso for a caffe latte! Lastly, yes, the terrace is good, but do not expect any service. Despite there being plenty of staff, they tend to walk around, ignoring your ' excuse me' pleas for some service and once you had their attention they would say that someone else would come and serve us (and after 20 minutes of waiting we left). Sadly, what has all the potential really falters at the lack of focus of customer care.",4,2013,06,03
11,Perfect,"This kind of hotel really doesn't need user reviews. It's 5 Star luxury. If you can afford it, do it. Beautiful hotel, great location, great rooftop lounge. If it's in your budget, you won't be disappointed.",5,2013,05,28
11,Majestic Hotel in Barcelona,This was our first trip to Barcelona and the Majestic was well worth the expense. It is convenient to shopping and within walking distance to the ancient city center.  The hotel is well cared for and the staff was pleasant and focused on our needs.  The view from the 10th floor is spectacular ! My only recommendation would be to include wi-fi in with the room price. It was truly a pain to have to pay for a new password to connect each day. The connection was only good for a single site so this took some getting used to. Other than the wifi- it was a perfect stay.,5,2013,05,28
11,on site,"This hotel has a really good location in Barcelona .It has a spectacular terrace on the top floor the care has been the best, thanks. I could not eat but breakfast looked right. Clean, helpfull staff and friendly. Nearby good ( too good) shopping . After Barcelona we went to Costa Brava , near Lloret de Mar a cosy luxury resort  hotel on the sea ,Rigat",5,2013,05,27
11,Best Hotel in Barcelona,"We stayed here at the end of April and loved every minute of our stay. The room was huge and we had a view to the street and a small balcony. 
The location is amazing, situated close to a subway station and between two of Gaudi's buildings Casa Balto & Casa Mila (100 meters away). This gives you the ability to get to them early and beat the crowds. 
The roof top terrace is great with a good view of Sagrada Familia, the drinks are on the expensive side but the view is worth it, there is a pool but we didn't use it.
The staff and the front counter were very helpful with bars and restaurant recommendations and were extremely nice.
The breakfast was amazing, if you like Iberian ham and other meats, sweets, pancakes and huge range of breads, include this in your room booking.
The only down side about this hotel is lack of free wifi, but the benefits clearly out way the only negative. Definately stay here!!!",5,2013,05,27
11,Beautiful,"This hotel deserves its 5 stars. Great location, helpful and friendly staff - great restaurant recommendations from the concierge. Roof terrace is great! 
The only negatives were that they charge 15euros per day for wifi, breakfast is expensive and my husband slipped in the shower which is over the bath.
Overall I would definitely stay there again! :). Highly recommend.",5,2013,05,26
11,Excellent Location,"Just returned from our second 5 day trip to one of our favourite city's, this time stayed at the Majestic in one of their suites, great choice. Hotel overall excellent, staff courteous and helpful, food exceptional.
 
Ideal location, Can't wait to return next year.",5,2013,05,24
11,Loved this hotel- beautifully presented & excellent location,This hotel is right on the best shopping street in Barcelona.  The bar on the top floor has excellent views over the city and does very nice cocktails.  I found the rooms to be very well designed.  It seems to be newly refurbished so there are some small niggles.  For example the bed is on casters which must make cleaning easy but it also makes for a strange bed time experience!  Otherwise I couldn't fault the service.  The room service was really great- especially the wine!  The roof top pool was a disappointment in that it was right in the middle of the bar area which meant it was only appropriate for exhibitionists.,5,2013,05,20
11,Majestic Jewel in Barcelons's Crown,"For our 40th wedding anniversary, my wife and I decided to celebrate with an extended Mediterranean cruise, from Barcelona, our port of embarkation, to Venice, the jewel of the Adriatic. To help put us into the spirit of the moment, I decied to book us into the Majestic Hotel in Barcelona for an additional three days before our ship departed, and that was one of the best decisions I have ever made!  The Majestic is one of Classic Vacations' Five Star properties in Europe, and based on our estay there, they have earned every star! Situated on Barcelona's magnificent boulevard, right in the middle of fine restaurants, exclusive shops, and tree-lined splendor, the Majestic rolled out the red carpet for us from the very beginning of our stay. From the warm curbside welcome, through the thoroughly professional process of checking in--the staff dressed ""to the nines""--every part of our three-daystay there was in perfect order. Our room was beautiful and spacious, the bathroom immaculate, the furnishings in very good taste. We did not take advantage of the spa, but a quick survey of the menu of services led me to believe it to be at least the equal of others we had used, in Las Vegas and on fine cruise ships. The hotel desk staff were able to answer our every question concerning our stay in Barcelona, and we followed their recommendations! Through them, we were able to secure tickets for the Red and Blue Line open-top sightseeing bus tours, which we throughly enjoyed. We recommend taking advantage ofthese tours, which, between the two lines, provide a complete survey of the city. Don't miss La Sagrada Familia, Gaudi's fanciful basilca--it exceeded our every expectation, the Picasso Museum, and the Provincial Art Museum of Catalunya on the summit overlooking the city. When you get hungry, there are several good restaurants near the hotel, and we enjoyed the tapas bars immensely.  There is also a McDonald's restaurant just a block away, and the coffee is quite good.  The Majestic is a fine hotel, the equal of some Four Seasons properties we have stayed at, and we recommend it highly.  Based on our experience there, we would not hesitate  to stay at other Classic Vacations locations.  Incidentally, we booked our airfare through Classic as well, and that proved to be a good decision, one we would do it again.",5,2013,05,18
11,"Good, but no SPA","Great location, good breakfasts, helpful staff.
A big bath in the bathroom, Bvlgari amentities.
There is no SPA unfortunately, only a gym. 
The swimming pool on the roof is not heated, the water was cold in the beginning of May.",4,2013,05,18
11,Great hotel in an amazing location,"Stayed overnight before boarding a cruise. Great location next to expensive stores and a pharmacy a few blocks down. Very clean, big room with a couch and receiving area. It had a  spacious closet and a large bathroom. Very comfortable. I noticed the room smelled really good, they must have sprayed something special. There were Bvlgari White toiletries provided and despite us being a very big group, the room service was prompt. The only issue we had were the small elevators. When the hotel is full, you might have to wait a while to get on one. Front desk provides universal adaptor upon request and internet was fast. The breakfast buffet was good, too!",4,2013,05,17
11,Terrific hotel,"Stayed here 3 nights after a business trip with my wife and another couple and booked via chase card.  I thought it was a terrific value as we were upgraded to a suite, received the delicious buffet for two each morning and had wine and treats in the room.  Rooftop was a great way to end the day and found hotel very clean.  Solid location and helpful staff.  Would suggest this hotel highly.  ",5,2013,05,16
11,Great Hotel for Business Travellers and Serious Shoppers.,"Having stayed off The Rambla before we thought we would try something more stylish this time.

You do get a lot of space much more than most city hotels.

The bedroom was large.  The bath was large.  The flat screen TV on the wall was large and it had English channels.

The turndown service was a lovely touch.

We had a terrible view from our window of a building next door under construction - but as we were out all day this didn’t matter.

We had an expensive drink at the roof top bar.  Very nice area with a small pool.  

If money is not a problem this hotel will suit you very well.

The staff are very attentive.

Others have commented on this site about the price of internet access here, but please note it is free in the business centre for an hour.

The hotel is on a beautiful street close to lots of beautiful shops.

There is a metro close by and Gaudi’s Casa Battlo is only 100m away on the opposite side of the road.

I was disappointed that I never heard a pianist in the bar during our stay.

I would recommend this hotel but I will not return as I prefer something not as grand with more atmosphere.",4,2013,05,15
11,Superb in Every Way,A truly elegant hotel in the best location. They combine old world charm with a fresh updated decor. The service is top notch professional. I got a great rate via the Internet so it can be a real value compared to other hotels. The restaurant is excellent with an unbeatable price fixe lunch. The hotel is convenient to the major historical sites and you can walk everywhere.,5,2013,05,14
11,Classical Gem,"It truly old world charm very modern contemporary everything white and bright as you walk in the morning and wonderfully seduced glow in the evenings. Rooms are well fitted very comfortable.
Great location from every point dinning, shopping and sightseeing. the good thing you do have lift a finger to find anything the concierge Angel must mention him does it without a blink and get you on your way.
One point though for 5star property they do not provide drinking bottled water it's charged.
Otherwise highly recommended even at its going rate.",5,2013,05,09
11,Out of two stays one was great,"I booked rooms for this property pre and post cruise.
The room we got initially was very nice- not large and not small but nice.
It was great to have a Nespresso machine in the room but it took us a while to figure out how to fill the water tank and use the machine.
The breakfast buffet was huge but the waiters have to figure out Americans like their coffee and to serve it frequently and HOT.

The location was very good and a brisk walk would take us to the Rambla.
Pool was small as well as the outside patio.

When we came back from our cruise at 3pm our room was still not ready. We sat in the lobby chairs waiting for the desk clerk to tell us when the room would be ready. Since I was so exhausted I fell asleep and after an hour my wife went to the desk to check on our room only to be told it was ready a half hour ago. Needless to say we were not happy about  this.

we were then shown   a very small room compared to the first room we had. If we did not have the first room we would have thought this second room was the standard size room. 

We went to the front desk and found a manager and told him that our room was very small; that we had to wait a long time to get our room and that the desk clerk was rude when we told him about not being informed our room was ready.
The asst. mgr. apologized and then took us up to a long vacant suite (the front of the building was being remodeled so maybe that was why the suite was closed up) for us to use.
The suite was very nice but being closed up for a while needed some housekeeping and repairs.

Overall I would recommend this hotel for its location and the breakfast buffet. 
I would recommend looking at the room and if it is not suitable see a  manager to get a suitable room. Do not settle for a room if you are not happy. Reading other reviews of other hotels on Trip Advisor when people complain the hotel management writes a rebuttal stating you should have brought it to our attention (four star rating hotels).",4,2013,05,07
11,All that rain in a beautiful city rubbish,Hotel very nice and well located. Staff very nice and friendly. Pool very small. Would stop again. Hotel a bit like a maze had trouble finding my way a couple of times. Did not use Spa because they were fully booked but would have cause prices were reasonable.,4,2013,05,07
11,Very good location but very expensive and Spa very small,"Have been there many times for a MWC fair (Mobile World Congress) in February (last visit this year 2013). This hotel is superbly located and offer spacious room with all facilities. Breakfast is great but the room on the underground was very cold. I never tried this hotel in the summer so I cannot comment on the spa (they have an small outdoor pool on the last floor of the hotel and a spa place that must be booked in advanced).

They also have a Michelin rated restaurant providing a very good way to enjoy Barcelona.",4,2013,05,07
11,Small but well functioned room,"Despite its size, its well-functioned design has shifted my attention to appreciate my stay here.  Although small, I can well managed my two luggages on the floor for packing.  The hotel is well located on the central of all retail brands.  Excellent bed linens.",4,2013,05,06
11,Excellent location and and overall quality,"I stayed at Majestic for 7 days at end of April 2013. The location is excellent, the quality of the facilities also very good (small minus on the SPA facilities). Part of the staff is unfriendly, my experience was 60 % friendly interactions and 40% unfriendly.",4,2013,05,03
11,One night in a beautiful suite,"Very friendly staff. We had the pleasant surprise of receiving an upgrade and it was beautiful! The rooftop bar offers an amazing view of Barcelona. Excellent stay, would also recommend for company conferences, nice conference rooms, breaks are well organized.",4,2013,05,03
11,Fantastic,"The very best with the best location.  We had an executive room with a walk in closet and sitting area.  The linens were top quality.  The staff was attentive, well spoken and helpful.  The restaurant was top also.  I travel a lot and am very picky.  This was the best experience.",5,2013,05,01
11,Beaitful hotel.,"Stayed 5 nights at this beautiful property with my family.
The location of the hotel is perfect. You are in the middle of the Paseo de Gracia which is the elegant avenue where all the shops and restaurants are. You are a few blocks north of Las Ramblas.
The rooms were spacious and very comfortable. Have to mention the water pressure in the bathroom. Amazing. 
The service can be a little hectic at times, especially at check in. A lot of people who are taking cruises from Barcelona stay here and they can overwhelm the place.
The 2 negatives of this hotel is that they charge 15 euros per night for internet service. This is uncalled for.  I have stayed in higher end properties that give you ""free"" internet.
The other is that breakfast is extremely expensive. 30 Euros per person.
I would recommend heading outside of the hotel for breakfast.",5,2013,05,01
11,"An A+ 6 night stay last week - 4/13-4/20, 2013","I brought my son to Barcelona as his graduation gift from high school and we were so happy with our hotel choice- it made our entire trip wonderful!  The four highlights were the rooftop pool and bar, the water pressure and the comfort of the beds and the location! We were in room 731 and it had a small balcony overlooking a side street which made it fun and exciting to be part of the bustling city. When we closed the door it was 100% quiet.  We always came back to the room being super clean and well restocked with fresh towels and glasses.  My son loved his Majestic slippers and the turn down service every night.  The front desk could not have been nicer and more helpful - they got us tickets to everything we wanted to see and we never had to stand in any lines. Great restaurant recommendations.  My only negative was that I felt WiFi should be included especially if you stay over three nights.",5,2013,04,22
11,"Pristine, and heavenly but polish your shoes and wear your labels on the outside...","The Majestic is pristine. It is clean and beautiful and cleverly appointed. The bathroom in our Jr. Suite was spectacular with a spacious tub (with jets for weary travelers) with a shower stall next to it...white marble everything...scrumptious amenities by Bulgari...the fluffiest of terrycloth robes. Floppy, cushy slippers. The room's upholstery was in crisp, chic earth tones and the linens divine. The view on The Passeig de Gracia gave a nice sense of place looking out on typically beautiful Catalonian belle epoque architecture. We even had the ubiquitous fresh potted white orchid--the darling of pretty rooms everywhere. I might go as far as saying that if heaven had a ""green room"" I would be satisfied if it was this Jr. Suite at The Majestic. All this said: It is also the kind of hotel where you will want to be excessively well-dressed and immaculately groomed when walking through the lobby or you will feel it. Really. Choose a LVMH designer and just wear that. It is a bit more pretentious in this way than other hotels in its class and this to me is not a point in its favor. The location is very good and the neighborhood is very safe. This was my second stay at The Majestic and it is consistently outstandingly appointed. One strong warning: The concierge staff is very uneven. Two of them were just fantastic and one was just totally obnoxious (he probably can't help it, but...maybe the other concierges could coach him?). If you are a foodie, avoid the room service and I would recommend doing your home-work on where to dine before the trip and avoiding the concierge's recommendations (you will probably be very disappointed by their suggestions--Barcelona has some of the best food in the world and our experience is that you will not find it through The Majestic's concierge). That said the concierge staff was very helpful in other ways, for instance confirming our reservation for a balloon ride in the Catalonian Countryside. All in all, stay for the perfectly lovely room and wonderful location.",4,2013,04,22
11,Very nice hotel with excellent service,"A very good hotel with nice rooms and excellent service, location is perfect and I will stay here next time in Barcelona!

I recommend NOT to ask for a city view room since they are rather small, ask for bathtub and state that you need space and you will get a much bigger room. The staff is super service minded and walked me to several rooms so I could choose : )",5,2013,04,22
11,Perfect!,"We were booked by our company in this hotel for our incentive drive. The hotel is located in a big avenue where you can locate some of the buildings designed by Gaudi. On the streets, you can see shops like Mango, Chanel, etc.

The hotel has huge rooms unlike other hotels in Barcelona. It is equipped with a vault, expensive coffee machine, comfortable beds. The comfort rooms has a bathtub one side, and a shower room on the other side. The toiletries given are made by BVLGARI.

The staff are courteous and helpful. The continental buffet breakfast is superb as they offer the finest food. Computer with internet is available for use in their business center.

Unfortunately, we were not able to use the hotel amenities as we have very limited time.",5,2013,04,22
11,Ryan Air of hotels?,"First the good...the Majestic is beautiful, and has a wonderful and helpful staff.  My room was spacious, modern and the bed very comfortable.  I asked to be moved to a higher floor because construction scaffolding blocked my 1st floor window and was moved to the 7th floor with no problem.  (smaller room, but had a balcony) Conveniently located a block from Casa Batilla on Passage de Gracia, one of the main shopping streets and only a few blocks from Plaza de Catalunya.  I walked everywhere from the hotel, including to La Sagrada Familia Cathedral, Las Ramblas, the Gothic Quarter, etc.  
Now for the less good--The reviewers below got a complimentary bottle of wine.  Not only did I *not* get complimentary anything, I felt like I was being gouged for more money every time I turned around.  You ate breakfast?  That will be 29 Euros please.  (I thought it was included) Oh, you made a cup of Nesspresso in your room?  1 Euro please.  Oh, you want to use the internet?  That will be 19 cents a minute and you have to have your own provider.    Also it dropped every minute or two so badly that I finally gave up using it.  I thought I got a good rate, but after six days of being gouged at every turn I wound up having to cough up an extra 250 Euros upon checkout.  It is a lovely hotel...for a sheik.  Beware of all the hidden costs if you stay here.",3,2013,04,21
11,Great Hotel in a Great Location,"Location of the hotel is right in the middle of the high end shopping strip, with Chanel and Gucci boutique in the hotel building. Opposite to the Loewe Gallery and Casa Batllo. 2 min walk from the metro. Extremely good location.

Facilities within the hotel is good, with a well equipped gym (although opening hour is from 7 to 10) and a good roof top bar. Hotel room is spacious and well equipped with BVLGARI toiletries and very comfy slippers and bathrobe. Toilet mirror is heated, and thus will not mist up. (heated mirror is always a sign of a good hotel as usually this will missed) Strong water pressure. 

Just some small irks with the hotel. Hotel is not exactly cheap, and when they want to charge clients for WIFI for 15 euro a day, it just doesn't make sense, when WIFI is almost free everywhere. Met some other visitors at the business center, was told that the front desk staff was not very helpful, which I told them to go back to the front desk and demand for better service as we are paying decent money for the rooms.",4,2013,04,21
11,Great Hotel in fantastic location,"We had booked a junior suite and were upgraded to a suite on arrival.  The suite was huge, spotlessly clean and had everything you could want.  There were nice small touches - a free chilled bottle of white wine on arrival, nibbles and dips.  The staff were very helpful and the location perfect.  Only niggle was the wifi which was unavailable for a day and a half.",4,2013,04,19
11,Perfect location in a 5-star hotel - if perfect is away from the main tourist spots!,"My husband & I spent three nights here in April and loved everything about it - easy to get too from the airport, via the airport train, great location in a beautiful up-market part of Barcelona, surrounded by lovely bars, restaurants & designer shops, and a great hotel with big rooms and huge comfy beds. We couldn't fault it. We even received a bottle of champagne in the room courtesy of the hotel as it was my husbands birthday. I would highly recommend if you are looking for somewhere away from all the tourist traps, near to nice places to eat & drink, but still within walking distance of all the main attractions. ",5,2013,04,15
11,Don't stay here!,"There have to be better hotels in Barcelona than this!  We lost the power in our room 3 times (and we weren't in our room very much to begin with), it took them awhile to come fix it, they never compensated us or offered to switch rooms, dirty glasses were not taken out of our room, they do not respond to emails, towels are thin and scratchy, you pay for everything - even the little cups of coffee you make in the rooms, water pressure and temperature vary a lot - making it miserable to take a shower there, beds are small and not very comfy.
HUGE rip off and I have no idea why it is rated so highly.",1,2013,04,13
11,City Break with Family,"Wonderfully located the Hotel Majestic is a stylish and convenient place to stay in Barcelona. Far enough away from the noisy tourist street of La Rambla to avoid the all night noise but close enough to be convenient should you wish to venture there. The hotel is surrounded by high-end shops and lovely restaurants and outdoor cafes.

The rooms are spacious and well appointed. We booked two - one for us and one for our teenage children. The children's room was in the older part of the hotel and whilst we paid exactly the same rate for the same type of rooms, ours, in the newer part of the hotel, was about two thirds of the size. The hotel was extremely clean and well maintained.

The views from the roof top bar are fabulous and it was a delightful place to sit on a spring afternoon. I can imagine in the summer it would be a perfect way to escape the heat of the city and enjoy a cocktail or two. There is a very small but very lovely swimming pool (un-heated) within the bar area.

The staff are highly professional and courteous. They were all friendly and only too happy to assist. Great service from the Bar Staff and Concierge in particular. 

You need to be very wary of the cost of the ""extras"" at this hotel. WiFi is charged at 15 Euros per room per day. Breakfast (which turned out to not be included in our package) was an eye-watering 103 Euros (29 Euros per adult and 16 per child) for our family of 4 for what was a fairly uninspiring buffet . Needless to say we had breakfast elsewhere the next day. 

We did not use the Spa. My husband wanted to use the steam-room after he used the gym but was told it had to be booked and paid for via the Spa (10 floors above). First time I have stayed in a hotel of this standard where you are expected to pay to use a steam room...

Would I return? Yes but I would request a room in the older part of the hotel.",4,2013,04,12
11,"Excellent hotel, very good location","A great 5 star hotel, excellent service. Located at the heart of the city. 5 minutes walk from Catalunia square. Rooms are comfortable and large. A very nice breakfast.
A very nice top roof view on the city.",5,2013,04,12
11,BEST HOTEL IN BARCELONA,"I have stayed in this hotel two times: One in 1997 (just before an important renovation) and also in 2012. 

The service was always PERFECT. Very kind people, always helping.

The rooms are from another world... Classy, stylish furniture, HUGE rooms and the bathrooms are very clean and beautiful. 

The spa is a very peaceful one, with great service.",5,2013,04,11
11,Wonderful Hotel in the midst of everything!,"I have stayed in the Majestic on two occasions now and would not hesitate to recommend ! The service is Excellent without being intrusive!
The hotel has a lovely rooftop swimming pool! In a word....Perfect!",5,2013,04,10
11,Luxury bathroom,"We stayed four nights in this hotel. It was an easy walk from Passeg de Gracia station and a perfect location. We had the most basic room but the bathroom was to die for! I would return for the deep bath, rain effect shower, toiletries and mirror that did not steam up but I would give this hotel a miss for the too soft bed and poor service on the roof terrace. I think it was worth the money but would probably look around for something else if I am lucky enough to return to this amazing city.",4,2013,04,09
11,Excellent Hotel,"Went here for my Wifes 50th Birthday, they laid on Cake and wine on arrival.  Excellent Hotel in the heart of Barcelona, very clean and pleasant. Rooms good and quiet. Enjoyed every minute staff very helpful, not sure about having to pay for coffee in the room in a 5* Hotel though.",5,2013,04,09
11,excellent hotel...great location!,"This was our first time in Barcelona and as usual, I poured over others hotel reviews on tripadvisor.com to find a great place for my mom, myself and my daughters.
I wrote the hotel in advance and even though they weren't the quickest in responding, a wonderful junior suite was waiting for us. It's wasn't the biggest suite I had ever stayed in but it was luxurious. The bathroom and rain shower alone was worth the stay! The hotel floors are quiet and peaceful. The bed was wonderful.
The location of the hotel is fantastic, as all the others have said. Breakfast was not included with our room but it did look lovely, albeit expensive for the buffet.  We got coffees and pastries at the little cafe right across the street.  Parking was a little costly...about 30 Euro a night...but it is city center.
A wonderful stay! We will come back!!",5,2013,04,08
11,"Majestic Hotel, Majestic Service","Attention to detail and faultless service accompanied us throughout our stay at the Majestic. Situated just a 15 minute stroll along patterned tiled pavements into the centre, this hotels small but beautiful deluxe rooms wrap you as would a cashmere blanket. Stay here if you want to feel  pampered. Step outside if you want to experience all that Barcelona has to offer on your doorstep.",5,2013,04,08
11,Majestic Barcelona,"Great hotel amazing service and in the most perfect location for seeing Barcelona. The rooftop terrace has an amazing view. Rooms are very good, beds fantastic, super service makes this hotel one of the best in Barcelona.",5,2013,04,08
11,Affordable Luxury at a GREAT location,"It was my first time in barcelona and this was the perfect choice of hotel if you are looking for luxury, comfort, great service and most importantly very accessible location with attractions and shops within walking distance.  Perfect location for shoppers as you get great choice of luxury boutiques, high street brands - all within walking distance including La Ramblas and metro station.  We could shop and walk back to the hotel to dump our bags and carry on shopping.  Concierge and hotel staff speaks perfect English and provided the most helpful and courteous service, excellent restaurant recommendation.  Tourist attractions like casa batllo and mila la pedrera is a stone throw away.  Cab from airport to hotel only costs euro23 - great value if you are travelling more than 2 people and have many baggage to handle.   Most impressed with the roof top bar as it offers a spectacular view of the city and you can even see la sagrada familia!  Will definitely return when i ever i visit barcelona.  Coffee lovers will be treated to a nespresso machine, only downside is that there is no kettle to boil your own water to make other beverages.  Unless you are staying in a suite, there's no free wifi access but guests can make use of free internet service at the business center.",5,2013,04,06
11,Incredible hotel....Two thumbs up,"Where can I start?  We came with our children for the first time to Barcelona.  Hotel was located in a fabulous location....felt like walking into luxury.  It is next to all the shopping and close to many monuments.  Metro station was close by (one block) for access to rest of the city.

We reserved a junior suite with the children.  Room was very clean and large...especially by european standards.    Bed was very comfortable as well as the pull out used by my son.  Top of the line toiletries and amazing rain head shower.  View was also wonderful and no noise heard in the room.

Concierge service was top notch as well with every restaurant recommended a hit.  Be careful with directions as these can be confusion and always have a map with you.

Only downside was Wifi access.  Free for the suite, but only one device can be logged on at a time.  The log in process was outdated and cumbersome....easier to go to business center for online access...especially when kids wanted on line access as well.

That being said, i would definately stay here again....our best hotel by far during our stay in Spain....I would highly recommend it to everyone",5,2013,04,03
11,Second visit - Excellent hotel in a GREAT location - and this time with Kids,"As it did on our first trip 3 years ago, and this time under very different circumstances, the Majestic was a 5 star experience. We returned this time with our 2 kids and instead of staying in the Hotel itself -- we stayed next door in the Majestic Apartments. Spacious and fully appointed 2 bedroom and 2 beautiful bathrooms, washer and dryer, full kitchen, 3 televisions, two patios. Very spacious, first class, comfortable option if travelling with kids or friends you want to all be together. Full access to the hotel restaurants, bars and gym (gym is executive quality with top of the line equipment). We love this hotel, its central location near the train, tourist buses, walk to everything from Pedera to Barrio Gotic to La Rambla to the beach. It's first class and high end -- great service and accomodating staff. Its in the middle of great restaurants and shopping. From end to end its top notch.  

I have one complaint -- especially if you have kids -- and the front desk acknowledged this problem and that it really needs to address it: the WIFI is very expensive and only person can be online at a time. This is wholly inconvenient and unnecessary in this internet age.  Literally one person has to sign off for the other to use the private wifi code? I hope on my next trip the hotel will have rectified this problem. A second observation -- the bed was surprisingly a touch soft  -- probably could use an upgrade of the mattress in the Master suite  (but this is a matter of personal choice for sure!).  Otherwise -- 5 star experience!",5,2013,03,31
11,Brilliant Location,"Our family of four stayed in a Junior Suite, which was bright and contained all we needed. Excellent TVs, good bathroom, with Bulgari toiletries, though needed to keep a careful eye on the shower to stop water leaking into the bathroom. Housekeeping staff kept the room immaculate and there was a welcome bottle of wine and pate/olives on arrival.

Service in general was excellent, though it took some time to retrieve our bags from storage when departing.

The best part of the hotel was its location, in one of Barcelona's grandest streets close to two Gaudi attractions and many top branded shops.

Breakfast was varied and plentiful, though the food on offer did not seem to change from day to day. The restaurant where it was served, however was somewhat dull.

Free wi-fi came with the suite, but only one device could be connected at a time, which had one advantage in keeping the kids off u-tube! Seriously the hotel needs to follow the example of other hotels where more than one device can be connected, without an additional charge.

The hotel arranged transport to meet us at Barcelona airport which was all very efficient at Euro 110. Going back to the airport we easily caught a comfortable cab at a cost of Euro 26.50!

A small roof top pool and bar are a nice touch and would be great in summer when the weather warms up a little.",4,2013,03,29
11,Don't bother unless you want to pay 15 euros for Wifi access,"I cannot believe that this review is costing me my Internet access fee of 15 euros.  The Irish bar not far away has the wireless code printed on the bottom of the drinks receipt.  On top of that we had to pay twice because only one iPad could be connected at any one time.  Had we booked for more than one night we would have cancelled the second.

I can accept that a nominal, say 2 euro fee be charged, but in this day and age free wifi should be the norm.",3,2013,03,26
11,Great location,"The hotel is rated as a 5 star Hotel, but I would give it a very good 4 star rating. I think that these rating have lost reference. Anyway, it is a great place to stay at decent prices. I ve got a courtyard room (147) that was very spacious with a very large bathroom, doublesinks, large shower and a bathtub. In room Nespresso machine (for me a big plus) and the usual flatscreen TV. Maybe a iphone or ipod operated sound station would be nice.
The staff is courteous and professional. The Hotel has a beautiful rooftop lounge and bar with a small pool to refresh after a day of strolling in wonderful Barcelona. The views are amazing.
The location at Paseo de Gracia is tops. 
All in all a perfect place not too expensive, totally worth every € .",5,2013,03,16
11,so worth ever penny!!,"Okay, first of all ; kudos to the hospitality!
Im seriously confused from where to start praising this beautiful place.
Please place is really beautiful..I and my lady friend(who was typically from spain) had our best time here.
This is a large property, rooms are very comfy, me being a typical veggy guy, they managed to get some Indian food for me.
They also managed to pick me from airport!

I'll give 10/10. EXCELLENT HOTEL, Food was okay! but im pleased with the hospitality.",5,2013,03,16
11,Worthy of its name!,"My wife and I travelled to Barcelona in February and stayed at the Majestic as my birthday treat. We found the hotel on Trip Advisor and were impressed with its location and rating. We didn't want to stay on Las Ramblas  because of the busyness of the street and so decided on the Majestic which is situated in the more upmarket area of the city. It is perfectly located for all of the major sights and just a short walk away from the open top tour bus stop!. World renowned names such as Chanel, Bvlgari, Gucci, Chopard are situated in the same 'block' and Louis Vuitton etc are just a few steps away. It really is a beautiful hotel and well worth spending a little extra money for the air of quality in the immediate area. Our room, which overlooked the main thoroughfare of Passaig de Gracia, was perfect for a 3 night stay. Beautiful marble bathroom with top quality amenities (the extra special touches were great) All of the public areas are immaculate and the service was excellent! On the day of my birthday,  Champagne, Chocolate dipped Strawberries and Chocolate Brownies were delivered to my room. They must have clocked my DOB from my passport when we checked in as we did not tell them it was my birthday! It's these special things which make this hotel stand out above all others. Do not hesitate to book this hotel - you will not be disappointed!  We will be returning soon.",5,2013,03,15
11,Very small room,"Beautiful hotel building in the middle of the city center, unfortunately room we received had about 16 square meters and view room was a technical background in the courtyard. Breakfast was good, the staff was professional and worth mentioning is the swimming pool on the hotel roof",3,2013,03,12
11,"Beautiful Hotel, Lovely suite","I stayed at The Majestic last July, before going on a cruise, and it was a beautiful place to stay, it was a shame it was being renovated. The suite was very spacious and luxurious and we had pre-arranged to have Champagne and Chocolate Strawberries waiting in our room. The hotel has a beautiful rooftop bar and pool, with view over Barcelona. The staff are very helpful and accommodating, and speak English exceptionally well. 
The hotel is in a great central location and close to Las Ramblas, and the centre of the shopping district (though more for window shopping!!). 
Only downside was we asked for an extra bed in out room and that never cam, but other than that it was wonderful!",4,2013,03,10
11,Charming and well respected,"Staying at the Majestic seems to touch a chord in the heart of the Catalonians. Taxi drivers respect you just that wee bit more, locals pay more attention to you and YOU feel you made the right choice. 

Superbly located, five star in each respect, The Majestic is on the the road that is home to two of Gaudi's masterpieces, the Casa Bartllo is the one I visited. One must take the audio tour in their visit there. The rooms in the hotel were small, but the bathrooms were huge. Bulgari toiletries to complete the feeling of luxury and a fantastic concierge to welcome you every day.

There is a cute cafeteria just outside where we'd grab our daily croissant and coffee, much recommended. Barcelona is one of the most beautiful cities I have visited and let's say this wont be my last trip...",5,2013,03,09
11,I loved everything about this hotel,"After 3 nights it really started to feel like ""going home""!  The staff was extremely nice and accommodating.  The room had a luxurious feel and one of the best showers that I have ever had in a hotel room.  And being that I have been a flight attendant for over twenty years, I have a lot of showers to compare to.  The location is ideal, right in between Gaudi's La Pedrera and Casa Batllo.  The rooftop bar/pool is very nice, although the weather was not great while we were there.  Room service was prompt and delicious, I had the spaghetti bolognese and it was wonderful.  The spa is worth a see.  I had a pricey but ""worth it"" manicure.  The lobby bar was a great place to have one last drink and long sit in a comfy couch before heading up for the night.  If there is one complaint it is that the wireless is not included, but the cost of the room was relatively affordable so not a big problem.",5,2013,03,07
11,GREAT LOCATION,"The hotel leaves no wish unfulfilled. The rooms are luxurious and very large. The bathroom boasts a series of Bulgary care and the bathtube invites you to relax.
One bright spot was the breakfast, very unusual and something different but phenomenal.",5,2013,03,06
11,So Relaxing,"It was great to go back to this property, in its excellent position on the passage de gracia.

We treated ourselves to a executive suite and got upgrade on arrival to a junior suite which had a splendid view of the passage de gracia, it had lovely buvlgari toiletries in the room to spoil yourself with.

Roof top spa and outdoor pool which was too cold to be outside but inside the spa was great and relaxing.

The staff were super and recommended a faboulous india which was in wallking distance of the hotel.",5,2013,03,04
11,"Clean, well run but an expensive bar","We were originally booked at Hotel MurMuri but on arrival told that there was a problem with our reservation and that we'd been rebooked at the Majestic Hotel. Despite the inconvenience, the experience of the Majestic Hotel was very positive. The hotel is fully renovated and it shows. We had a great room, large and with a glass enclosed balcony. It could be a little noisy at times but noting that interrupted sleep. We also really appreciated having some English TV channels (rather than the usual BBC World, the TV also featured BBC and ITV channels), a nice little background entertainment while getting dressed or lounging in bed! 

Unfortunately the weather was bad so we weren't able to enjoy the 10th floor terrace bar, but I ventured up in the wind and rain and the view was great. I can imagine it's a wonderful place to be on a sunny evening! 

The only issues were:

No free wifi. Really? At this room rate I would have expected it.
Bar prices. 15 euros for a very mediocre cocktail. But you have to expect this at a 5-star hotel.
Breakfast: Price was too high, especially when there's a great cafe 20 yards away.",4,2013,03,01
11,Elegant 5 star & well located,"To our pleasant, we were upgraded to a Premier Room. Very spacious, near
good restaurants just off Ps De Gracias, well appointed equalling Asian deluxe hotels.  Only hitch is the nearby Service room which bangs loudly when closed.  ",4,2013,02,28
11,Excellent!!!!!,"I stayed there with my boyfriend for one night in early February.  I booked this hotel because of the location and also base on the positive comments from tripadvisor. I was not disappointed.

I booked through hotels.com.  We rented a car at the airport and drove to the hotel. It should have been a 20 min drive (or less) but we got lost and took us nearly an hour. Once we arrived, the staff quickly gave us directions on where to leave the car and helped us with our luggage.  

We were disappointed when we were shown to our room. The room is nice and luxurious, it's just that it had no view. The window faces a wall and there was little light coming into the room. We immediately asked for another room.  Luckily the hotel found us another room on the same floor. We were told that we were upgraded (3 tiers as we were told) to a suite.  It was very spacious, modern bathroom and even comes with a terrance. 

The room was clean. The bed was super comfortable. Lots of English channels on tv. The bathroom came with all the amendities needed.  The staff were friendly and helpful (i.e. directions, restaurant recommendations, shopping etc). The location was superb! It's right in the centre with lots of big brands nearby. Unfortunately all the shops were closed on Sunday.  

We had breakfast at the hotel. I didn't pick the B&B option so we ended up paying like EUR2x/person. It's a bit pricy for breakfast but it was worth it! Cava, fresh juice, coffee, tea etc were served. Eggs any style you want. All sorts of patries in a very clever display.  All kinds of ham and cheese.  I wish I had a bigger stomach! We were so stuffed till dinner time! 

We were recommended a tapas place about 2 blocks away from the hotel for dinner. However there were too many people so we went to another one nearby, which was still good. We had a drink at the Mandrian Oriental hotel down the road, and one more drink at Hotel 68 or 87 next door which is a hip boutique hotel which was very nice.

The only downside is that this hotel doesn't come with free wifi/ internet access.  My boyfriend used the computers at the computer centre for free.  I got a local sim card at the nearby vodaphone shop for around EUR 20 (so we can use it throughout our trip in Spain, France etc) and was able to check my email and facebook using my phone. There is a Macdonald near the hotel which free wifi if you absolutely need to check your email. 

Overall a very enjoyable stay at the hotel. I will likely stay here again if I come across another good deal on the internet.",5,2013,02,26
11,Real Luxury In Barcelona,"There are many design hotels in Barcelona which charge a fortune for noisy rooms, lumpy beds and very little customer service.  The Majestic Hotel where I stayed on two separate occasions in February fortunately is in an outstanding category of its own!  The location is perfect, the reception staff and porters are numerous and extremely efficient, they made me feel like visiting royalty. I arrived with ski equipment and lots of luggage plus hire car, it was all whisked away in the blink of any eyelid!!!  The beds are so comfy, sparkling bathrooms, black out curtains which work, BBC1 BBC1 ITV1 practically a first for a Spanish hotel (normally CNN and BBC World), quality healthy breakfast delivered to my room with the toasties still warm!  Late check out, no problem, also received upgrades on both occasions a suite no less!  Booked through booking.com received fabulous rates.  The management and staff of this hotel are to be congratulated for their outstanding work and attention to their guests personal comfort!",5,2013,02,25
11,Lovely staff,"Hotel rooms are big with amazing showers. Very comfortable bed too. 
Reception were very helpful and gave great restaurant recomendations. There's a local cafe for breakfast across the road and a popular tapas restaurant 2 blocks away. There's a taxi rank right outside the hotel too. Location is ok, taxi is needed for the port. About a 10mins walk to las ramblas/Boqueria market. It is near the Gracia neigbourhood its in is very nice as well. If you do not get B&B, it's GBP25.",4,2013,02,21
11,The center of Barcelona,"The Majestic is ideally situated on the most interesting section of the Passeig de Gracia with easy access to the Metro (within one block) and other transportation services including a 24 hour cab stand (within 50 metres). The rooms are excellent and the staff are quite professional and well trained in other languages (I heard French, German, and English). You can also walk to a number of important tourist sites. I was all over town setting up a room for a student at the Liceu Conservatory and I was impressed how many small businesses were in walking distance of the Hotel for setting up dormitory living.",5,2013,02,21
11,Great Hotel Great location,"The hotel is located in one of the best parts of the city, away from all the madness of the rambler. we had a great room with a balcony facing the street. The rooms are excellent . The staff are really helpful and polite.
this time of year is a good time to visit, as there are no crowds, and a nice temperature to walk round the city.
Thanks to the hotel for putting a cake in our room for my partners b,day Nice !
Defiantly we book this hotel next time.",5,2013,02,19
11,Hotel to Stay,"This is best hotel I have stayed, people are friendly food is excellent location is perfect.
The breakfast especially was awesome. Advised to go in winter during Nov so that you can get a god deal else the room rates are pretty steep. It has a michelen 5 star kitchen.",5,2013,02,18
11,great service,We unexpectedly moved to this hotel as we had problems with our previous but the staff were super helpful from the start. We had some problems with our aircon in the room and the staff changed the room for us right away. The location was perfect. We could easily get a taxi to get around the city.,4,2013,02,12
11,Ideal for a Romantic weekend and to discover the city,"Ideal for a Romantic weekend and to discover the city
The Junior suite on the first floor was very spacious. Brand new refurbished room with a great luxurious design. Spacious bathroom with both bath tub and shower. Very comfortable bed. Despite an active and intense weekend we were able to also rest and felt completely refreshed by the end of the weekend.
Great service throughout the stay, including a bottle of cava and chocolate dipped strawberries as a welcome gift.
The location was extremely convenient to discover the city (starting with the view from the roof top bar /swimming pool). End of January was quite a good timing for a visit. Combination of nice weather and great discounts.",5,2013,02,09
11,"Wow, exceeded expectations","I wasn't sure what to expect on arrival, reviews on the site are mixed. A party of 4 on a birthday treat, we were treated like royalty. Champagne and chocolates in our room, staff friendly and helpful. Doorman a little surly when he didn't know the name of the restaurant we had booked, but I can forgive that. Our rooms on the 6th floor were spacious and luxurious with every amenity you could wish for provided. Bathrooms are huge! Separate toilet is also a nice touch. Beds were comfortable with a comprehensive pillow menu, turndown service with chocolates etc. Roof terrace has stunning views of the city and particularly the Sagrada Familia and further afield towards the sea. Location is great, right in the heart of everything. Will definitely return.",5,2013,02,04
11,Great location!  Loved the bathroom,"This was the first time I booked a hotel through ""Jetsetter"" and I was more than pleased!   Jetsetter gave me what I thought was a great rate for our 2 nights in Barcelona.  The location of this hotel could not have been better.  Having been to Barcelona 3 other times, I knew that I didn't want to stay right on Las Ramblas (where there are too many thousands of people).   The location is in the high rent part of town, near the Mandarin Oriental etc, and fancy shops.   Also, the ""on and off"" tourist bust picks up right outside the hotel which made that convenient for us too.  The best part was that the room was HUGE and the bathroom was beautiful!!  All marble, double sinks, great products and a fantastic HUGE marble shower.  
The only thing that is not worth your time is the roof top bar which does have a good view, but the service is so slow that it's not worth it.  The food/drinks are way way to overpriced for what you get, so oh well, you live and learn.   
After 4x now in Barcelona, that might have been my last.... but if there is a 5th, I will likely stay here again.",5,2013,01,29
11,Great Location but very poor service and everything else just average,"I stayed in this hotel with 4 other friends as a sort of grown up ""girl's weekend away"". The location was what we wanted as it was close to the nice shopping area and restaurants. The hotel was very traditional (a but stuffy) in its decor and really not my style. 
The service was very slow and the attitude of the staff was not good, they didn't make us feel welcome or cared for. I especially did not like the staff at the front desk, some of which had the attitude of not wanting to be there and answering questions to do you a favour. All 5 of us felt a little offended by the way we were treated. Cabs would be called and then you were left to fend for yourself to understand when your cab arrived and whether it was yours.
I am so did not like that WiFi was not free and easy to access. I think that in 5 star hotels you should get wifi included Snd very easy to use for your whole stay. Only Easyjet can get away with making you pay extra for your food. If you are travelling first class you expect to get champagne included. I expect to get Wifi included when I stay in 5 Star hotels. 
Breakfast buffet was average and the restaurant was underground so really not very nice as you want to have breakfast in a place with natural light. Again service here was slow and with a negative attitude. I do not recommend this hotel to people who are used to staying in places like the ""W hotel"" and the like as they will be very disappointed! ",2,2013,01,27
11,Great Hotel in a fab City,"Stayed for 4 nights 16 to 20 Jan 2013...room 730....First class service from the moment we pulled up at the Hotel,doorman took charge of everything in car  and even parked car. I cannot speak highly enough of the staff from door man to reception and room cleaning.....The lady who looked after our room did a really great job..it seemed every time we went out she went in and squared up the room. evening, room turned down with choco on pillow, simple  but we loved it...BIG Thanks to this lady..As a 57 year old man I needed a wee bit of pampering and went to spa, massage is to be recommended ....you must go onto roof great view...We never had any food in hotel as we like to forage for good places to eat.....Over all a great hotel that made a great City break...many thanks Majestic..",5,2013,01,24
11,Great Location!,"Recently renovated so the rooms and public areas are clean and contemporary and the hotel stands in a fantastic location especially if you like shopping - right next door to Chanel! I would definately stay here again and recommend it, but i would not book through Expedia - we were promised a discount refunded due to work on our balcony disturbing us at 7am and the view was covered duirng our stay due to noise, i contacted Expedia and was totally ignored - i will never book through them again - beware of Expedia!",5,2013,01,22
11,Good location and fine rooms.,"Spent 3 nights at this hotel Jan 17-20 2013. It is a fine hotel with very comfortable and quiet rooms. The staff is very helpful and efficient. It was too cold to make use of the rooftop bar but the city views are great from up there. 
The location is ideal for people that want to get to the main attractions quickly. It is safe and away from the pickpockets on Las Ramblas but very near several bars and restaurants.
They should update their wifi service and provide free service in the rooms. 15 euros per day for wifi is a little out of date for such an expensive hotel. They do have a business center available at no charge.
The main restaurant is overpriced, service is a little stuffy and the food mediocre. I would recommend the Tapas in the bar for your later evening meal. Alex the head waiter in the bar area is exceptional and very helpful.",4,2013,01,22
11,Nice Hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"The best thing about Majestic Hotel is it's location - in the middle of beautiful Passeo de Gracia. 5 minutes from a great Gaudi's buildings - Casa Batlló and La Pedrera. Also it's a great location for shopping (Gucci, Dior, Louis Vuitton etc). Near from subway station ant taxi parking. The roof terrace and bar is great with views over the city. In 0 level located small fitness area. Our room (deluxe) was a well comfortable, but very tiny. In room available nespresso coffee machine and minibar. Wi-fi in hotel is paid and slowly. Good breakfast and good menu in hotel's restaurant (but no smoking area in hotel). The service in general was good, but not superior. So, i would give the hotel strong 4 stars, but not 5.

Stayed November 2012, traveled as a couple.",4,2013,01,22
11,Almost excellent,"I have stayed here many times.  Newer hotels have opened but I always come here. Very comfortable.  Great location.  Friendly staff.  Shame Drolma, the restaurant has closed.  Still, a good stay at a good price",4,2013,01,18
11,MAJESTIC IT IS.!,"At first sight it looks majestic. An imposing building amongst many others in the Passeo de Gracia as you approach it looks special. I drove up to the front and a member of staff appeared immediately opened ny door  took my luggage and told me he would park my car,always difficult in central Barcelona. Another member of staff then escorted me to Reception. Staff there were attentive and helpful and I was remembered from several previous visits, a nice surprise, and was then upgraded to a Suite. Why was I getting this 6 Star treatment I thought but decided to sit back and enjoy it!
My room was majestic! Very comfortable ,superbly appointed with a lovely view over the Passeo.
The Hotel recently has had some extensive re-furbisment and it shows from its lovely reception area to the cosy foyer bar and minamalistic restaurant.. I found the foyer bar an enjoyable place to sit and enjoy a drink and people watch in lovely deep seated settees, relaxing ambience, and excellent well stocked drink shelves.You can also enjoy small snacks and lovely pattiserie.
This beautiful first class hotel is stategically located near a lot of the striking Gaudi buildings .is coveniently placed for La Ramblas,The Old Town, The Picasso Gallery and many other local attractions.
Recommended strongly if you want a 5 star location at areasonable price at the centre of Barcelona",5,2013,01,18
11,Truly Majestic,"We were a group of friends (27school & collagemates) who travelled to Spain to celebrate most of us turning 40years.
We stayed at The Majestic hotel in Barcelona and our 6nights stay there was truly majestic.
The breakfast both continental and local Catalanian cuisine was truly mouth watering.
Their rooftop swimming pool bar where they organized a party for the whole group was as magical as the city of Barcelona.
The majestic hotel can be considered as the Spanish twin of The Taj Mahal hotel Mumbai not only because of grand, majestic & heritage feel one gets on just looking at the hotel but also because of the great service, excellent food and the fantastic location. The best tapas bars, hordes of restaurants with open air service, the best branded stores for shopping and the gaudi museum are right at the hotels doorstep.. It was a truly majestic experience..",5,2013,01,18
11,Majestic!,"I should have written this review sooner but just didn't get a chance to. The hotel really does live up to its name. It looks royal, rich in colours and in a fantastic location. The staff there were  fantastic and made our long weekend getaway superb. Went with my boyf and we were both blown away as soon as we stepped inside the hotel.  

Location was GREAT ! Right in the heart of things. Perfect spot for the hop on and hop off tourist bus. Breakfast there was divine, everything you could imagine was there including a nice glass of champagne so you can have a mimosa. we never ate dinner here as we wanted to sample different eateries, but the staff at this hotel were great at advising us about where the best places to eat were. 

Building works- there was building works going on (which was one of the reasons i was a bit apprehensive about going) however you couldn't even tell as it felt hidden away. If anyone wants  a 5* experience in the heart of Barcelona, then you should look no further as the Majestic is for you.",5,2013,01,13
11,Stylish hotel in the centre of the city,"We stayed one night here whilst my husband was looking for conference facilities.
The hotel environment, staff and facilities were second to none.  The conference facilities were brand new, flexible and airy with good access for stands and expo.
Our room was comfortable and bright. The dining room was the place to be seen by celebs.
The hotel is located in the upmarket shopping area to the north of La Rambla and close to Gaudi buildings.
It was a very enjoyable stay.",5,2013,01,12
11,Very good,"The best thing about this hotel is it's location. Our room was nice and comfortable but I know that rooms in lower class are extremely tiny and not worth the price. Very clean, Good service, The lobby is not friendly.",4,2013,01,10
11,Nice and verynwell located hotel,"We stayed for 3 days in this hotel. The rooms, the interior design, the beds, all of these are very good. There are some rooms where there is a strange noise over the wall, lime there is a metro driving constantly. We asked for a room change due to that and they did it with out any problems. The hotel is perfect for shopping, aas the passeig gracia is full of brand shops. The breakfast is one of the best in barcelona, even if it costs 28 euro. We had dinner one night at the lobby restaurant and the meals were perfect, very tasty, also one of the best meals in barcelona. 
The rate was also good for this period.",4,2013,01,08
11,"Good position, in normal rate period is a great solution.","I have been there several times in different period. It is not a 5stars L but it is a good 4 stars and in the period where it is not in high season the rate is a great compromise for a very good hotel in a super strategic position. Very centred, on the paseo de Gracia. 
I will be back in Barcelona for business in january and will go there again. 
I never experienced the pool on the roof, shouldn't be the reason to go there. They have a spa that I never tried. 
The rooms are ok, elegant, not big but comfortable. 
The hotel is not smoking. 
",4,2013,01,05
11,Absolutely stunning!,The perfect location of this hotel is only one of the many things to compliment about when looking for a hotel in central Barcelona! The staff were superb and extremely friendly and willing to help out for any directions or recommendations for any ideas of what to do when in the city and give you some tips to finding the best tapas bars in town too. We stayed for a two night break in late December and seemed to be a very busy time as well. The room was really lovely and had a very picturesque balcony on the front of the building to take in the sites as well as some great photo opportunities. The bed was an extremely comfortable King with lovely linens and high quality pillows. I personally liked the touches of the Bulgari body washes and shampoos...a nice treat to be able to use when you are away. A great hotel for a special occasion.,5,2013,01,05
11,A worthwhile choice!,"Hotel Majestic is as its name suggests. We had a wonderful two night stay in December. The location is fabulous, smack in the middle of high class shopping and sightseeing and very central to public transportation. The hotel staff were exceedingly friendly and accommodating, especially the concierge service. The room was well appointed with lots of nice touches like the bulgari cosmetics, nice fluffy robes, great shower/bath experience, and even a phone in the separate toilet room although unfortunately the music in the bathroom area was out of order and not fixed by the time we left. We even had use of the business center for wifi etc at no charge. We would most certainly consider staying there again when we visit Barcelona.",5,2013,01,01
11,Great location!!,"the hotel is in an amazing location right on the main shopping street, next to Chanel and Chopard etc so evening window shopping was fun!!  It was a block or so walk to everything you wanted to see and many good restaurants are positioned near by. We were disappointed by the reception staff who we found to be quite unhelpful with recommendations of places to eat etc and they only seemed to suggest places we found to be connected with the hotel! Rooms are quite small and ensure you have a street view or else you will be looking at a car park! Decor is lovely and relaxing and the view from the roof terrace is incredible, day or evening!",4,2012,12,31
11,"friendly staff, centrally located","we really enjoyed our stay here. Unfortunately no free wifi, but apart from this, just perfect. very helpful and friendly staff. they have a good variety of gins at the bar! The hotel is perfectly located, so that you can reach all the sights by foot. From the sky deck bar you have a beautiful view all over barca...",4,2012,12,30
11,Almost the best I have been to.,"This was my second time to the Majestic, and I truly feel it is a magnificent hotel. Everything is top class from start to finish. I would not look elsewhere!
My only minor concerns are that the WiFi, and breakfast, are ridiculously priced.
With modern technology being what it is, I cannot understand why WiFi is not included, or available at a lower price. 
The breakfast is very nice, but once again, is a little over-priced.
As I mentioned above, everything else is top class.",5,2012,12,29
11,Working just outside the room,"Overall the hotel was good, friendly staff, nice although small rooms, practical although small business center and nice spa. Unfortunately, I definitely have to say something about the noise just outside my room in the morning. 
I arrived at the hotel on Wednesday 19 December in the morning at about 10.00. Workers were working at the room wall making noise. This didn't disturb me particularly as I immediately left the hotel. I expected it was a matter of one day. Unfortunately, this was not the case and the following morning I started hearing the noise of the drill earlier when I was still sleeping. 
After complaining I immediately received another noise-free room. However, what would have happened if the hotel had  been fully booked? For sure the hotel knew about this works and the potential inconveniences for the guests. In my opinion they shouldn't have sold the room.
This is the reason for the poor rating",2,2012,12,25
11,Solo pampering at Majestic,"Convinient room, with a nice king size bed. Very nicely equipped room. My room didn´t have a view, but I expect some of the top floor rooms might have a nice view.
The breakfast was good, but nothing superb. It had good variety an nice Spanish flavors.
The top floor has a nice terrace with a pool and lounge bar for drinks and food (at least snacks). The view is spectacular over the city, you can see Sagrada Familia, the Mediterranean sea and the hills to south. I can recommend for sure just going there for a glass of cava and the superb view, even if you are not staying at the hotel. It´s good both day and night.
On the top floor, behind the roof bar you can find the spa. I didn´t find the treatments to be quite worth the money that I paid for them (massage and facial), the person treating me wasn´t anything too special with skills. I would expect something really good for about 200euros.. But I really enjoyed my private time before the treatments, as you can reserve the spas steamrooms all to yourself or with a friend or spouse. They have three different hot treatment rooms, for example a traditional type sauna and a turkis style steam room. There is also two different nice hydro therapy showers. After that I had some time to sunbathe before my treatments by the rooftop pool. I recommend trying this!
The service in general was good, but not superior, like you would expect in a hotel that claims to be 5 stars.
Also the wifi in standard room was with extra fee and quite expensive and slowish. Should be included in the already high price.
All in all, i would give the hotel strong 3 stars, but the view on the roof top is full 5 as is the location :)",4,2012,12,23
11,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here unexpectedly having broken my foot at Heathrow on our way to Barcelona

We had been booked into another hotel that had no amenities.

The rooftop pool and bar area was perfect

Our room had great amenities and was very comfortable

Hotel was undergoing major refurb so lots of scaffolding and works going on

Main restaurant a bit depressing. Breakfast was great.",4,2012,12,21
11,Pure luxury,"This is absolutely a top hotel! Everything is tasteful, beautiful  and well managed. Well situated in Barcelona. Excelent breakfast. We had one dinner at the hotel and this was also up to all our expectations. Aircondition. Huge, very beautiful bathroom with toaletteries of top brand. Quiet, nice beds, perfect linen. Tea/coffe making facilities.",5,2012,12,18
11,Loved it!,"My husband & I arrived on the day of the general strike but had no problem getting to the hotel.  We had arranged a car through the hotel, worried that we may not find a taxi.  The staff was wonderful throughout our stay & before we arrived, emailing as necessary.  Our room was wonderful - king bed, very comfortable.  Ate dinner in the restaurant the 1st night since everything was closed, the food was delicious.  So no wifi in the rooms - you can access it in the lobby.  Location was great - shops, restaurants nearby.  Can walk to many attractions.  Oh & a spectacular roof top bar.",5,2012,12,13
11,Expected more for the money,"This hotel doesn't quite deliver what it promises - the best thing about this hotel is the external look and the lobby/bar area. The rooms are really average (we stayed in a standard double), similar to what you expect to find in any international chain hotel. We were initially given a room facing a parking lot, which was noisy because of building works. We then asked to be transferred to a quieter room and were given a street facing room. The second room had a beautiful view but the double-glazing didn't really block the street noise, which was quite loud because of the very central location of this hotel. 
The nespresso machine in the room is quite handy, beware though that each capsule costs 1 euro which is not clearly marked (there's a nespresso boutique across the road where you can buy the capsules for 1/3 of this price).
The service is quite good, most staff very welcoming.
The bar area is not particularly exciting, a bit old-fashioned and lacks atmosphere. 
Overall, this is not a great value for money and there are much more special hotels in Barcelona for the same price.",3,2012,12,12
11,Good hardware but no software,"We were wonderfully surprised that we got an upgrade when we arrived. Location of these hotel is fantastic, surrounded by all the expensive brands but of course Mango and Zara are walking distance too. There is a great tapas restaurant called the Catalina, it is about 10mins walk away from the hotel. The price and food is superb! Little I could mentioned about the hotel service though, we were there for at least 5 days but the lady at the breakfast reception could never remember our room numner or names. Housekeeping and laundry would just open your door without even ringing or knocking first. This is really unacceptable!",3,2012,12,06
11,Wonderful location,My wife and I spent 4 nights here at the beginning of October 2012.  We had a lovely quiet  room overlooking the courtyard. The service was excellent and the staff exceptionally helpful.Because of the great location we could walk to most of the sights and restaurants. I would recommend this hotel very highly. The only negative was that they do not have free WiFi.,5,2012,11,28
11,"perfect location, beautiful hotel","The hotel is located in Paseo de Gracia, my room had a beautiful view. Just a few blocks away from Las Ramblas. The room was spacious and the bed was super comfortable. Service and food was excellent! Truly a 5 star hotel.",5,2012,11,23
11,"great location, well appointed","The Majestic was overall very nice, the rooms were big enough, although ours overlooked a noisy courtyard/work area, but it was otherwise fine. Great location on the Passeig de Gracia with Chanel underneath and La Pedrera and Casa Batlo a block away.
 A Nespresso machine in the room was very welcome, but only on the 4th day did we realise that the coffee was not free, also no kettle or tea available, except through room service. 
The bathroom was fantastic - excellent shower from ceiling, and beautiful bulgari shampoos and soaps, but the toilet area was a bit cramped. Only other quibbles were that the air-conditioning didn't really seem to work, there was a funny musty smell all around the hotel, and no free wifi! The internet price (9 euro per hour - daylight robbery!) Overall it was a very nice hotel, a pity that the restaurant did not seem very inviting, otherwise we would have tried it. 
Hotel staff were very friendly.",4,2012,11,22
11,beautiful hotel,we arrived very early (9:30 am) but they found a room for us to drop our bags and catch up on sleep.  the hotel has been refurbished.  the room looked brand new with marble everywhere. the hotel is well located if like good restaurants.  there is a great tapas place 3 blocks away and a cerveceria that serves fresh inexpensive sandwiches and latte for breakfast around the corner from the hotel. their concierge recommended both.,5,2012,11,22
11,"Good location, beds uncomfortable.","Location very convenient. Staff polite and helpful. Two single beds put together to make one king bed was very uncomfortable. Standard of cleanliness in room was moderate. Options available at buffet breakfast was poor to average - not many healthy options provided at all compared to other 5 star hotels in Europe. Suggest hotel have at least a few more wholesome (complex carbs, low-sugar) breakfast options available for those guests who want it.",4,2012,11,21
11,AMAZING HOTEL!,A coworker recommended the Hotel Majestic and we were blown away.  We ended our thirteen day cruise in Barcelona and had pre-booked the Majestic through their website.  The Majestic is one block from Las Ramblas and right next door to Chanel.  The Majestic is in a great location and the area around the hotel is truly the largest Rodeo Drive I have ever seen.  The hotel is gorgeous and at night is beautifully lit.  We had booked a junior suite and let me say the website pictures do not do the hotel or the rooms justice!  The bed was super comfy and the bathroom is one I wanna build at home! The shower was amazing!  The Bvlgari toiletries were a very nice touch too!!  We did our tours during the day and ended our evenings at the roof top bar.  The view is amazing and you can see the Sagrada Familia and the Port from the roof.,5,2012,11,18
11,"Deluxe rooms nicely renovated, well located, but thats it.","nicely renovated deluxe rooms and an excellent location, so we'd stay again for that...which is the key for us...but the breakfast was very average, and the staff at the front desk and otherwise are very haughty and certainly don't go out of their way.

Fine for about 200 euros, but no more.",4,2012,11,17
11,Great Hotel For A Special Occasion,"We spent two nights here to celebrate my wifes birthday and it was pure luxery (although we did book a delux room).  The hotel is very convenient if travelling from the airport by train (which I would recommend, cheap, quick and regular) with a station five minutes walk away.  You can also walk to La Rambla and the Gothis Quarter in about 15-20 minutes.  Lovely hotel, our room was spacious, very clean and well served.  The roof terrace and bar is great with views over the city and many of the sites, but the pool is more of a spa bath!  We didn't eat in teh hotel as it was a bit pricey and we prefered to find a local place outside.  Staff were all very helpful and pleasant.   Despite being on a busy road I wasn't aware of the traffic at all, the rooms are well sound proofed.  I would go back again.",5,2012,11,16
11,Fantastic!,"We were 4 friends from Dublin and we had a wonderful stay at this hotel. The staff were wonderful, the location could not be better on a top class street with Chanel next door! The rooms have all been done up and were really beautiful. I could not fault anything, now we have all stayed in other 5 star hotels and for me the breakfast presentation, quality and choice was by far the best. The highlight of staff for us was the porter, he gave us wonderful recommendations to his favourite restaurants and all three recommendations were wonderful and made our stay in Barcelona wonderful. We loved the rooftop bar with wonderful views of Gaudi house and the November sunshine helped too. Thank you guys!",5,2012,11,16
11,"Great Spa, Great Hotel, One major flaw","This is a great hotel in a wonderful, convenient location. The spa provides wonderful treatments and are very nice. Hotel staff is accomodating. There was a recent refurbishment of rooms which are now modern. 

And now the flaw- they charge extra every day for unreliable wi-fi or you must ask for a code to access the internet in their business center.   A five star hotel that offers less modern service than the nearby McDonalds.  I am sure they make money on the charges but they cannot possible know how many guests they lose to other hotels. If they chhose to count, they can now count me. OK so for the 50€ that they made from me this trip, they have now lost 2500€ on the stay that I will not have on my next trip. Such a short-sighted policy is unimaginable in this century when so many options are available!!",4,2012,11,16
11,"perfect location,wonderful hotel, amazing staff.","Everything was perfect, especially the staff!! All were very kind and helpful. The hotel was very clean and luxurious. The location is absolutely perfect, close to all the hot spots of the city. Dont miss Catalana restaurant, ask from the reception where it is located. Try the city tour bus and visit Jofre boutique ;) If the breakfast is not included in your package go to Cornelia and Co right across the street, delicious!!! Thank you Majestic for making our stay unforgettable !",5,2012,11,15
11,Love this hotel,Great hotel in an excellent location with a terrific staff. The rooms are lovely with wonderful bedding and great bathrooms. The breakfast room is very nice and the food is beautifully presented . The bar off the lobby is restful but good people watching and with a pianist in the evening. Did not try the restaurant but went up to look at roof top bar and is awesome!  ,5,2012,11,15
11,"Majestic Hotel and Spa Residences, Paseo de Gracia","We were extremely happy with our choice of accomodation at Barcelona. The location was simply superb as it was centrally located and we could walk to La Ramblas, Plaza Catalunya and other major attractions in the area. The metro was located within a few meters of the hotel and there was a lovely pizzeria Cafe Brown down the road. The apartments are large and spacious and well furnished and had a lovely balcony which overlooked the Paseo de Gracia. 
Would highly recommend this place.",5,2012,11,15
11,"Great Location, great bathroom, comfy bed, charges for Internet.","I stayed at the Magestic for 4 days.  The first room we checked into was noisie because of construction so they happily moved us to a bigger room on a the 1st floor.   It was a very comfortable room with a great bathroom.   We didn't eat at the hotel, too many great eateries all over Barcelona.  The location was perfect, we walked all ovr the city & learned the transit system.  Great city and wonderful hotel.",4,2012,11,15
11,Looks nice but service is lacking,"This looks like a five star hotel but service is lacking. Check-in experience was cold and unpleasant. On arrival at 14:45, we were told room was not ready, even tho we'd called the day before to confirm our room would be ready for our early arrival. We were then told to wait at the bar for ""a half hour maximum."" After waiting an hour with nothing to do (no free wifi in the lobby) we asked again at the front desk, and a new staff was unaware that we were waiting for a room, had no idea who we were, then could not find the luggage they had stowed for us an hour earlier. No apologies, in fact they made us feel we were an inconvenience to them. And when they finally found a room ready, they demanded full payment for our stay in advance at check-in -- quite unexpected for a luxury hotel. A totally insulting and degrading experience.",2,2012,11,14
11,Vacation,"This Hotel it is very centrally located in one of the most well known boulevards in Barcelona very important to me it is the great service from some the staff who definetelly know what excellency is
I had a very big Dissapointment it was they do not have complimentary Wifi I had to go to near McDonalds where Wifi is free or to Sturbucks that give you a code for 45 minutes just to buy a coffee. While Majestic front desk agents told me the cost of 30€ with a list of sites. They do not offer any amenities for returning guests.Meaning to me that they believe that they deserves everything.My next visit to Barcelona I am considering to stay in another Hotel",3,2012,11,12
11,barcelona weekend,"Really enjoyed my trip, a lot to see and do, did a lot of walking and used the city tour buses a lot
Hotel Majestic (5 stars) was as expected comfortable, clean etc staff were excellent as well as friendly, watch out if you decide to have a drink on la Ramblas street (we were pre warned) but still got caught out paid 27 euros for a large lager and large sangria(felt like I was mugged)
however don't be put off by that, I found Barcelona to be a very laid back and friendly city and would definetly visit again best meal we had was the sea food paella at the Monchos restaurant in the the Olympic port area, alsa visited the Sagrada cathedral,  Gaudi park aquarium, lots of shops, restaurents etc cannot see everything in 3 days but overall a great weekend city break.",5,2012,11,11
11,Nice overall with a few disappointments,"The hotel is stylish and the premium class rooms spacious and nicely decorated.  The bathroom is stocked with Bulgari toiletries and the bathtub is huge.  You can't beat the location, which is within walking distance from all the best shops and beautiful Gaudi buildings.

However, I'm not giving it the five star rating because 1)average quality breakfast and 2)WIFI at a charge of 15 euros a day.",4,2012,11,08
11,Trip Saved,"My wife and I arrived in Barcelona and discovered the hotel that had been booked for us was unacceptable. The Majestic was given a good review in our Guide Book, so we called and were able to get a room. The staff was very accomodating and helpful. Because of the late booking we had to change rooms after the first night. The staff moved our bags to the new room the next day for us so we could spend the day sightseeing. This is an outstanding property and I highly recommend it. The room cost was also a bargain for the quality of the hotel.",5,2012,11,08
11,Excellent hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Majestic in August. After reading some extremely off putting reviews we were some what nervous of what to expect! The hotel was undergoing renovation, however we were not disturbed at all. We hardly noticed, apart from some painting in the lobby and scaffolding around the outside of the hotel. Overall the hotel was fantastic, food, rooms and quality of service! The hotel is in a great location and we will definitely be returning!!! Enjoy!",5,2012,11,06
11,"Excellent location,  Very Good hotel","let me start off by saying the very good in the title of my review is not a reflection of the hotels standard or level of service it indeed deserves it's 5 star rating I only said Very Good because compared to the Arts hotel I would say the majestic is Very good.

Alright so We stayed at the Majestic in Oct 24th and were there for 7 days. I booked the rooms through both external sites and the hotel's own website. I have to say I got a better deal from the hotel's website on a Junior Suite than the one I got from Booking.com so extra points to Majestic on that note.

So the pros and Cons of the Majestic, I will start with the Cons;

Cons;
1- Concierge doesn't seem to have a good list of restaurants, as every restaurant they sent us to was not good in terms of ambiance and food so I'm guessing they have a deal with certain restaurants. Also 2 of my friends tried to book a car through the hotel to take them to a function they were quoted one price one day and a different price the next day. So their concierge I would have to say is a bit dodgy.

2- the breakfast area in the first few days we were there was small with not a lot of choice, but that was temporary apparently (I will explain further in the Pros section). But I would have to say that their tea is just aweful during my whole stay I couldn't get a decent cup of tea (but apparently this is true of all of Barcelona, you cannot get a decent cup of tea)

Pros: 
1- The location the location the location I cannot say it enough the location you dead smack in the middle of everything and on one of the most important streets of Barcelona Passage De Gracia where you have not one but two of Gaudi's masterpiece houses.

2- The rooms The Rooms, I have to say that I was impressed by the size of the rooms while the rest of my family stayed in suites I was in a regular double room and the space was great in comparison to other city hotels where the rooms are tiny and cramped and actually we had a few friends staying at the Mandarin hotel just a block down from the Majestic and they mentioned that the suite their staying in is in fact smaller than my room so dnt worry about the room any room you get is spacious. but the view wasn't much.

3- The service, I have to say that the service is impecable though I mentioned the concierge in the cons the receptionists were great they directed us to good restaurants and were very helpful. The service during breakfast was also great and fast. all in all their service was great and always with a smile.

4- the breakfast area, so I know I mentioned it in the cons, the first few days we were having breakfast in the basement in a rather cramped area but apparently they were reconstructing a new area on the 1st floor which was a lot more spacious with more variety of food.

overall my stay at the Majestic was great I enjoyed it and I would definitely stay there again.

if you are going to Barcelona for the 1st time then the majestic is the perfect choice if you are looking for a hotel with a great location, great service and spacious rooms.",4,2012,11,05
11,The Majestic Opinion,"We stayed in this Hotel on the backside of a two week Med cruise late in September 2012 to explore Barcelona for a couple of days.  Let me start by saying, overall, this is a great hotel in a great location in Barcelona.  The staff is excellent.  The rooms are recently renovated and very accommodating.  We stayed two days and two nights.  Weird Thing/Red Flag - when we arrived at the hotel, they tried to get me to stay across the street at the ""Majestic Studio Apartments"".  So the particular room that we got was not a ""choice"" room or location in the hotel, probably because we were only staying two nights late in the week, which is also why we wanted all of the conveniences of the hotel proper.  Had we been staying for a longer period of time I would have tried getting relocated to a larger and better placed room.  As you can read in other reviews, the hotel is undergoing some renovations.  There was a stairway access less than 25 feet down the hallway from our room door.  Both days we stayed in this hotel, a jackhammer was being used in this stairwell starting at 8AM.  Starting at 7:15 AM you can hear the construction workers assembling in different areas where work is being performed at the hotel, getting ready to start their workday.  My wife and I were up early both days we were in Barcelona and leaving the hotel to sightsee, plus we were just off a very blissful 12 day cruise, so we did not care about the noise for the short time we were there.  Here is the warning - It was very loud and persistent - If we were staying in Barcelona for an extended stay on a destination trip, I would inquire about the state and completion of the repairs.  In Europe, everything takes ""forever"", so suffice it to say this could be going on for years.  Ask the questions directly when booking about the state of construction and if you are not an early riser - you may be best off staying elsewhere.  The only other annoying thing that I will comment on is internet access if you do not have your own device.  The business office for patrons of the hotel is downstairs from main reception, and they provide only one access code for you at a time to access the internet to print tickets (unless you purchase an internet package), requiring you to return to the front desk everytime you wish to access the internet.  If you get knocked offline - back up the steps, possibly wait in line if the front desk is busy, and back down.  If you are an American, and actually like the conveniences that America offers, little things like this may annoy you.  I am proud to be an American, but I like Europe, so sometimes I find myself in this place I call the ""European Twilight Zone"" of which this incident qualifies.  Europe is a ton of fun....but sometimes very different from what we are used to - part of the fun of travel!  Eventually I smiled, gave up and realized I was in the twilight zone - not worth the time investment.  The Hotel is beautiful in a european sort of way.  There are no ""Grand"" lobby's or huge gathering areas, in fact the walk from the front door through reception through the lobby to the elevators is probably less than 50 feet, but the hotel has a very distinctive feel about it that you will like if you like Europe.  There is a very cool rooftop spa/bar/pool which again, is not large, but very cool to be at as night settles over the city.  The bed was very comfortable.  The appointments in the room, especially the bathroom (according to my wife - Europe does bathrooms better than anywhere) and right down to your very own expresso machine.  Truly 5 star.  The location can't be beat if you are healthy and like to walk.  We are and do.  The La Rumbla is about a 15 minute walk away and the Gaudi attractions Casa Battlo, Casa Mila, and even Sagrada Familia are within walking distance if you have good weather and don't mind walking.  Park Guell required a 10 minute cab ride, but was well worth the fare.   (Casa Battlo is almost directly across the street from the Majestic).  This should also be said - the Majestic is in a very safe and desirable part of town.  We really enjoyed the area, and honestly, would stay at this hotel again.  New experiences are always fun, but some familiarity when abroad can put some quality into your time management and make available more experiences.  Again, this is a great hotel in a great location, and I'm glad I stayed at this hotel, and not in the Studio Apartment.  Just a little construction going on that they really don't care to talk about!  If you are up early and plan to get out - not a problem, if you plan to spend some time in the hotel because you are a late riser, you may want to investigate the Studio Apartment.",4,2012,11,03
11,BETTER THAN OUR LAST STAY,"My latest review of this hotel was in April 2012, and it was not very good.
I stayed in this hotel more than I can remember, and most stays were just fine.  My latest stay was in October, after the hotel was done with major reconstruction.  I stayed with my family in a junior suite, which was newly renovated and nicely appointed with clear views of Paseo De Gracia.  The hotel service improved some what from my last stay.  Breakfast  was excellent and the staff at the restaurant were very attentive.  I would recommend the Majestic for its wonderful location and nice rooms.",3,2012,11,01
11,Great place to stay in a great city,"My wife and I just returned from a five day trip to Barcelona, Spain. We stayed at the Majestic Hotel and could not have been more impressed with the location, the hotel service and the rooms. The Majestic has just completed a renovation; the lobby was beautiful and the rooms were updated very tastefully. The hotel set the stage for a terrific week in Barcelona.",5,2012,11,01
11,Under construction,Had heard wonderful things but the hotel is under repairs. They should tell you when you book. Currently not a good choice for a restful vacation. Did not tell us when we checked in. Construction noise stats in the morning. in addition elevators under repair. All and all - a bit disappointing.,3,2012,10,31
11,MAJESTIC IS THE RIGHT WORD,"Superb hotel - no better way to describe it. Rooms immaculate, service first rate, best breakfast I have experienced in many years of travelling - everything you could possible want to start your day - with excellent attentive waiters and waitresses. Front desk personnel helpful, pleasant and patient. Only a five minute walk to the Plaza de Catalunya at the top of La Rambla. Far enough away from the hustle bustle but within easy striking distance. A multitude of shops, restaurants and cafes on the doorstep. Find it hard to believe there is a better hotel in Barcelona",5,2012,10,29
11,Beware of misunderstandings,"I bought a 5 day package for my wife and I. It said ""apartment room only"". My travel agent, who had stayed at the hotel, thought it was at an annex ""new section"". We both thought it was some kind of suite with no meals. We were welcomed at the hotel, the facilities (internet, breakfast) were explained, the paperwork completed. Then we were ferried across Paseo de Gracia, half a block away to a ""residence"" - 5 apartments on a first floor with no onsite personell or facilities or maid service. An enormous apartment - large living room, gigantic kitchen, 2 bedrooms. Not what we needed which was an hotel room. No possibility to change - fully booked. The tone of the conversation led me to believe that this was not the first time this misunderstanding occurs. They did offer waiver of breakfast charge ( 25 euros per capita). Why a first class hotel such as this would allow itself to get into this kind of misunderstanding is beyond me. The breakfast was excellent.",3,2012,10,28
11,Great overall experience and terrific location.,"We spent four nights at the Majestic. The welcome was great from the curbside attention all the way to the room. Located closely to the center of the city, this is a terrific location to walk to most everything you might want to see.
The only downside to the hotel is that it has a very small dining room with a very limited menu which is not very interesting to many travelers from the US. The good news --- many, many tapa bars and restaurants within a few steps.
The downside to Barcelona is pickpocketing. BE AWARE, BE ON GUARD --- we were involved twice while there and carrying things in secure locations was the only thing that saved our valuables.",5,2012,10,27
11,A Romantic Weekend,"I just loved this hotel from the desecrate entrance to the wonderful service. This is a fantastic hotel within walking distance of all that Barcelona has to offer.
In addition they had a cigar room in which to relax and enjoy the finest cuba has to offer I can wait to go back.",5,2012,10,25
11,An impressive hotel - in a prime location!,"We were very impressed with the hotel and staff. The rooftop terrace allowed us to see wonderful views of Barcelona.  The staff was very accommodating and helpful.  In walking distance to Casa Balto and Port Vell if you are interested in fine architecture.  I would definitely stay at Majestic again...

---M&D",5,2012,10,24
11,Fine old lady in an idea location,"We stayed 4 nights here recently on an extended weekend break. The location was ideal for exploring Barcelona, steps away from many locations and the rooftop bar & pool you can see the Sagrada Familia, sea and most of the city around you. The rooms are well appointed and excellently sound-proofed (we only realised we had a very noisy neighbour when their door opened!). The hotel had made a mistake in giving us 2x doubles instead of 1x double & 1x twin as confirmed. They instantly upgraded one room to a twin suite across the hall from our son's double room at no cost and without our even having to return to the front desk. There was a large business meeting group in the hotel the last two nights, and we honestly didn't notice anything beyond their standing outside waiting for their tour bus!

The main shopping areas are around the hotel, as are excellent restaurants and tapas bars.",5,2012,10,20
11,Beautiful hotel at a perfect location,"This is most certainly a 5 star hotel! Great service, very friendly and helpful staff. I had a junior suite which was very clean, spacious and had a terrific bathroom, I really loved the shower. It was one of these big rain shower head and combined with a very good water pressure, made showering an extremely relaxing experience. Indeed, as some other people mentioned, they charge for the coffee capsules. It is just 1 Euro, but still, it gives the wrong signal altogether and is somehow out of sink with the rest. They were certainly not stingy with anything else, the amount and quality of the shampoos, shower gels etc was far better than any other hotel I've ever stayed in, so why charge for a silly little cup of coffee? The roof terrace is lovely and offers beautiful views and the breakfast buffet offered all I could possibly have wanted and more. I would certainly recommend this hotel any time.",5,2012,10,14
11,Very pleasantly surprised and satisfied.,"This is a five star hotel in my opinion. Wonderful staff and our room was just lovely. A marble bathroom with a rainshower as well as a hand appliance, very roomy as well.
We had a sitting room with a flat screen TV as well as a very comfortable bed in the generous bedroom with another large flat screen TV.  If we should return to Barcelona this is where we'd stay, no questions asked. You just can't go wrong.",5,2012,10,12
11,Fabulous,"We just returned from Barcelona where we ended a cruise.  We spent 4 nights after the cruise in Barcelona at the Majestic.  It was one of the loveliest hotels I've ever stayed at.  We were off our cruise by about 8:30 in the morning, tired from a late night prior.  We got to the hotel around 10 and they checked us in immediately to an upgraded room.  The staff was fabulous.  Everyone we encountered was kind and helpful.  Got a great reommendation for dinner from the doorman, who actually went into the hotel and called the restaurant to tell them we were coming.  Breakfast is really good and they will do ""special""orders if their good assortment of food isn't what you want.   Also, it's a great location.   We walked almost everywhere from there.  Also used the hop on hop off tour bus, which stops 2 blocks from the hotel.  And cabs are pretty cheap.   All in all a GREAT stay.",5,2012,10,11
11,Expensive but ...,"We had requested an ""accessible"" room, or at least a room with a shower rather than a tub.  When we arrived, we had to wait in the lobby over six hours before one became available!
On our last night, there was a horrible smell in the room.  We complained, and the staff apologetically told us that a paint job was in progress immediately below us.  They brought up an air purifier, but even by the next morning some of the smell lingered.
Otherwise the room was quite luxurious...",2,2012,10,10
11,Just Okay.,"Very nice location and decor but the food was terrible!  They put me in a room by a firescape with a view of a construction zone....I don't think so!  Changed rooms with a street view not bad.  room amenities were nice, shower was heavenly.  ordered breakfast asked for egg whites (omg)!  I received a white mound of pebbles the size of a grapefruit!  I only got part of my breakfast and had to ask about the rest of it!  They brought it up soon after, I asked about the questionable eggs, the wait staff said were just simple people, ""then charge simple prices"". ( I didn't say it but I was thinking it!  I think it was 40 bucks for breakfast.  Overall, impressed with hotel, not a fan of service or food.",3,2012,10,10
11,Adequate business hotel let down by the little things.,"This is my second visit to the Majestic, located in the centre of Barcelona.  It is an adequate business hotel but it is let down by a few simple things that could be easily solved. Here we go...

Internet is expensive (Kubi wireless) and it doesn't allow you to be logged on with more than one device at a time. I had my iPad running and needed my laptop to work - couldn't do it. 5 star hotel MUST offer free wifi to justify the prices and in the public areas at least.

My room was small, noisy with an equally small bathroom. Two nights was plenty.

Breakfast is a disgrace. Again for 5 stars this hotel offers the most basic standard selection in a crowded, stuffy room. Really disappointing.

Finally, this is Barcelona. Party city. What are they doing shutting the lobby bar at 0130!?!? All we wanted was a beer and we had to order room service. Dull.

In defence, the staff are very nice and the bed was comfortable.",3,2012,10,10
11,Great location,Stayed in Majestic in September for 3 nights. First time in Barcelona. On arrival at the hotel we found the reception staff quite friendly. Got to our room which was small but everything there.  We had only been in the room for 15 minutes when we started to cough.  The room was so dusty from the work being carried out to the hotel and when we looked out through the window it was like a bomb site with the air conditioning unit in the middle of it.  We decided to ask for a different room as we were finding it difficult to breath. We went to reception and there we found a very unfriendly receptionist who never once apologised.  We stayed put until we got another room on the 3rd floor still looking out on the bomb site but it was a lot better.  We did not use the airconditioning because that was how the dust was getting into the room.  I feel it is totally unacceptable that a 5* hotel charges for tea and coffee in the room and there is no free internet. Great location but no way would I stay here again or recommend it.,3,2012,10,08
11,Lovely hotel!,"We stayed here for 1 night in the end of September before embarking on a cruise.  When we checked in the hotel, we were upgraded to a beautiful suite with a balcony that faced the front of the hotel.  We were escorted to the suite by a very friendly young lady and she showed us all the amenities.  It had 1-1/2 bathrooms and a separate living room and bedroom.  The suite was very comfortable and we slept well.  We had the hotel's buffet breakfast and it is held in a room in the basement of the hotel.  There were lots of food choices but I would have enjoyed it more in a room with windows.  All in all--a very nice hotel!!",4,2012,10,08
11,Great Hotel!,"Spend 1 week At Majestic Hotel and it was great! 10-15 minutes by foot to Plaça de Catalunya and 1 minute to the metro station. The room was very nice, a big TV, a big bathroom. We had a room with view at a small street, so no noise. The only problem with the room is that it is very small. Al least the one in which we stayed in. And the elevators are slow. 
Everybody in the Hotel speaks English! For me, the stuff was the best!",4,2012,10,08
11,a great central place to be in Valencia,"the apartments are fabulous, like having a condo in Barcelona for a week.  Wonderful hotel all around.  I left items behind, they were sent to me in Valencia in 2 days.  Metro and buses very handy. The Metro is very easy to use. Concierge superb. They got us fabulous tickets for a FC Barcelona game, and for a superb spanish guitar concert at the Palau de Musica.",5,2012,10,07
11,Grand hotel with a lack of atmosphere but in good location,"I stayed here for one night with my friend. Great location on Passeig de Gracia, near the Gaudi houses and fab shops etc. The lobby is very underwhelming as are the communal areas, I expected to be more wowed! The room was ok - a bit nondescript but fine. the bathroom was glorious however! Wow! There was a Nespresso machine, but then we were charged for using it!!! Also no free Wifi, which is poor in a 5*. 

The rooftop terrace had lovely views but the pool was tiny! I felt the photos had been a bit misleading. I had a massage and facial in the Spa from a girl called Mereia, which was absolutely AMAZING!!!! The spa was small but lovely staff, I would visit the spa again if in Barcelona. 

I think this is a hotel for older European/Middle Eastern and business customers, it is not much fun for a younger visitor.",3,2012,10,07
11,A 'Majestic' Hotel,"Stayed here 2 nights in September.  Hotel at present is undergoing major refurbishment work affecting dining areas and roof top pool and a number of the rooms.   Therefore cannot give a true picture.  At present the dining room is small and cramped while this refurbishment goes on and same applies to poolside area for sunbathing.  However, this did not detract from our excellent stay.  A 5 star property with 5 star service which was never obtrusive.  Pleasantly surprised that bar snacks were quite reasonable.  Room though slightly old fashioned was a good size and bed comfortable.  Our room also had a large balcony wth sunbeds.  Hotel is very centrally located with metro stops very close by.

Only niggles  - the hotel provides an expresso coffee making machine in room but then charge for the 'coffee pods' that you need to use - so no free coffee making facilities.  No free wifi either throughout the hotel except in the business centre where you can gain access for up to 30 min.  But this was complicated and didn't particularly work.  For a hotel of this standard and price I would have expected these two items to be complimentary.  Once refurbishment is complete the hotel should be stunning in the meantime reception areas, dining, and pool are somewhat compromised for space.",4,2012,10,03
11,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed here for a 3 night city break and the hotel was superb. Came armed with my English-Spanish phrase book but did not need it as the reception, concierge and bar staff all understood and spoke English very well. The room was immaculate, the bed was very comfortable and the batroom extremely well appointed.  Perfectly located, there was sufficient of interest within walking distance to fully occupy 3 days of sight-seeing with no need for public transport or taxis.  Lots of excellent Tapas bars and restaurants within a stone's throw of the hotel and both the piano bar and the roof-top bar were perfect for having a final night cap before retiring to our lovely room.",5,2012,10,03
11,Very nearly perfect,"The Majestic in Barcelona is, as the title suggests, very nearly perfect.  From a warm and efficient welcome to an easy checkout it combined the pride of a job well done, which seems to be the norm in Catalonia, with a genuine interest in its guests.  It clearly deserves its five stars.",5,2012,10,02
11,Luxury experience,"Excellent, a very pleasant experience, retain the essence of luxury service as always, comfortable facilities and modern services but without losing Majestic style. Highly recommended and will definitely return.",5,2024,10,14
11,Family celebration at Majestic Hotel & Spa Barcelona,"We celebrated a family occasion with a custom-made menu in the Majestic’s new private rooms. The lounges, accessible from the main floor, are newly renovated and the atmosphere is elegant, and the waiters were attentive with us. My father is going to evaluate him for a company theme, as they also do corporate events. Nandu Jubany’s gastronomy we loved, we already knew it and it is assured success. The team helped me create a menu adapted to special diets. Thank you so much for taking care of us!",5,2024,10,14
11,Exceptional,"We were at the restaurant brunch on Sunday. The quality of the product, the variety and the attention of the staff have been unbeatable.
Both the terrace and the indoor lounge are very cozy and beautiful, plus all the brunch enlivened with live music",5,2024,10,06
11,Good memories in Barcelona,"The other day a friend asked me about hotel recommendations in Barcelona and I remembered my stay at the Majestic. The best hotel in Barcelona. Pro service and excellent location. We will return safely, I recommend it for Trips as a couple or family.",5,2024,10,06

11,Excellent service and quality,"Excellent treatment and very careful with the details, highly recommended.  We liked the spacious room and variety on the menu for both breakfast, lunch and dinner.

11,Very good experience,"I really enjoyed the experience. The hotel was beautiful, and the spa allowed us to spend great times and is very complete. The overall facilities are 1 ten and the staff was super attentive throughout the stay.

11,Second stay!!! We will definitely repeat!!!,"We stayed more than two years ago and did not hesitate to repeat!!!

No doubt all the staff make you feel special from the moment the doorman meets you until when he accompanies you back to the taxi when you leave.

Our children were amazed by the details Marcelo prepared for them on arrival and all his charm and affection during the days we were there.

The breakfast is spectacular and it is mandatory not to miss it any day!!

We saw the reform they have done in fitness and Wellness with a pool area with adapted hours for children. Definitely an oasis of rest after visiting the city.

The terrace has also been renovated and remains wonderful with amazing views of the Sagrada Familia. On the menu they keep Ferrero ice cream and Majestic Cake. Of course you have to try them are delicious!!!!

The rooms are spacious and spacious and in the turndown service put a sample of natura bisse hand cream, a detail that is appreciated at night. The bathtubs are amazing!!! Some rooms have separate shower which is appreciated when traveling with children.

Caesar of concierge made us very good recommendations adapted to go with the family and very successful!!! It is noticeable that the selection of staff take great care to have such an exquisite staff in the hotel.

We have been delighted once again and it certainly lives up to its name!!!

Highlight Jordi and Felipe for their continuous smile every morning attention to children 

Congratulations on keeping the hotel so beautiful and current with excellent staff and the essence of the Majestic!!!

Thank you!!! We hope to be back soon!!",5,2024,07,25
11,Rooftop Bar,We had dinner at the rooftop bar and the food and views were fantastic. Elias served us and was really great. Always happy to come back! I also have a lactose intolerance and they customized all the food for me. Thank you very much. It was really delicious.,5,2024,07,20
11,The best hotel for a luxurious stay in Barcelona,"The hotel is located in the best street of Barcelona, strategically located in a barycentric position with respect to all the best attractions.
Fantastic breakfast and one of the most elegant roof terraces in Barcelona for an aperitif.
Rooms with everything a five-star hotel requires.
Very courteous service.",5,2024,07,19
11,Majestic ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,"Hotel Majestic has everything, location, food and top facilities, we were super comfortable during our stay.
The rooms are comfortable and spacious. Overall the staff is friendly. Breakfast is very varied with options for all tastes. The roof top has an evident view and tapas and drinks are good. 
Majestic will be my Hotel of choice for future visits to Barcelona",5,2024,07,19
11,Pleasurable Stay,"From the time we arrived until we left it was an excellent experience, the staff attentive, respectful and helpful.",5,2024,07,17
11,Good experience,"It is not ideal as a brunch, because there are sections that you can choose and there are sections that you can not, in itself it is not a buffet in shape, but saved by people, it is extraordinary and extremely friendly, from when you are received until you leave they make you feel at home",4,2024,07,14
11,Excellent!,"I would definitely return to this hotel, the food is delicious in the restaurant, terrace and bar. 
The service of all the staff is excellent, they are always attentive to your needs.
Super comfortable and very nice rooms.",5,2024,07,05
11,Terrible experience with two girls under 3,"We arrived at 3am as AVE RENFE suffered a delay. Despite having two girls under 2 years old there was no empathy with us and we were not given the room that had been booked through the BCD TRAVEL agency in Colombia (double deluxe overlooking Paseo de Gracia). In the end, at 4 am we were given a simple internal room and had to spend two nights completely horned. 

In addition, the lady who attended us, unwillingly and with little level of service, the first thing she did was sell the city of Barcelona very badly, referring contemptuous to the possibility that she was going to steal our watches.

Sadly BCN was full the fds and I could not book the Hotel Condes to leave their hotel. We were NEVER treated with empathy, we were left MURDERED with the two daughters, two makeshift cots and a small double bed (the only thing was that we changed the room to one with views but the same simple only with 1 bed). 

Unfortunate and terrible experience.

Mr. Director, at a time when pet animals are treated better than child human beings, it was no wonder that, despite showing the documentation showing the reservation made with the inclusion of my two baby daughters, NO ONE from your front desk was patronizing or empathetic to us, not even arriving at 3am at check in. We will not return to your Hotel and are extremely disappointed with the use of reason by your staff in the field. Not a single drop of common sense, moreover, we were a reserve of 16 ... in a few moments we will publish, each one, our (dismal) experience on Tripadvisor and other ratings. 

Hopefully this will improve, however I doubt it, because they had 4 nights to make amends and not even with giving us breakfast courtesy end understand why not be empathetic with young children.",2,2024,07,02

11,Waste of time,"We wanted to have a drink on the Roof top
At 4:30 p.m. 

They told us that it was reserved for guests.

Some foreign girls (who were not hotel guests) allowed them to enter in front of us.

The conclusion is: If they do not want people from outside the hotel to go up to the Roof top or Dolce Vitae Terrace... why do they allow keyless access to the elevator?

They were Brazilian and we were from Girona.",1,2024,05,30
11,"Majestic and crack-free, the best possible location","We had been there before but it got better with time
Fantastic location!!!!!

11,A pleasure in all the senses,"We went on the tapa tour with some friends and we loved both their tapas offering and the wine pairing, although we would have loved for the wines to be from somewhere in Catalonia, for example Penedés which has very good wines, of course I want to highlight the attention from Edurne who was charming and very professional!!",5,2024,05,25
11,HORRIBLE ROOM,"We have been other times and it was very good and the location is excellent, but on this occasion they gave us a room that, in addition to being a cellar, made it impossible to sleep due to the noise of the extraction machines that must have been nearby.",1,2024,05,18

 very helpful staff.
Excellent home automation, spacious rooms, very nice bathrooms, abundant breakfast.

11,A unique experience,"My stay at the Majestic Hotel in Barcelona was unforgettable, totally recommended and worth repeating without the slightest doubt. The rooms are spacious, bright and fully equipped. The attention is professional and close at the same time, for me that combination is perfect when you settle in a place. The Gourmet Brunch was exquisite whether you like sweet or savory, although it should be noted that the desserts were incomparable. In addition, you have given me an idea to give as a gastronomic experience with the SOLC Gourmet Brunch for a Sunday plan.

Many thanks for everything. I will definitely repeat in the summer to enjoy the roftoop and the pool as it deserves, because with those views, once is not enough!",5,2024,05,15
11,A perfect plan,"My experience at the Majestic Hotel in Barcelona was simply unforgettable, and I have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone looking for an exceptional place to stay. The rooms are spacious, bright and fully equipped, I had to telework for a few hours and it did not cause any inconvenience.

The service is impeccable, very professional and friendly at the same time. You feel welcome and cared for at all times throughout your stay. The gourmet brunch was a true delight, with both sweet and savory options, although I must emphasize that the dessert for me was exceptional.

Furthermore, thanks to this experience, I have discovered an excellent gift idea: SOLC's gourmet brunch, a perfect gastronomic experience to enjoy on a Sunday. Many thanks for everything!

Without a doubt, I plan to return in the summer to fully enjoy the rooftop and the pool. See you soon!",5,2024,05,14
11,"Excellent stay, kindness and response from the hotel team, and excellent cleanliness in the room and throughout the hotel","Excellent hotel located in Paso de Gracia, where you have everything at hand (coffee shops, car rental half a block from the hotel, shops, subway line, etc)... The hotel team is always very friendly and attentive to your needs. the stay is pleasant. Cleanliness in the rooms excellent, food and drinks excellent. Parking 45 euros per day, however the hotel is surrounded by cheaper parking lots, so vehicle issues are not a problem. Plaza Calatunya is an 8-minute walk from the hotel, Casa Batlo is 3 minutes away, and El Nacional is 5 minutes away. I recommend it for location and services near the hotel (coffee shops, shops, car rental, restaurants, metro stop, etc.). Without a doubt it would be my first option to stay in Barcelona.",5,2024,05,11
11,Tradition meets present,"A hotel in the city center with charm from times gone by. We felt very comfortable in the traditionally furnished hotel. It exudes luxury and elegance, right in the city center. Many sights can be reached on foot, and directly opposite the hotel is Gáudi's former home, which is worth a visit. 
The rooms are a reasonable size and nicely furnished. We didn't find the view of the next building very appealing, but who looks out the window all day? We were compensated for that by the very extensive breakfast selection. 
The hotel's roof terrace is a special treat. In the evening, it invites you to linger after sightseeing with a wonderful view of Barcelona - you can't enjoy a glass of wine any better.
All in all, a clear ""yes"" to the hotel - very expensive, but justified!",5,2024,05,11
11,Excellent,"Everything was fine except for the incident in the room which was later fixed.
Everything else very good.",5,2024,05,06
11,Disappointed,"I have stayed in this hotel several times and have always returned because the treatment has always been up to five star standards. Not this last time when at the reception at check in they greeted us with an air of arrogance and assigned a disappointing, sad, old and dirty privilege room which is why we were forced to ask for an upgrade. I don't think I will return",3,2024,05,02
11,Spectacular,A hotel with an unbeatable location. The attention of all the staff was incredibly helpful and friendly. The room is spacious and very comfortable. Everything excellent,5,2024,05,01

Recommended, we will definitely return.",5,2024,04,04
11,Home Sweet Home,"Very good Hotel. They just have to prepare for an arrogant person to welcome them to the hotel! (Reception) but I think it's a matter of luck! Afterwards everything divine! The service of Concierge César is spectacular, his recommendations, the guys from Relation Guest two of them! Very divine!!",4,2024,03,29

11,EXQUISITE TREATMENT. EXCELLENT LOCATION,"I had been eating a few years ago at their magnificent restaurant Drolma on a couple of occasions, sadly gone. I have not stayed at the hotel, since I live in Barcelona.
I had the opportunity to go with some friends a couple of days ago to taste some dishes and pastries at the annual celebration of the ""passeig dels gourmets"" in which some restaurants and hotels on Paseo de Gracia collaborate.
I have been staying and meeting in different high-end hotels around the world for years and on few occasions have I felt as well treated as we were on this occasion when our personal expense was not going to be more than 30 euros.
A rule of large hotels is that you don't know who you are dealing with and you must serve your clients equally. Congratulations to the hotel management for the professional and careful attention, both at the reception and in the bar at the Majestic, which we were able to compare with the disastrous experience suffered a while later at the Mandarin or the Claris...",5,2024,03,16
11,High level gastronomic experience in Barcelona,"Excellent lunch/brunch with tasting menu starting with an Aperol spritz and champagne accompanied by an exquisite delicate and tasty appetizer.

11,The Spa is on another level,"I was in the hotel SPA. From the arrival of the reception, the entrance to the SPA always with a smile, kindness, warmth, smiles. Daniela, the masseuse, HAS MAGIC HANDS! She was always attentive to my comfort during the session, very professional and was very attentive to the back pain that I indicated. I told him at the beginning to promise me that he would leave there floating on a cloud and he kept it. In the end they offered me tea and recommendations to, in my case, improve my posture.

I would return as many times as necessary. excellent service",5,2024,02,26
11,WONDERFUL BRUNCH,"We enjoyed brunch last weekend. The food was of the highest quality, and the service impeccable.

It is my favorite hotel. This time I stayed in the Majestic suite and it is truly paradise. The entire staff (and I mean, really the entire hotel staff) goes out of their way to make you feel happy. Thanks thanks. Thanks to Pascal and everyone for caring so much and making my mom's birthday such a special moment. Thank you for so generously correcting minor misunderstandings and for caring so much. I will never be able to thank you in fair measure for so much warmth. And special thanks to the driver who came to pick us up/take us to the airport. A delight to talk with people so cultured and versed in history and literature. It was really a pleasure. Thank you. See you next year.",5,2024,02,11

11,A VERY SPECIAL HOTEL EXPERIENCE,"Everything was good, both the accommodation and the complementary services. Perhaps they should improve clarity in billing, with clearer and more understandable concepts. The famous tax always attracts attention. When will they remove it? Do the guests of the Majestic Hotel bother the city?",5,2024,01,18

11,Wonderful experience,"We stayed at this hotel with my wife and son, and the experience was wonderful.

The staff pampered us and treated us like royalty throughout our stay. We ate at the Solc restaurant, everything was delicious and the service impeccable.

At night, coming with a small child, we opted to have dinner in the room ordering Room Service and go to bed early, and the truth is that it was like being in a restaurant in the room. The menu was very complete and there were several options for children, we really enjoyed it.

The room was spacious and comfortable, the bed was dreamy, and the little details (like a mini bathrobe they brought us for our little one) made all the difference.

We will recommend and repeat!",5,2024,01,11

11,Pension management,"Very nice hotel, even if partially renovated. Large and comfortable room, but with the management of the internal temperature, incomprehensible.
Reception located in an unobtainable position and without indications.
Although 5 stars, beds were poorly made and rooms were not serviced in the evening.
Breakfast room too small compared to the number of guests, with endless queues to have the right to a table, to the point that on 01.01, having an appointment, we had to give it up
Poor quality of breakfast both in terms of savory, sweet and drink items.
In short, given the vast competing offer, we won't go back.",1,2024,01,01
11,Scam. SCAM.,"Bad experience. Five stars only the price. Room without maintenance, old mattress that sinks, even cloudy tap water!!! I have photos. Incredible. I had a company dinner, which they also charged as if it were a five-star hotel. Poor quality food, very cheap supermarket wines, the water shuts off at midnight and the bathrooms are disgusting. When I show the staff the photos of the room and the water with which I was supposed to brush my teeth in the morning, they only offer me breakfast there in compensation. How could I want to have breakfast in such a horrible place? On top of that, I explain to them that I'm in a hurry because I have to go to work and they waste my time with empty apologies and delays in returning the hundred euros they charge you as a deposit. Terrible experience at Majestic!",1,2023,12,25
11,Best rooftop in Bcn,"We went to the rooftop to have a few drinks and eat, the service was incredible, Marco from Venezia took great care of us! 10/10 always attentive, we would return with all the
Taste of the world, and we will do it! In addition to the service, the view that this rooftop presents is a must when coming to Bcn!",5,2023,12,18
11,Comfort in the middle of Barcelona,"The staff was very friendly, the facilities were very nice, the rooms were perfect...the breakfast was a luxury.
Perhaps the only drawback is that they put a bottle of water on the table, I thought it would be included in the price of the room but no...that doesn't seem right to me to be honest...but hey...it was only €14",5,2023,12,05
11,Always Majestic,"The experience has been magnificent. Feeling at home in a 5* hotel is not easy. The perfect room. The front office team is very decisive and attentive at all times (Ms. Susana, thank you very much!). The service of all the staff at the Majestic Hotel is wonderful and very professional, led by Mr. Billard. The eggs Benedict for breakfast are a delight. I think the roof top is the best in Barcelona.",5,2023,11,03
11,We will repeat for sure,"Wonderful experience at the Majestic Hotel in Barcelona.
The beautiful room with views of Paseo de Gracia. All the attentive and super nice staff, especially Linda at breakfast and Franco on the terrace, treated us wonderfully.
Elegant and timeless decoration. The atmosphere of the bar is reminiscent of the 40s, we spent the afternoon having some cocktails listening to the piano. It was difficult to leave the hotel even though we were going to see Madonna at the Palau San Jordi.",5,2023,11,03

11,torture,"We arrived at the hotel around 2:30 p.m. and they informed us that the room was not ready yet, we accepted the situation, we would have liked to freshen up after the trip and they offered us the SPA. But of course, opening the suitcases, to change clothes, and take a shower, didn't seem comfortable to me. I did emphasize that we wanted 2 beds on a high floor, to which they replied that it was no problem, that it was room 807 and it would be ready when we returned after the game. We returned from the game with just enough time and found that the room had been changed to 206 (the hotel acknowledged that it was the worst they had) and it was still not ready (the two beds together). I complained and the response was that it was the only one left. Since I had just enough time to go out to dinner I had to change while an army of 5 people tidied up the room. The reason for asking for a high floor is because I am clautrophobic, when I saw the views from the window, I began to feel the sensation, which I tried to counteract with medication and turning the air conditioning to the minimum (I even thought about leaving the hotel). that has given us a cold. The next day we were waiting for the transfer that would take us to the airport, we notified the reception, and seeing that it was delayed, we requested the service, to which they told us that it had been at the door since the agreed time and that he had come in to inform the reception and They told him we weren't there. We took this trip with another couple who told them that we were on the same floor (they were on the eight hundred and thirty something) and they even had some welcome gift. In our room the detail was that the Kleenex box was empty and they had put one on top to hide it.",1,2023,10,30

I called the Hotel and Richard from Uruguay helped me! He literally told me to return immediately that the Majestic Hotel will provide you with accommodation and help with everything necessary for your well-being.

11,Un potenziale 5,"La posizione è da 5, la colazione anche da 6, credo una delle più ricche mai viste in hotel di questa categoria. Tuttavia tre elementi mi hanno indotto ad abbassare drasticamente il giudizio:1) al momento del check out c'è stato un errore nel conto di ben 200 euro, peraltro non extra ma sulla quotazione della camera. Errori del genere sono imperdonabili oltre che antipatici  e peraltro abbiamo atteso venti minuti prima di vedere riconosciute le nostre ragioni ...pur avendo mostrato loro la mail di prenotazione con il dettaglio dei costi ...2) camera piccola e antiquata, parquet usurato e pulizia sommaria (capelli e altro lasciati sul pavimento nonostante la doppia pulizia giornaliera), 3) poca cordialità del personale.

11,Espectacular!,"Nos alojamos en diciembre durante el puente con motivo de nuestro aniversario y fue una experiencia única.
Llegamos al atardecer y la llegada nos enamoró con la excelente ubicación en Paseo de Gracia y espectacular decoración de navidad de la fachada.
El edificio es único en toda la avenida y sin duda destaca en todo el Paseo de Gracia. Si la decoración de navidad exterior es bonita la del interior es mágica llena de lucecitas y detalles. Te sientes como en un cuento de Disney!!!
Al entrar nos recibió el portero muy atento y nos acompañó hasta el mostrador.
 El equipo de recepción y conserjería fueron todos súper amables a la llegada y con excelentes recomendaciones de la ciudad, de restaurantes y mercadillos de navidad.

Al acompañarnos a la habitación nos explicaron toda la historia del hotel y destacaron algunas de las obras de arte que posee. Es como un museo y visita obligada en Barcelona. Sin duda hay que visitarlo!!!

La habitación tenia un balcón con una balaustrada preciosa y unas vistas privilegiadas a todo el paseo de Gracia decorado de Navidad. Nos habían preparado una sorpresa a la llegada con una decoración de globos y pétalos de rosa por el paquete romántico que habíamos comprado con botella de champagne y un espectacular Majestic Cake, el pastel de chocolate que sin duda se ha convertido en nuestro favorito para toda la vida!!!!!!

Y para acabar no os podéis perder el desayuno!!!! Creo que les han dado un premio al Mejor Desayuno y sin duda se lo merecen!!!! La sala exterior es preciosa e ideal pero el servicio de desayuno , pero el surtido, la calidad y selección de los productos de verdad que es único e inmejorable !!!! Hemos estado en La Mamounia en Marrakeck, en el Savoy de Londres, en el Hotel du Palais de Biarritz y ninguno de ellos lo supera….

Antes de marchar nos dimos un capricho y reservamos unos tratamientos en el spa con la zona de hidroterapia. Está todo reformado y es súper acogedor y cálido, pero lo mejor son las manos de Ana la terapeuta!!!!! Yo me hice un facial kobido y mi pareja un masaje y lo mismo,  ningún otro hotel supera la profesionalidad de las personas que trabajan en él!!!!

Nos quedamos con las ganas de visitar la terraza ya que nos habían hablado de las espectaculares vistas a la sagrada familia y a la ciudad 360 grados, pero tendremos que volver!!!!

Lo dicho, visita obligada en Barcelona y excelente regalo para escapada en pareja o regalo de Navidades!!!!",5,2022,12,16
11,Hotel divino comida mala,"De tres noches que me hospede con ellos, dos días me desperte con el ruido de taladros y martillazos por renovaciones que seguro estaban haciendo.

No aceptable para un hotel de esta categoría y costo.

11,Sehr gemischter Eindruck Optisch ist das Majestic ein klassisches Top-Hotel in bester Lage direkt neben Chanel,"Wir reisten als Gruppe von 20 Paaren. Der Check in klappte reibungslos. Schnell waren die Zimmer bezogen. Das Zimmer 840 war ganz hübsch und von der Größe her komfortabel. Es gab zwei recht kleine Dachflächenfenster mit Milchglasscheiben, das machte mich stutzig. Nachdem ich die Klimaanlage wegen des Rauschens ausgeschaltet hatte, der Geräuschpegel jedoch so laut blieb, war mir klar, dass die undurchsichtigen Scheiben den Blick auf die Lüftungsrohre verbarg. Ich hatte glücklicherweise Ohrstöpsel im Gepäck, die meinen Nachtschlaf gerettet haben. 
Ich habe durchaus Verständnis für die Herausforderungen, die eine technische Anpassung der historischen Bausubstanz an heutige Ansprüche, mit sich bringen, aber das hat den Gesamteindruck des Hauses doch ziemlich getrübt. Die Lage des Hotels ist toll. Wunderschön sitzt man auf der Dachterrasse mit Blick auf die Sagrada Familia bei einem Sundowner oder Nightcap.
Dass bei unserem ersten Frühstück die Information, dass das Frühstück bereits bezahlt war, nicht vorlag, ist ärgerlich, aber kommt öfter mal vor.
Das Frühstück bot eine große Auswahl in guter Qualität. Eierspeisen wurden auf Bestellung zum Tisch gebracht. Ein guter Start in den Tag.
Fazit: Ein sehr schönes Hotel für den großen Geldbeutel. Das nächste Mal würde ich Zimmer 840 nicht beziehen.",3,2022,10,04
11,Estadía perfecta,"Tanto las instalaciones, habitaciones, ropa de blanco, salones y restaurantes de primer nivel, sumado a un excelente atención, amable alegre y resolutiva.
Hemos estado en una suite para tres personas y unos días más tarde en los departamentos situados enfrente. Ambos, aún siendo alojamientos distintos, valen cada euro pagado",5,2022,09,11
11,Una verdadera gema en el centro de Barcelona,"El Hotel Majestic 5*GL, ubicado increíblemente bien en pleno centro de Barcelona y rodeado de las mejores tiendas y boutiques de lujo, es una gran elección para alojarse y disfrutar de la ciudad. 

Las habitaciones son preciosas y realmente acogedoras, la cama muy cómoda así como la terraza que tuvimos en nuestra habitación con vistas al Paseo de Gracia.

Los servicios del hotel son muy buenos, ofrecidos con los altos estándares de LHW de manera muy profesional. Me encantaría destacar el riquísimo desayuno, nadie que se aloje en el hotel puede irse sin probarlo, todo lo que pueda decir se queda corto en cuanto a la exquisita decoración, la variedad del buffet y las opciones que tienen aparte, sin pasar por alto el gran equipo que trabaja en el mismo, ya que son TODOS muy atentos.

Tuvimos tiempo también de hacer una parada en el spa del hotel, donde Nuria nos atendió muy amablemente y educada. Después de estar todo el día recorriendo Barcelona, lo recomiendo mucho para relajarse, así como tomarse algo en la terraza del hotel y contemplar las vistas de toda la ciudad.

Solo puedo decir, que desde el momento en el que llegamos al hotel, todo fueron mimos y detalles por parte del personal, empezando por Sofía que nos hizo el check in y nos recibió con una sonrisa.
Estamos deseando volver, y sin duda repetiríamos quedándonos en el Majestic.",5,2022,08,23
11,Estancia inolvidable.,Presentación exquisita del buffet desayuno y el menú cena aunque excelente muy poco variado. Personal muy amable. Estancia limpia si bien no pueden haber manchas en la moqueta de la habitación. Consideraría ofrecer parking gratuito.,5,2022,08,22
11,Una verdadera delicia. El hotel está ubicado en una esquina privilegiada.,"A unos pasos de la casa Batlló. Y en la calle paralela a Rambla de Catalunya. 

Todo el fue personal sumamente amable desde que llegamos hasta que partimos. 

El Retaurante ubicado en el primer piso, es bellísimo, tanto la sección interior como la exterior. La comida deliciosa. 

El bar que se encuentra en el roof top donde también está la alberca, tiene una vista increíble. 

El SPA 100% recomendable. 

Definitivamente una excelente opción para hospedarse en Barcelona. 

El hotel es per friendly y los detalles para las mascotas también se hacen presentes.",5,2022,07,24

11,"Definitivamente, el mejor hotel de Europa, no sólo de España","Bueno, por dónde empezar... yo siempre me hospedo en los mejores hoteles (Plaza Athénée, Bristol, Four Seasons) pero el Majestic me ha sorprendido muy gratamente. Llevó las cosas a otro nivel. ¡Qué detalle, qué calidad! No dejamos de sorprendernos a cada minuto de la belleza y el trabajo puesto en cad detalle. Me hospedé en la Suite Majestic y no pude haber elegido mejor: terraza propia, jacuzzi al aire libre, jacuzzi en uno de los dos baños. Las amenities son hermosas y se agradecen de todo corazón. La atención de los empleados fue impecable tanto por su profesionalismo como por su simpatía, especiales gracias a Diana de recepción y a Martín. No puedo no mencionar la cama... nunca dormí tan cómoda y feliz en mi vida. Por la cama sola volvería toda mi vida. Y así lo haré, no puedo esperar regresar a Barcelona sólo para hospedarme en el Majestic. ¡Gracias por haber sido la frutilla del postre! ",5,2022,07,03
11,Siempre bien atendido,"El hotel Majestic se distingue siempre por su buen servicio y excelente comida en restaurantes y en la terraza. Las habitaciones limpias y muy bien cuidados los detalles. La atención del personal, siempre sobresaliente.",5,2022,06,29
11,"Pésimo servicio, Pésima habitación",Me quitaron mi llave de la mano en check in para dársela a otra cliente y terminé en un cuarto con vista a la coladera y escobas viejas.  Cinta aislante en la lámpara del techo. Peor inversión de vida.  ,1,2022,06,14
11,Espectacular!,"Un hotel perfecto en el centro de la ciudad, digno de su categoria y estándares! Los domingos, cuenta con el mejor brunch de Barcelona, con un menú degustación insuperable! Trato excelente y comida deliciosa!
Gracias por todo! Pronto volveré!",5,2022,06,14
11,Fin de semana en Barcelona,"Estancia muy confortable, con excelentes instalaciones, magnifico restaurante, hermosa terraza, y el trato de su gente esplendido. Es mi segunda ocasión en Majestic, y me voy muy satisfecho y con muchas ganas de regresar. ",5,2022,05,27
11,De lo mejor,"Desde la llegada el personal dedicado a atender y servir lo que se requiere
 La comida extraordinaria y se le suma la amabilidad y el servicio. La ubicación esta muy buen, cerca de diferentes puntos de interés.",5,2022,05,26
11,Una decepción,"Volvimos al Majestic, porque en nuestra anterior estadía nos habíamos sentido como en casa. Esta vez no sucedió. Por empezar, la atención en la recepción estuvo muy lejos de ser cordial.  Una señorita de nombre Paula, nos solo nos trató con total frialdad, sino que puso en duda, lo que nosotras llevamos pautado de antemano con el hotel: que era un ofrecimiento a ubicarnos en una habitación similar a la que habíamos tenido en nuestra visita anterior. Al mostrarle el mail, dónde se nos prometía esas condiciones, nos contestó que eso era un arreglo que nuestra agencia, no una respuesta certera del hotel, como si le estuviéramos mintiendo. Así mismo, nos dijo que la habitación asignada tenía una de las mejores vistas hacia el exterior. Qué decir que cuando corrimos las cortinas, lo único que se veía eran andamios para continuar obras.
La habitación asignada, no tenía ninguna de las condiciones esperadas. No encontrando allí con quien solucionar la situación, tuvimos que hacerlo mediante nuestra agente de viajes, quien mediante comunicaciones con las personas  del área comercial, aceptaron que se trataba de un error lo sucedido, pero que ya ese día, no se podía solucionar porque el hotel estaba lleno.
Para no extenderme, la situación se solucionó alrededor de las 16 hs., del día siguiente, con la consiguiente necesidad de mudanza de nuestras pertenencias y la pérdida de prácticamente un día de estadía hasta estar finalmente acomodadas.
Por otra parte, suponemos que quizás efecto de los tiempos de pandemia, el hotel no luce tan cuidado, aparece oscuro y falto de detalles, como estándar hoy en día, como ficha USB para cargar elementos electrónicos.
Buen desayuno, no ha sufrido cambios durante el tiempo transcurrido. Buena atención del personal.
Finalmente, debemos decir que para solucionar el problema del cambio de habitación, desde nuestra agencia se nos habían dado dos nombres. Si bien ambas personas fueron muy amables y cumplieron todo lo prometido, fuimos nosotras las que al día siguiente de haber llegado nos tuvimos que poner en contacto, porque nadie se comunicó directamente, para acercarnos una palabra de disculpa y de certeza de cómo seguiría la estancia.
Esperamos que el Hotel Majetic, mejore y vuelva a tener el esplendor con el que los conocimos unos años atrás. Sabemos que la pandemia ha castigado especialmente al sector, pero entendemos que no es así, la mejor manera de atraer al cliente, que también está haciendo sus propios esfuerzos por volver a viajar y deposita en unas vacaciones muy deseadas (postergadas dos años por el Covid). En nuestro caso, no volveremos. Y lo lamentamos mucho.",3,2022,04,25
11,Decepción ,"Trato totalmente despersonalizado y e inexistente. Salvo por la recepcionista de desayunos, que nos preguntó si habíamos descansado bien, nadie en recepción nos dijo ni una palabra que no fuese, dame los DNIs o la tarjeta de crédito.  Pero es que ni hola, ni adiós. El adiós ha sido ""Es todo"".

No he podido acceder a la terraza ni al Spa. El desayuno está en el rango de otros establecimientos similares. Por las críticas y el precio esperaba algo especial. No lo ha sido.

11,"Un po' delusa,,,,,","Soggiornato a Pasqua. Prenotato online camera base senza vista sulla Passia de Garcia. All'arrivo alle 14,30 la camera non era ancora pronta (giustamente il check era alle 15). Lasciamo valige. Al rientro alle 19 ci consegnano le camere con attesa di almeno 15 minuti alla reception. Quarto piano. Quella delle ragazze basica con vista sul parcheggio ma ok. La nostra più piccola con vista agghiacciante su un'altra finestra di una camera 
.....non vedevo neanche se c era il sole. Errore mio... dovevo farmela cambiare.....
Il giorno dopo per tutto il pomeriggio è stato lasciato un vassoio della colazione ritirato solo alla sera tardi. In seguito alla partenza usciamo dalla camera e troviamo un carrello con cibo avanzato a 20 cm dalla ns camera. Non molto da 5 stelle.....Per il resto personale gentile e posti comuni gradevoli.",2,2022,04,21
11,Eccellente soluzione in centro,"Hotel di ottimo livello, situato in pieno centro a poca distanza a piedi da numerose attrazioni come casa Batlló e casa milá.

Raggiungibile dall’aeroporto in taxi (30 euro circa) o facilmente con aerobus (fermata non molto distante a piedi).
La terrazza dell’hotel offre una vista meravigliosa sulla città e si può degustare un pranzo o un aperitivo. Aperta anche agli esterni.
Colazione di buon livello, con vasto buffet e possibilità di chiedere piatti a la carte, salati o dolci.

11,"Excelente hotel, servicio y ubicación","Quería regalarle a mi pareja algo especial por nuestro aniversario de novios y decidí pasar el fin de semana en el Hotel Majestic por su estratégica ubicación en Barcelona. La habitación fue mejor de lo esperado y el servicio del hotel, en especial de la conserjeria, fue de diez. Gracias Susan y equipo, nos ayudásteis a pasar un fin de semana inolvidable...Volveremos!!!",5,2021,09,01
11,Me encantó...,"He estado 8 veces en Barcelona y es mi primera vez en el Majestic. Creo que nunca mas volveré sin alojarme en el Majestic.

El mejor Gin-Tonic que he tomado me lo sirvieron ahi.",5,2021,08,11

chiara , in questa occasione , la mia responsabilità ma strano per un hotel di questo livello. 

per il resto tanta cortesia ",3,2021,07,29
11,Experiencia magnífica,"Hicimos una escapada de fin de semana mi mujer y yo a Barcelona, y elegí este hotel para pasar la noche. Aproveché una oferta denominada disfrutar majestik en la que se incluía una media pensión con desayuno y cena. Desde el primer momento en recepción ya intuíamos que la atención y el servicio del personal iban a ser dignos de un hotel de esta categoría. Nos tocó una habitación a patio de manzana, tranquila pero sin vistas, lo cual compensa el tamaño de la misma, ya que era junior suite. A la llegada detalle con botella de cava. Nos ofrecieron la opción de cenar en el restaurante solc interior en lugar del rooftop. Yo no lo tenía claro así que lo dejé a elección del personal. El rooftop tendría unas vistas magníficas, pero la afluencia de gente de copas podría empañar mi intención que era una cena tranquila y bien atendida. Finalmente nos ubicaron en el comedor del solc, que es también la sala de desayunos, donde solo estábamos tres o cuatro grupos. La atención del Sr. Pablo, único camarero-maitre-sumiller fue exquisita, un gran profesional. Puede que tuviera que ver con la poca carga de trabajo, pero desde luego lo hizo fenomenal. Y los platos deliciosos, en su justa cantidad y bien presentados. Como apunte señalo a futuros clientes que las bebidas no están incluidas en la oferta, por lo que se pagan aparte. Pedí al Sr. Pablo si podíamos tomar el café y copa en el rooftop, y amablemente hizo la gestión e incluso nos acompañó al ascensor. En la terraza el ambiente perfecto, con dj y buena temperatura. En la habitación todo estupendo, el baño de la junior especialmente grande. Las temperaturas de agua caliente rápidas y fáciles de regular, un punto que aprecio mucho en un hotel porque conozco toda la infraestructura que hay detrás del confort en un hotel. Disponíamos de ducha y bañera. No hubieran encajado con el estilo del baño, pero echamos un poco de menos un bidé y un lavamanos cerca del inodoro. Los amenities correctos, máquina de café con cápsulas de cortesía y plancha. Pedí una maquinilla de afeitar y me la trajeron inmediatamente. El desayuno buffet y el servicio de camareros perfecto, con buena variedad de productos y de alta calidad. Es reseñable la buena organización en todos los servicios de afluencia como terraza y desayuno. A la hora del check out rápido y amable, me dispensaron servicio de guardamaletas mientras dábamos un último paseo por la capital. En general hemos notado el impacto del covid en bcn porque tanto los hoteles como las atracciones turísticas no estaban saturadas. Quizás la experiencia no hubiera sido igual con más afluencia de gente, pero en este momento sin duda el hotel y su personal se merecen un diez.",5,2021,07,15
11,Gute Lage aber verbesserungsbedürftig,"Wir waren im Juni zu Gast im Majestic Barcelona. Die Lage ist sehr gut direkt in der Stadt und nahe bei vielen Sehenswürdigkeiten.

Auch der Empfang war sehr freundlich und nett der Herr an der Rezeption.

Unser Zimmer hatte Blick auf die Prunkstraße und war nett eingerichtet aber die Sauberkeit war problematisch! Überall Staub usw so erwartet man sich das nicht in Zeiten wie diesen !

Frühstück sollte angeblich das beste in Europa sein aber davon war es weit entfernt ! Auswahl war eher dürftig.

Aso war geschlossen worüber wir vor der Buchung nicht informiert wurden und der Pool am Dach ist mini eher eine Badewanne als ein Pool !

Das einzige Lokal was geöffnet hatte war das auf dem Dach mit tollen Ausblick und recht guter Küche.",3,2021,07,11
11,Clásico y atemporal,"He estado en varias ocasiones durante la pandemia viajando sola, en todas ellas me he sentido  genial segura, bien atendida.

11,46 aniversario de boda y desencanto.,"Un hotel tiene muchas aristas y cualquier error en uno de 5* es decepcionante. El ""desencanto"" viene determinado porque al hacer la entrada en recepción me retuvieron, además del importe de la habitación, 100 euros en mi tarjeta por posibles consumiciones o no sé qué otro concepto. Tengo 73 años y he conocido bastantes hoteles de calidad en Europa y América y ésta ha sido la primera vez que me retienen, a cuenta, un importe por si vacío el minibar, me llevo las zapatillas del baño, la mesa camilla de la habitación o no pago una consumición. Me pregunto si esa medida se la aplican a todo el mundo o hay algo más, aunque no creo que la aplicaran a los políticos del ""Pacto del Majestic Aznar/Pujol"". A esta medida de desconfianza, que me molestó muchísimo, he de añadir varios apartados más. La habitación no se corresponde con un hotel de 5*, pues no vi ninguna calidad en el mobiliario desvencijado. El mueble bar era un solar inhabitable, totalmente vacío y desconectado. Pensé que, tal vez, la caja fuerte me guardara alguna sorpresa por los 100 euros, pero no, no había ningún diamante ni fajo de billetes. Reparé entonces en la cafetera y ¡oh! ¡qué detalle¡ había tres cápsulas de café y ninguna de ellas descafeinado. Teniendo en cuenta que la habitación era doble, me estuve devanando los sesos para ver como podía dividir 3 cafés entre dos personas. Llegué a la conclusión de que al ser el 3 primo -no divisible, por tanto-, detrás estaban los 100 euros retenidos en mi tarjeta. Mejor no tocar nada, porque los 100 euros si admiten muchas divisiones.  La cena, bastante incómoda en el bar, aunque no me quejo, incorporaba, en el plato de mar y montaña, gambas de Palamós. Eran langostinos y no sé de qué mar. Respecto al desayuno, el baicon estaba refrito y no se podía comer. Quiero, no obstante, resaltar la profesionalidad y amabilidad de la totalidad del personal. Para todos ellos, gracias.",3,2021,04,08
11,Dia del pare,"Hace una semana tuvimos la ocasion de celebrar el dia del padre en vuestro hotel.
Quedamos encantados.

La cena fue estupenda y el servicio inmejorable, así como el desayuno.
 Nos sentimos como en casa.
Sin duda, muy recomendable.
Volveremos.",5,2021,03,26
11,Perfecta experiencia,"Muy recomendable el paquete DISFRUTAR con un menú riquísimo en el que las gambas de Palamós son el ingrediente estrella!

Habitaciones muy limpias y el personal muy atento.",4,2021,01,09
11,El peor regalo que he dado en mi vida. Simplemente nefasto.,"He cometido el gran error de regalar para un cumpleaños una noche en el majestic. El que debería ser uno de los mejores hoteles de Barcelona no está ni siquiera a la altura de un hotel 2 estrellas. La lista de deficiencias es realmente larga por lo que solo me dedicaré a destacar lo que ha sido más grave >> 
1. Publicidad engañosa: en su sitio web publicitan que reservando por allí tendrás incluido algunos de los servicios del spa y el desayuno buffet que supone ser de los mejores de europa. Aunque no lo crean nada de esto está disponible debido al covid pero NO HAN PODIDO ACTUALIZAR SU SITIO WEB. Un hotel de su categoría y recursos que Ni siquiera es capaz de comunicar bien. 
2. Luego de desilusionarnos dado que la tarde de spa ha quedado en la nada hemos decidido subir hasta la terraza para sentarnos junto a su piscina. Más que piscina deberían decir Lavapiés. Menos mal que no nos hemos alojado en verano pues solo deben entrar dos adultos y en plena pandemia ninguno. 
3. Luego de pasar la noche en nuestra cómoda, pero bastante desgastada y deficiente para el año 2020, habitación decidimos bajar por lo que supone ser el mejor desayuno de hotel de europa. Realmente no sé cómo expresar mi desilusión. El buffet estaba cerrado dado que no han logrado adaptarlo a medidas covid(patético de parte de un hotel de esta categoría, he pasado el verano en hoteles que han logrado adaptar la totalidad de sus servicios) Servicio lento(aunque muy amable y no es culpa de las chicas que están sobrepasadas por la falta de personal), café regular, bolleria SECA,VIEJA Y SIN SABOR. Pan duro, embutidos escasos y de dudosa calidad. No hay pastelería, ni gofres, ni nada de lo que ofertan falsamente en sus redes sociales. Han tardado cuarenta minutos entre un café y el otro. Al salir puedes ver la nefasta preparación del poco desayuno que ofrecen con las deficientes medidas de limpieza.Si yo fuese el renombrado chef que auspicia este desayuno me sentiría humillada por que mi nombre se asocie a este servicio. Pueden ver en las fotos la tristeza que da la tortilla francesa que supuestamente hacen al momento junto con esa patata recalentada. Me gustaría muchísimo saber cómo han logrado la cantidad de premios que ostentan con tan poca capacidad de liderazgo en el sector, tan poca capacidad de adaptación a las circunstancias actuales y tan poca capacidad de comunicación veraz. 
He dejado mi número de teléfono en recepción para que supuestamente me llamen para una compensación de esta nefasta experiencia, aunque dudo mucho que eso suceda. Por cierto: me ha atendido Gabriel que ha realizado excelentemente su trabajo y se ha disculpado reiteradas veces por lo mal que la hemos pasado. Sabemos que los pobres chicos de recepción no tienen la culpa de la nefasta gerencia y queremos resaltar su calidez y profesionalidad.

11,Noche de bodas súper recomendable,"Celebramos nuestra noche de bodas en el Hotel - recién abierto tras la pandemia. Tuvimos una experiencia inmejorable. Habitación muy espaciosa con terraza para nosotros. Nos trajeron desayuno a la habitación súper completo y a la carta.

11,Lujoso hotel en el Centro de Barcelona,Uno de los hoteles más emblemáticos y lujososo de Barcelona en pleno Passeig de Gracia. Tienen un buen servicio de habitaciones y el conserge de la puerta es muy atento con el personal que se hospeda. El precio un poco elevado,4,2020,06,06
11,sublime,"Fui por ultima vez cuando comenzaba la crisis del covid 19 y ver Paseo de Gracia tan vacío me impactó. El servicio muy bueno, la ubicación es el motivo de mi elección y las habitaciones son realmente buenas.",5,2020,04,17

11,De relax,Estuve con mi pareja hace poco y estuvimos muy tranquilos. Disponen de una gran variedad de piscinas. Ideal para relajarse un poco. El hotel ni idea pues no nos alojamos pero desde luego que tiene muy buena pinta.,4,2020,01,28
11,Brunch,"Acabo de leer la opinion del 3 de Noviembre de Merline....y ayer 12 de enero estuve en el brunch. Totalmente de acuerdo, pero ademas los platos que debian ser calientes estaban frios. El pescado a la sal sé acabo a las 3 cuando el horario de comida es hasta las 4.....en los postres se acabaron los conguitos y unicamente ofrecen tartas hechas el dia anterior....nada de crema catalana, helados etc.
En estas condiciones, me parece carisimo pagar 59 euros.
Quizas Nando Jubany debería empezar a plantearse no intentar abarcar tanto.....no se puede estar en Andorra, Singapore y en 2 o 3 restaurantes en Barcelona. Quien mucho abarca poco aprieta.......",1,2020,01,13
11,"Buen hotel, bien ubicado.","El Majestic es un muy buen hotel de lujo, ubicado a distancias caminables de muchas de las atracciones.
Estuvimos dos noches previas a un crucero. Una de las noches estaba incluida en el crucero y la otra la reservamos por nuestra cuenta.
La recepcionista tuvo la gentileza de hacernos un upgrade para emparejar ambas noches con la mejor reserva.
La habitación de buen tamaño, wifi razonable, baño bien equipado.
Es destacable en este hotel el desayuno. Debe ser uno de los más completos de la ciudad y de gran calidad.
Se encuentra a un par de cuadras de Casa Milá, paseo que vale la pena.
Volveré cuando pueda.",5,2019,12,16
11,Atención y el mejor desayuno,"Quisiera agradecer la atención recibida por Lucy, fue excepcional, nos hizo sentir especiales. El desayuno sin ninguna duda merece el título de mejor desayuno de hotel de Europa.

11,Un clásico que mantiene la elegancia y ese saber hacer...,"Uno de los hoteles más emblemáticos de Barcelona. Un clásico al que siempre apetece ir. Especial su terraza y su desayuno, uno de los mejores del mundo según la prensa especializada. Y su colección de arte. Me encantan sus habitaciones, tan confortables, a las que apetece llegar tras un día intenso. Y su decoración, actualizada y cuidando todos los detalles",5,2019,11,22
11,Hotel ubicado excelentemente ,"Hotel con una ubicación excepcional. Hotel excelente por su servicio y por sus servicios. Habitaciones grandes y cómodas. Ideal para viaje de negocios. 
Desayunos extraordinarios. Fruta de primera. 
Recomendable. ",4,2019,11,06
11,Un brunch decepcionante,"Ya había ido varias veces en el pasado y siempre me encantó. Ofrecían champagne francés, vinos y copas sin límite y el doble y triple de platos en el buffet. Ahora el precio incluye una sola copa, el restaurante está medio vacío y el servicio a capa caída. Había que pedir que cambiaran los platos, los cubiertos y rellenaran las copas. Servicio muy deficiente.Además había un aire abandonado al lugar: un hueco vacío donde antes había self service de copas, ni la mitad de los postres  Y detrás de los platos calientes una puerta sucia, pateada, desconchada. Si no fue rentable antes ¿porqué no subieron los precios? Una visita muy decepcionante. No voy a volver ni recomendar.",2,2019,11,03
11,excelente en todo concepto,este es un Hotel de categoria con detalles muy especiales del clasico una atencion excelente de todos un desayuno excelso para volver siempre el unico detalle para tener en cuenta que ponen demasiado perfume en los pasillos del hotel y deben considerar que no a todos les agrada la terraza es genial con una gran vista,5,2019,10,13
11,Majestuoso como su nombre,"Excelencia en todos los aspectos. Personal súper amable y educado. Las instalaciones del hotel son espectaculares. La ubicación es excepcional. Han ganado el premio al mejor desayuno de Europa y vaya si lo merecen,  desde el salón en el que ofrecen el desayuno, a la atención del personal y la excelencia de los productos, su variedad y abundancia hacen que merezcan el premio que han obtenido. La terraza y bar del hotel en muy lindo con una vista hermosa de Barcelona. Claramente es un hotel cinco estrellas . Tienen conserge que siempre esta atento a tus necesidades y solucionar algún problema que se te pueda presentar. ",5,2019,09,29
11,Combinaba un par de visitas de negocios con unos días de descanso,"Resultó el sitio ideal, pude atender mis negocios sin problemas de desplazamiento. Y el resto del tiempo lo disfruté con mi familia visitando Barcelona. 

El hotel combina magníficamente las características de elegancia clásica y señorial con la modernidad, sin caer en burdos contrastes y con una armonía decorativa sublime. 

Me encantan las vistas desde la azotea, especialmente las de la Sagrada Familia.",5,2019,09,20
11,Bastante bueno ,"Hotel situado en el paseo de la gracia En el ombligo de la zona comercial nice de Barcelona , cerca de todo , es un hotel emblemático de lujo  con 100 años de experiencia y donde se han alojado todo tipo de personajes , desde que entras el olor a un perfume como de lavanda que se llama mask imperial que  te inunda tus fosas nasales , asi como la presencia de limpieza en sus rincones y la amabilidad de todo su personal en todas las áreas desde el check in , e incluso hasta el restaurante que tiene un jardín interior y un decorado exquisito que hacen del hotel una experiencia grata, las habitaciones amplias y limpias sin olores , sábanas y almohadas suaves y sin olores que hacen que pases noches descansadas.
Muy buen sitio para pasar tus vacaciones en Barcelona.",5,2019,09,19
11,El mejor premio! Ever!,"Bueno yo estuve en Majestic gracias a un concurso de Pandora Jewerly. En definitiva no pudieron elegir mejor hotel. Es magnífico! Los detalles y el servicio de excelencia es inigualable! Y la terraza de la azotea, lo mejor!  ",5,2019,09,16
11,Muy buen hotel con algunas deficiencias. ,"El hotel en sí es bellisimo. Las habitaciones amplias y con una decoración exquisita.  El baño es amplio y muy cómodo. 
 En cuanto al desayuno, debo decir que es el mejor que he comido en mi vida, y he recorrido bastante en hoteles de lujo, de hecho han sido premiados por ser el mejor desayuno de España. 
 El personal del hotel es muy amable, y cubren varios idiomas. 

  ❌Sin embargo, debo decir que a veces en la habitación había olor a podrido. 
  ❌Si la pileta es uno de los motivos por los que eligen este hotel, deben saber que es muy pequeña, que solo cuentan con 4 reposeras y esta en la terraza con el bar del hotel. Es decir, hay gente comiendo y bebiendo (tanto huéspedes del hotel como gente que no) al lado de uno que esta tratando de relajarse al sol o en la piscina.",4,2019,09,14
11,Desilusión Espantosa,"Optamos por la oferta de departamentos de lujo ya que acostumbramos a consumir solo hotelería 5 estrellas, el formato departamento nos posibilita preparar la alimentación de nuestro hijo sin rescindir los servicios de un hotel. Lamentablemente en esta oportunidad toda nuestra estadía se vio opacada por el tremendo y nauseabundo olor que provenía de los baños del departamento, copando todo el lugar y haciendo prácticamente imposible habitar el mismo. Tuvimos que recurrir a opciones fuera del departamento para comer ya que adentro del mismo se hacia imposible debido al olor.

Pagamos aproximadamente 3000 euros por 4 dias, por 5 estrellas y servicio de primer nivel y no obtuvimos ni siquiera algo aproximado, no puedo admitir una cosa así, sin al menos informales para que tomen las medidas necesarias.

Cuando hicimos el check out informamos de la situación y nos preguntaron porque no les comentamos de este problema, pues bien no creo que sea algo que ustedes desconozcan ya que tanto su personal de limpieza como el de mantenimiento deben haber informado de repetidas oportunidades el problema del departamento.

Atrás quedan otros detalles como por ejemplo:

* Falta de pantuflas
* Doble ascensor para entrar y salir con lo incómodo que es
* Piscina en el 10 piso imposible de utilizar por su agua helada y su tamaño muy reducido
* larga espera hasta lograr agua caliente para bañarse",1,2019,08,24

11,Brunch del Majestic Barcelona,"El Restaurante del Majestic ha estado ofreciendo los Domingos el mejor Brunch de Barcelona (...y posiblemente de España). Un buffet libre de una calidad inmejorable con Moet Chandon free flow, vinos, refrescos y cócteles. Nosotros éramos asiduos pero al realizar una reserva para el próximo mes nos informan que han bajado el precio 6€ y han dejado free flow solo de agua y refrescos.
Para nosotros ha perdido mucho interés y sintiéndolo mucho dejaremos de ser asiduos. Hubiéramos preferido que anunciaran que necesitan subir el precio los 6€ y que lo dejaran con todo el atractivo que tiene actualmente. 
Esperemos que la Dirección del Majestic se lo replantee porque era fantástico, único y ahora será un brunch más de la ciudad.",5,2019,08,07
11,Excelente opción en Barcelona ,"Para mi no hay mejor hotel en Barcelona. Por su ubicación, su servicio, sus desayunos... Es la segunda vez que nos quedamos aquí y este vez estuvo mejor.

11,Magnifico,"Estupendo hotel. Restaurado a full. Todo impecable. Lobby habitaciones, etc

11,Por mi no le daba ni una estrella! ,"El peor hotel al que he llegado en mi vida! Y vaya que he viajado por el mundo y este definitivamente no es un hotel de 5 estrellas! Ayer llegue en la madrugada pensando que iba a llegar a mi deliciosa cama a descansar en el mejor hotel de Barcelona! Pero oh sorpresa cuando llegue me dijeron que no había habitación y que si quería me regresaban mi dinero y me mandaban a otro hotel... Perdon pero mi reservación estaba pre pagada y desde hace meses! Como puedo creer que a las 2:30 de la mañana me digan que no tengo donde dormir y que no se puede hacer nada! El trabajador del front desk según el haciendo lo posible pero todos sabemos que fueron 50 minutos de hacerse tonto... a la hora casi (ya estamos hablando de pasadas las 3 de la mañana) llegaron dos personas con una reservación impresa y a ellos al parecer si les  iban a respetar su reservación! No entiendo si son racistas o de que allá dependido el que ellos tuvieran su cuarto y nosotros no! Pero el punto es que no iba a aceptar que me sacaran del hotel, yo tenia mi habitación pagada igual que las otras personas! Por fin me solucionaron el problema y me dieron la habitación más horrible que visto en mi vida! Tiene vista a un patio horrible, INTERIOR! Puedo escuchar a las personas del servicio bajar y subir entrará y salir de donde sea que lo hagan, escucho todas las conversaciones... y aparte jamás pudimos apagar un Luz en un closet! La peor noche por culpa del tal Majestic Hotel! El peor servicio al cliente, como puedo creer que no me hayan ofrecido aunque fuera una cortesía de desayuno... después del trato y la espera a esas horas de la mañana! Me encargaré de decirle a la gente que este es el peor hotel al que he llegado y por supuesto que jamas volveré a llegar a este hostal! ",1,2019,07,03

Destacamos sin duda alguna a dos de los chicos que nos atendieron, Lucy,una chica francesa super educada y profesional, atendiendonos todo el tiempo con simpatia y carisma, nos dio un servicio de 10. Y por otro lado nos atendió tambien Simone,super atento y educado todo el tiempo,ofreciendonos un servicio impeccable.
Esperabamos un muy buen servicio al ser un cinco estrellas pero Sin duda no esperabamos este trato tan super profesional por parte del staff y sobre todo acogedor. Volveremos pronto 100% recomendado.

11,Habitación sin Estilo,"Me aloje en una habitación superior con vista a la calle y se podian sentir los autos transitar. La decoraciòn muy simple con muebles que convinaban y de mal gusto. Las cortinas eran del siglo pasado mal definidas en el largo, ya que sobraba mucha tela.
Lo rescatable fue el desayuno servido en un area muy acogedora y de buen gusto.",3,2019,05,28
11,Mayo 2019,"Es la primera vez que nos quedamos en este Hotel en Barcelona, la verdad no se puede negar que tiene buena presencia desde fuera, bien ubicado en una de las avenidas con las tiendas mas top. En cuanto a las instalaciones, la verdad es que nada sorprendente, es más me dio la impresión que es mucho nombre para lo que es en realidad el Hotel. Los desayunos están bien y cumplen con el objetivo, quizás un detalle es que para los días de lluvia el hotel tiene un paraguas en la habitación pero demasiado pequeño. Recomendable si es para un hospedaje corto.",3,2019,05,28
11,Excelente!!!,"Habitación muy confortable, desayuno opíparo y terraza preciosa con vista sobre Barcelona. Muy recomendable para descansar y disfrutar de esta maravillosa a ciudad condal estos días de primavera. Gracias!

11,Tutto perfetto ma camere troppo troppo piccole.,"L'albergo è ben posizionato e molto bello, l'accoglienza è buona e veloce. Piccoli gli spazi nella hall e al bar in pianterreno meglio nel bar sulla terrazza ma è difficile trovare posto. La camera standard vista città è molto piccola ed è imbarazzante vivere in un posto così angusto. Per essere un 5 stelle e a questi prezzi è ridicolo offrire una stanza così piccola. Il bagno al contrario è spazioso con vasca da bagno molto grand, manca il bidet molto caro a noi italiani. Colazione molto varia e assortita. Consiglio di non prendere la camera standard ma sceglierne un altra tipologia.",3,2019,05,12

La última noche en una habitación cercana hacían muchísimo ruido , con música y cantando ( 3 de la madrugada) avise a conserjería e inmediatamente enviaron a una persona de seguridad . I mediata mente cesó el ruido . Al día siguiente nos pidieron disculpas . Un detalle muy bueno es que kndo nos entregaron el coche del parking habían puesto 2 botellitas de agua y una tarjeta.

El detalle de tener la botella de champany al entrar a la habitación con motivo del aniversario nos ha gustado mucho.
Nos han dado una habitación con terracita que hemos aprovechado durante el día y por la noche unas vistas preciosas a la lluna ‘casi’ llena.
¡Servicio de habitaciones impecable y servicio muy bueno! :)

La única pega que teníamos reserva inicialmente para pasar una hora en el Spa y no ha podido ser porque estaban en obras de mantenimiento. El hotel no nos ha proporcionado una alternativa a la hora reservada, sólo ante mi petición un mini descuento si nos hacíamos algún tratamiento de masaje o similar :/",4,2019,01,20

11,Pudo ser Mejor ,"En un principio reservamos en los apartamentos que están ubicados justo al enfrente, en el mismo paseo de gracia, y después de una noche, pedí cambio a una habitación del hotel, ya que quería disfrutar de sus instalaciones sin tener que estar cruzando la calle. Todo ha sido perfecto en los dos lugares, pero después de hacer el cambio del apartamento a la habitación del hotel, pude comprobar que hacían falta dos pares de botas nieve de mis hijas, un convertidor corriente , cargador iPhone , y algunos alimentos , los cuales nunca aparecieron, y esto en un prestigioso hotel como este, es inadmisible. Por todo lo demás, he de destacar que el servicio y la amabilidad por parte del personal del hotel ha sido excelente!! ",4,2019,01,05

“Exquisito, selecto, espléndido, esmerado”",Fabuloso brunch el del día de hoy 18 de Noviembre de 2018 ! Celebrando en familia los 100 años de este Gran Hotel de Barcelona. Delicada selección de productos y un brindis con Dom Pérignon. Felicidades a toda la dirección y personal del hotel y muchas gracias por todas las atenciones recibidas en este importante evento a las personas que nos han atendido. ¡ A por el 200 Aniversario !,5,2018,11,18
11,Vale la pena tomarte un tè,Sòlo fuimos a tomarnos un te en la cafeteria que hay en el vestíbulo.  Vale la pena entrar a relajarte un poco entre compra y compra. Servicio atento y el producto es bueno.  El precio... de 5 estrellas.,5,2018,11,16

11,Bellísimo ,"Tenía más de 15 años de no venir a este hotel, y que sorpresa me llevé, totalmente remodelado hermosísimas las habitaciones amplias y bonitas, desde luego es un hotel muy caro pero estás desquitando lo que pagaste, porque también la gente que trabaja aquí es extraordinario, profesional y servicial",5,2018,10,17
11,Bastante decepcionado por los servicios ,"Estuve simplemente una noche y pagué 345€ por la misma. Hasta ahí todo puede parecer normal, pero luego te das cuenta que en ese precio no está incluido el desayuno. Para cargar mi iPhone tuve que dejarlo en recepción porque no me dejaban ningún cargador para la habitación. En los utensilios de baño no había ni un triste kit para lavarse los dientes. Y cuando me marché por la mañana no fueron capaces ni de ofrecerme un triste taxi a la puerta. En definitiva, el precio que pagué no está justificado para nada con la atención que recibí. Deberían ponerse a la altura de hoteles de su supuesta categoría. Y lo que está claro es que hay opciones a sí mismo nivel y seguramente muchísimo mejor a un precio muy inferior. Afortunadamente sólo pasé una noche y me ha servido para no volver a cometer el mismo error en el futuro. ",1,2018,10,12
11,Immer wieder exklusive Shopping-Pause ,"Die dachterasse ist ein geheimtip als Pause vom Shopping auf dem Passeig de Gràcia.

Es sind kaum Touristen am Tag oben, alles drängt sich in den Cafés des passeigs. Auch abends eine wunderschöne Location. ",5,2018,10,04

He tenido el placer de descubrir nuevos sabores y texturas que no pasan desapercibidas en él paladar.

11,Pésimo servicio de botones/valet,"El hotel está muy bueno aunque por falta de disponibilidad nos toco una habitación muy pequeña.

Podría haber estado excelente se no ser por el malísimo servicio de los valets o botones y la falta de atención de los conserjes sobre este tema.

Gente indiferente hacia las necesidades de los clientes de tomar un taxi o de bajar tus maletas del cuarto.

Para ser más explícito cuando hice “check out”  avise que ya estaban mis maletas y que iría a comer algo rápido para irme al aeropuerto, que por favor las tuvieran listas abajo. Cuando llegue por ellas, ya con el coche en la puerta tardaron 20 minutos en bajarlas, casi haciendo que perdiera mi vuelo, subí por ellas yo corriendo pero no me quisieron abrir la habitación.

Este tipo de cosas en un hotel 5 estrellas puede arruinarte la experiencia de tu estancia además de hacerte perder un vuelo en pleno verano.

Un caprichito al año no hace daño ☺️",4,2018,06,30
11,TERRAZA LAMENTABLE SERVICIO,"Buenas tardes he esperado unos dias para escribir mi opinion dejando de lado mi parte emocional.

Llamo porque quiero ir a la terraza y me dicen que es llegar y subir sin espera , evidentemente cosa no cierta.

Llegamos arriba se nos atiende mal y se nos dice que debemos esperar minimo 30 m , luego llegan clientes del hotel y pasan delante nuestro nada que objetar y comprensible pero se nos debia haber informado al llegar , un servicio malisimo porque de los 30 m iniciales pasan 60 minutos.

60 minutos mas tarde nos fuimos al hotel mandarin que por cierto nos dio un servicio impecable.

Por cierto el nivel de ingles de la persona que atendia ese dia es irrisorio.

Acto seguido tuvimos el deleite por parte del equipo de servicio en el bar del Majestic para la cena. No solo nos encantó el menú degustación del renombrado chef Catalán Nandu Jubany, sino también el hecho que lo causó inolvidable para nuestras memorias, el servicio por parte del camarero, Albert.

Todo ello ha definido lo que se conoce como la genuidad. Muchísimas gracias equipo Majestic!",5,2018,02,15

Asimismo está muy bien ubicado sobre el Passeig de Gracia a unas seis cuadras de la plaza Catalunya. Seguramente será nuestra primer opción cuando volvamos a Barcelona.,5,2018,02,15
11,"Excelente ubicación, Hotel con Historia Tarifas Elevadas",Por razones de trabajo me hospede en este hotel con una tarifa super preferencial. La primera noche me aloje en una habitación que no tenia calefacción . Al día siguiente realice el reclamo y me mudaron a otra habitación muy grande. En compensación recibi unos bombones. El desayudo buffett es muy completo. El personal es muy amable. La ubicación es privilegiada,4,2018,02,13
11,Finde ,"Ubicación fantástica. El personal muy amable. Las vistas en la terraza situada en la decima planta son muy espectaculares y genial el espacio para tomar una copa. No pudimos entrar en el spa por ya estar lleno, una pena.",4,2018,02,04
11,Excelencia en el servicio,"El Hotel Majestic no sólo te ofrece una excelente ubicación en el Paseo de Graciá en Barcelona, sino que sus servicios son excelentes.
Habitaciones comfortables, sencillas pero elegantes. Personal dispuesto a mejorarte tu estancia en Barcelona, y lo más importante una variedad exquisita en la gastronomía que ofrecen. Repetiré sin duda. ",5,2018,01,22
11,Simplemente perfecto,"Simplemente les tengo que decir que para mí no hay mejor hotel, mayormente suele surgir alguna critica en los hoteles, pero éste es perfecto. 
No hay motivo de critica alguna, si quieren revisen mis otras criticas para que puedan ver que siempre he sido muy objetiva y con criticas constructivas pero esta ocasión estaría de mas.
Por las noches se puede tomar algo en la terraza que tiene unas vistas espectaculares y en su momento había una DJ Argentina!",5,2018,01,15
11,A tiro hecho: calidad y ubicación.,"El hotel está situado en la mejor zona de Barcelona, Paseo de Gracia junto a las mejores tiendas y cercano a todo el centro, ramblas, plaza de Cataluña etc.  
Reservé una deluxd doble con amex y una vez más recibí un super upgrade por fine hotels & resorts a una junior suite (esta vez sí tengo fotos y no videos). Creo que el baño era lo mejor aunque la habitación era enorme y con unas vistas preciosas al paseo y al monte. 
Cafetera incluida aunque he echado de menos botella de agua de cortesía, si bien en el check out me han regalado todo lo consumido en el mibi bar. Muchas gracias por ese detalle. Lavandería express, gracias!! No hay tantos hoteles que la tengan, ni siquiera en este nivel de 5*GL. 
Me han dado también 85 € para tratamientos en el spa pero no he tenido tiempo de bajar. 
Me encantó el lounge con piano bar (adoro los piano bar!) Y la pianista tocaba muy bien y música discreta. 
La bañera tenía hidromasaje y la verdad el precio me ha parecido baratísimo, especialmente cuando su directo competidor en la misma calle a unos metros cobra el doble. 
Lo guardo como fijo para Barcelona, tanto de negocio como familiar.

",5,2018,01,11
11,HOTEL LHW,"Muy buen hotel en Paseo de Gracia. Es un LHW y ello da tranquilidad. Las instalaciones muy buenas. Es un hotel tipo boutique, pero con áreas amplias. Por ejemplo su Lobby Bar es de excelente tamaño. Cuenta con Staff profesional y en la puerta sus porteros dando la bienvenida. Tiene terraza en piso alto con vistas a la ciudad.
Muy buena alternativa en Barcelona ",5,2018,01,06
11,Muy bueno ,"Muy bien ubicado, trato acorde, instalaciones muy bien decoradas, habitaciones comidas amplias y prolija, la terraza con vistas espectaculares a los puntos más importantes de Barcelona, la piscina un poco pequeña.
Por el precio deberían de incluir el desayuno.",5,2018,01,01
11,Hotel Majestic Barcelona,Estuvimos una noche alojados en una júnior suite con vistas al Paseo de gracia y nos sorprendio gratamente tanto la decoracion del hotel como el servicio 10 del personal de recepcion. Desayuno muy completo. Si visitats Barcelona este hotel es una opcion muy buena. Muy recomendable. Muy centrico y comodo.,5,2017,12,27
11,Alojamiento sin desayuno,"Necesita reformas par acoger a personas con minusvalias pero servicios de puerta de alta calidad con personas agradables y muy humanas,servicios de recepción administrativos y siempre como despita’os.",2,2017,12,21
11,"Excelente servicio, comida y localización. Inmejorable","Excelente hotel de 5 estrellas, con una conserjería atenta y impecable. Una zona para tomar el café, en el paseo de gracia turístico con unas habitaciones muy limpias, baños de mármol. Una experiencia inolvidable, el mejor hotel de Barcelona claramente. Las suites de un tamaño espectacular, muy contenta con el personal, el servicio, el desayuno variado y la ayuda para buscar excursiones por la zona. Tiene una sala del té e incluso una tienda de lujo. ",5,2017,12,19
11,Posiblemente la mejor opción de lujo,"Una vez más el Majestic proporciona tanto lujo como calidez y buen servicio. Es un hotel con alma y personalidad, con mucho más carácter que la mayoría de GL y mucho confort. Camas y baños fantásticos y posiblemente el mejor desayuno de hotel de 5* en la ciudad (con conocimiento de causa). Y encima perfecta ubicación",5,2017,12,09
11,El Majestic de siempre.,"Soy cliente habitual del hotel, en mi anterior visita tuve una mala experiencia, lo que me llevo a una desilusión con el hotel y provocó mi critica en TripAdvisor. Pero, por un sentido de justicia, quise darle una nueva oportunidad y fui huésped en el hotel en mi estadía reciente. Pasé una semana allí a todo gusto.
Que estadía más agradable y placentera. Ningún problema, es decir es mi Hotel Majestic de siempre. Espero, como siempre, repetir la experiencia el próximo año.
Gracias por todo.",5,2017,12,06
11,"Este es un gran hotel,","Este es un gran hotel, el personal no podía hacer lo suficiente para nosotros, y las instalaciones y la ubicación son excelentes. Es realmente de primera clase y realmente merece sus 5 estrellas en cualquier ciudad del mundo.",4,2017,11,20
11,Ottima soluzione.... per una fascia alta di ospiti,"Location centrale e perfettamente contestualizzata nella città. Tutti i comfort sono garantiti. Le stanze sono ampie e accoglienti. Persino il locale bagno. Personale gentile e puntuale.
Tutto ciò non è ovviamente alla portata di tutte le tasche.",5,2017,11,17
11,Incantevole,"Ho soggiornato in questa incantevole struttura per 2 notti. Personale super qualificato, struttura imponente e bellissima. Stanze molto comode e pulitissime. Servizio in camera super veloce e personale sempre sorridente. Palestra piccola ma essenziale con tutti i macchinari che servono. Sala riunione molto spaziosa. Per chi viaggia per fare shopping con questa struttura fa centro, basta uscire dalla holl e si trova immerso immediatamente nelle migliori boutique. Certamente lo consiglio sia per chi viaggia per lavoro che per divertimento. Complimenti ",5,2017,11,15
11,EXCEPCIONAL!,"Inmejorable ubicacion, hermoso, lo mas destacable la atencion del personal, increiblemente amable desde la puerta de entrada.  Estan atentos a que los huespedes se sientan realmente comodos.  Justo dejabamos el hotel el dia antes de mi cumpleanos y nos enviaron una botella de champagne para agasajarme.
Totalmente recomendable.",5,2017,11,14
11,Praticamente perfetto,"Centrale, pratico e accogliente. Luogo incantevole per rilassarsi e divertirsi!!! Si è a pochi minuti da tutto, metro vicinissima. Rilassarsi in terrazza per un brunch  o un aperitivo è magnifico. La colazione in serra rilassante e piacevole",5,2017,11,13
11,Majestic Das stimmt,Grandioses Hotel auf top Niveau . Nicht billig aber dafür etwas anderes. Service an der Bar kann besser aber ansonsten immer wieder.  Dachterasse mit Blick auf der Welt berühmte Kathedrale von Barcelona und über Barcelona City ist schon etwas tolles .,5,2017,11,10
11,Favoloso,"Albergo favoloso. Camere lussuosissime.
Al centro della città. Servizio e cura del cliente eccellenti.
Aperitivo di benvenuto con formaggio e vino.
Pulizia straordinaria e cura dei dettagli.
Terrazza dell’ultimo piano con vista sulla città spettacolare",5,2017,11,06
11,Forse Gran Lusso e' un po' troppo,"L'hotel e' molto bello, ma forse addirittura classificarsi gran lusso e' troppo.
Upgrade alla stanza di categoria superiore e' stato molto apprezzato, perche' nonostante questo le camere son un po' piccole. La moquette inizia a mostrare i primi segni di eta'. La piscina sul tetto e' proprio minuscola ed il bar un po' affollato.
Ottima la colazione, sia in camera che al buffet. Perfetta la posizione.",4,2017,10,18
11,Sehr gepflegtes hotel,"Sehr gute Lage, das Zimmer ein wenig klein, Zimmer 480, das Bad ein wenig zu eng, wenn 2 Personen gleichzeitig sich darin aufhalten! kompetentes und freundliches Personal! Ein freundliches willkommen heissendes Ambiente! ",5,2017,10,03
11,Espectacular Estadia,"Estuve en el Majestic del 19 al 23 de Septbre .La ubicación del hotel es super privilegiada asi como la atención esmerada  desde el personal de recepción hasta las mucamas .- El Roof Top es increíble ,con unas vistas maravillosas  
No tengo mas que halagos.para este hotel hermoso ¡¡",5,2017,09,28
11,"""Majestuoso""","Hermoso el hotel es muy atento el personal y amable,la pileta es muy linda pero no nos pudimos meter porque estaba muy fría(no hace que sea mala experiencia). Hermoso el departamento es limpio,grande y tiene una terraza con muy linda vista .

11,Increíble limpieza y trato,Fuimos a celebrar nuestro aniversario y nos trataron genial además toda la instalaciones son super limpias el espada es pequeñito pero muy agradable el masaje increíble menudas manos tienen las profesionales sales medio muerto y la habitación muy cómoda y la verdad que estuvimos muy a gusto las vistas desde la terraza panorámicas,5,2017,09,20
11,Posizione fantastica ,"Hotel in pieno paseig de gracia . Posizione quindi eccezionale . L'hotel e' curato e si respira un lusso di altri tempi, con arredamenti  classico e funzionale . Forse le camere di categoria minore dovrebbero essere migliorate , per dimensioni o affaccio . Si è sempre in un 5 stelle lusso ed alcune sistemazioni non sono proprio all'altezza .",4,2017,09,19
11,DECEPCION,"Nos casamos en noviembre, y habíamos decidido pasar la noche de bodas en este hotel, como vivimos en Barcelona nos pareció buena idea acudir en persona a reservar, y así poder comentar con el personal la elección de la habitación, para nosotros se trata de un día especial y no queremos que falte detalle. El pasado martes mi novio estuvo en el hotel por la mañana y la persona que le atendió en recepción, un señor de mediana edad, le informó que tenían varias habitaciones y lo mejor es que consultase la web, eso ya lo sabíamos, pero que sucede, como informan en su web en una de las opciones, no podemos tener un cara a cara? Una pena de verdad, mis padres también habían estado en este hotel cuando se casaron y siempre hablaban de su bonita experiencia. Les aconsejo eliminen de las tres opciones que tienen en su web la de cara a cara, porque no ofrecen el servicio esperado. Optaremos por otro hotel.......",1,2017,09,15
11,Muy buena situación ," Debido a su inmejorable situación y la amabilidad de su personal, el hotel Majestic es una perfecta elección para una escapada a Barcelona.  Y, por la calidad y variedad de su desayuno , es la elección segura de mi hija cuando recomienda un hotel en esa ciudad.",5,2017,09,06
11,Gaudì in camera,"Bellissimo hotel nel cuore di Barcellona.
Camera strepitosa con vista su casa Batllò!!!
Sala colazione enorme e ricca di ogni tipologia di prodotto, camere ben arredate e corredate, da notare gli accessori da bagno Bulgari, fantastica la terrazza con piscina ristorante e meravigliosa vista sulla città!

Vicinissimo a tutte le boutique griffate e ad un passo dalla Pedrera.
Esperienza strepitosa lo consiglio a chiunque!",5,2017,08,29
11,Terraza TOP,"He ido varias veces a la terraza, al atardecer que es cuando mejor se está en verano y siempre he disfrutado del ambiente y una copa con amigos. No obstante, el sushi me pareció notable, se encuentra de mayor calidad en otros locales de Barcelona.",4,2017,08,24
11,Visitanto la Terraza,"Llegado el verano, nos gusta ir de terrazas por Barcelona, y me gustaría destacar esta sobre las demas que hemos visitado de hoteles similares. Atención exquisita, vistas inmejorables, música agradable y muy acertada de fondo con el DJ. El cocktel de los mejores que he probado hace tiempo y desconocido. Nos guistó tanto que porque teniamos reserva en un restaurante cercano, pero los que estabamos dijimos de comer para cenar porque todo tenia una pinta buenisima.",5,2017,08,08
11,"No sabría que mejorar, es todo perfecto","Nos ha encantado el hotel, su personal y por supuesto las instalaciones del mismo. Gracias por cuidar hasta el mínimo detalle. Imposible poner una pega. Un hotel que corresponde a su categoría de 5 estrellas GL.",5,2017,07,31
11,Super bien ubicado,"Hotel muy bueno, buena atencion las habitaciones super bien de tamaño, super bien ubicado cerca de buenos restaurantes y buenos sitios de compras.  rooftop con buenas vistas, lo mejor que solicitamos la habitación super temprano y nos las dieron sin costo alguno como deben hacer todos los hoteles 5 estrellas si no están full ocupados.",4,2017,07,24

11,Una vergogna per la categoria 5*,"Prenotato con Booking 3 notti in una Deluxe matrimoniale. La descrizione sul Booking diceva: Camera elegante con arredi in stile classico, vista su un caratteristico cortile interno dell'Eixample. Superficie 20m2. Costo della stanza 350 Euro + 37 Euro colazione a testa al giorno + 39 Euro al giorno di parcheggio. Il calcolo è subito fatto. 
Ci hanno assegnato una ""stanza"" che non merita nemmeno il nome. Sicuramente era stato un locale di servizio, dove si teneva il materiale di pulizie, ma poi questo hotel che si freggia del nome Majestic 5 stelle Gran Lusso (!!!) ha deciso di far fruttare anche questo localino e ci hanno messo un letto e una scrivania con la sedia. La ""vista su un caratteristico cortile interno"" in realtà è un buco di finestra sul pozzo formato dalle mura dell'edificio con tannto di tubo di ventilazione proprio davanti alla finestra (vedi le foto allegate). La finestra è larga max 50 cm. Di giorno bisognava tenere sempre la luce accesa, talmente è buia la stanza. 
I 20 m2 promessi dal Booking comprendono anche il bagno, percio' potete immaginare le dimensioni di questa ""elegante"" stanza. Abbiamo dovuto mettere una delle nostre due valigie per terra davanti alla porta d'entrata e l'altra sul minuscolo sgabello in mezzo ai piedi del letto e l'armadio. Lo spazio tra un lato del letto e la parete sara' stato max 30 cm, giusto per poter mettere i piedi per terra e strisciare lungo la parete, sbattendo immancabilmente le ginocchia contro la valigia menzionata prima, la quale, tra l'altro, finiva praticamente davanti alla porta del bagno. Vedete le foto allegate e vi renderete conto della situazione.
Eravamo al 6 piano, mi sembra fosse l'ultimo. Sul tetto si trova un bar. Fino alle 2 del mattino è stato impossibile dormire: la stanza rimbombava dai bassi degli altoparlanti.

La sala della colazione era piccola, affollata, con tovaglie bucate, come si puo' vedere sulla foto (5 stelle GL!). La prima mattina ci hanno messo al tavolo nel passaggio verso WC, che meraviglia! (vedi foto).
Questa è stata la mia prima volta a Barcellona. Grazie al Majestic, i miei ricordi di questa città saranno semplicemente brutti.
Non so se Majestic commenterà questa mia recensione... Se lo farà, saranno le solite parole generali di scuse e l'invito di tornare, ecc. Ma non ci sono ne scuse ne spiegazioni che possano tenere. La cosa è una sola: un VERO hotel 5 stelle, anche senza il pomposo GL, non deve potersi permettere di mettere i propri clienti in un locale del genere. Di piu': non deve nemmeno avere dei locali cosi. Sempre che sia un vero 5 stelle degno di questo nome. Veramente, è una vergogna.",1,2017,07,01
11,Viaje,"Excelente atención, nos gustó todo desde la recepción, la habitación y el desayuno todo muy bien.
La zona donde se encuentra es privilegiada y cómoda.
Nos atendieron genial
La terraza un poco concurrida los fines de semana pero vale la pena conocerla

11,Excelente estancia,"Fin de semana por motivos laborales alojada en este hotel, muy buen ambiente, detalles en la habitación y excelente trato del personal. A destacar: ¡la cama es súper cómoda! Y la ubicación perfecta en Paseo de Gracia!! la cena en la terraza súper agradable con unas vistas espectaculares ",5,2017,06,17
11,No esperaba menos... ni más,"Me parece que en todo, el hotel destaca notablemente. Habitaciones amplias y confortables, con unas camas súper cómodas. servicio inmejorable, con un personal muy simpático, amable y atento. Ubicación perfecta, en el centro de Barcelona. El spa muy bien, con buenas masajistas. 
El catering que sirvieron en un evento en la terraza exquisito.
En definitiva, cumple sobradamente con las expectativas.",5,2017,06,12
11,Detalle de cortesía con motivo de nuestro 30º aniversario de boda,"Suite excelente, con cama de matrimonio cómoda y grande, habitación limpia, silenciosa y con todo lo necesario además de un cuarto de aseo amplio y espacioso, con un trato exquisito dispensado tanto en Recepción como en el Comedor donde desayunamos.",4,2017,06,10
11,Especial,"ciertamente quien no conoce el Majestic , es todo un clasico de obligada visita en Barcelona y si viajas por negocios una perfecta excusa para alojarse y disfrutar de sus instalaciones, una maravilla .",5,2017,06,07
11,Demasiados turistas,"El que era un buen Hotel se ha convertido en un lugar para turistas, quizás con dinero pero sin educación.
Los precios han subido, pero el servicio cubierto por extranjeros está cubierto por gentes con conocimientos de idiomas pero nada más 
La terraza es un sitio para evitar igual, que el bar, ya que el pianista toca mal y encima con el sonido altísimo para matar cualquier conversación.como se entiende que en un restaurante de lujo exista un self-service.
Recomiendo a los locales que se olviden del hotel y lo dejen para los de fuera",3,2017,06,05
11,CASI PERFECTO,"estuvimos alojados toda la familia por la boda de mi hermana por el mismo precio algunos teníamos habitaciones mas grandes que otros pero todas estaban bien.lo único es la polucion que ensucia todas las ventanas.hotel tranquilo y con aire retro
situación muy buena y te llevan el coche al parking.lo único que no le damos perfecto es por la comida .a lo mejor no tuvimos el dia y mi padre prefirió ir a comer justo al lado del hotel a una tasca.el desayuno muy bueno",4,2017,06,05
11,Valida la terrazza per un buon aperitivo in compagnia,"Possiamo valutare bene l'accoglienza in terrazza, al lounge serale, per un buon aperitivo. Va bene per una cocktail o una bevanda rinfrescante, una coppa di champagne. Non consigliamo moltissimo il cibo, non vale proprio e da evitare assolutamente jamon iberico e quesos. Lasciate perdere! Sono comunque accettabili i piacevoli piatti dello chef, che comune vanno a gusto, ma vanno bene in generale per accompagnare un buon bicchiere di vino in compagnia. Entusiasmante invece la vista, a nostro avviso, impagabile e suggestiva di sera.",3,2017,05,31
11,El Hotel de Gran Lujo de Barcelona,"Majestic es mi hotel de Gran Lujo favorito en Barcelona, no solo por tradición familiar. Es como hablar del Plaza de NY o del Ritz de Paris. Sin duda alguna es el clásico del lujo en Barcelona pero que ha sabido actualizarse, como solo lo sabe hacer la cadena Majestic Hotel Group. Su cafetería es un lugar excelente para un encuentro ya sea personal o de trabajo, donde uno puede encontrar a destacados personajes de la economía de la Ciudad y del País, pero donde el Bar del Majestic adquiere una magia especial es por las  tardes donde me encanta ir a tomar el ""Majestic Champagne Fashion Te"" con sus exclusivos éclairs diseñados por Bulgari, Ferragamo, Jimmy Choo, Cucinelli y Rosa Clará. Todo ello al son del pianista los miércoles, jueves, viernes y sábados. La gastronomía del Majestic es exquisita de la mano del chef estrellado Michelin Nando Jubany, espectacular el Brunch de los domingos con showcoocking y acompañado todo por Möet Chandon. En verano es imprescindible la terraza ""Dolce Vita"" con sus espectaculares y los aun mejores cócteles en las ""Majestic Sunset Sessions"". Del Spa destacar el Yoga. Y como no sus habitaciones, increible dormir en un hotel con tanta historia, y si hay lleno total o se quiere estar mas independiente siempre están los apartamentos, con todos los servicios Gran Lujo 5*.",5,2017,05,27
11,Excelente combinación!!,"El hotel Majastic se encuentra ubicado en Paseo de Gracia , a mi gusto mejor imposible! , calle con muchisimas tiendas de grandes marcas y clasicas , restaurant, etc, el hotel es muy lindo , brindan un miy buen servicio , todo el personal es muy amabla y servicial , cuenta con un exquisito desayuno , pileta en el ultimo piso y una encantadora terraza donde se puede tomar o almorzar. Las habitaciones son comodas , recomiendo con vista a paseo de Gracia , sus amenittis presentan una fragancia q fue elaborada es esclusivamente para el Hotel Majastic"" ..... lo recomiendo, si queres q tu estadia sea inolvidable.",4,2017,05,18
11,La mejor experiencia!!!,"Nuestra visita de abril fue la segunda estadía en este exquisito hotel. Desde que uno llega a el empieza a tener experiencias únicas, la atención en el front desk es impecable, el lobby huele maravilloso, las flores, la decoración … todo invita a quedarse allí. 
Las habitaciones han sido decoradas con esmero y buen gusto, y los baños de mármol ofrecen los amenities con el espectacular aroma del hotel. 
Y ni hablar de la comida, que delicia, que variedad! 
Pero lo mejor es el personal, siempre atentos y dispuestos a atender lo que uno necesite. 
Volveré sin dudarlo, es una experiencia que vale la pena repetir muchas veces!!!",5,2017,05,17
11,En relación a ubicación y habitación excepcional.,"El hotel tiene un servicio espectacular, las zonas de la parte de arriba (terraza y piscina en el roof) son geniales pero el restaurante esta en un zulo que no se entiende como un hotel de tanto nombre tiene una sala pequeña para dar de comer a pocos comensales. La comida esta bien pero el sitio que dispone para dar de comer horroroso. Las habitaciones ideales y el baño espectacular. El spa merece ser visitado. La zona de desayuno ideal y el desayuno inigualable.",4,2017,05,12
11,Ricevimento e servizio pessimo,"Siamo arrivati da un volo intercontinentale alle ore 13:00 e ci é stato detto che l'appartamento prenotato non sarebbe stato disponibile prima dell'ora stabilita per il check-in. Siamo tornati mezz'ora dopo l'ora stabilita ma niente da fare ""Sedetevi nella hall, prendete quualcosa al bar a vostre spese e aspettate"". Quando finalmente l'appartamento si é reso disponibile ci hanno detto che dovevamo fare la fila per prendere le chiavi perché c'erano altri ospiti che erano arrivati e dovevano essere attesi. Quanto successo prima per loro era gía dimenticato. La sera, in attesa dell'arrivo di nostra figlia, ci siamo seduti nella zona bar ed abbiamo ordinato uno snack e delle birre. Dopo un'ora abbiamo chiesto che era successo e ci é stato risposto che avevano dimenticato l'ordine. Come si puó considerare questo hotel come un 5 stelle? L'appartamento era decente ma niente di straordinario. Ci sono molti hotel nella zona piú economici e migliori. Noi sicuramente non torneremo nel Majestic!",1,2017,05,02
11,Perfetto,"Hotel di lusso in posizione ideale sul Paseig de Gracia. Hall molto elegante, stanze spaziose e molto curate. Letti e cuscini molto comodi. Wifi naturalmente gratuito. Bellissimo il roof con bar e piscina con vista sulla città. Colazione di prim'ordine per qualità, quantità e varietà dei prodotti. Personale ottimamente preparato, e attento alle esigenze. Un ringraziamento particolare alla bravissima Lucia che ha seguito il nostro gruppo. Un hotel assolutamente da consigliare",5,2017,05,02

11,El hotel perfumado,"Este hotel huele muy bien. Huele como un italiano recién salido del apartamento de Lloret un sábado de julio.

Resalto esto porque el resto de atributos van en línea con lo que uno espera de un cinco gran lujo: servicio exquisito, habitaciones cómodas y cuidadas, localización...

No obstante, a este hotel le sucede lo mismo que a tantos restaurantes y negocios del centro de Barcelona. Uno se sienta a tomar una copa en su bar y aquello parece el aeropuerto de El Prat con gente haciendo tiempo hasta el embarque.",4,2017,04,27
11,Mejorable,"Para ser un Hotel de 5* es muy mejorable. El personal de recepción no es muy amable, entiendo que las habitaciones no estén listas a las 14:00 horas, pero hay muchas maneras de decir las cosas. La habitación requiere renovación. Nada especial que comentar. Lo mejor su ubicación. Hay otras opciones en Barcelona a mejor relación precio calidad",3,2017,04,24
11,Comodissimo,"Hotel che rispecchia gli standard di un 5 stelle.Struttura molto bella,camere eleganti e confortevoli,palestra fornita,SPA di livello,bar del terrazzo pieno di avventori,da cui si gode una meravigliosa vista.L'Hotel gode di una posizione ottimale per il turismo,siamo nella strada top di Barcellona.
Una nota di merito per il sig Fernando responsabile alla recepcion,all'arrivo per un disguido con l'agenzia avevano sistemato me e la mia famiglia in un bel appartamento,ma in un residence di proprietà dell'hotel,giusto difronte.Ovvio che quella situazione non era di nostro gradimento.
Con tempestività,e gentilezza,dopo educate rimostranze da parte nostra,ci e' stata accordata una junior suite di valore superiore con up-grade gratuita.

ci avete reso questo soggiorno ancora più fantastico.
A presto",5,2017,04,23

11,Ottimo come sempre o quasi,"Quando vado a Barcellona per lavoro, una o due volte l'anno, è questo l'hotel dove mi fermo e che, finora, ha sempre soddisfatto tutte le mie aspettative: la posizione centrale è ottima, reception e servizi ottimi anche loro, le camere molto buone (a parte quest'ultima volta che, complice, spero, il basso anticipo della prenotazione, avevo la finestra del bagno con vista ... tubo dell'aria). Una seganalazione particolare merita la colazione: francamente, in giro per il Mondo, ne ho viste poche altre così ""imperiali"" ... spero la prossima volta di ri-avere una delle solite buone stanze.",4,2017,04,18

11,Muy buen hotel y situación,"Que Barcelones no conoce el Hotel Majestic. Su situación en el Paseig de Gràcia lo hace encantador. El interior lujoso y majestuoso, conservando el encanto de cuando lo inaugurarón en el año 1914. Hemos estado en uno de sus salones invitados a la cena de gala de la Feria Advanced Factories. Tanto la cafetería como el salón perfectos. la cena servida del cocinero Jordi Jubany, me ha gustado mucho, principalmente el aperitivo.

La habitación no me pareció lo mejor que he visto considerando el costo del hotel. Closets muy pequeños. El desayuno es bueno, pero para el nivel del hotel, podría ser mejor. El wi fi no funcionaba bien en la habitación.",4,2017,03,10

11,"Super gelegen, top Komfort und toller Service","Als Familie nutzten wir ein wirklich exklusives Apartment, welches sich gegenüber des Hotels befindet. Dieses war optimal für 4 Personen ( 2 Erwachsene und 2 große Kinder). 2 Schlafzimmer, 2 Bäder mit Dusche und Wanne , ein großer Wohnraum und eine sehr gut ausgestattete Küche lassen nichts vermissen. Man kann den Service des Hotels komplett nutzen und hat aber die Möglichkeit seine Alltag incl. Versorgung selbst zu organisieren. 
Das WLAN ist kostenlos.
Die Lage des Objektes ist genial.Man befindet sich auf der Prachtmeile Barcelonas. Alle Sehenswürdigkeiten sind zu Fuß oder mit vorhandenen Verkehrsmitteln problemlos und in kurzer Zeit zu erreichen. Einkaufen und Essen  - auf dem Passeig  - besser geht es nicht.",5,2017,02,21

El servicio en el hotel es digno de un hotel 5 estrellas. Está ubicado en el corazón de Barcelona en calle Passeig de Grácia.

11,Brunch ideal,"Hemos ido mi marido, mi hijo de 2 años y yo a hacer un brunch.
Nos ha encantado tanto la comida, como la bebida y el servicio ha sido genial.

Zona con primeros o entrantes excepcionales  a base d patitos elaborados y cosas sencillas pero deliciosas como ostras, berberechos, almesas, jamón, quesos .. .
Segundos muy ricos también y postres sin igual, delicioso todo.

Cocktails y bebidas con café incluido.
Objeción el cocktail de la terraza va con un 20% de descuento pero contando con que el bruch cuesta 60€ ya podrían marcarse el detalle de que  la primera copa estuviera incluida. Mojitos 18€ gin tonics 19€ aún con el descuento la visita sale por 150€ minimo.

He de decir que volveré pero las copas me las tomaré en el restaurante...
",5,2017,01,15
11,Excelente hotel,"Muy buena ubicación, pese a estar en pleno Paseo de la Gracia, el interior de las habitaciones es muy silencioso y pudimos descansar con mucha comodidad. El servicio es muy bueno en general. La terraza estuvo bonita, pero lamentablemente había gente que insistía en fumar en el ambiente cerrado y el personal no hacía mucho al respecto. Cabe señalar que, a diferencia de los demás ambientes del hotel, el servicio de la terraza del hotel es bastante lento tanto para tomar el pedido, para traer la comida y demoran infinitamente para traer la cuenta. 

Hay que resaltar los desayunos, son excepcionales. La variedad y calidad de productos es impresionante, es un placer tomar un desayuno en este hotel. El servicio del personal de los desayunos es impecable. También recomiendo especialmente los huevos revueltos, les quedan deliciosos. 

Es un placer estar hospedados en este hotel. La próxima vez que vayamos a Barcelona, sin duda vamos a escogerlo.",5,2017,01,02
11,Un cambio para mal,"Siempre que hemos ido al Hotel, que no ha sido la primera vez, el servicio ha sido excelente, así como el desayuno y habitación, pero esta última vez pagamos una habitación con vistas y estas eran tejados de las casas colindantes y dormir fue una tarea ardua imposible por habernos instalado al lado de una extracción de calefacción cuyo ruido constante e intermitente hacía imposible conciliar el sueño.
Las disculpas al marchar fueron muchas pero tengo que decir que el Hotel no hizo gala de su fama ni prestigio.",3,2016,12,30
11,"GRAN LUJO, SOBRETODO EN EL PERSONAL","Es uno de esos lugares que todo el mundo conoce en Barcelona pero que muy pocos disfrutan, ver su fachada en el mismísimo Paseo de Gracia y su decoración interior en Navidad ya es de por sí todo un placer. Una estancia corta para celebrar la Navidad que se no hizo todavía más corta por el trato del personal, hay decenas de personas en todo momento dispuestas a hacerte la vida más agradable, su terraza el día de Navidad con 18 grados al sol y la ciudad a tus pies fue algo que no se olvidará fácilmente. Su habitación enorme y con todo detalle, no es un hotel nuevo pero su calidad se mantiene. El desayuno magnifico, le pondria quizás todavía más alternativas para los que no comen carne, pero es magnífico. El Bruch de Navidad todo un placer y un exquisito servicio, el bar interior es de una placentera armonía y un desfile de nacionalidades, el personal es una joya, ese si es el GL del Majestic. Gracias a todos ellos y en su representación a la Mariona Sabatés - Guest Relations Manager del Hotel. Ha sido todo un placer conoceros.",5,2016,12,26
11,Día especial,"Mi mujer tenia una reserva echa en este fantástico hotel (sorpresa), para celebrar mi cumpleaños... y vaya sorpresa!
El hotel es fantástico, la junior suite un encanto, la decoración del hotel espectacular (mas aún en navidades) y el personal inmejorable! Muy buen trato, que te hace sentir realmente bien!
La zona de la terraza es muy acogedora, con unas vistas impresionantes sobre la ciudad, con unas mantas y ""calefacción de fuego"", dando un toque romántico a la estancia!
El desayuno con productos de gran calidad, frescos, y con imaginación.
Nos encanto, y volveremos seguro! Gracias por todo!",5,2016,12,21
11,VOLVERÍA MIL VECES,"Sin duda de los mejores hoteles en los que he estado. Ubicación, buenas habitaciones y la mejor atención de todas. Grandioso e imponente hotel, donde te hacen sentir que eres importante. Todos los productos de baño y tocador son de Bvlgari, las habitaciones están remodeladas y la terraza con su bar son imperdibles.",5,2016,12,19
11,Desilusión,"Al igual que años anteriores, hice reserva en el Hotel Majestic de una habitación doble con vista a calle Valencia, dado que en Mayo de este año ocupamos una allí y nos pareció bien. Al hacer en check-in se nos ofreció un upgrade, quizás por ser cliente antiguo, de una habitación con balcón mirando Paseo de Gracia. Aceptamos si mirarla pues pensamos que con upg la pieza sería mejor que la reservada por nosotros. Lo del balcón daba lo mismo...noviembre, lluvia, viento, frio, etc.
La habitación resulto ser bastante más chica que la reservada por nosotros, con poca iluminación y además el baño pequeñísimo. Hicimos ver en recepción que el upg no nos favorecía y que preferíamos la reservada por nosotros. Se nos ofreció el cambio, pero dado que ya habíamos desempacado maletas y estábamos muy cansados nos quedamos en esa pieza. El baño muy pequeño y sin ninguna percha, no había donde colgar una toalla ni menos el albornoz. O sea había que dejarlos en el suelo. No tenía espejo de aumento. En un hotel 5 estrellas Gran Lujo asociado a The Leading Hotels of The World es impresentable.
Mi señora acostumbra a pedir su desayuno Continental a la habitación. El primer día llegó con el café servido en la taza. Hasta en un hotel 1 estrella llevan el café y la leche en su respectivo recipiente, el cliente se lo sirve como le apetece. El desayuno más sencillo, todo mal servido. En definitiva todos los días el desayuno con problemas, hoy sólo miel, mañana no trae mantequilla, al siguiente olvida las tostadas, etc., etc. Se nos dijo que era un aprendiz. A lo que contestamos que vaya a aprender con un supervisor y no con los húespedes del Hotel. Al final nos mandaron un regalo pidiendo las disculpas del caso. En el Bar pedí un Gin-Tonic, le dije al barman que nunca había tomado uno más saludable...sin Gin.
En definitiva, desilusión total. pensé había cambiado de administración o dueño, pero eran las mismas caras de siempre. Para un 5 estrellas GL. miembro de LHW, una verguenza.
Estuve después en Madrid en otro Hotel miembro de LHW, que gran diferencia.",3,2016,12,13
11,Brunch inmejorable!!,"Increíble brunch!
Champagne de bienvenida, ostras, jamón y muchas cosas más, todo de un gran nivel.

11,Aperitivo con vista sulla città,Durante una permanenza a Barcellona per lavoro ho avuto modo di fare un aperitivo all'ultimo piano dell'hotel Majestic.

11,Privilegiadas Vistas,"Recomiendo darte un privilegio de vez en cuando e ir a la terraza del Hotel Majestic a comer o cenar o simplemente a tomar una cerveza. Tendrás vistas espectaculares del Paseo de Gracia y Gaudi a vista de pájaro. La conocida manzana de la discordia a tus pies con la Casa Batllo,  la Casa Ametller a tus pies y vistas espectaculares de la Basílica de la Sagrada Familia. Comer en esta terraza es todo glamour y se respira una tranquilidad inalcanzable tratándose del Eixample de Barcelona lleno de coches. A esta terraza no llega el ruido de los motores. Tomar una copa y picar algo nos costó 25 euros por comensal pero realmente valió la pena. Para ocasiones especiales. ",5,2016,10,25
11,Espectacular,Estuve con mi pareja para celebrar una ocasión especial y no defraudó. Nos dieron una habitación preciosa. El hotel ha sido reformado y el personal es muy amable.

11,Un perfecto clasico,"Hemos estado en este hotel y desde antes de cruzar la puerta, el personal se esmera por hacerte sentir especial. Cuidan cada detalle, desde la recepción hasta acompañarte a la habitación y explicarte cada detalle de ella.

Son habitaciones muy clásicas, pero muy acogedoras y amplias. Te sientes muy augusto en ellas!

Todo es perfecto, aunque hay que saber a qué hotel se viene, ya que aunque casi no te hace falta de nada cuando estás allí, me llamó la atencion que no tienen transfer al aeropuerto, aunque lo ofrecen. Pero claro, por unos módicos 140€. Sabiendo que es así, eres libre de cogerlo o pedir un taxi, que me costó 31€.

Es una opción perfecta para visitar la ciudad. Perfectamente situado para poder desplazarte cómodamente a cualquier punto.",5,2016,10,22

Check-In war schnell, freundlich und kompetent. Das Apartment sehr großzügig mit zwei Schlafzimmern, zwei Bädern, komplett ausgestatteter Küche und einem großen und sehr hellen Wohn-/Esszimmer. Alles war sehr sauber und gepflegt, lediglich ein dickes Brandloch im Sofa trübte leicht den Gesamteindruck. Eine defekte Jalousie wurde nach Reklamation umgehend repariert und auch der Bitte nach Regenschirmen wurde sofort nachgekommen. Die Dachterrasse im Hauptgebäude ist sehr schön, der Pool mehr zum Planschen geeignet. Für Spa hatten wir keine Zeit und die Mahlzeiten haben wir außerhalb des Hotel eingenommen. Insgesamt sehr schön, auch für Familien mit Kindern zu empfehlen.",4,2016,09,26

La cama y las almohadas son de una confortabilidad suprema. La atención del personal, estupenda. De la comida no puedo decir nada porque no teníamos el desayuno incluído",5,2016,08,21
11,Caro,"Buen hotel no puedo decir lo contrario pero quizá un tsnto caro para lo que actualmente ofrecen y la oferta barcelonesa. Problema con el aparcamiento al no tener en el mismo hotel. Me cambiaron varias veces la habitación a petición propia pero con mayor coste. En fin, gran hotel pero hay otros más cómodos y si se busca lujo, más lujosos ",4,2016,08,17
11,Gran Hotel,"Es un hotel hermosisimo con una ubicación ideal porque te permite caminar y trasladarte fácilmente. Este lugar cuenta con una terraza donde muy pintoresca, con una linda vista de Barcelona , tiene una pequeña pileta y solarium. Todo el personal es muy servicial y siempre atentos a que tu estadia sea placentera, cuenta con un desayuno completo y una pasteleria francesa destacable.  Al entrar al lugar la fragancia elaborada para este hotel genera un placer especial .Critica constructiva , siendo la categoria de un 5 estrellas no me parece correcto que el servicio de cortesia de café en la habitación sea sólo 2 capsulas al igual q los amenitis sólo dan los muy basicos ( no me resulto de buen gusto). Es un lugar que recomiendo .",4,2016,08,16
11,Lugar sorprendente. ,"Nos recomendaron la terraza del hotel y cumplió con creces las expectativas. Las vistas son impresionantes, el sitio muy acogedor, los cocteles muy buenos y con nombre muy divertidos que nos han hecho sacar una sonrisa. 
La terraza estaba muy ocupada a nuestra llegada, pero los chicos que nos atendieron nos trataron muy bien y el servicio fue excelente, incluso con el local lleno. Me gustaría personalmente agradecer a el chico que nos recibió en la puerta de nombre Sergio y la mesera Leandra. 
El precio de los coctales eran un poco costosos pero valió la pena gracias a la experiencia recibía. 
Recomendado y espero regresar en una visita futura. ",5,2016,08,12
11,Muy buena experiencia en el Majestic,"Elegimos el Majestic para un viaje de Barcelona x 4 dias. Ubicacion inmejorable, limpieza, servicio y estilo. Las habitaciones estan muy bien. Segun mi opinion, lo que tendrian que aprovechar mucho mas es la terraza. Es un lugar increible que tiene servicio de bar y comida que de ser mejor organizada seguramente seria un exito total. El menu es algo limitado y los tiempos largos.. No obstante, este hotel es una excelente opcion y muy recomendable.",5,2016,07,31
11,Un hotel excelente,"Un hotel excelente, muy bien ubicado, en el paseo de Gracia que es una belleza, cerca del metro, con parada del autobus al frente.... Desde que uno llega al hotel el personal del hotel, atento gentil, muy pendiente de los clientes, estoy muy muy contenta con el personal del hotel, la habitación no era muy grande, pero en una habitación cómoda, en un pasillo sin ruidos, el baño muy confortable y cómodo, lo mejor del hotel es el desayuno, un desayuno gourmet, con una gran oferta de comida, todo de primera calidad, las fruta bellísima, variedad de embutidos, variedad de panes, montones de mermelada, y cocinero que te preparan Panque cas, huevos tortillas.

Tiene unas de raza, en el último piso del hotel, donde se ve toda Barcelona, y aparte se puede cenar, a tomarse unos trago, y pasarlo bien con amigos....",5,2016,07,28
11,hacer turismo en casa,"Formé parte de una celebración sectorial que tuvo lugar en el Majestic, la cual fue perfecta, después nos alojamos en el mismo hotel, todo es digno de su catalogación de 5 estrellas, pero hay un apartado que es escepcional y no es necesario estar alojado: el bar en la piscina de la azotea,es sencillamente insuperable, si parais por Barcelona o vivis en ella no os lo perdais,",4,2016,07,26
11,Volveremos siempre!,"Hemos pasado unos días inolvidables en Barcelona y sin duda el Majestic ha hecho su parte. Primero hay que decir su ubicación de lujo, en el centro del Passaig de Gracia que da para caminar a muchos lugares de interés como Casa Batlló y Casa Milá y cantidad de restaurantes todos excelentes; eso sin contar las magníficas tiendas y cafecito a que le rodean.

La ubicación le suma la inagotable cordialidad de todo el equipo que trabaja en este hotel. Desde que llegamos hasta que salimos fuimos tratados muy bien. Recuerdo haber llegado e primer día con un fuerte dolor de cabeza y una de las personas del bar me dicho: ""descanse señora, yo le veo a sus hijos""; en este mundo hoy han hostil, realmente sorprende la buena educación, la amabilidad y paciencia. Viajamos con nuestros dos hijos aún pequeños y fueron muy bien recibidos, les entregaron colores y hojas para dibujar.

La habitación -única-! Hemos tenido la suerte de estar en la 601, habitación de dis balcones con vista al paseo de Gracia; impecable, con todos los detalles necesarios, buen espacio para closet, baño muy cómodo, camas divinas y almohadas para dormir como los ángeles.

No pueden dejar de ir a la terraza a tomar algún trago y comer algo, todo delicioso y con unas vistas panorámicas de la ciudad, incluyendo la Sagrada Familia.

Ni que decir de los desayunos...fue mi sueño de cada día; variado, fresco, rico, las frutas deliciosas, los panes estupendos, jugos naturales, yogurt hecho en casa, fiambres, encurtidos y quesos únicos, no sabía que escoger!

Los ""Concierge"" Mark y Emilio, están para lo que se necesite; desde una reserva en algún restaurante imposible, los tickets de algún museo, alguna dirección y hasta el envío de correo. Todas sus recomendaciones fueron excelentes.

Que si volvería? Sin dudarlo ! Quiero volver muchas veces a Barcelona, y siempre que se conserve así de bueno, regresaremos a este hotel! ",5,2016,07,24
11,Mucho espacio-Pocos detalles,"Las habitaciones grandes y cómodas. Lo mejor, sin duda el desayuno, aunque esperaba más. Para ser lo que es y lo que cuesta hay detalles extraños. Entré en el hotel a las 18:00 horas y salí al día siguiente a las 14:00. Cobraron dos dias completos de aparcamiento. Las habitaciones tienen de todo pero sin embargo en los ""amenities"" no pude encontrar cepillo de dientes, pasta o peine. 
No devuelven el importe de las reservas si no han pasado 48 horas. Éramos 3 y uno no pudo venir. 2 noches perdidas cuando el hotel estaba completo.
Francamente, poco serviciales. He estado en muchos hoteles de lujo y, por lo menos, lo intentan",3,2016,07,21
11,Increiiiiiiiiibleeeeeeeeeeeee,"Que decir de este Hotel típico de Barcelona sobre Paseo de Gracia , un hotel que se gana cada una de sus 5 estrellas , tuve el agrado de pasar 3 noches y 3 atardeceres en su terraza impresionante lugar , pileta en la terraza libre para los visitantes , comida y según ellos las mejores aceitunas del mundo , son unas aceitunas pequeñas rellenas tremendas se puede visitar la terraza siendo o no huésped del hotel es un bar abierto de Barcelona es probable que tengas que esperar un poquito en los sillones de la puerta porque es pequeño y se llena todos los dias , tambien podes ver toda la ciudad de Barcelona de un lado y el otro , como decimos con unos amigos  EXISTE OTRA VIDA  ,

11,Brunch magnífico,"Fui con mi pareja al Brunch de los domingos en el Majestic la semana pasada y nos gustó mucho. Habíamos visto fotos pero en persona es mucho mejor. Mucha variedad y calidad en los platos fríos, los calientes buenísimos y los postres una maravilla. El camarero que nos atendió muy agradable. No le pongo el 5 porque había alguna camarera un poco torpe (te quería retirar platos mientras aún estabas comiendo). La relación calidad-precio inmejorable.",4,2016,07,13

11,Excelente comida y restaurante,"Sencillamente genial. Hemos descubierto el Brunch del Hotel Majestic, y lo hemos encontrado perfecto. Por 59 euros, tienes todo incluido (Buffet caliente y frío, postres, bebidas...Moet Chandon durante toda la comida, vinós...).
La verdad es qie todo estaba muy Bueno: quesos, ostres, tartaletas variades, canalones, tartar, carnes, Rissoto, postres... parecia un gran menú degustación). 
El Servicio de camareros, y la recepción a la llegada perfectos. Trato exquisito. 
cumple todas las expectativas de un restaurante de 5*GL. 
Lástima que el próximo Domingo es el último, ya que en verano cierran el Brunch. Tendremos que esperar a Septiembre-Octubre para volver. Ideal para parejas y celebracions. Todo un acierto. Gracias.",5,2016,07,03
11,Fantastico,Acudi a un evento muy bien organizado. Todo perfecto y el trato genial. Limpio y bien climatizada  la  y un equipo de personas muy profesionales. No  vi el resto de instalaciones pero  seguro que estan a la altura de las espectativas,5,2016,06,21
11,Brunch para los sentidos,"Fuimos a tomar el brunch con motivo de mi cumpleaños y cumplió todas nuestras expectativas.
El trato del personal fue exquisito en todo momento, siempre pendientes de si necesitábamos algo y de que nuestras copas de Moët nunca estuvieran vacías.
La variedad de comida era abrumadora, comenzando por la mesa de aperitivos, pasando por los platos fríos, los calientes y llegando al enorme rincón dedicado al dulce.
Además, destacar el fantástico entorno en el que se encuentra y la paz de la que se disfruta a pesar de haber bastante gente.
Repetiremos sin dudarlo.",5,2016,06,20
11,Beste Dachterrasse von Barcelona . . .,"Man kann einen Abend in Barcelona nicht besser beenden, als auf der Dachterrasse des Majestic Hotel & Spa. Auch als nicht Hotelbewohner hat man Zutritt und der Besuch lohnt sich auf jeden Fall. Der Blick Richtung Mittelmeer und über das erleuchtete Barcelona ist einfach einzigartig und spätestens dann verliebt man sich in die Stadt. Wenn man sich dann noch eine Flasche Champagner gönnt kann man so richtig die Seele baumeln lassen ist die Welt in Ordnung. Der Service ist überaus freundlich und zuvorkommend und die Auswahl an Drinks ist sehr gut. Auf jeden Fall einen Besuch wert.",5,2016,06,14
11,Wir waren als Familie (zwei Erwachsene und drei Kinder) für einen Kurztrip in Barcelona,Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral. Das Appartmenthaus liegt ggü. des Hotels. Sowohl das Hotel mit einer traumhaften Dachterrasse als auch die Wohnung sind sehr gut. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und professionell. Auch als Appartementnutzer können alle Einrichtungen und der Service des Hotels genutzt werden.,5,2016,05,27

11,"Lujoso, confortable y bien situado","El trato del personal es inmejorable, agradables, siempre pendientes de ayudarte y con una sonrisa en la boca . La habitación cómoda y acogedora, aunque el armario me resultó un poco pequeño. El baño es muy confortable y con una enorme bañera para darte un baño de lujo. Maravillosos amenities de Bulgary. 
La ubicación es perfecta, en pleno corazón de Barcelona, en la milla de oro, muy próximo a la Plaza de Cataluña. En el hall del hotel hay una tienda de Chanel. Las vistas desde la terraza son fantásticas. La piscina y la terraza son maravillosas para tomar el sol mientras te tomas un refresco. Me encantó el perfume que embriaga todo el hotel. En la habitación tienes una muestra, Atelier Cologne. Deliciosa.",5,2016,05,16

11,Molto soddisfatti,"Hotel di gran pregio, in un palazzo antico che conserva il suo originale fascino. Avevamo una junior suite meravigliosa con vista sul passeig de graca. Non potevamo desiderare di più ! Un elogio particolare a chi ci ha seguito, personale qualificato e riservato: ogni nostra richiesta e' stata esaudita e per noi, il personale, qualifica un albergo più di qualsiasi altra cosa. Palestra fornita, terrazza spettacolare e colazione più che completa per noi mediterranei. Sicuramente consigliato.",5,2016,05,10
11,"En cada visita, mejora","He vuelto a hospedarme en el Majestic, en esta ocasión por motivos laborales, la verdad que en cada visita, mejora. Es como sentirse en casa.

desde que entras en el hotel, el concierge, Marc, hace un trabajo increible, ayudandote en todo cuanto puede, dando sugerencias de restaurantes... un trabajo impecable.

en esta ocasión, pude disfrutar de las vistas de la terraza y la verdad que hacen que pienses que no estas en el centro de la ciudad. 

Volveré seguro ya que cada vez me gusta mas este hotel. 

recomiendo que lo visiten, merece la pena, tanto las habitaciones, el trato, el desayuno... en general TODO.",5,2016,05,02
11,Meraviglioso,"È senz altro uno degli hotel più ricchi di fascino della città. La location magnifica permette una vista meravigliosa in particolare dal suggestivo terrazzo. Camere belle e spaziose è ottima colazione. Vale sicuramente una visita. Indimenticabile il profumo di acqua di colonia che aleggia negli spazi comuni.

11,Una de las mejores atenciones que hemos tenido en todo el mundo,"El hotel es excelente; buenas instalaciones, muy bien ubicado, pero por sobre todo una excelente atención de todo el personal; el check-in, los servicios de habitación, el bar, los restaurantes y en especial el concierge. Todo el mundo se preocupa de agradar al pasajero con la mejor disposición y voluntad.
Una de las mejores experiencias de atención que hemos tenido en hoteles e primer nivel",5,2016,04,20
11,EXCELENTE,"Excelente ubicación. Excelente desayuno, con variedad de platos calientes, finger sancwiches, frutas, cereales.  Excelente ropa blanca, limpieza y amenities. Nuestra habitación era amplia pero sin vista. En un próximo viaje a Barcelona sin dudas elegiría hospedarme nuevamente en este hotel. Super recomendable el bar de la terraza para disfrutar de las vistas de la ciudad",5,2016,04,16
11,Semana placentera en Barcelona,"Alquilamos un departamento muy bien equipado, puro confort. Dos dormitorios con 2 baños, living comedor amplio, balcón y cocina con todo lo necesario para disfrutar una estadía. Recorrimos mucho y conocimos, casi diría con detalle, Barcelona y alrededores. La ubicación del hotel es excelente. También el personal. ",5,2016,03,26
11,Superó nuestras expectativas,"Ciudad de México

Costo-calidad excelente. Con todas las comodidades a nuestra disposición. El concierge Ángel es muy amable y lo hace sentir a uno como en casa y con buenas sugerencias para conocer Barcelona. En resumen: Invitados a regresar. Su ubicación en la ciudad lo hace todavía más recomendable. ",5,2016,03,26
11,Opinión,"Estuvimos desde el 18 de marzo hasta el 24 y hemos tenido la posibilidad de viajar y conocer distintos hoteles y apartamentos. Desde la ubicación, comodidad, limpieza y la disposición de todo el personal en especial Carlos con sus consejos de donde visitar lugares turísticos , debo de decir que va a ser difícil superar la experiencia vivida!!! Además con motivo de nuestro 25 aniversario nos recibieron con bombones y champagne. 100 puntos, volvería a ir, lo único que me faltó fue comprar la fragancia del Majestic así  seguía recordando a la distancia dicho viaje.  Gracias Jorge Tolosa",5,2016,03,25
11,El mejor hotel en Barcelona!,"Sin duda, la mejor opción para hoteles en Barcelona. La belleza del exterior del edificio es solo un reflejo de la maravilla que es este hotel. El staff es increíblemente cordial y profesional, la habitación y el baño, cómodos, limpios, bellos. El mejor desayuno de hotel que hemos tenido. Barcelona es una de las ciudades mas bellas del mundo, y quedarse en este hotel hace la experiencia de estar en esta ciudad aun mas placentera. La unibacion no puede ser mejor. Estabamos indecisas entre quedarnos aquí, el W o el Arts, y por suerte nos quedamos aquí. Cualquiera de los otros hoteles hubiera sido un error. Gracias a todos en este estupendo hotel por recibirnos como nos recibieron!",5,2016,03,24
11,excelencia,"una estadia soñada, elegancia, sofisticacion, una antencion increible desde el inicio de la estadia, una terraza viendo todo barcelona a pocas cuadras de la sagrada familia, indudablemente mi estadia en Barcelona es en este hotel",5,2016,03,20
11,Vergonzoso. Evitad las habitaciones deluxe!,"El hotel está en muy buen estado pero no es ni mucho menos de 5 estrellas. 
Los pasillos parecen ratoneras, las habitaciones son minúsculas y no tienen nada de luz. 
MUCHO cuidado: cuando hagais el checkin no permitais que os dejen ir solos a la habitacion: a muchisimas habitaciones no se accede desde el mismo nivel al que para el ascensor. Si teneis la espalda mal o vuestro esquipaje pesa demasiado, necesitais SIN FALTA un botones, ya que hay que subir y bajar muchos escalones. 

También, si quereis una experiencia 5 estrellas os recomiendo evitar las habitaciones deluxe. Al parecer todas dan a los patios traseros, algunas, como la mía, lamentablemente con unas vistas a otras casas a muy pocos metros. Horrible! 
Ademas, se oye todo desde los pasillos, adiós intimidad! 
El servicio de habitaciones es excesivamente caro, para una comida mas bien pasable. 
Yo no creo que volveria, aunque quizas pruebe algun dia alguna habitacion superior, para ver si puedo mejorar mi opinion. 
",2,2016,03,19
11,Kurzaufenthalt mit Familie,"Ich habe in den letzten Jahren schon öfter in diesem Hotel gewohnt, es hat sich
leider sehr zum Schlechteren verändert:

Zimmer sind verkleinert worden, Badezimmer selbst einer Junior-Suite so kalt wie
möglich ohne der Möglichkeit zu heizen. Schränke fast unzumutbar eng.

Im Rahmen dieser Preiskategorie sicher nicht mehr empfehlenswert.",3,2016,03,10
11,CASI PERFECTO.,"Excelente desayuno- comida, en uno de los hoteles
con mas magia de Barcelona.
Gran bufet frio con una magnifica variedad de platos
y con una calidad muy buena y ademas muy,muy 
bien hechos.Excelentes embutidos, buena tabla de
quesos, salmon,ensaladas,panes,enfin casi un 10
en lo que son los entrantes, pero el Sr Jubany, se
tendria que fijar un poco mas en el apartado de los
segundos o calientes, a estas alturas de la pelicula
no es de recibo que en lugar tan excepcional, por
ejemplo tengan el bacon requemado, o el pescado
como lo tienen o..........Para mi gusto los segundos
no estan  en consonancia con el bufet frio, pues este
probablemente es el mejor de Barcelona.
Gran servicio con un personal extraordinario, sala
preciosa y elegante donde degustar un brekfast
casi, casi celestial.A  mi parecer de los 3 mejores
de Barcelona, FELICIDADES Y GRACIAS por hacerlo
bien.",4,2016,03,09
11,Tolle Lage mit Pool und Bar auf dem Dach,"Wir waren bereits 2014 schon einmal im Majestic und sind seitdem immer dort, wenn wir nach Barcelona fliegen. Das Hotel hat eine hervorragende, sehr zentrale Lage. Man kann (fast) alles sehenswerte zu Fuß erkunden. In dem sehr schönen, historischen Gebäude (top saniert und echter 5-Sterne Standard) empfehle ich die Junior Suite(n). Der Service im Hotel ist ohne Makel. Speziell der (wenn auch kleine) Pool auf dem Dach lädt zum entspannen ein. Dort kann man auch am Nachmittag schon schön die ersten Drinks genießen.",5,2016,03,05
11,Königliches residieren,"Das Hotel hat eine ausgezeichnete Lage am Passais de Gracia. Umringt von noblen Shoppingboutiquen wird man zum bummeln und flanieren eingeladen.
Das Hotel zeigt sich ebenfalls in noblen und exklusivem Flair. Zimmer sind großzügig eingerichtet, sauber und komfortabel.
Frühstücksbüffet sehr variantenreich und ausgezeichnet. Die Tischaufteilung ermöglicht den großen Andrang an Früstücksgästen am Morgen abzufertigen. Was zugleich ein wenig an Exklusivität mangeln lässt.
Insgesamt ein sehr gutes Hotel mit toller Bar am Dach, die einen traumhaften Ausblick über Barcelona biete.",4,2016,02,12
11,la mejor ubicación,"la ubicación es ideal. estás en el barrio de casa Batlo y de la Pedrera. A la mayoría de los lugares turísticos se accede caminando o se toma un bus en la plaza Cataluña que queda cerquitica. el Aero bus que viene del aeropuerto Le Prat te deja a pocas cuadras. es el lugar ideal para moverse de noche sin temor. La atención del hotel es inmejorable. no es el típico hotel de trato elegante pero distante, al contrario se destaca la calidez. El desayuno es d lo mejor.",5,2016,02,09
11,"Sobre todo, sentirse muy bien atendida por el personal",Pasando vacaciones en Barcelona. El hotel tiene una ubicación excelente. Las habitaciones ejecutivos muy espaciosas y muy buena la calidad del descanso. Baño espectacular. Todo impecable. Nada para criticar. Para volver sin lugar a dudas.,5,2016,02,05

11,"Ein Stadthotel wie viele, ohne erwähnenswerte Details...","Die Lage des Hotels ist sicherlich das Highlight des Hotels. Aber im direkten Vergleich zu den anderen Top-Hotels in Barcelona fällt es doch merklich ab. In der Rezeption ging es so hektisch zu ""wie auf dem Jahrmarkt"", es war wirklich kein herzlicher Empfang. Die Einrichtung der Zimmer und des Hotels ist mit viel Marmor verarbeitet; dabei aber traditionell konservativ und lieblos, ohne Besonderheiten. Daneben fehlte uns die individuelle Betreuung durch das Personal; auch vermissten wir die sonst üblichen Aufmerksamkeiten für Leading Club Mitglieder. Das Personal war sehr zurückhaltend und sachlich; es fehlte uns die Freundlichkeit, auch wenn das Haus ausgebucht war. Für uns aber keine Entschuldigung. Ein Stadthotel wie viele, ohne erwähnenswerte Details, einfach nur langweilig.....Hätte auch ein Vier-Sterne Haus sein können.",3,2016,01,17
11,Barcellona,"Visitato Barcellona in Dicembre fantastica location nuova e a due passi dalle rambla. La zona è la più esclusiva di Barcellonacpiena di negozi di tutte le griffe, ma soprattuto c'è casa Batlo che vale il prezzo del biglietto per la visita, da consigliare anche piazza reale .....",5,2016,01,11
11,"Lindo, servicio al cliente incomodo ","Me hospedé solamente una noche, pensaba quedarme más ya que vi las fotos y parecía hermoso; lo cual es cierto, es precioso , cómodo , el hotel está muy bien situado, tienes tiendas por todos lados cerca, museos, restaurantes, etc. Pero el servicio de los colaboradores me pareció malo ya que yo llegue y no estaba arreglada "" fancy "" y no me atendieron de lo mejor, cuando estaba por hacer el check in espere al rededor de 15 min para que me dijeran que allí no era y yo tuve que preguntar, nadie fue a atenderme, ya que estaban muy ocupados con un grupo de hombres que al parecer eran famosos o importantes, 
Si me hospedo en este hotel que no es para nada barato es lógico que tengo suficiente dinero para pagarlo . 
Me parece de muy mal gusto que su servicio sea "" como te veo te trato """,3,2016,01,10
11,"Livello alto, ma il GL e' altro!","Viaggio di famiglia. Junior suite x quattro: spaziosa e luminosa, ma divano letto scomodo per due ragazzini, mancavano cuscini e coperta per il quarto, oltre set di cortesia, acqua, ciabatte accappatoio ecc. tutto da richiedere ....
Trattamento speciale come bottiglia in camera e biscottini, macon possibilità solo di farsi un caffè ( no tea! ) e soprattutto inaccettabile che alle 5 del pomeriggio non fosse ancora passato il Room Service e che all'improvviso, dopo aver suonato alla porta e nonostante le nostre voci, apra ed entri un cameriere per "" controllare il mini bar"" mentre tutti noi eravamo in mutande a riposare! All'interno della cabina armadio luci non funzionanti e.....36 euro per una colazione, di livello alto si, ma non superlativo per qualità del settore dolci, e' veramente troppo. 
Servizio alla hall ed alla concierge,  quello si, di gran lusso. 
Se si chiede tanto, si deve dare tutto.",4,2016,01,03
11,Prestigio assoluto....con qualche incertezza.,"Soggiorno : famiglia di 4 persone due adulti e ragazzi di 13 e 10 anni.

Periodo:   4 notti Capodanno 2016.

Posizione : 
(a) eccellente in una delle zone più esclusive di Barcellona; 
(b) vicina alle principale attrattive.

Camera : 
(a) bella suite silenziosa, ampia , luminosa;
(b) vista con doppia finestra  sul Paseo de Gracia - 
(c) letto matrimoniale adulti (supporto, materasso , cuscini) : perfetto; 
(d) letto supplementare ragazzi tipo sofa-bed con rete e materasso entrambi decisamente inaccettabili per struttura, confort e qualità (mio figlio soffre di allergie alla polvere) anche perché la parte verso i piedi era inclinata e ""scivolava"" verso il basso (accade spesso in alberghi di livello che il letto dei minori non venga curato e che i virgulti non trovino diritto ad un riposo adeguato ma solo ad una sistemazione ""ortopedicamente non corretta"" : insomma un 5 Stelle GL deve essere tale anche per i più piccoli : peccato!); 
(e) bagno molto bello : ampio con vasca , doccia e nel complesso perfettamente attrezzato (set cortesia ecc.); 
(f) accessori arredamento vari ok e  graditissima macchina caffé + compendio di biscottini da thé. 
(g) apprezzato omaggio di benvenuto con bottiglia di bollicine di buona qualità.

Personale : impeccabile : cortese, efficiente  e  di  adeguato livello.

Pulizia : ineccepibile.

Servizi : 
(a) colazione con prodotti di qualità ma, a mio avviso, decisamente limitata nella varietà ( manca ad es. un adeguato settore di prodotti biologici) e comunque decisamente molto,molto cara per l'offerta (in città si trovano facilmente piacevoli soluzioni più caratteristiche e di pari livello qualitativo a prezzi decisamente inferiori); (b) non abbiamo usufruito di altri servizi preferendo ""immergerci"" nella città per pranzi , cene, intrattenimento ecc.. 

Rapporto qualità-prezzo : adeguato al livello (ma non per la colazione).

Note particolari: 
(a) singolare che in un 5 Stelle GL un addetto dell'hotel, nel pomeriggio del 2 gennaio 2016 alle ore 16,00, abbia aperto la porta della nostra camera con la chiave di servizio mentre eravamo tutti dentro e, nonostante la presenza e le rimostranze dei miei figli, li abbia ""bypassati"" entrando senza bussare (!!!) nella zona in cui io e mia moglie stavamo riposando ....solo per controllare il frigo-bar!! L'ho considerata un ""leggerezza"" e non ho protestato ma in strutture del genere (e non solo in queste) è meglio che non accada!  

In definitiva del nostro soggiorno posso dire: hotel di eccellenza da tutti i punti di vista con qualche caduta: (a) per la sistemazione dei minori che dovrebbe sempre rispettare uno standard di confort adeguato al livello  anche quando si utilizza un sofa-bed, (b) per l' incredibile ""intrusione"" in camera di addetti ai servizi.

Ci tornerei e ci torneremo.

11,Perfecto hotel en Barcelona,"El Majestic es la mejor opción para una escapada a Barcelona. Todas sus características son excelentes, la ubicación céntrica en Barcelona, el trato impecable de todos sus empleados, la calidad de la comida en todos sus restaurantes (y las vistas desde la azotea), el buffet del desayuno dispone de una variedad y calidad increible.

Destacar también el SPA, donde poder relajarnos y elegir alguno de sus múltoples tratamientos",5,2016,01,01

11,Encantador hotel,"El Majestic tiene una localización privilegiada para quien desea realizar largas caminatas por los diferentes y maravillosos barrios de la Ciudad Condal.

11,Casi perfecto,"Teniendo en cuenta la localización del hotel, la calidad y la majestuosidad que impone, es un hotel casi perfecto.

Fue ideal para un fin de semana de descanso y relax, de la mano de amigos.",4,2015,12,04
11,5* aber wenig Mehrwert,"Wir hatten über Opodo (davon kann man nur abraten) das Majestic für ein langes Wochenende zu Zweit gebucht. Schon bei der Ankunft gab es die erste Überraschung, ein winzig kleines Zimmer ohne! Fenster und mit Steh-Bad (kleine Dusche). Nach Verhandlungen mit dem Management gab es ein Zimmer mit kleinem Fenster und mit Badewanne. 
Weiter ist die Ausstattung des Hotels sicher der Standard in 5* Hotels, aber was hat man von einer Dachterrasse mit Mini! Pool bei der eine Cola 7Eur kostet!?
Das Frühstück ist mit 35Eur sehr teuer und absolut nicht zu empfehlen, gerade mit Hinblick auf die tollen Cafés in der Umgebung. 
Der Spa-Bereich ist klein und selbst die Sauna kostet 15Eur für 30min.

In Summe: 5* auf dem Schild, aber welcher Mehrwert ergibt sich für den Gast?!

Wir buchen nächstes Mal lieber ein Hotel mit weniger Sternen, buchen dort die höchste Kategorie und sparen min 100Eur p. Nacht. Oder wir steigen gänzlich auf neue Angebote a la AirBnB um. In Zukunft sollten sich solche Hotels ohnehin fragen welche Daseinsberechtigung sie haben werden.",2,2015,12,01

11,Recepción impresionante ,Entras y ya te sorprende. Me encanta la decoración ( el estado de la moqueta no). La amplitud y la luminosidad son puntos muy positivos para la recepción de un hotel. Su restaurante de desayunos tipo Buffet está muy bien y el mobiliario está bien cuidado. El restaurante un buen conjunto con el resto del hotel. Buen trato y profesionalidad. Buenas habitaciones. ,5,2015,11,25

Personal muy atento y agradable, especial mención al concierge Angel, buenas recomendaciones me dio, le agradezco la ayuda prestada. 

La habitación, preciosa, con vistas a la calle Valencia y Paseo de Gracia, con su pequeña terraza para salir a tomar el aire, un lujo despertar y poder salir a sentir Barcelona desde la altura del piso 7.

Continuando con la habitación, muy comoda, la cama... increible, el baño ideal....

respecto a detalles, mimo en el trato, las zapatillas ubicadas en cada lado de la cama, los amenities de calidad Excelente... y la bienvenida al entrar en la habitación... Botella de agua, bombones y mensaje del director del hotel (como estos detalles quedan pocos...) asi mismo, cada día, al hacer la habitación, botella de agua pequeña a cada lado de la cama, colonia y reposición de amenities en el baño. 

El desayuno, buffet, excelente, buena calidad de productos, personal muy atento llevando el café a la mesa... y giños a los pequeños de la casa con ""piruletas de chocolate blanco y lacasitos"" en los donuts.  (me arrancaron una sonrisa al ir a por los desayunos)

11,Che vacanza splendida,"Siamo stati 3 notte in questo bellissimo hotel circa un mese fa. 
La posizione dell hotel è SUPER CENTRALE, meglio di cosi non potrebbe andare, in pieno passeig de Gracia. La colazione è un qualcosa di spettacolare, ci sono numerosissime portate e tutte, e sottolineo tutte, sono un qualcosa di favoloso.
Le camere sono molto belle e il personale è molto disponibile.
Si, è vero, è abbastanza costoso... forse un po troppo, ma la posizione di questo hotel e il modo in cui si presenta fa in modo che alla fine uno ci passi sopra",5,2015,10,27
11,Serenidad dorada,"Unos dirán que ha perdido su lujo y que su oferta no se adecua a los tiempos actuales.  Ciertamente el majestic ya no es un emblema de barcelona como antes, los tiempos han cambiado, pero aun reina la calma y la serenidad de los spots históricos.

Ampi saloni, marmi, lampadari, mobili in stile, tutto il repertorio classico dei grandi alberghi delle grandi città d'Europa. Le camere sono ben arredate, ampie e dotate di lussuosi bagni. 
Non trascurate la colazione del mattino, il roof garden con bar, mini piscina e vista su tutta la città, in particolare verso la Sagrada Familia.

11,Costa troppo,"Non è' un 5 stelle
      Troppo caro per i servizi che offre. Colazione sempre uguale. Spiaggia orrenda e cara . Camera non da 5 stelle .. Albergo troppo grande e con servizio dozzinale. Camera rumorosa......",3,2015,10,02
11,Elegante eficacia,"El hotel es fantastico,lo mejor en Barcelona,con diferencia,servicio eficaz y super amable.
El hotel en mi opinión solo necesita aislar un poco mejor del ruido exterior,en algunas habitaciones .
El brunch excelente

11,"Angenehmes Stadt-Hotel, aber...","Kein Zweifel: Das Majestic ist ein sehr gut gelegenes, sehr elegantes und gepflegtes Hotel. Angenehm fällt die gute Geräuschisolierung der Fenster auf. Man hört auch bei denen zur Straße gelegenen Zimmer kaum Straßenlärm, der dann doch beträchtlich sein kann.

Das Zimmer selbst ist nicht das größte, aber für einen Kurzaufenthalt vollkommen in Ordnung. Gut gefällt die große begehbare Dusche im Bad.

Ein Highlight ist das Frühstücksbuffet. Die diversen spanischen/katalanischen Kleinigkeiten sind eine tolle Abwechslung zum sonst Üblichen. Auch die frischen Eierspeisen sind lecker (unbedingt die eingelegten Zwiebeln ins Ei rühren lassen), zumal es auch Eggs Benedict ohne Aufpreis gibt.

Nun zu den nicht so angenehmen Punkten (Vorweg: Jammern auf hohem Niveau): Im Zimmer finden sich diverse Gegenstände mit Preisschildern, wie eine Duftkerze und auf dem Bett drapierte Parfümproben mit jeweils wenig dezentem Hinweis auf den Shop im Hotel, wo man diese Produkte kaufen kann. Derartige Verkaufsförderung ist im Motel One akzeptabel, in einem Haus wie dem Majestic aber doch deplatziert.

Aufgepasst, Leaders Club-Mitglieder: Der Status wurde vom Hotel zwar erkannt, wie das Begrüßungsschreiben erkennen lässt. Aber weder wurde das Upgrade gewährt (und es wurde beim Check-in auch keine Begründung geliefert wie ""wir sind ausgebucht""), noch wurde die im Schreiben genannte Aufmerksamkeit geliefert. Nicht, dass dies ein Weltuntergang wäre. Aber an sich Übliches sollte dann auch geliefert werden.",4,2015,09,27
11,Un comfort da 5 stelle,"Albergo la cui categoria viene confermata dai servizi di accoglienza e dalle splendide strutture eleganti e sobrie. Concierge sempre disponibile ed attenta alla sua clientela. Camere silenziose e dotate di ogni comfort. Ci tornerò sicuarmanete anche per l'ottima posizione centrale che consente, nella via più prestigiosa e rinomata della città,  di visitare i punti di maggior interesse turistico. A pochi passi dalle opere architettoniche di Gaudi è un vero paradiso. Provare per credere..... che dire? Benvenuti a Barcellona! ",5,2015,09,22
11,Confortevole,"Hall molto accogliente e personale disponibile. Le camere di categoria superiore sono molto belle pulite e confortevoli. Un elogio particolare alla colazione gustosa e prelibata che offre Davvero una grande varietà di leccornie.
E ' un piacere svegliarsi per recarsi alla colazione. Consigliato",4,2015,09,21
11,Empfehlenswertes Hotel,"Grund der Reise: Städtereise, waren schon in Barcelona im W-Hotel. Dauer 4 Übernachtungen mit Frühstück.

Anfahrt: kein Problem vom Flughafen aus (wir haben der Bequemlichkeit eines der vielen Taxen genommen, ca. 35 Euro).

Einchecken: Zimmer stehen erst ab 15 Uhr zur Verfügung (mit Glück auch schon früher). Check-In etwas versteckt ""um die Ecke"" im Hotel. Gemütlicher ""Wartebereich"".

Zimmer: Doppelzimmer mit Ausklappbett (weil 2 Erwachsene + 1 Kind). Großzügiges Zimmer mit ebenso großem Bad. Blick in den Hinterhof. Stört nicht, weil man sich ja eher in der Stadt aufhält als im Hotel. Sehr ruhig.

Service: Frühstück bis 11 Uhr, also auch etwas für Spätaufsteher. Man wird zum Tisch geleitet. Frühstücksbuffet sehr reichhaltig und abwechslungsreich.
Sehr hilfsbereite Rezeption!

Lage: Hervorragend gelegen zu den Sehenswürdigkeiten. U-Bahn sehr nahe (ca 5 Minuten).

Fazit: Hat seine Sterne verdient!",5,2015,09,17
11,Gut gelegen,"Wir waren eine Nacht in diesem Leading Hotel - unser versprochenes Willkommensgeschenk wurde leider vergessen. 
Das Zimmer war schön, ich hatte mir allerdings mehr erwartet.
Die Lage ist super! 
Die Beduftung in der Lobby ist etwas gewöhnungsbedürfrig. Alles in allem ein gutes Hotel jedoch unter meinen Erwartungen geblieben. ",3,2015,09,14
11,ottimo,"sono stati molto gentili carini premurosi camere stazione pulite servizio di concierge e di room service al top
colazione fantastica ricca  di qualsiasi genere di prelibatezza con la possibilità di richiedere pietanze cucinate al momento

11,Atención Perfecta,"Fui en verano , temporada alta. lo mejor que tiene este hotel es la ubicación, queda en pleno paseo de Grazia al lado de la pedrera, el personal es impecable, todos absolutamente amables y muy buena onda, el servicio es impecable. las habitaciones de super buen espacio y la cama es perfecta.
Los amenites son de bulgary, esquisitos..la terraza del hotel es maravillosa unas vistas de todo barcelona imperdibles. vale la pena!!",5,2015,09,08
11,Un clásico de Barcelona,"Un clásico de Barcelona, hotel de mucho hablar. Creo que esta muriendo de éxito, después de ultima reforma parece que habitaciones están aun mas pequeños. Un buen servicio esto si. Una grand terraza arriba con estupendas vistas a la cuidad. Creo que la terraza es el mejor del hotel.",3,2015,09,02
11,Perfecto,"Llegamos después de un largo viaje en tren y la habitación no estaba lista. Había algún problema con las reservas. Pero... para compensar el desaguisado nos dieron una suite fantástica con una terraza enorme sobre el paseo de gracia. 

Con eso solo ya estaría bien, pero es que la situación del Majestic es perfecta y la comida bastante buena. ",5,2015,08,31
11,Maestoso,Un ottimo albergo in ottima posizione gestito bene e tenuto benissimo. Un unica obiezione sta nel fatto che e' quotato come un 5 stelle gran lusso. Onestamente ripeto credo si tratti di un grand Hotel penta stellato ma non di un Gran Lux.,4,2015,08,19
11,WONDERLAND!!!!,"Estuve alojada en el hotel en mayo, un hotel hermoso lleno de colores, el personal super querido muy amable !! los detalles del hotel cada rincón es hermoso, me encanto !! muy recomendado. La comida deliciosa, pero un poco costosa aunque amerita el precio porque tiene mucha calidad. 

Gracias al personas y a todos los que nos atendieron, nos encanto a mi esposo y a mi !!",4,2015,08,09
11,En servicio el mejor,"Es un clásico de toda la vida en bcn , ideal para un finde de compras , por situación en pleno paseo de gracia . 
Pero lo que mas distingue a este hotel son dos cosas 
Un restaurante sencillo ,  regentado por cocinero de moda en cataluña, en todos los fregados , Sr Jovany, un crack, que es la ultima moda , el cliente se hotel de lujo no quiere pijadas , quiere comer algo bueno y sencillo u de esto no es tan fácil de encontrar .
El segundo punto fuerte del hotel es el servicio extraordinario de todos , se desviven por ti",5,2015,08,01
11,Un Hotel recomendable,"Muy lindo Hotel. Lujoso, cómodo, en el corazón de la Barcelona nueva. Con detalles de estilo que te hacen sentir una reina. No visite la piscina pero la habitación era amplia cómoda lujosa. El baño con amenities adecuados",5,2015,07,29
11,"Sehr elegantes Grand Hotel, zentral gelegen","Das Majestic ist sehr zentral, in einem neoklassizistischen Gebäude an der luxuriösen Haupteinkaufsstrasse im Herzen Barcelonas, in der Passeig de Gracia gelegen. So kann man fast alle interessanten Plätze der Stadt zu Fuss erkunden. Das 5-Stern-Hotel, das auch Mitglied bei den Leading Hotels of the World ist, wurde sehr schön renoviert, insbesondere auch die allgemeinen Räume und die verschiedenen Restaurants (El Patio, El Bar, Restaurant Condal, und La Dolce Vita). Es bietet allen Komfort, den man sich wünscht; WLAN ist im ganzen Haus kostenfrei; Parkservice.
Obwohl die Rezeption während der Haupreisezeit stets stark in Anspruch genommen wird, sind die Mitarbeiter zuvorkommend und hilfsbereit.
Unsere Juniorsuite im 8. Stock liess bezüglich Grösse, Ausstattung, Komfort usw. keine Wünsche offen. Einzig nachts mussten die Fenster geschlossen bleiben, sodass sich die Umgebungsgeräusche in Grenzen hielten und unseren Schlaf nicht störten. Hilfreich waren dabei auch die beiden separat einstellbaren Klimaanlagen (eine im Schlafteil und eine im Aufenthaltsteil).
Das Frühstücksbuffet schien uns für spanische Verhältnisse sehr reichhaltig. An einigen Tagen war der Andrang so gross, dass man einen Moment warten musste, bis ein Platz frei wurde. Doch der Service war dann freundlich und flink.",5,2015,07,18
11,Con la familia,"Excelente hotel, ubicación envidiable y las vistas de la terraza únicas, habitaciones muy cómodas y amplias , recomendable al 100.

11,"Servicio de bar normal,nada de 5 estrellas","El otro día después del trabajo estuvimos tomando algo con unas compañeras en el rooftop del hotel, las vistas son impresionantes y el ambiente a pesar de la magnitud da pie a relajarse. 
La hostess fue muy amable con nosotros y nos avisó con un tiempo de espera correcto.
El único fallo es que tardamos en ser atendidos al menos 15 minutos y algun camarero parecía algo agobiado, una camarera pasó a nuestro lado diciendo en voz alta y negando con la cabeza:""esto es un desastre,esto es un desastre..."".
Me parece lógico su stress dado el movimiento que había de gente,pero si pagas un elevado precio por ser un bar de 5 estrellas ,al menos debería haber más camareros en sala para satisfacer lo que esperamos y pagamos, sin sensación de ser una molestia cuando llegamos.",2,2015,06,10
11,tutto perfetto,"Appartamento confortevole, elegante e pulito. posizione centralissima, staff gentile e disponibile. Non abbiamo soggiornato in hotel, ma nella dependance di fronte, essendo famiglia numerosa, abbiamo affittato un appartamento.

11,Gutes Hotel mit freundlichem Personal und sensationeller Dachterrasse,"Das Hotel liegt etwas entfernt vom Stadtzentrum entfernt an guter Shopping-Lage. Die Zimmer sind stilvoll eingerichtet.

11,Fantástico.,"Un hotel clásico ubicado en el paseo de gracia, muy cerca de todo y con la mejor terraza de Barcelona. El piso 10 es una gran sorpresa, una pequeña alberca y sillones alrededor que permiten ver toda la ciudad (pude tomarme un par de cervezas mientras oscurecía y ver poco a poco como se ilumina la sagrada familia, excelente experiencia).",5,2015,05,21
11,Tuve complejo de zapato,"Nos obsequiaron con una habitación superior a la reservada, menos mal, la habitación pequeña bueno muy pequeña y tenía un pase pero el cuarto de baño minúsculo, vamos un aseo con ducha, si uno de nosotros estaba dentro el otro tenía que esperar que terminara.
Creo que al unirle un edificio contiguo han salido habitaciones como las de una casa de muñecas
Pero no todo es malo
El personal de diez, ni una mala cara ni un mal gesto y mira que dimos la lata.
El desayuno también muy bueno había de todo y reponían con rapidez
El bar muy bien y con unos precios muy asequibles comparándolo con el de las habitaciones
El Spa también muy bien aunque el sitio muy mal, terminas de relajarte y al salir te encuentras en la terraza llena de gente tomando copas",3,2015,05,10
11,Un lujo,"El hotel es un hotel de lujo que es impresionante. Impecable las instalaciones, el servicio, y todo acorde con el precio. Lo mejor que tiene es la terraza.

11,EL LUGAR JUSTO CON CALIDAD SUPERLATIVA,Estructura muy fina. Habitaciones cómodas y bien equipadas. Camas y almohadas para disfrutar de noches de profundo descanso. Atención fina e inteligente de parte de todo el personal. Bar muy bien equipado y con gente con toda la onda.,5,2015,04,29
11,traditionelles Grandhotel mit modernem Komfort,"Ideal gelegen an der mondänen  Passeig De Gracia . Ein Dezent Luxuriöses Haus mit Prachtvoller Fassade. Lichtdurchflutete Glänzende Marmorhalle , Blumenschmuck und helle Flure. Die Atmosphäre im Haus ist gediegen und zum Wohlfühlen. Die Einrichtung ist zeitlos und nicht überladen wie teilweise in anderen Traditionshäusern. Der Stiel gefällt mir gut. Die Junior Suiten sind grosszügig und mit dem üblichen Standard ausgestattet. Praktische Badezimmer. Bequemer Schlafkomfort. Ich hatte mein Zimmer gegen die Strasse was aber kein Nachteil war. Lärm war nur schwach wahrnehmbar was für eine gute Isolierung spricht. Das Frühstück bietet ein umfangreiches Buffet mit qualitativ hochwertigen frische Produkten. Schön präsentiert. Die Roof top Bar ist Trendig gestaltet und bietet eine wunderbare Rundumsicht. Ein mini Pool ist ebenfalls vorhanden. An einem milden Abend oder zum Sonnenuntergang ist es wirklich ganz toll da oben. Auch die Bar im unteren Stock des Hotels finde ich sehr gelungen und lädt zum verweilen ein. Gediegen mit gutem Lichtkonzept und sehr aufmerksamen Team, wie im ganzen Haus. Das Majestic kann ich empfehlen für Leisure oder Business. Es hat die 5 Sterne verdient, Bravo !",5,2015,04,27
11,Sensacional,"La ubicación es perfecta! El servicio impecable, las habitaciones cómodas, los bares y restaurantes suculentos,  en definitiva creo que de lejos, el mejor hotel que he disfrutado en Barcelona. Es un lugar, donde a uno le gustaría quedarse a vivir!! Sensacional ",5,2015,04,27

11,Inmejorable trato,"Ha sido una estancia muy agradable. Como en todos los hoteles, pueden surgir problemas, pero el personal es de lo más diligente para solucionarlos. Las habitaciones están muy limpias.

11,De lujo,"El nombre lo dice todo. Desde que llegamos nos atendieron con amabilidad. Hotel de lujo, muy bien ambientado, entre lo moderno de la nueva Barcelona y a la vez vemos cuadros y pinturas que lo hacen ver clásico. El cuarto es pequeño para el costo de la habitación, pero muy limpio y las personas del higiene van dos veces al día a recogerlo y dejan chocolates y chinelas. 
El buffet es el mejor presentado que haya visto, tienen el mejor yogourt, un chef haciendo tortillas, pero excesivamente costoso. 
Tremendo hotel, lo recomiendo a quien lo pueda costear.",5,2015,04,07

11,La mejor opción en Barcelona,"Muy buen hotel, excelente ubicación, pero el servicio necesita mejora. Tuve que recordar varias veces pastillas de café, jabón, agua. La actitud del servicio en restaurante del desayuno muy mala, excepto las hostess que si eran muy amables.",4,2015,04,02
11,Un paraíso catalán,"Primera vez en Barcelona y en este fabuloso hotel. Nos ubicamos en una suite con una hermosa terraza privada. Todo un lujo pero para ser vivido. La suite en desnivel. El hotel excelentemente ubicado y la atención de primera. Con un mayordomo, llamado Toni, dispuesto para todo. Tomar un Vega Sicilia y luego ir a ver al Barcelona frente al Real fue de las mejores cosas en este viaje. Me enamore de esta ciudad. Me enamoré de este hotel. No duden.",5,2015,04,01
11,Un privilegio ,"Como es costumbre cada vez que viajo a  Barcelona me hospedo en este maravilloso hotel

11,ANUNCIA  UNA CATEGORIA QUE NO CUMPLE CABALMENTE,"este hotel se anuncia como 5 estrellas gran lujo y asi lo confirma con la tarifa que ofrece. en realidad no llega a esa categoria en absoluto, tanto en atencion como en el nivel de la habitacion. posee una ubicacion excelente. 
como detalles de nuestra experiencia puntualizo que debimos cambiar de habitacion pues no reunia las condiciones minimas de lo que habiamos reservado y partiendo tambien de la base que reservamos habitacion deluxe, la segunda habitacion que nos dieron tampoco reunia las condiciones y no contaban con otra alternativa o por lo menos no lo intentaron",3,2015,03,28
11,Spa divertido,"Fui con una amiga al spa con un bono descuento de tan solo 15 euros para una hora conseguido en Atrápalo. Nos lo pasamos genial y además nos ofrecieron un cocktail en la terraza al finalizar, desde donde se veía toda la ciudad de Barcelona desde arriba.",5,2015,03,25
11,Soggiorno piacevolissimo,"L'hotel è molto bello ed elegante. La location è ottima, vicino ai migliori negozi e alla Casa Batllo. Il personale è gentile e disponibile. Insomma, ci sono proprio tutti i presupposti per un indimenticabile soggiorno in una città davvero affascinante!!",4,2015,03,23
11,Experiencia irrepetible y máxima comodidad.,"El Hotel tiene la virtud de hacerte la vida FELIZ.
Edificio. Habitaciones. Servicios. Restaurante (desayuno y comidas). Bar. Limpieza. Situación. En fin: TODO.
Y lo principal: Personal SUPERAMABLE!!!
Detalle de la sensibilidad del Hotel y su personal: Soy muy aficionado a la F1. Como en otras ocasiones coincidió mi estancia con Grandes Premios de madrugada, me ponen una televisión en uno de los bares para no interrumpir el descanso de mi mujer.
Esta vez pulían el suelo del bar. Solución: Me dejaron una habitación contigua a la mía para ver el Gran Premio.
Pequeño ejemplo de hacerte la estancia FELIZ.
Resumen: Un 100 sobre 10.",5,2015,03,22
11,Un hotel muy agradable con excelente ubicación,"El hotel está ubicado en un lugar perfecto: tiene cerca una estación de metro, está a unas pocas cuadras de Plaza Catalunya y tiene las mejores tiendas alrededor.

El hotel, no tiene un pero; de los hoteles de lujo mejores de Barcelona y, entre ellos, el más asequible.
Por lo demás, fantásticas zonas comunes, fantástico spa, increíble restaurante (éste si, caro, quizás hay mejores opciones en Barcelona para cenar...).
Su ubicación, perfecta, cerca de todo y alejado de lo no agradable.
Que decir, muy recomendable.",5,2015,03,10
11,Perfetto,"Situato su una delle più prestigiose vie dello shopping,lontano dal caos della Rambla che è però, tranquillamente raggiungibile a piedi.
Camera Deluxe Executive, confortevole, non molto grande, ma con una meravigliosa vista sulla Passeig de Gracia.
Ottima e ricca la colazione.
Staff molto gentile e disponibile.",5,2015,03,03
11,La perfezione di un 5 stelle in una delle location migliori della città,"Visitare alla grande Barcelona vuol dire anche poter alloggiare al Majestic: 
la location è semplicemente spettacolare sotto tutti i punti di vista - siete nella via più elegante della città, dove i negozi di lusso vi accarezzano e appena usciti dall'hotel alzando lo sguardo a sinistra trovate la fantastica casa Battlò di Gaudì. La Metro, praticamente sotto l'hotel , vi permetterà di raggiungere qualsiasi punto della città agevolmente. Vicinissima anche la fermata degli autobus se necessitate dell'EXPO. i taxi invece praticamente sono sempre sotto l'hotel.

Ma veniamo all'hotel: costruzione imponente all'esterno non delude nei suoi interni, lussuosi e lucidi. Il bar al piano terra ha un piano bar gradevole dove incontrare amici, svolgere affari o semplicemente rilassarsi.
Le stanze, anche quelle di livello standard, forse non sempre spaziosissime, sono però curatissime nei particolari e in bagno troverete prodotti profumati e di lusso.
La colazione è degna di un 5 stelle, forse un po' caotica ma il personale fa di tutto perchè il servizio si svolga con efficienza ed attenzione. La reception è molto efficiente e il personale professionale e gentile come ci si attende dallo standard in questione.
Per chi vuole l'hotel ha servizi SPA e un ristorante che pare sia anche di ottimo livello.
Una pecca? Il bar sul roof garden: dicono goda di una vista spettacolare ma quando ci sono andata io (novembre inoltrato) e sono salita al piano, il personale  mi ha detto essere chiuso!

Peccato.... da andarci dunque nella bella stagione per massimizzare il tutto!",5,2015,02,12
11,Excelente hotel en Barcelona,"Espectacular hotel por ubicación, infraestructura, pero sobre todo por la atención de sus colaboradores todos muy atentos y con muy buena actitud para atender y dar respuesta a los huéspedes, los chicos y chicas de la recepción, del restaurante, el bar de la terraza y los bell boys son muy educados y amables, el hotel es de un estilo muy particular y preciosa arquitectura, sus habitaciones muy iluminadas y la limpieza impecable, encantada de hospedarme en Majestic Hotel & Spa Barcelona, si vuelvo a esa maravillosa ciudad, me quedaría de nuevo en este hermoso hotel.",5,2015,02,03
11,Colazione super,"Quello che mi è piaciuto di piú di questo hotel e' stata la colazione....fantastica,spaziale. Sembrava di essere nello stesso momento in una mega pasticceria ed in un ristorante . Non ho mai visto una cosa del genere in altri hotel a 5 stelle . A disposizione dei clienti c'erano i pasticceri ed i cuochi e non mancava proprio niente. Mi ha deluso però la camera , arredamento un po' datato e vista su un brutto sottoscala . Tutto il resto ... Eccellente, dai servizi al personale. Ottima posizione in centro.",4,2015,01,25
11,Perfetto ed elegante,"Siamo stati a capodanno dello scorso anno... Hotel perfetto in tutti i sensi: elegante,pulito e personale molto cordiale...da non tralasciare: POSIZIONE STREPITOSA!
Un po' caro ma è normale per questo tipo di hotel! 
Con le lucine di Natale è spettacolare! ",5,2015,01,22
11,Más de lo esperado,"Por encima de nuestras expectativas, nunca pensamos que pudiéramos pasar tan maravillosos días alli. Ubicación inmejorable, servicio de lujo, habitación de ensueño, en ninguno de mis viajes encontré una cama tan cómoda, una nube. El baño nuevo.
Recomendable tomar una copa en el lobby por la noche, tiene un encanto especial",5,2015,01,11
11,Un diez al Brunch del Majestic.,"Yo  no me he alojado nunca en el hotel, pero si he ido en dos ocasiones en el Brunch que hacen los domingos, y lo recomiendo totalmente. 
Tienen una gran variedad de entrantres frios, platos calientes y postres. Está todo riquísimo.
El personal de sala es muy amable y atentos, están pendiente de todo en todo momento y no falta un detalle.
Si avisas con antelación, te pueden preparar el pan sin gluten, y no tienen ningun problema en hacerte algun plato a parte sin gluten para que lo pruebes.
Lo recominedo cien por cien. Es exquisito!",5,2015,01,02
11,Coccolarsi a Barcelona,"Bellissimo hotel nel Passeig de Gracia con personale cortese e disponibile. La camera molto elegante, confortevole e spaziosa con affaccio sul Passeig. Spa e bar all'ultimo piano con vista mozzafiato sulla città. Colazione molto curata con prodotti di qualità e variegata. L'unico inconveniente è stato chiedere un medico senza chiedere anche il costo che si è rivelato veramente esorbitante, e si poteva pagare solo in contanti al medico.",5,2014,12,27
11,Experiencia inolvidable,"No oldivaremos nuestra estancia en el Majestic. Era el cumpleaños de mi pareja que me invitaba al Brunch. Que por cierto, completamente recomendable, alta cocina a precio bajo, es un buffet a 60€ por persona que te permite degustar una selección de platos calientes y frios muy elaborados y con productos de alta calidad, y puedes comer y beber Champagne Moet tanto como quieras. Los detalles marcan la diferencia y el equipo de Majestic tuvieron unos cuantos con nosotros. Ya en el Brunch, le sacaron una pequeña tarta para que soplar las velas. Y luego tuve la suerte de poder darle una sorpresa a mi pareja, había reservado una habitación sin que ella supiera. Querría destacar la predisposición y ayuda prestada por los chicos del Guest Experience que hicieron posible la sorpresa, estuvieron impecables en todo momento. La habitación Junior Suite espectacular con vistas a Paseo de Gracia, una de las mejores habitaciones en las que he estado. Botella de Champane y ramo de flores en la habiración. Ninguno de los dos olvidaremos la experiencia en este super hotelazo. Muchas gracias a todo Majestic por hacer posible esta experiencia inolvidable!",5,2014,12,27

11,Love it!!,"Lo ame!! Es un hotel maravilloso...

El personal es super amable desde el principio mostraron una actitud positiva y dando tips de los lugares alrededor asi tambien de como trasladarme al Camp Nou porque tenia boleto para el partido del dia siguiente!!
El hotel esta muy limpio y las habitaciones de muy buen espacio, la terraza esta increible!!
Talvez lo unico que no ame fue la cama que eran 2 twins pegadas y se movian un poco pero como estuve sola no fue mayor problema para mi pero talvez podria serlo para los que van en pareja!!

Esta super bien ubicado tiene todo cerca... tiendas, restaurantes, farmacia, linea de metro, paradas de tour bus, tiendita de conveniencia, etc!! Definitivamente si algun dia regreso a Barcelona no dudaria en hospedarme en este hotel!! Lo recomiendo ampliamente...

Una regia  :)",5,2014,12,09
11,BUON RATING (con un -),"hotel di ottimo livello, felicemente ubicato a metà del Passeig de Gracia; dal roof-bar si gode una stupenda vista su quasi tutta Barcellona; la spa è di assoluto valore; breakfast con ampia scelta e di ottima qualità; camere e servizi adeguati alle 5 stelle. Giudizio finale: promosso, con voto 8- .
 Il meno è giustificato da una ""scivolata di stile"": al cambio biancheria, non si possono mettere asciugamani bucati e strappati dall'usura, e sono certa che la direzione terrà conto di questa segnalazione.",4,2014,12,03
11,Barcelona es bona i el Majestic mijor,"El pasado fin de semana nos alojamos en el Majestic y fue una experiencia muy gratificante. El personal de recepción impecable y atento, tuvimos un pequeño problema en la habitación asignada por olor a tabaco y nos cambiaron inmediatamente. 
El desayuno fantástico y digno del paladar más exigente. La habitación correcta y las sabanas tenían un olor muy agradable. 
Llovía muchísimo pero teníamos paraguas a nuestra disposición. 
El bar y su personal a la altura del establecimiento.Y además uns noche en la ópera en un marco tan incomparable como el Liceo.Que más se puede pedir para disfrutar.

11,"brllo, ma con contrattempo inziale ...","sulla qualità dell'Hotel, del personale e dei servizi non ho niente da dire, tutto all'altezza della fama e del costo. inizialmente però mi hanno assegnato una stanza più piccola di quella promessa da booking e senza bidet. ho telefonoato alla reception e subito mi hanno cambiato stanza assegnandomene una coerente con quanto avevo visto su internet. contrattempo o strategia dell'hotel che riserva le stanze meno belle ai siti ?!? 
in ogni caso , ripeto, servizio e accoglienza ineccepibili, posizione strategica e centrale in una città magica.",4,2014,11,03
11,Ubicación ,"La ubicación es excelente,  su atención muy buena,  las habitaciones de primer nivel y también su baño,  excelente aseo y muy elegante el salón de desayuno y comida. 
Precio muy acorde a lo que es el hotel nos encantó el sector seguro y todo cercano ",4,2014,11,01
11,Hotel con un servicio estupendo,"El servicio es estupendo, el restaurante ofrece menus al mediodia a muy buen precio y con una calidad superior.
Las habitaciones son pequenias y para llegar a la nuestra habia que subir 4 escalones.
La terraza en el 10 piso tiene una vista de 360 grados sobre toda Barcelona, algo espectacular.
En el looby, aunque pequenio, por la tarde se puede disfrutar de la musica que proporciona un pianista.",4,2014,10,19
11,El Hotel EXCELENTE,"Nos gustó TODO. La ubicación: inmejorable. A metros de La Casa Battlo. El Paseo de Gracia. A 500 metros la Plaza Cataluña y las ramblas.
El servicio: Tiene elegancia, prestancia, profesionalidad, cortesía y eficiencia.
Las habitaciones son amplias, con baños de marmol lujosos y funcionales, excelente servicio de wifi y muy cómodas. La ropa de cama es muy suave y la almohadas muy cómodas. Muy limpias.
El bar situado en la terraza es una delicia por las vistas que proporciona de Barcelona. Ünico. Además piscina, bar y comidas rápidas.
Por último: el desayuno. EXCELENTE y a un precio que no se consigue en otros 5 estrellas. Generoso, exquisito y con cava de cierre para festejar.",5,2014,10,19
11,Wirklich tolles Stadthotel,"Internationales Flair, aber nicht überkandidelt, prima Lage direkt an DER Shopping Meile von Barcelona, schöne wenn auch kleine Zimmer, sehr geräuscharm !, sehr guter Service vom Zimmer und an der Rezeption. Und als Krönung eine Bar auf dem Dach, wo man der Sonne im Westen hinter den Hügeln beim Untergehen zusehen kann. Von der Placa de Catalunya (Haltestelle des Airport-Busses) 5-10 Gehminuten entfernt. Frühstück gibt es 1 Fußgängerampel (20 m) weiter südlich vom Hotel, direkt vor dem Haupteingang der Universitaria de Turisme.",5,2014,10,12

Lo mejor la ubicación, en pleno centro de Barcelona. El resto como cabe esperar, todo muy correcto.
Las vistas preciosas y la piscina genial tambien.
Recomendado!",5,2014,10,06
11,Ideal para una parada en Barcelona,"la localización es perfecta en pleno centro de Barcelona, ideal para una visita a la ciudad. Las habitaciones simplemente correctas, nada especial. Lo mejor la amabilidad del servicio, un 10. Desayuno normal. Volveré ",4,2014,10,04
11,Favoloso hotel in Barcellona,"Favoloso, gigantesco, eccellente, camere molto grandi, servizio al top, dalla terrazza con piscina si vede la sagrada familia e tutta Barcellona.

11,Vistas panoramicas,"    Hola. Llegamos al hotel por casualidad. 
    No nos hospedamos en el.
    Utilamos sus áreas sociales y el restaurante que esta en el último piso (10) donde se encuentra la terraza y una pequeña 
piscina.
    Las vistas son maravillosas podría decir que de un millón de dolares si fuesen de 360° pero con solo ver la sagrada familia, el Montjuic,  casa Batllo y otras cosas que en este momento no recuerdo:) .
    Tomando un tinto de verano o simplemente unas claritas, pasaran un rato muy agradable.

11,Hat sich gelohnt,"Das Hotel liegt direkt an der Flaniermeile von BCN. Der allgemeine Zustand des Hotels ist gut bis sehr gut. WLAN klappt relativ gut und ist gratis. Gäste sind vorwiegend Touristen und Geschäftsleute. Ob sich der Aufpreis für das Frühstuck lohnt muss jeder selber wissen. Diesmal war es im Paket mit dabei. Ich würde aber keinen Aufpreis von mehr als 15,00 € zahlen, denn genau gegenüber gibt es eine gute Location um das Frühstück einzunehmen.
Direk an dem Paseo de Gracia gelegen gibt es jede Menge an Möglichkeiten zum Einkaufen. Die Hop-On Hop-Off Busse halten einen Block entfernt. Zur Ramblas sind es ca. 10 Gehminuten, zum Barrio Gothico ca. 15. Vom Flughafen fährt der Aerobus für 10,20 € bis zur Plaza Catalunia.
Personal sehr gut und sehr hilfsbereit. Die Zimmerreinigung könnte etwas sorgfältiger arbeiten. Bei uns (442) lag ein kleines Gipsstuck während unseres Aufenthaltes unbehelligt an der wand und die Lampenschirme haben auch schon etwas länger keinen Staubwedel gesehen.
Das Frühstücksbuffet ist der Hotelkategorie angemessen und für spanische Verhältnisse ausserordentlich gut, aber wie Ober schon gesagt.... Restaurant und Bar haben wir nicht in Anspruch genommen, da wir lieber außerhalb der Hotels essen.
Der Pool ist winzig und befindet sich auf der Dachterrasse und bietet Platz zum Liegen für 8 Gäste. Beziehungsweise 4, denn wenn Sie nicht taub werden wollen, können Sie die Liegen an dem Lautsprecher vergessen. Das Hotel sollte die Musik für die Chill Lounge anders organisieren. Die Dachterrasse selbst ist herrlich mit schönem Blick über die Stadt.
Unser Zimmer war relativ klein, vor allem im Schrank geht es ziemlich eng zu. Es gibt eine Nespresso Maschine, aber Achtung die Kapsel schlägt mit € 1 zu Buche. Gratiswasserflasche sucht man auch vergebens. Das Bett ist OK, mehr aber auch nicht. Obwohl Kingsize gebucht hatten wir Twens und die haben sich leicht bewegen lassen! Bad ist ausreichend gross ist aber nur mit einem Waschbecken ausgestattet und Wanne und Dusche sind in einem.",4,2014,09,10
11,Otra fortuna del textil convertida en hotel icono de Barcelona,"Hotel Icono de Barcelona, perfecto para una noche romántica, con su terraza al atardecer, esperando la puesta de sol, con un coktel o en la pequeña piscina adyacente.

11,"Bien ubicado, buen gusto, buena atención","Este hotel es un edificio antiguo de la ciudad, muy bien mantenido y decorado.  Las habitaciones son amplias, bien decoradas, incluye cafetera Nesspreso (el menos la mía), un baño increíble y muy buen servicio de recepción y conserje.  La verdad volvería feliz! Fui con mi marido, no se como sería para viajar con familia.
No use el desayuno porque lo encontré caro.",5,2014,08,03
11,"Bien ubicado , buenas instalaciones","Estuve durante 5 días en este hotel,  está muy bien ubicado y me encantó la atención calidez del personal. Las áreas comunes están muy bien. Respecto a las habitaciones cero pretención ni nada especial full lujo , NO esperes eso en categoría standar ni deluxe . Es un hotel convencional , clásico. Tuvimos una grata experiencia!  ",4,2014,07,25
11,Un muy buen hotel en el centro de barcelona,"Accesos claros y con ayuda de todo tipo. Check-in/out agiles y precisos. Un poquito de lio para acceder a tu habitacion y faltaria algun otro sinoptico. Desayuno tipo buffet excepcional, no falta ni un solo detalle. El acceso a habitaciones bien, pero me temo que en algún caso no han contemplado que hay que salvar escaleras. La habitacion completa de todo lo que se pueda precisar, y el servicio de habitaciones funciona a la perfeccion, FELICITACIONES, os esmerais y se nota (gobernanta-supervisora, camareras), son muchos pequeños detalles y se nota la profesionalidad. No me gusto el bar. El spa fué perfecto y con una gran profesional. La terraza y las vistas, espectaculares, pudimos hacer un picoteo y unas copas en un ambiente perfecto, merece empezar la noche en la terraza. Destaco del hotel, su ubicacion, la amabilidad de todo el personal en especial (servicio de habitaciones, desayunos y mozos de entrada), comodidad de las habitaciones con descanso reparador, desayunos y parte de la decoracion. Volveremos sin dudarlo",4,2014,07,14
11,Muy bien ubicado,"Ubicado en pleno Paseo de Gracia, este hotel hizo de nuestro fin de semana algo muy especial, tanto por su terraza como por todos los empleados del mismo. La habitación muy bien, limpia y espaciosa lo mismo que el baño",5,2014,07,12
11,La terraza,"Espectacular vista de Barcelona. Estuvimos muy agusto, ya habíamos estado cada vez que visitamos Barcelona. Tienen Fantásticos cócteles. Muy buen trato, atentos, me trajeron hasta una mantita para el frío. La música estupenda hay dj. Los sillones súper cómodos. También puedes comer en la terraza .Me encanta lo recomiendo. Siempre esta lleno,mejor reservar antes de ir.",5,2014,07,11
11,Nuestra casa en Barcelona,"Venimos una vez más, el año pasado nos fuimos con la incógnita sobre el bar. Quedó precioso. Sólo tengo que lamentar que han retirado de la oferta el whisky Deward's, el más joven, el que nos gusta. La habitación que tuvimos (623) estupenda. Sobre la ochava. La atención de cada servicio y de su personal son estupendas. El pianista del bar, Efrem, muy atento y con gran dominio de su oficio. Emilio, el conserje, un profesional de primera.",5,2014,07,09
11,Ottimo Hotel,"Abbiamo soggiornato per tre notti presso questo Hotel e siamo rimasti molto soddisfatti. Camere molto belle e lussuose, bagno in marmo bianco degno di nota sia per eleganza che per pulizia. Unico neo delle camere la poca scelta dei canali televisivi, ma è proprio una piccolezza. Splendida vista della città dal decimo piano ideale per fare foto e rilassarsi. C'è anche la piscina al decimo piano che a mio avviso è un po' piccola in rapporto alla bellezza dell'albergo. C'è da dire anche che non è che sia così fondamentale visto la quantità di attrazioni della città. Colazione abbondante, ben presentata e con orari molto ampi (dalle 7 alle 11). Personale discreto, cortese e disponibile. Da segnalare anche la pulizia in generale sia delle stanze che dell'hotel; nelle camere c'è anche una seconda pulizia pomeridiana. Zona molto bella e sicura, ricca di negozi delle migliori marche e ben servita dai mezzi pubblici. Sicuramente consigliato per un weekend di relax godendosi Barcelona, senza sorprese in hotel.",5,2014,07,02
11,Decepcionante,"Pasamos tres noches en una habitación de las que el hotel denomina Deluxe y a las que, desde luego, haríamos un gran favor considerándolas Standard. Ningún detalle ni característica especial de las que te hacen sentir que te encuentras en un establecimiento que merezca la calificación de ""Cinco estrellas Gran Lujo"": ni la decoración, ni las instalaciones, ni los servicios. Una habitación poco luminosa con vistas a un garaje y a una escalera de incendios no es, ni mucho menos, lo que uno espera encontrar en un hotel como el Majestic. Por no hablar de los fortísimos portazos provenientes de las habitaciones del personal de servicio que, a partir de las 08,00 de la mañana sonaban sin cesar. El Wifi, gratuito, no funciona en absoluto. Por lo demás, un personal muy correcto.",2,2014,06,23
11,Hotel muy bueno,"Muy recomendable. En el Centro del Paseo de Gracia, al lado de todas las tiendas de lujo.
Las habitaciones muy bien. El trato de los empleados exquisito.
Recomendable para gente de negocios que venga a pasar 2 o 3 días a Barcelona",4,2014,06,20
11,splendida esperienza,"Mi sembra di sentire ancora il profumo della camera .... mi mancheranno le coccole della buona notte, le colazioni dove c'è tutto ma proprio tutto, il sorriso di Maria alla reception, la cortesia di tutti! Confermo certamente le recensioni che ho letto prima di partire : ottima la posizione, 5 stelle tutte meritate. Esperienza da ripetere.",5,2014,06,16
11,Excelente!,"Estuve sólo un día, la atención es excelente, llegué del aeropuerto a las 9 de la mañana y me dieron la habitación. La habitación era un primer piso mirando al paseo de gracia, muy amplia y cómoda.  En el último piso tiene una terraza con SPA, bar, pileta y unas vistas espectaculares de Barcelona. Sin dudas volvería a este hotel a quedarme más días.",5,2014,06,13
11,Perfect stay!,"Schönes upggrade auf ein Sute mit Balkon zur Vorderseite. Zimmer  war optimal geschnitten und sehr leise, auch das Bad war bestens. Frühstück ließ in Auswahl und Angebot keine Wünsche offen, lediglich der Frühstrücksraum war bei voller Auslastung etwas beengt.
Dachtereasse mit toller Aussicht über Barcelona und mit sehr gemütlchem Pool- und Lounchbereich. Abends tolle Baratmosphäre mit DJ und sehr angenehm gemischtem Publikum wie im ganzen Hotel.
Für mich bisher das angenehmste Hotel unter den Spitzenhotels in Barcelona!!",5,2014,06,09

11,Per me è il migliore di Barcellona,"Sono stato di nuovo al Majestic dal 16 al 18 maggio. Come sempre il mio soggiorno è stato veramente ottimo, l'hotel è, secondo me, il migliore di Barcellona. La location è perfetta, le stanze sono molto accoglienti e conformi alla categoria, il servizio è ottimo, il personale alla reception particolarmente gentile. In particolare il Sig. Fernando si è dimostrato veramente cortese, professionale e disponibile. Tornerò senz'altro!!",5,2014,05,19

11,Una Noche en el Pentágono/house,"Gracias a un gran amigo mío, descubrir una de la suite del Majestic de Barcelona y realmente la disfrute a lo grande es un placer poder recomendar este hotel para que la gente que va a Barcelona tenga un gran sitio donde ir. Recomendable el 100% ",4,2014,05,13
11,Tiene una vista impresionante,"La terraza Dolce Vitae del Hotel Majestic es una de las más chic de Barcelona. Con su remodelación y sus nuevos servicios estoy segura que se convertirá también en una de las más frecuentadas. La gastronomía y los cócteles que ofrecen son de primera, como su servicio. Las vistas dada su privilegiada ubicación permiten disfrutar del atardecer sobre toda la ciudad y mirar desde lejos conjuntos tan impresionantes como la Sagrada Familia o Montjuic.",4,2014,05,07
11,Ottima accoglienza e servizio,"Siamo stati molto contenti del soggiorno nel vs. hotel,camere ospitali e piacevioli, ottima la pulizi e la professionalità dell personale tutto.Moltobella la vista dalla terrazza e buonoil servizio.La parte fitness èpiù che valida. Contiamo di tornarci prossimamente.",5,2014,04,28
11,No llega a la altura de un cinco estrellas,"Lo primero que encuentras es una recepción abarrotada de gente sin nadie que te atienda , obligándote a hacer colas casi siempre. Para el garaje se llevan el coche y cuando lo necesitas tienes que llamar con bastante antelación porque están siempre ocupados y alguna vez se olvidaron haciéndome esperar más de media hora.la terraza es espectacular para tomar un aperitivo con unas vistas fantásticas , pero el servicio deja mucho que desear, nos hicieron sentir invisibles, sentados por un buen rato sin nadie que viniera a atendernos, y obligándome a levantarme para preguntar sí había servicio en las mesas. La habitación no está mal amplia y cómoda . En definitiva creo que para un cinco estrellas son muchas cosas que no van. . Deje comentarios en la hoja de reclamaciones y la respuesta fue que lo sienten mucho, pues muy bien yo también lo siento mucho pero cuando vuelva a Barcelona esta claro que  buscare otro hotel.",2,2014,04,21
11,Muy buena opinión del hotel,"Me gusta el hotel. Está muy bien situado en lo mejor de la Ciudad. La atención al cliente es optima.
Claro que me gustaría volver en cuanto me sea posible.
La ubicación del hotel es inmejorable, muy cerca de los edificios interesantes de Gaudí y otros arquitectos de gran renombre.
El hotel es confortable, las habitaciones espaciosasy lujuosas. Me gustaría volver en cuanto fuera posible y quedar informada de sus precios favorecidos para clientes y admiradores del lugar.",5,2014,04,19
11,Fantastico hotel in centro,"Consiglio vivamente questo hotel. Ho visitato parecchi hotel a Barcellona ma questo e' uno dei migliori. Camera spaziosa, pulitissima, doccia enorme, accessori bulgari, tutto di ottima qualità. Accoglienza fantastica! Assolutamente da provare!",5,2014,04,11
11,Assolutamente NON un 5 stelle!!!,"La nostra permanenza è durata 3 notti. Veniamo accolti molto gentilmente dalla reception ma, arrivati alle 11, troppo presto rispetto alle 15 orario di check in, la camera matrimoniale con bidè da noi prenotata non era ancora pronta perció optiamo per un giro nella città!Tornati in hotel alle 20 e assegnataci la stanza scopriamo che, oltre ad essere minuscola e ad affacciare su un muro con dei tubi, aveva due letti singoli e mancava di bidè.
Così sono sceso per farlo presente alla reception ma dopo essersi scusati mi hanno detto che per quel giorno le stanze erano tutte piene perciò ce ne avrebbero assegnata un'altra l'indomani!In compenso però sarebbe venuto il servizio in camera per rimediare ai due letti singoli e comporli come un matrimoniale. Infatti dopo una mezz'ora è piombata in camera la donna delle pulizie senza bussare ma spalancando la porta, sorprendendoci sul letto a riposarci, assolutamente inconcepibile in qualunque hotel, figuriamoci in un 5 stelle del centro.
Il giorno dopo ci hanno confermato che ci avrebbero cambiato la stanza e i nostri bagagli li avremmo trovati direttamente in quella nuova, inutile dire che così non è andata.
Perciò tornati la sera ed entrati nella nuova stanza, sempre minuscola ma almeno con letto matrimoniale e bidè, ci siamo resi conto che le nostre valigie non c'erano!Allora chiamo la reception ma non ricevo risposta, provo a chiamare il concierge ma anche li nessuna risposta, allora chiamo un operatore il quale mi assicura di risolvere l'inconveniente il prima possibile!Dopo 40 minuti sono riusciti a farci avere le valigie.
Dopo tutte queste vicissitudini aggiungo che l'arredamento e i sanitari del bagno non sono da 5 stelle, la camera non era insonorizzata e il condizionatore era inefficiente.
Non mi ritengo una persona pretenziosa ma avendo pagato per un hotel 5 stelle questi disservizi, come già detto, non sono minimamente accettabili.
Se dovessi tornare a Barcellona, città magnifica, sicuramente opterei per un altro hotel 5 stelle ma non soggiornerei al Majestic.",2,2014,03,24
11,ottima struttura,"Avevamo prenotato per una breve vacanza a fine febbraio presso il Residence Majestic, appartenente alla stessa struttura. Per un disguido con il sito di prenotazione non ci siamo trovati alcuni servizi che ci aspettavamo. Dopo aver chiesto delucidazioni alla reception, nonostante l'errore fosse del sito di booking, il resp.  della reception, Sig. Ravella, ci ha gentilmente offerto una junior suite all'interno dell'hotel senza alcuna spesa aggiuntiva. La struttura è molto elegante ed il personale cortese e disponibile. La ns camera spaziosa, con una bella vista sul Passeig de Gracia, pulita, confortevole e provvista di ogni accessorio. Grazie al Sig. Ravella, il ns soggiorno è stato piacevole e torneremo volentieri nel ns prossimo viaggio a Barcellona.",5,2014,03,17

Alto livello, sicuramente lo consiglio.",5,2014,03,15

El hotel es muy confortable, las habitaciones espaciosas y pueden encontrar el confort adecuado que se puede esperar de un 5 estrellas como éste.",5,2014,02,26
11,Ideales Stadthotel,"Wir sind in den letzten Jahren mindesten schon 10 Mal in Barcelona gewesen, mehrmals haben wir versucht, ein Zimmer in diesem Hotel zu erwischen, es war immer ausgebucht. Diesmal hatten wir Glück, vielleicht, weil wir schon vier Monate im voraus gebucht hatten. Es hat sich gelohnt. Von allen uns bekannten Hotels in Barcelona ist dies das Beste. Wie üblich hatten wir ein sehr ruhiges Zimmer verlangt und auch erhalten. Frühstück ausgezeichnet, Nachtessen in dem etwas verlorenen Restaurant erstaunlich preisgünstig und sehr gut. Sehr empfehlenswert: Den Lunch auf der Dachterrasse an er Sonne zu geniessen. Es gibt dort einen ausgezeichneten Hamburger oder sonst sehr gepflegte Snacks. Alles in allem: Dieses Hotel garantiert einen erfolgreichen Aufenthalt in Barcelona.",5,2014,02,18
11,"Albergo centralissimo, elegante e dotato di ogni confort","Situato nel centralissimo Passeig de Gracia, a pochi metri da caso Battlo, dalla Rambla e dalle principali attrazioni del centro. Stanze molto  ampie (la mia era una standard), pulitissime e dotate di ogni confort.
Lo consiglio vivamente. Un po' troppo caro il costo della colazzione",5,2014,02,18
11,Sehr gutes Hotel - mit einer Einschränkung... ,"Sehr schönes, sehr zentral gelegenes Hotel. Die Mitarbeitenden sind zuvorkommend , freundlich und hilfsbereit. Allerdings klappts nicht immer mit den Versprechen, die der Concierge macht...! Unser Zimmer ging zur Carrer de Valencia hinaus. Wenn man - wie wir - zu Hause sehr  ruhig wohnt, schläft man auf dieser Seite des Hotels sehr unruhig, um nicht zu sagen schlecht. Es hört sich trotz geschlossener Fenster an, als ob die 5-spurige Carrer de Valencia geradewegs durchs Hotelzimmer führt..... Leider fanden die vom Concierge versprochenen Ohrstöpsel den Weg ins Zimmer ebenso wenig, wie die zusätzlich erbetene Decke...! 

Fitnessraum, Spa, Dachterrasse mit Fernsicht und Frühstück sind über jeden Zweifel erhaben - just perfect!  Wir werden bei unserem nächsten BCN-Aufenthalt wieder im Majestic absteigen, aber sicher nur in einem Zimmer, das auf den Innenhof hinaus geht!",4,2014,02,16
11,Nos ha encantado,"Las habitaicones son muy grandes como un 5 stars se merece, mi amigo Bonstanislas y yo visitamos la ciudad recientemente y elegimos este hotel por su ubicación.
El personal es profesional y aunque mi amigo se enfado porque el desayuno no esta incluido cerca hay muchas y buenas cafeterias que en Barcelona las llaman granjas.
volveremos",5,2014,02,09
11,En pleno Paseo de Gracia,"Hotel en el centro de Barcelona, su ubicación es perfecta. El trato es amable y cordial, pero sin detalles. Las habitaciones de aires clásicos pero cómodas y con todas las necesidades, bastante amplias, bueno pedir una categoría con vistas al Paseo de Gracia. Tarifas buenas por ser un 5 estrellas gran lujo. La relación calidad precio es muy buena.
Desayuno muy correcto y variado, en los restaurantes se puede mejora bastante, pero hay muchos lugares para comer a pocos metros del hotel.
Faltaría un poco de trato personalizado y no tan generalizado.
Una buena opción de alojamiento en la ciudad condal.
Felices viajes",3,2014,02,08
11,hotel reformado con gusto pero lo mejor es su personal excepcionalmente amable,"el hotel es reformado con estilo diseño clásico con toque moderno. Los espacios son interesnates. Habitacioens deluxe grandes para esta categoría. Lastima que pocas den a la calle. La atención del personal es excepcional, desde botones, recepción, bar etc-... He visto pocos sitios de este nivel con personal amable, simpatico, servicial. Fui a tomar una copa al hotel vecino MANDARIN y uno recuerda que en ciertos hoteles el personal suele adoptar las actitudes de sus clientes más tontos. Volveremos. Un fallo quizas es excluir el desayuno por principio de las reservas pero fuimos fuera del hotel en las terrazas agradables del paseod e gracia del hotel zurich con tal de tener alguna vista.",5,2014,02,03
11,Charmantes Hotel,"Tolles Ambiente und sehr freundliches Personal! Wir hatten ein Standard Zimmer mit Blick in den Innenhof gebucht, bekamen aber ein upgrade auf ein Zimmer mit Stadtblick. Das Zimmer ist wirklich schön und gemütlich mit einem riesigem Marmorbad. Einzig der Preis fürs Frühstück ist mit 29€ pro Person doch etwas sehr hoch, aber man kann problemlos für kleines Geld in der Nähe frühstücken. Ein Muss: die Dachterrasse des Hotels mit Blick auf die Sagrada Familia. ",5,2014,02,02
11,"Il lusso in centro città""","Se vuoi soggiornare in un hotel cool nella strada più rinomata di Barcellona, l hotel majestic e il posto ideale. Le camere, il servizio, la struttura, le amenità es. Seguono gli standard della catena. Io mi sono trovato benissimo e ci ritornerò sicuramente quando vado a Barcellona. Il prezzo e giusto e la sera il bar e cool.",5,2014,01,19
11,Disappointing,"Efectivamente decepciona y por ello mi puntuación. He estado en prácticamente todos los 5* de la ciudad y este no llega a la media. Y no se por qué tiene un GL. No lo veo. Llegas y te encuentras una recepción-conserjería en medio del paso, casi siempre con cola, con una decoración floral de plástico¡ al lado una mesa con la RRPP siempre sin nadie que atendió pero sin apartar la vista del ordenador ni, por supuesto, intentar ayudar a los que esperan. La recepción necesita formación. Educados y nada más. Ningún interés por la persona, visita o estancia. También mirada absorta de ordenador para saber como es tu reserva. No es tan complicado. Pareció un aeropuerto. Maletero amable. Habitación correcta aunque memorable la insonorización exterior y, por supuesto, las amenities: simple gel-champú y acondicionador, aunque de Bulgaria... Tuve que reclamar tres veces que me subieran un cepillo de dientes. Restaurante triste, sin ningún encanto, con ""vistas"" a un patio interior. Solicite que me hicieran más la carne y tardaron 20 minutos¡ una disculpa y ninguna atención u ofrecimiento. Bar también interior, que lastima estando situados en Paseo de Gracia¡ una Coca cola creo recordar a 6 €. 
Terraza chill out con excelentes vistas de la ciudad, una mini piscina y buen servicio de bar. Excelente la atención en el Spa aunque las cabinas no tienen una ducha y hay exceso de iluminación. Lo mejor es su situación. Lo peor es que no tiene la categoría y su personal necesita ""mejorar"" (formación necesita este sector¡) Por cierto, rellene el cuestionario de satisfacción que me dejaron en la habitación y me sorprende no haber recibido nota alguna después de dos semanas, a pesar de poner una pequeña nota en la que hacia esta pequeña observación esperada. Sin comentarios",2,2014,01,16
11,"CALIDAD, SERVICIO Y BUEN GUSTO","Pues si, esta vez tengo que decir que el hotel Majestic de Barcelona es un gran cinco estrellas G.L. con todo merecimiento.
Sus atenciones, servicios y detalles le hacen ser un auténtico G.L., que es esa categoría que va más allá de las cinco estrellas, ese plus extra de calidad que hay que tener y hay que demostrar y sin duda, el Majestic está a la altura.
Tanto en la amabilidad, la disponibilidad y la profesionalidad de su personal como en los pequeños y grandes detalles, todo lo que se puede esperar de esta categoría de hotel está presente en el Majestic.
Sin duda, muy recomendable.

11,auch ein jahr später immer noch sehr gut!,"Weil es uns so gefallen hat vor einem Jahr, kamen wir dieses Jahr zurück und wurden nicht enttäuscht. Majestic ist nach wie vor ein echtes Grand Hotel mit allen Annehmlichkeiten, die man damit verbindet. Schade war einzig, dass auf der Dachterrasse (von der aus man eine super Aussicht über Barcelona hat) keine Wolldecken oder ähnliches angeboten wurden, denn es war doch relativ kühl im Dezember und wir hätten gerne einen Drink dort oben genossen.",4,2014,01,09

11,Hotel ideale in centro città,"Mentre gli altri due o tre hotel paragonabili sono distanti (a piedi) dal centro della città, l'hotel Majestic è in una posizione ideale, lungo il centralissimo Paseo de Gracia e a pochi minuti da Plaza Cataluna.
Sono tornato di recente e ho soggiornato per una settimana in una camera con spettacolare balcone d'angolo: tutto è stato perfetto.
In particolare il personale è stato rapido efficiente e giustamente premuroso in tutti i momenti, soprattutto nel check-in e check-out.
Dico giustamente perché ho in mente un altro celebrato hotel locale in cui il personale, più esteticamente ed anagraficamente selezionato, sembra formato da automi in stage la cui principale funzione sia quella di salutare a distanza e ad alta voce, in modo impersonale, qualunque ospite appaia all'orizzonte, con una frequenza da apparire fastidiosi.
Anche la colazione, come assortimento e qualità, non è seconda ad alcun altro hotel locale (credo di essere stato in tutti i principali).
Per Barcellona questo hotel è diventato il mio preferito.",5,2013,12,28

11,"Como en este hotel, asi debería ser tratado en todo el mundo, con cortesia y optima aptitud.","Gracias a la sugerencia de mi hija que vive en Malaga, pasamos la navidad del 2012 en este muy comodo recinto, la cena de navidad excelente y sobre todo, la atención de su personal,mejor que si hubiera estado en casa. Sí merece estar en esta página.",5,2013,11,22
11,Trato personalizado excepcional que lo diferencia de muchos hoteles de 5 estrellas.,"Gracias a un concurso de Marie Claire hemos pasado un fin de semana en el Majestic, desde el primer instante que cruzamos la puerta hasta que nos fuimos hemos vivido una experiencia personal increíble, su calidad, servicio y calidad humana destacan gratificantemente.
Aunque no fuéramos perfil nos han tratado como reyes. Simplemente puedo resumir nuestra estancia con una palabra : Mágico!!!",5,2013,11,18
11,Su reconocimiento es bien merecido,"Ubicación inmejorable, confortables zonas comunes, Las habitaciones, como suele ocurrir en este tipo de hoteles en grandes ciudades, un poco pequeñas con baños estrechitos (al menos a mi me ha tocado), pero no le faltan detalles.",4,2013,11,12
11,sensationelles Grandhotel,"Die letzte Zeit war ich häufiger geschäftlich und privat in Barcelona und habe mehrere Hotels ausprobiert. Das Majestic ist eines der besten Hotels, in denen ich die letzte Zeit abgestiegen bin. Die Zimmer sind sehr geschmackvoll und hochwertig eingerichtet (Bulgari Amentities, großes Flat Screen TV etc). Trotz der Lage an einer Hauptverkehrsstraße überraschend ruhig. Sehr freundliches Personal. Tolles Frühstück (auf jeden Fall mitbuchen: köstlich!), sensationelle Dachterrasse mit Blick über die ganze Stadt",5,2013,11,12
11,justo lo que esperaba,"Mi experiencia fue muy buena!!!!, la verdad que el hotel se corresponde con lo que anuncia. Una ubicación excelente, cómodas habitaciones y una atención inmejorable. Lo recomiendo con los ojos cerrados. Mi novia y yo pasamos unos días geniales en Barcelona y mucho fue gracias a la ubicación del hotel",4,2013,11,06
11,Ottimo Hotel nel cuore di Brcellona,"Ottimo hotel in pieno centro: affaccia sul Paseo de Gracia ed è a pochi metri da piazza Cataluna, dalla Rambla e dalla città vecchia.
Inoltre per visitare la città la fermata dei bus panoramici è quasi di fronte all'albergo, sull'altro lato del Paseo.
Le camere sono arredate con molto gusto, linde e profumate. Nel bagno non manca alcun accessorio e il letto era comodissimo e riposante.
Se non volete fare colazione in hotel, uscendo troverete proprio di fronte un piccolo ed accogliente bar dove fanno torte magnifiche ed un ottimo caffè.
A pochi metri gli edifici progettati dal grande genio di Gaudì.
Che dire di più? Non vi pentirete d'esservi fermati qui.",5,2013,10,27
11,TODO LO QUE ESPERABA,"Un hotel muy bien ubicado , la atención es buena pero es un hotel grande y poco personalizada , todo funciona bien y la habitacion es grande , comoda y limpia.En el baño todas las cosas de limpieza son de Bulgary ( a mi esposa le encantó) , está en la parte más linda de la ciudad .El resto bar de la terraza es excelente y tiene una vista imperdible de la SAGRADA FAMILIA y de la torre Abgar.",4,2013,10,25
11,"Muy especial, sorprendentemente excelente.","Estuve en el hotel con mi pareja.
Fue una pequeña escapada y una sorpresa. yo vivo en la misma ciudad y realmente me ha sorprendido la excelente calidad del hotel, las nuevas instalacones de todo el hotel, el spa es maravilloso y la terraza muy recomendable por la noche.
Solo había estado en hoteles de esta categoría y confort en londres y paris, ni siquiera en roma!

El hotel es excelente en todos los aspectos.",5,2013,10,24
11,Muy bien!,"En principio recibimos una habitación pequeña y al indicar que eramos dos en una habitación que parecía individual, nos dieron una habitación más grande y muy cómoda. El desayuno es muy completo y de calidad. El personal no es precisamente amable, yo diría que es serio pero muy correcto para la impresión que quieren brindar del hotel. Cuenta además con una terraza y piscina pequeña pero puedes apreciar la bonita vista que ofrece de la ciudad.  La ubicación es estupenda, en pleno Paseo de Gracia. En general el hotel está muy bien!",4,2013,10,23
11,Extranjera en mi tierra,"Excelente habitación , terraza fantástica con vistas y los mejores helados que jamás comí, trato muy correcto y desayuno de ensueño. Pero nadie, absolutamente ningún empleado del hotel no supo responder en catalán, su inglés perfecto pero agradecerías que te supiesen contestar en tu mismo idioma",4,2013,10,06
11,Optimal gelegenes Buisness Hotel,"Super Hotel mit ausgezeichneter Lage. Sehr zu empfehlen auch die Dachterrasse mit einem phantastischen Blick über Barcelona. Einzig gestört hat, das das tolle Frühstücksbuffett erst um 7.00 Uhr geöffnet hat. Zu erwähnen ist auch die gute U-Bahn Anbindung.",5,2013,10,04
11,Fünf Sterne Hotel mit sehr guter Lage,"Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral direkt am Passeig de Gracia. Die nächste Metrostation ist ca. 100 Meter entfernt.
Die beiden Häuser von A. Gaudi, Casa Badlo und La Pedrera sind in kürzester Zeit zu erreichen.
Das Hotel lässt keine Wünsche offen. Das Frühstücksbuffet ist sehr umfangreich und von sehr guter Qualität.
Am Abend sollte man unbedingt die Bar im 10. Stock besuchen und auf der Dachterasse den tollen Rundblick über die Stadt genießen.

Der einzige happige Nachteil: WLAN ist nicht kostenlos sondern wird mit 15 €/Tag berechnet.",4,2013,10,01
11,Tomar una copa en la terraza de la 10ºplanta,"Fuimos a tomar una copa por la noche a la terraza del hotel. Vistas fabulosas del centro de Bna y ambiente tranquilo con buena musica
 Precios buenos teniendo en cuenta el lugar. Totalmente recomendanle con amigos o para una ocasion especial
 Volveremos.",5,2013,09,21
11,meravigliosa Barcelona,"Hotel splendido, nel pieno centro di Barcelona, ad un passo da casa Gaudì e dalla Rambla, lungo un viale (il Paseo de Gracia) tra i più belli della città. In hotel, tutto è stato come ci si aspetta in un 5 stelle, dalle camere al servizio sempre impeccabile.
E' stata una breve, ma splendida vacanza",5,2013,09,20
11,Non si poteva stare in camera,"Venerdì 13 si arriva a Barcellona majestic 5 stelle ... Posizione ineccepibile nel cuore della città con metropolitana vicina, personale giovane e ben preparato, camera nota dolente per aprire l'armadio ho dovuto spostare il comodino piccola che facevo fatica a girare senza sbattere contro scrivania o mega poltrona , balcincino non pavimentato lasciato a cemento a vista, per fortuna che ho avuto molto da fare e il tempo soleggiato mi ha tenuto tanto fuori, non mi è' mai capitato il un 5 stelle una camera così piccola, nota veramente positiva la terrazza di giorno attrezzata per il sole, piscina , e per il pranzo con vista sulla città, di notte suggestiva con musica e luci da mille e unanotte.Anche la colazione che pachi a parte come la connessione internet era piacevole.",4,2013,09,17
11,Grata sorpresa,"Cada vez que volvemos a Barcelona lo hacemos al Majestic. En esta oportunidad nos encontramos con que, a pesar de la crisis económica española, la empresa mira a mediano y largo plazo y ha acometido una remodelación mayor y muy bien diseñada. La planta baja ha sido la tarjeta de presentación: sobria, eliminando la colección de escalones que separaban los ambientes. Una marquesina preciosa que ratifica su región y su ciudad. Las habitaciones preciosas. Luminosas y muy bien decoradas y dotadas. Los baños estupendos. El desayuno de la mejor calidad posible y con atención impecable. Gema Ravasi atiende como nadie. Carlos, en el bar, es un gran empleado. Atento y con un gran conocimiento del negocio. El personal de la recepción y conserjería resuelve cualquier necesidad de sus clientes.
Capítulo aparte a nuestra inquietud:¿Lograrán sustituir adecuadamente a uno de los mejores bares de España? ¿Qué ya es decir bastante? El ""charm"" y la hospitalidad que hemos recibido en ese bar, son inolvidables! Dios quiera que lo logren.",5,2013,09,04
11,ottimo hotel,"albergo molto bello con camere non eccessivamente,almeno le standard che loro chiamano comunque de luxe,ma ben organizzate.colazione abbondante e di gran qualita anche se non bellissima la stanza adibita alla colazione.la terrazza vale tutto il soggiorno in questo albergo!!offereun panorama eccezionale sia di giorno che di notte su tutta la citta!posizione buona,cinque isolati da placa catalunia e nel ieno dello shopping,con fermata dei taxi e di tutti i bus proprio sotto.",5,2013,09,02
11,HOTEL DA RE E REGINE,Decisamente uno degli alberghi più sofisticati che abbia mai visitato. Tra i suoi ospiti annovera anche il re di Spagna quando si reca a Barcellona. Lussuoso e raffinato.Super la colazione e affabile il personale. Splendido.,5,2013,08,23
11,Stupendo,"Ottima la posizione, servizi e personale affabile e professionale. Arredi e spazi comuni di gran classe e di grande eleganza. La camera era ampia e spazioso, ottimamente arredata e con un grande bagno.
Un hotel consigliatissimo.",5,2013,08,20

11,Hotel Perfecto,"El hotel es muy bonito, están reconstruyendo la entrada principal pero es lo de menos. El servicio excelente no tengo queja. Hermosas vistas desde la terraza y su locación es muy buena. Esta situado en el Passeig de Gracia y muy cerca de todo. La atención espectacular fue una estancia placentera. Se los recomiendo!",5,2013,08,04
11,TODA UNA EXPERIENCIA PLACENTERA.,Estuve buscando muchos hoteles en Barcelona para una ocasión especial y al final hice una apuesta segura. Cuando llegamos la recepción estaba un poco congestionada al momento nos recibió un chico muy profesional y muy amable. Se llama Mario. Nos atendió de una manera formidable. Nos subieron la maleta y nos explicaron la habitación. Me parecía que eso ya no se hacia así que muy bien. La habitación impecable con todo tipo de amenities y detalles. También nos hicieron un upgrade con balconcito exterior. y quedamos muy contentos. No puedo pasar por alto la terraza del hotel....es algo increible. Las mejores vistas de Barcelona tomándote un baño y con alguna bebida no tiene precio. Fuimos por el aniversario de mi pareja y fue toda un experiencia. TODA UNA EXPERIENCIA PLACENTERA. LO RECOMIENDO SIN DUDAR NI UN SEGUNDO.,5,2013,07,30
11,Non merita 5 stelle,"La posizione è eccellente, nel cuore del Paseo de Gracia, e la terrazza sul tetto ha una vista spettacolare. Per il resto ci sarebbero parecchie cose da dire, ma mi limiterò a un paio.
Appena arrivati (alle 16 del pomeriggio) ci hanno detto che la stanza da noi prenotata (e già pagata, tramite booking.com) non era ancora pronte e dopo averci fatto aspettare un po' ci hanno proposto un upgrade per farci entrare subito. Peccato che noi avessimo prenotato una stanza executive e che l'upgrade avrebbe dovuto essere perlomeno una suito o comunque una stanza ben diversa da quella che ci hanno dato, estremamente piccola e molto diversa da come le stesse executive si presentavano delle foto. Delle due quindi, o era veramente un upgrade e allora non oso pensare come sono le stanze semplici. Oppure non si trattava di un upgrade ma di un downgrade, e allora sono poco onesti... E a quanto pare, a leggere altre recensioni anche recenti, è un trucchetto che usano spesso... 
Inoltre il personale è giovane, poco professionale, lento e in alcuni casi un po' arrogantello, in particolare nel bar sul tetto.
Non consigliato.",2,2013,07,29
11,Algún detalle tiene que tener.....,"Un Hotel excepcional en todos los sentidos, desde una recepción muy amigable y cálida ( a pesar que estaban en plena obra de remodelación y con el acceso cambiado) no se notaba para nada y de hecho no parecía que fuera otro acceso.
Fué mi primera vez en este Hotel, pero parecía que fuera habitué del mismo, por eltrato recibido. Las habitaciones impecables, muy confortables y las instalaciones acorde al nombre del Hotel.
Como detalle, y algo tenía que tener, es que en el segundo piso (que es donde estuve alojado) para ir a mi habitación con las maletas, en el pasillo hay una escalera, pocos escalones, pero escalera al fin, y era medio engorroso el traslado, nada, sólo eso.",5,2013,07,26
11,si te quieres quedar en el centro de barcelona el mejor hotel es el majestic y creo que es de los mejores para quedarse,"llegue al hotel majestic de barcelona con muchas dudas acerca del hotel y tuvimos una sorpresa me parecio un hotel muy lujoso un servicio impecable, sus habitaciones todas reformadas y el hotel con mucho ambiente 
segun me explicaron el bar ya va a hacer reformado el unico defecto me parecio que en la recepcion hay a veces mucha congestion lo mismo para hablar con el concierge 
pero lo recomiendo como opcion numero 1 para quedarse en barcelona",5,2013,07,15
11,UN OASIS EN BARCELONA,"En realidad nunca dormí en el hotel pero soy asiduo del bar del hotel , es un oasis de tranquilidad cuando después de haber hecho las compras en el centro te sientas en la cafetería , un servicio impecable , según la hora hay un pianista.",5,2013,07,03
11,Willkommen in Barcelona!,"Das mittlerweile komplett renovierte Hotel laesst keine Wuensche offen! Es beginnt bereits bei der Ankunft. Sollte mit dem eigenen PKW die Anreise erfolgen, wird Vallet-Parking angeboten und man hat sich um nichts mehr zu kümmern.
Das Hotel liegt zentral zur sehr berühmten Fußgängerzone und zu den Bauten von Gaudi, ist also als Ausgangslage bestens geeignet.
Die 5Sterne sind meiner Meinung nach absolut gerechtfertigt. Das Frühstücksbuffet ist Traum! Bei einem solch reichhaltigen Angebot in Bester Qualität kann auf das Mittagessen sehr wohl verzichtet werden.
Umliegend sind einige gute Restaurants und nette Bars zu finden. Die Hotelbar lädt ebenfalls zu einem Schlummertrunk in angenehmer Atmosphäre ein.
Der Spa-Bereich mit der anschliessenden Terrasse bietet ebenfalls einen sehr guten Service mit qualitativ hochwertigen Produkten.",5,2013,07,03
11,habitacion sin ventanas,"Hotel cinco estrellas gran lujo.Precio de 5 estrellas gran lujo.Habitacion sin ventana,ni ventilacion,igual pension sin lujo.Como es posible que contrates una habitacion en un hotel de 5 estrellas gran lujo,y te metan en una habitacion sin ventanas,ni ventilacion.Parecia un zulo.",1,2013,07,02
11,Buono,"Buono. Posizionato in centro. Negozi e/o supermercati ad un passo. Facile da raggiungere con qualsiasi mezzo., bus.....taxi...ecc... Staff gentile ed educato. Camere spaziose. Buon bagno. Sonno non disturbato da rumori circostanti.
Prezzo non eccessivo vista la posizione.
In definitiva....buon albergo.",5,2013,07,01
11,Muuuuy bueno!!!,"Disfrutamos muchísimo la estadía en el hotel. La atención del personal es muy cordial. La ubicación del hotel es excelente, céntrico sobre la calle más bonita de Barcelona! El hotel tiene una terraza excelente que te permite tener una vista aérea de la ciudad impecable, y la atención del bar allí también es muy buena. Las habitaciones son muy limpias y cómodas, como todas las instalaciones del hotel. Muy recomendable!! Volvería sin dudas.",5,2013,06,09
11,posizione strategica...,"è indubbio che un albergo così ben posizionato a barcellona non c'è. infatti a pochi passi si trova ""la pedrera"" e ""casa battlò"" di gaudì. senza contare che è anche a pochi passi da plaza de la cataluna e quindi in prossimità della ""rambla"". io e la mia famiglia abbiamo soggiornato mentre  si teneva un congresso di medici, l'hotel era pieno. mio malgrado in quei giorni stavano ripassando di vernice le finestre esterne con inevitabile , insopportabile odore di solvente . ottimo l'arredo e il livello di pulizia. colazione all'altezza del rango, un pò meno alla reception. ottimo per chi deve pianificare seminari e congressi.",4,2013,06,06
11,Scarsa professionalità in un bel 5 stelle!,"La posizione e gli arredi sono eccezionali, e anche il prezzo non è proibitivo. Quello che ci è apparso molto carente è stato il servizio, in particolare della concierge, composta da giovani assolutamente inesperti a cominciare dalla conoscenza delle lingue, a finire con la contabilità . La cosa più grave è stata che all'arrivo ci hanno proposto come upgrade il soggiorno nel residence situato fuori dell'albergo, sul marciapiede opposto e per la verità piuttosto anonimo negli arredi, a fronte di una evidente disorganizzazione dell'albergo nel gestire le prenotazioni. Al nostro rifiuto ci hanno rifilato una stanza senza bidet che affacciava in una vanella buia... Al terzo tentativo abbiamo avuto la stanza corrispondente a quello che avevamo prenotato e pagato quasi venti giorni prima!!!!!! Poco serio per un 5 stelle!!!",2,2013,05,31
11,5* Hotel im klassischen Sinne,"Das Majestic ist noch eines der klassischen 5* Häuser wie man es aus Spanien oder eher Frankreich kennt und erwartet. Das Haus wurde vor zwei Jahren komplett saniert und modernisiert. Es fehlt an nichts was man in dieser Kategorie erwarten möchte. Die Zimmer sind überdurchschnittlich groß und wie gesagt gut ausgestattet. Wifi gibt es wie zu erwarten nur für einen dezent übertriebenen Obolus. Die Verbindung ist leider auf dem Zimmer und den öffentlichen Bereichen eher unterdurchschnittlich. Dafür ist der Empfang nahezu überall gegeben. Das Personal ist gut ausgebildet und trainiert. Der Service agiert wie an der Militärakademie. Das Frühstück ist definitiv über dem Durchschnitt auch in dieser Kategorie. Einzig das Tütenrührei würde ich weglassen. Dafür gibt's die Live-Cooking-Station. Die Lage könnte zentraler kaum sein. Ausserdem ist meine Lieblings-Tapas-Bude ""Ciudat al Cabron"" nur eine Querstraße und Casa Milla nur zwei Fussminuten entfernt.",5,2013,05,23
11,Todo un regalo al buen gusto,"Este es uno de los hoteles que más me ha gustado, excelente buen precio para todo lo que ofrece, a pesar de ser un hotel de cadena, las habitaciones estan decoradas con gusto y muebles de calidad elegantes y muy funcionales, el desayuno es INCREIBLE, todo riquisimo y no apto para respetar cualquier tipo de dieta, excelente bolleria.
La joya del hotel es sin duda alguna la terraza en la que las vistas con un buen café resultan un regalo a los sentidos.
Tremendamente recomendable.
Personal educado y con buena preparación, muy valiosos los consejos y recomendaciones para visitar la ciudad.
Ayuda mucho lo bien situado que esta.
Pienso volver este año.",5,2013,05,12
11,delicioso,"estuve una semana (laboral) a un precio arregladisimo y disfruté de los auténticos grandes hoteles de siempre.
educación, amabilidad, silencio, intimidad, servicio, ganas de agradar, camas, moquetas, baños....
todo una auténtica delicia.
no volveré más a hoteles modernos si puedo evitarlo.
como les dije e ellos no entiendo que internet no aprecie más estos auténticos hoteles.
si encontrais ofertas, que las hay, no lo dudeis.",5,2013,05,02
11,tutto ok,abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel in aprile 2013 e devo dire che non ho trovato nulla di negativo anche se prima di partire guardando le recensioni non erano proprio tutte così.non abbiamo usufruito della Spa pertanto non posso valutarla .,5,2013,05,01
11,Comodo e bello,"Gran bell'albergo, in pieno centro, vicino alla fermata della metropolitana, dei taxi e a due passi da casa Battlo e dalla Pedreira. Accoglienza e charme da cinque stelle. Stanza molto bella e curata con Nespresso a disposizione. Biancheria molto raffinata e per qualsiasi esigenza c'è un intero team a vostra disposizione. C'è anche un comodo servizio di lustrascarpe che al modico prezzo di 4,50€ le rimette a nuovo. Unico appunto ma comune a molto hotel di questo tipo è il costo della colazione. 29€ a persona, malgrado che venga servisto più dell'immaginabile mi sembra veramente eccessivo",4,2013,04,30
11,tutto a cinque stelle,"Poco da recensire, la posizione perfetta se volete essere nel centro, albergo molto curato, raffinato e qualitativamente eccelso. Stupenza la terrazza con vista! almeno una volta se andate a Barcellona concedetevelo.",5,2013,04,20
11,Posizione perfetta!,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel e mi sono trovata benissimo!!
La posizione é eccezionale... Il quartiere più bello,la metro a due passi così come casa battlô e pedrera. La camera ampia, il bagno meraviglioso, la macchina nespresso una salvezza!
Non ho usufruito della SPA.
Lo consiglio per la posizione.",5,2013,04,15
11,Inolvidable,"Hotel de lujo con excelente atención, ubicación y servicio. Las habitaciones son maravillosas, limpias y la cama ea muy comoda. El baño es amplio y muy limpio. 
La atención es excepcional, al nivel de un hotel de 5 estrellas. Volvería sin pensarlo, superó mis expectativas al 10000%",5,2013,04,11
11,Excedio mis espectativas,"Tiene el mejor desayuno que he visto. Debes controlarte para no comer mas de la cuenta. asegurate de elegir tarifa con el desayuno incluido. Es hasta las 11 am, asi que se puede hacer solo dos comidas al dia. Desde que bajas del taxi hasta que llegas a tu habitacion el servicio es muy amable y alegre. Te hacen sentir que estas muy bienvenido. Las habitaciones estan impecables y de estio contemporaneo. Las camas muy buenas. La ubicacion estupenda!.",5,2013,03,29
11,de lujo son los precios...,"Varias cosas sorprenden en las habitación: La vista a un muro a unos 7 metros de distancia, un armario con su aspecto de estar hecho por un aficionado al bricolaje y con un ancho de 120cm no cumple los requisitos de un 3 estrellas, la falta de una cabina de ducha te obliga usar la de la bañera, algo muy peligroso por no disponer de una agarradera, la falte de una papelera en el baño y la ubicación del calientatoallas (que no funciona) con las toallas del baño en la cabina del WC, donde  no hay cepillo.
La puerta al pasillo conecta directamente con el dormitorio lo que permite escuchar las conversaciones de las camareras. La temperatura del aire acondicionado no se deja graduar.
Los sillones del bar son de diseño pero incomodos por ser muy bajos sin embargo el club sandwich que sirven en el ha sido el mejor que he probado en muchos años.
El servicio de pisos es lento, media hora de promedio y caro, un sandwich con un acfe mas de 
25 €..
El desayuno es lo que se espera de un hotel de esta clase y no deja nada que desear",3,2013,03,16
11,noche de ensueño,"Este pasado fin de semana, pudimos disfrutar de una maravillosa experiencia en el Hotel Majestic. Me encantó la suite, la exclusividad, la tranquilidad, la luminosidad…  La verdad es fantástica! El personal fue muy amable en todo. Y por la mañana una sorpresa más..  el bufet libre de desayuno! Había de todo, muffins caseros de todos los colores y sabores, brownies, plumcakes, pasteles, crepes, jamón, quesos variados, sandwiches, comida dietética, comida recién cocinada de todo tipo... Una muy buena y recomendable sorpresa. Esperamos poder repetir pronto!",5,2013,03,13
11,Troppe aspettative per..,"Sono stato settimana scorsa al Majestic per il week end. Conoscendo molto bene Barcellona e avendo provato diverse strutture, abbiamo optato per questa dopo aver visto che e l hotel in cui la squadra del Barca va in ritiro prima delle partite. 

Servizio accoglienza in reception da sei stelle come riporta la targhetta fuori dall hotel. Camere pulite, forse un po piccole le deluxe con un piccolo neo, non cambiano gli accappatoi lasciati per terra volutamente!

Per il resto tutto nella norma, sicuramente un gradino sopra gli altri per il rapporto qualta prezzo! 

Consigliato!",4,2013,03,09
11,buon 5 stelle..ottima posizione ma può fare di più,"in questi ultimi 10 anni sono stato circa 8 volte in questo hotel soprattutto per la posizione strategica.posizione:molto buona vicino le ramblas. camere:diciamo che sono molto funzionali e hanno tutto.ma sicuramente non sono tanto ampie per un 5 stelle di questo livello.bagni sono ok.servizio:hanno un bar molto carino e fornito,servizio in camera ok.pulizia ok.onestamente per un 5 stelle si può dare di più ma è sempre un ottimo albergo per barcellona. prenotare sempre in tempo altrimenti non si trova mai posto. c'e' una piccolissima terrazza all'ultimo piano ma niente di particolare e la palestra è davvero piccola.",4,2013,03,07

11,Gut gelegenes 5* Hotel mit gediegener Bar!,"Wir waren zum 40. Geburtstag meiner Freundin in Barcelona und hatten dieses Hotel gebucht. Anfänglich etwas enttäuscht von der eher kleinen Empfangshalle fanden wir immer mehr gefallen an diesem genial gelegenen Hotel. Direkt an der Prachtstrasse mit den ganzen Luxuslabes und den wirklich tollen Läden in den Parellstrassen! Ein paar Schritte neben dem Gaudihaus (Casa Batllo) und somit auch bei den Hop on Hop off Bussen war die Lage wirklich genial.

Die Bar überzeugt mit qualitativ sehr guten Speisen und Weinen. Zwar sind die Preise nicht günstig aber sowohl die Atmosphäre wie auch der Service sind sehr gut. Wir hatten ein Zimmer im 7. Stock nach hinten raus mit einem grossen Balkon mit Sicht über die Dächer Barcelonas. Diese Zimmer sind sehr gut vom Lärm der Strasse abgeschirmt.

Die Zimmer sind in einer angenehmen Grösse, sauber und es fehlt einem an gar nichts. Am ihrem Geburtstag überraschte das Hotel meine Freundin mit einer Flasche Champagner und einer Schokoladentorte.

WICHTIG! Verpassen Sie auf keinen Fall einen Besuch auf der Dachterrasse des Hotels, die einen Pool, eine Bar und wohl einen der besten Blicke über Barcelona bis zum Meer bietet.

TIP: Gönnen Sie sich in der Bar ein Glas Cava und einen Teller Jamón Ibérico. Typische Tapas-Spezialitäten kann man im ""Tapas24"" geniessen. Gediegen, romatisch und extrem gut isst man im nahen (15 Min. zu Fuss) aber gut versteckten ""Con Gracia""!",4,2013,02,16
11,Sucio para el precio,Al llegar a mi habitación habían pelos en  lavamanos y una pinza de pelo bajo la mesita de noche así como manchas en la pared detrás de la mesita. No acostumbro a quedarme en hoteles de esta categoría pero me da la impresión de que estas cosas no deberían pasar en un 5 estrellas.,3,2013,02,07
11,Sin dudas volveriamos!!!!!!,"Estuvimos alojados mi familia y yo, en un departamento para 4. Excelente todo, la limpieza, la comodidad del apartamento y la ubicacion. Los apartamentos se encuentran en frente del hotel.
La cocina tiene lavadora de ropa, secadora y tambien tiene lavavajillas. La limpieza diaria se paga euros 30 por dia y la limpieza de la cocina euros 15. Utilice el servicio de spa, excelente atencion tambien. Sin duda volveriamos a este apartamento. Sobre el Paseo de Gracia .",5,2013,01,29
11,"niente di particolare, 5 stelle economico","Periodo Pasqua 2012.
L' hotel dista poco più di 5 minuti a piedi dalla placa de catalunya da dove parte la famosa rambla.
La paseo de Grazia, lungo la quale e' ubicato l'hotel, e' una via lunga, spaziosa, elegante ( vi sono i marchi più prestigiosi della moda, ma per ulteriori notizie sulla via vi rimando, perche' lo merita, ad una recensione a hoc nell'apposita sezione dedicata).
Avevo scelto l'hotel per la sua ubicazione ( centrale ma al di fuori del caos della rambla, rapporto qualità / prezzo).
L'hotel dall'esterno si presenta bene e anche con una certa imponenza. Ma qui mi fermo. 
Il personale alla reception non parlava italiano ( non so se hanno qualcuno che lo parla ma a me non e' mai capitato di incontrarlo).
Viaggiavo in coppia e avevamo prenotato la vacanza  direttamente dal sito dell'hotel con la classica tariffa internet prepagata.
La camera stava in un piano in cui ci si arrivava soltanto con l'ascensore ( non c'erano scale a disposizione dei clienti) e affacciava su una via laterale (per individuarla, sono le finestre piu o meno sopra le vetrate del ristorante dell'hotel). L'interno era piuttosto piccolo e il soffitto esageratamente basso ( forse per questo il costo era inferiore rispetto alla media degli altri hotel di lusso ?) ma nell'insieme pur non essendo da 5 stelle, accettabile.
Wi fi a pagamento.
Ho avuto l'impressione che eravano considerate stanze di serie B dal personale dell'hotel.

Colazione scarsa per un 5 stelle con solite cose che in Italia trovi in qualsiasi hotel 3 stelle di medio livello. Attenzione all'aria condizionata particolarmente alta.

Il ristorante ( ubicato in una zona diversa da dove veniva servita la colazione) era costoso. Aveva poca scelta sia di piatti che di vini ma si mangiava discretamente e i camerieri erano gentili. Nel rapporto qualità / prezzo non ci siamo assolutamente.

Bar frequentato nel pomeriggio ( anche da esterni).

In sintesi da un 5 stelle ci si aspetta ben altro. Il prezzo per quanto economico rispetto a un hotel di pari livello risulta essere eccessivo per i servizi offerti ( bar e ristorante pur non entusiasmando possono anche arrivare ai minimi standard da 5 stelle, ma camera e sopratutto reception e servizi no).
Con quei prezzi si trovano 4 stelle molto gettonati a Barcellona. Non ci tornerò.
Concludo dicendo che siamo stati costretti per causa di forza maggiore maggiore a interrompere la vacanza e tornare in Italia e per questo abbiamo cercato di coinvolgere la reception ( orari e prenotazioni dei voli, cambio biglietto e altro) ma, sicuramente complice la non conoscenza della lingua ( ma in un albergo internazionale non dovrebbe esserci qualcuno che parla italiano?) abbiamo fatto da soli. Peraltro, dato che avevamo pagato già tutto il periodo, nessuno si e' degnato di contattarci per proporci non dico un rimborso dei giorni non goduti ma almeno un'offerta per un altro periodo. Invece indifferenza assoluta. Forse sono abituati a clienti che pagano e poi vanno via a meta' vacanza.
Ci tengo a sottolineare che quanto esposto circa quest' ultimo episodio non ha influito sull' opinione generale che mi sono fatto sull'hotel ma soltanto su un aspetto ( quello del caring e dell'attenzione al cliente).",2,2013,01,28
11,Relacion Calidad - Precio Impecable,"Este hotel es un clásico de Barcelona, situado ni mas ni menos que en el mismísimo Paseo de Gracia. Tiene una terraza en la azotea, que en vera goza de unas vistas y ambientes de ensueño.
Estuve hospedado tres noches con mis hijos. Las habitaciones son preciosas, limpias, muy tranquilas,con todos los gadgets que se necesitan. Por cierto el Wifi es de pago.
El personal de recepción correcto sin más, tal vez, poco avispado (el que me atendió) a lo hora de sugerir algún restaurante para cenar.
Del desayuno no puedo comentar, ya que decidimos mi familia y yo desayunar todos los días en una terraza en el mismo paseo que era muy agradable.
La habitación la reservé a través de una central (Trivago), pagamos 152 € /noche y habitación. Este hotel habitualmente tiene una tarifa que ronda los 250€, con lo que fue un chollo. En fin, la Relación Calidad-Precio fue IMPECABLE.",4,2013,01,28
11,Excelente hotel,"Este hotel es realmente excelente, los cuartos de buen tamaño, el servicio muy bueno, en general todo está perfecto.
Lo recomiendo ampliamente, si van a Barcelona no duden en quedarse en el Majestic, la ubicación es perfecta",5,2013,01,28
11,tremenda decepcion,tengo muy mal sabor de boca con este hotel. me aloje con un grupo gramde que ibamos por trabajo y me imagino que seria por ser grupo pero  que desastre! a precio de suite me dieron un zulo auntentico con una microventana que daba a un perfecto patio de cocinas. al ir a cambiarlo me encuentro a mas gemte con el mismo problema y el hotel nos dice que es lo que hay y que eata lleno!!!! el servicio un desastre!!! no solo no me ayudaron con las maletas sino que viendo que no venia nadie pedi un carri para hacerli yo misma y me dijeron que estaban muy liados con el check put dr todos. la comida y cena que hicimis alli a mi me dio verguenza! las habitaciones las hacian a primera hora pero los baños no y me explicarom que hay mucho lio a primera hora y que ya lo limpiaran a la hora de comer. y de estas tenemks bastantes anecdotas. NO CORRESPONDE A UN HOTEL DE SU CATEGORIA,1,2013,01,27
11,Buona posizione,"Senza infamia e senza lode.
Camere piuttosto piccole ma bagno molto bello ed ampio.
Prodotti cortesia di qualita' bulgari ottima doccia.
Macchina nespresso in camera per fortuna in quanto invece il caffe' servito a colazione non si beve.
Servizo adeguato.
Colazione da migliorare .",3,2013,01,23
11,REALIDAD,"Hace años estuve en este hotel cuando tenía una categoría de tres o cuatro estrellas,  y también después de la reforma a 5 estrellas y hace poco siendo  un cinco estrellas súper lujo. 
Bueno, lo de súper lujo solo por la situación y antigüedad del hotel, por lo demás le falta mucho. 
Un cinco estrellas súper lujo debe trasmitir algo más que estás por que puedes y pagas, eso se presupone. El súper lujo en un hotel lo marca exclusivamente la categoría del personal que te atiende. Nosotros estuvimos en una suite con magnifica vistas al Paseo de Gracia y a la calle Valencia y por supuesto que es una maravilla, pero solo utilizamos el hotel para dormir, cenar en la habitación una noche y la cafetería para una reunión. Cuando quisimos algo más, vimos una  fría y pobre disposición. Hay otras opciones en Barcelona, alguno de dos estrellas, con una atención increíble. También es verdad que si no reservas a tiempo, imposible obtener una habitación.",4,2013,01,23
11,Divino,"Un Hotel lujoso, encantador, con un servicio excelente. La amabilidad y encanto en la atención de su personal, la limpieza y confort de las habitaciones todo hace que sea mi hotel preferido y elegido cada vez que voy a Barcelona",5,2013,01,21
11,Claustrofobico!,"Abbiamo soggiornato dal 26/12/12 al 01/01/13 in una camera DeLuxe Standard. 
L'hotel si trova nella zona più bella di Barcellona piena di negozi e servizi ( metro, bus, ...) ed esternamente é senza dubbio molto affascinante come pure la terrazza sul tetto. 
Purtroppo é la prima volta che ci troviamo a soggiornare in un 5 stelle con una camera senza finestre!  Bella ma praticamente un bunker... che ti lascia quella sensazione claustrofobica di andare a letto e svegliarsi alla mattina senza sapere quale tempo ci sarà fuori!!
Non abbiamo usufruito ne della SPA e neppure della prima colazione, in quanto i prezzi sono a nostro avviso eccessivi e si possono trovare ugualmente nel raggio di pochi metri intorno al l'albergo.

11,Una semi vacanza....,"siamo stati in questo albergo da natale a capodanno 2013, ci siamo accordati da novembre che volevAmo la stanza piu' bella e cosi e' stato...sono stati di parola, con il Sig. Rodriguez siamo stati sempre in contatto, stanze belle molto pulite, staff gentilissimo, prodotti per il bagno Bulgari a iosa...Un bel hotel di lusso e classe.

Unica nota negativa durante in periodo natalizio lo staff e' ridotto e le cose non funzionano come sempre

11,Okay pensavo meglio,"Pe un hotel a 5 stelle GL (GRAN LUSSO) pensavo qualcosa di meglio . Effettivamente dopo tante esperienza in diversi hotels nella città di Bacellona devo dire la verità nessuno mi ha entusiasmato !! 
Il Majestic si trova nel pieno centro di Bacellona, la posizione è ottima , ed  la vista dalle camere che danno sulla via principale   è molto piacevole. Il personale è assolutamente preparato ed cordiale . 
Le camere sono state tutte rinnovate  molto belle  e pulite . Piacevole l'abbinamento dei  colori. 
Hotel classico ed elegante . 
No è compreso il wifi  e nella mia camera la 721 no funzionava ne la filodiffusione in bagno ne il frigobar.",4,2012,12,22
11,"Gran hotel, reformado y en un sitio único","El hotel ha sido reformado hace solo 3 meses y se nota el gusto exquisito para hacerlo: Ni moderno de tonos negro y dorado, ni clásico recargado. Toda la grifería, pintura, moqueta, etc. es nueva a estrenar.
Las habitaciones son realmente bonitas, silenciosas, cómodas y el servicio excelente.

A media tarde te vuelven a ordenadr la habitación, abren la cama, colocan bombones y postales, colocan una alfombrilla junto a la cama y entregan unas zapatillas, lo cual, cuando llegas de compras, es un detalle realmente agradable que los grandes hoteles están perdiendo la costumbre de hacer.

Pedimos hacer el check-in a primera hora de la mañana en vez de a la 1, pues mi mujer está embarazada, y tal y como pedimos teníamos la habitación lista.

Está en la zona más lujosa de Barcelona, grandes avenidas, todas las tiendas alrededor del hotel, y a 3 manzanas del Raval y Barrio Gótico.

Escogimos la Delue City View: Da a una calle lateral a Paseo de Gracia, con lo que tienes árboles, edificios clásicos y silencio total pues sólo hay un carril de coches.

Mi consejo: no tiene sentido gastarse más en una superior llamada Deluxe Paseo de Gracia mirando directamente porque hay 5 carriles de coches y es probable que no sea tan silenciosa, y los edificios de enfrente tampoco valen la pena como para pagar un 30-40% más.

Otra cosa: No pagues el desayuno de 30 euros.  Barcelona tiene una magnífica cultura de bollería y hay cientos de sitios que por mucho menos dinero te darán de desayunar fabulosamente bien. Por ejemplo: El Pinotxo del Mercado de la Boquería. 

El hotel, en resumen, es muy recomendable.",5,2012,12,21
11,Eccellente!,"Una fantastica esperienza da tutti i punti di vista. La nostra junior Suite era spaziosa, elegante, aveva due bagni ed una vista magnifica sul passeig de Gracia. Dalla nostra finestra vedevamo anche la Casa Battlo di Gaudi. Ottimo il servizio. Abbiamo chiesto di stiratrici degli abiti, lo hanno fatto in poche ore. Gli unici punti dolenti sono il costo della colazione e del Wi-fi, ma l'esperienza magnifica dell'hotel li fa passare certamente in secondo piano! Torneremo certamente! Natascia e Alessandra",5,2012,12,06
11,un sogno ad occhi aperti,"l'albergo molto bello e ben tenuto, personale cortese e sempre sorridente e poi ottima la posizione molto centrale per cui ci si sposta molto facilmente.Si trova sul corso principale di Barcellona e lungo la passeggiata ci sono tantissimi negozi di stilisti famosi, per cui c'è solo l'imbarazzo della scelta.",4,2012,11,24
11,Un eccellente 5 stelle nel cuore di Barcellona,"l'Hotel Majestic  si è rivelato veramente un 5 stelle dove ogni cosa si è rivelata perfetta , dalla Reception alla Hall , alle camere ben curate e dotate di ogni attrezzatura che un viaggiatore si aspetta di trovare.
Bagni completamente di marmo e finalmente una vasca/doccia che funzionava perfettamente.
Ottimo anche il bar sulla terrazza panoramica, con piscina e vista a 360° gradi di Barcellona, e con tavolini dove poter sorseggiare un buon wisky e fumare un ottimo sigaro , peccato che chiude presto alla sera.
Per la sua invidiabile posizione in Passeig de Gracia è sicuramente un Hotel che vale il costo richiesto.
Buon soggiorno

11,Fantastico,"Hotel centrale e vicino alle maggiori attrazioni di Barcellona. Dispone di ampie camere dotate di ogni comfort, incluso ciabatte accappatoi calzascarpe cassaforte di ampie dimensioni etc..., frigobar ricco e variegato. Il personale è molto gentile e sempre a disposizione. La colazione è di tipo internazionale classico.",5,2012,11,23
11,ottimo hotel,"Tutto perfetto la reception  e' sempre stata a totale disposizione ,il bar piano terra piacevolissimo ed eccezionale per la vista quello al decimo piano ,le stanze bellissime ed equipagiate di tutto con bagno nuovissimo ed enorme tutto di bulgari!inoltre la posizione che e' il massimo !dalla mia stanza avevo una vista mozzafiato .Inoltre la cosa che mi ha stupito sono stati i prezzi ,sempre equilibrati sia per le stanze che per il bar mai esagerati come i nostri hotel 5 stelle! Insomma tutto perfetto !

11,E' sempre una garanzia,"Sono stato in questo hotel dal 13 al 15 ottobre 2012 con mia moglie. Ogni volta che vado a Barcellona scelgo questo hotel perchè è veramente una garanzia di qualità. In primo luogo, la posizione è eccezionale. Si trova nella via più importante e più commerciale della città ( Paseo de Gracia ) a pochi passi dalla Pedrera e Casa Batllò. In secondo luogo, il rapporto qualità prezzo è veramente ottimo. In ultimo, le camere ( alcune un pò piccole a dire il vero ) sono assolutamente accoglienti ed il servizio è all'altezza della categoria ( cinque stelle ). Continuerò a frequentare questo hotel anche per i soggiorni futuri.",5,2012,10,31
11,Un hotel ....come ce lo aspettavamo.,"Uscire dall'hotel e passeggiare per il Paseo de Gracia è quello che avevamo sempre desiderato fin dalla prima volta che siamo stati in Spagna.L'hotel offre stanze giustamente spaziose e di una eleganza unica: letti king-size (0vviamente) con biancheria di prim'ordine dalle lenzuola ai piumini. I bagni ampi con grande vasca, dotazione toilette abbondante ed elegante. Ambienti comuni non molto ampi, tuttavia sempre molto eleganti : Pulizia sia delle camere ch e delle parti comuni eccellente. Personale gentile e disponobile..",5,2012,10,25
11,Per me il Majestic e' Barcellona,"Quante volte sono arrivato nel Paseo de Gracia ed entrando al Majestic mi sono sentito come a casa, prima che venisse ristrutturato ed anche dopo.
Giro al suo interno e sto bene, e poi esco e vado alla sempre nuova scoperta della mia seconda città...
Adoro Barcelona, adoro il Majestic, adoro il fatto che ci sono stato forse cento volte e soprattutto che ci tornerò (spero) altrettante...",5,2012,10,20
11,un buen hotel,"Nos dieron una magnifica habitación (junor suite) (tres personas, matrimonio y un hijo) dando al Paseo de Gracia con una estupenda vista
Las camas bien y el baño estupendo con bañera dos lavabos y una estupenda ducha con una presion y caudal que no se encuentran en ningún hotel.
El personal muy atento 
La situación inmejorable
Como defecto el atasco que se organiza para entrar en el desayuno sobre todo si se pide una mesa para tres
Buena relación precio calidad, merece la pena",4,2012,10,09
