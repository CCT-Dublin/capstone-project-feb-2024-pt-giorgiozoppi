229,Castle Hotel Dublin Review,"Excellent food. Great place to stay. Staff were very friendly. Would definitely recommend the castle hotel Dublin. Super close to the city centre. Beautiful old Victorian building. I know some people would find the building very claustrophobic, but for me you get a sense of what Dublin was like in Victorian times.",5,2024,10,18
229,Felt like home!,The Castle hotel staff were all amazing. From check in to room service.  Restaurant and entertainment were excellent!   We arrived early and they were able to accommodate our checkin.  The breakfast was amazing with lots of variety!  We would definitely book there again!,5,2024,10,15
229,Friends trip,"We have had such a good trip this week. The hotel is a lovely Georgian building and very central. The staff are very helpful and friendly, food is very good and the entertainment each night is fabulous well worth a visit. Dublin has a lot to do and see, well worth a visit.",4,2024,10,09
229,Wonderful place to spend our time in Dublin.,"We loved staying in this hotel.  We toured Ireland with a tour company and stayed here after the tour.  Location great, staff wonderful, the room was best we stayed in (we stayed in a total of 9 hotels).  We liked the ambiance, and if we go to Ireland again,  and stay in Dublin, this will be the first place we would check into!",5,2024,10,09
229,Front Desk Staff was exceptional,"This hotel has so much character it feels like you are stepping back in time. I know some reviewers had said it needs a refurbishment, but we enjoyed this hotel very much. Yes, it is old, but they kept all the charm. Our room was very comfortable and clean. We only did the continental breakfast one day which was plenty for us.  Front desk staff was amazing. One morning we left very early, and they arranged a breakfast to go for us. The day of departure they ordered a cab for us and when it arrived the worker came out and carried my (very heavy) suitcase to the cab for me. Would stay here again when visiting Dublin.",4,2024,10,08
229,It’s like home!,"Excellent service- so friendly and helpful. Rooms comfortable, food and craic good. I have been coming for years from when I worked in Dublin and stayed a night every week and am still treated like an old friend. I can walk into the cellar bar and am asked’ is it the usual?’",5,2024,10,03
229,Short break Dublin,"Castle Hotel is an excellent Hotel, situated close to the centre of Dublin. Quick and friendly staff, swift check in, with all relevant information for our stay.
Room was quiet, comfortable and spotless. Bed was very comfortable and snug. Heating was on in the corridors and our room, which made it quite stuffy, but we opened the window and shut off the radiator. No safe in the room, no fridge, kettle with tea and coffee supplied.
Two choices of breakfast, continental and cooked Irish fry. Opted for the Irish fry, cooked perfectly. Coffee was tepid though. Arrived at 0815, seated right away and there was a large queue by the time we left at 9. 

Great value for Dublin for a short break. Would use again.",4,2024,09,26
229,Great location,"Castle Hotel is situated close to amenities and the centre of town. O’Connell street starts a few metres away as do the bus tours. 

The staff, particularly in the bars and restaurants were lovely and helpful. Having the bars open at different times upstairs and downstairs then serving either continental or cooked breakfast in these areas was certainly interesting. Not great if one of your party wants something different from the rest. The breakfasts were great with good choices and well cooked produce. 

The room was a little dated and as it faced the main street, it got very noisy. Day and night. It was also hot so opening the window did nothing for the noise! The hotel layout is like a maze. We went downstairs from level 3 to our rooms which should have been level 4!  

It’s a bit pricy (€725 for 3 nights). We’d come back though as the location was perfect for what we wanted to do in Dublin",4,2024,09,23
229,4* Price for a 2/3* Hotel,"Certainly not 4*, rooms are very dated, more like 2/3 Star. Very noisy. If someone is having a shower in their room they might as well be using your bathroom.  Rooms are clean but again not 4 star, Towels are certainly not fluffy.   Wheelie Bins being moved outside at 11.30 pm every night causing lots of noise. Double Glazing does nothing.  Breakfast ok, lots of choice in the Continental Section.  Hotel located on a side street but up a Hill from Connaught Street.   Staff pleasant enough although forgot to do a wake up call we had requested.    4 Star Price for a 2/3 Star hotel.",2,2024,09,16
229,Watch out,"I picked this hotel for the location and the apparent ""charm"" of an old Irish hotel with history. It offered those things and the restaurant provides regular live music at night, which is convenient if you don't want to go far to find a show. These factors did not outweigh the negatives elements. This is not a 4 star hotel. My cleaning rags look in better condition than their towels, which were not soft and had some small holes and easily visible stains. Another flaw is how difficult this hotel is to navigate. Others have mentioned this as it relates to carrying bags up steps and the maze of halls and rooms. The hotel is generally awkwardly designed. I would include that in its ""charm"" except that on one occasion I was knocked in the back by the handle of a door by a guest who pushed through a door while I was waiting for an elevator. The door is located immediately beside the elevator where guests will logically be standing to wait for the elevator. I suggested to the hotel that they place a note/sign by the elevator to warn guests to watch out for the door etc. but I was told that everything met code and it was just an ""alleged"" accident. Be cautious waiting for an elevator at this hotel and don't expect luxury (or a 4 star hotel experience).",1,2024,09,15
229,Excellent Hotel - Brilliant Location.,"The hotel situated approx. 2/3 minutes walk from the centre was a delight. The evening meal in the Castle Vaults more than matched our expectations - congrats to the Chef. My steak was to perfection (medium rare) with the seafood chowder being a delight. The room was OK as you would expect, the only issue being an obvious draft through the window which could be overcome with the application of some sealant. The heavy curtains at night did help!
Overall, enjoyed our stay with staff being professional, respectful, and helpful when approached - not constantly 'in your face'. The Georgian building delightfully decorated with various lounges to hide away to enjoy the peace!",4,2024,09,13
229,A lovely central hotel with an oldie world feeling and lovely down to earth staff,"With excellent staff I was made feel like at home. A special thanks to the breakfast staff especially David who managed a well coordinated staff, to reception staff who were very helpful and to Trevor and his crew in the bar and food at night. Well done Fionn Mc Cúl on building up a fantastic family environment hotel",5,2024,09,12
229,Best accommodation in Dublin,"We had a flawless stay thanks to the hotel's excellent location, friendly and hospitable staff, spotless bathroom and sheets, beautifully decorated lounge areas, and rich breakfast. (Moreover, if you need to leave the hotel before breakfast service starts in the morning, they prepare a packed breakfast for you, which is very considerate and something I haven't encountered at any other hotel.) If I ever come back to Dublin, I definitely won’t look for another place to stay.",5,2024,08,31
229,A wonderful place to stay in Dublin,"What a gem of a hotel! Historical yet modern with the friendliest staff ever! They were so helpful! The location for me was perfect - easy to get to from the airport with the #16 (the Dublin Express is a block away). A short walk to the shopping area, yet quiet! And the restaurant/pub was so much fun!!!!",5,2024,08,23
229,Not 4 stars,"The hotel is quirky and nice with friendly staff, but the rooms are not 4 stars at all. We first got a room with a terrible  sewage smell. Then we were moved to a better room, but with small double bed and really warm (it was mid August). 
We found a dusty fan inside the wardrobe that helped us sleep during the night.",3,2024,08,17
229,A fantastic place!,"Four wonderful days in Dublin, the Castle Hotel has been an important added value in our journey. A well organised staff with kind and professional people, a beautiful location, smart and clean with hystorical rooms. A good position to visit the town. Thanks for all and see you soon!",5,2024,08,11
229,Save the trouble and pass on this hotel,They overcharged my credit card even though they gave me a receipt showing the refund (that I now notice has “void” underneath) and haven’t responded to my emails asking for help. I’m going to have to file a dispute now with my credit card. I’m home now and the trip is over so this is the last thing I want to deal with. Just avoid this place. They also comfirmed a triple room and immediately after sent an email that it’s first come first serve. Just avoid this place. It’s also extremely noisy,1,2024,08,07
229,Great location ,Return visit to this great central location in Dublin.we were there for two nights for the all Ireland final in Croke Park which is about 10 minutes walk away.and great stay as always lovely staff and food.so handy to be able to park the car at the hotel and leave it for the few days.,4,2024,07,28
229,No go,"Great, helpfull staff who went out of their way to fix some of the issues we had, nice breakfast with a lot of choices (continental and Irish) and friendly waiters. Very nice to get fresh waterbottles everyday. 

But: some rooms (like ours) need to be updated/fixed. We stayed for 3 nights. Both bathroom taps are loose, showerhead constantly came down, mould on the bathroom floor, very greasy/brown bathroom door (near the handle) and lightrope, window couldn't lock so could be opened from outside. No wall outlet near desk so teaboiler on the ground, no view/ blind wall, old furniture in the room (not in a nice old way like the rest of the hotel-atmosphere which is lovely). 

Overall not the 4-star familyroom we paid almost 300 euro's per night for (a little less, because we were offered a small refund).

The most dissapointed we were by the reaction of the hotel owner who came by coincedently and was very verbal about the pride he took in being the owner of the hotel for 38 years - and that is was unfortunate that we complaint about the room (not the reception staff, they were great!).  The owner ended by saying it all was the cleaners fault and that he would fire her the next time (which we thought was ridiculous and made us feel guilty in an absurd way). We won't be back...",2,2024,07,26
229,Super Hotel,"Super hotel!
Great hotel. Everything was nice. Me and my Mum had a wonderful weekend in this Hotel.Would surely choose it again next time we visit Dublin.Great location, great service, friendly staff. Breakfast was delicious,as was Dinner.Very comfortable.Lovely big bright bedroom.Really nice areas to sit and relax.The hotel is well situated, being close to shopping, transport, and the tourist sites. We would definitely stay there again.",5,2024,07,25
229,"Good, but ….","Good hotel but expensive, perhaps not quite 4 star. We had room 4 good but the outside smoking area was just below our window and smell got in despite complaint. Also chef holiday so dinner menu restricted to Irish Stew or Irish Stew (I exaggerate). Staff great, hotel clean.",3,2024,07,17
229,Great location and friendly atmosphere,"It’s a very friendly place to stay in Dublin. As tourists, breakfast is always important for a start of the day-this hotel provides hot breakfast or continental breakfast. The restaurant has Irish singers and dancers for dinner time. It was quite pleasant to be entertained every night.",5,2024,07,09
229,Lovely hotel with great location,"The hotel is absolutely stunning. The rooms have everything you would need and the staff go above and beyond to make sure your stay is perfect. The breakfast is great as well, lots of choices and high quality produce. You can also have lunch and dinner in the hotel as well.",4,2024,07,06
229,Highly recommend,Great place to stay. Close to everything. The staff are so helpful and everything is so clean. A quirky little place with loads of character in a Georgian row.  We had a fabulous stay.   The owner was charming and the breakfast plentiful. We had dinner in the restaurant one night and the chowder was amazing.,5,2024,06,18
229,Great for families!,Great hotel for families. The rooms are comfortable and come with toiletries and breakfast - both continental or Irish. There is free parking around the back which is tight but a nice plus. Within walking distance to the city center and to where many of the hop on hop off buses start from. I would recommend.,5,2024,06,07
229,Great hotel in the heart of Dublin.,"We have stayed in this hotel a few times over the years, the staff have always be exceptionally helpful and friendly, nothing is to much of a bother for them. The hotel in a good location away from the hustle and bustle of Temple bar but within walking distance if you fancied heading for a night in that area. Most of Dublin attractions was easy accessible on foot from the hotel. 
Room was clean and the beds are comfortable, options of a continental or full Irish breakfast but we a had a few day trips with very early morning starts and the hotel provided us with a take away breakfast that consisted of muffins, fruit orange juice and water and we could help ourselves to a takeaway tea or coffee. We will definitely return to this hotel on our next trip to Dublin.",5,2024,06,04
229,Nice hotel in a good location,"We were booked into this hotel by our tour company for a weekend stay before our private guided tour of Souther Ireland. It is an older property but well maintained, clean with a much appreciated elevator. Lots of nice touches throughout. Location is great! It is right off O'Connel street not far from the Liffey River and a half block from the hop on hop off bus stop.

All the staff were courteous and always helpful.  Rooms were clean with updated nicely bathrooms. The breakfast (included) was great with the option of a buffet in the cafe upstairs or FIB (full Irish breakfast) downstairs in the restaurant which also featured a great Irish folksinger after dinner each nite we were there. We would stay here again.",5,2024,05,28
229,"Top of the morning, top of stays!","Fabulous location within walking distance to local amenities. Tasty full breakfast menu; full Irish to continental & lovely, friendly staff. The hotel itself is within a beautiful building, full of character - couldn’t have asked for more!",5,2024,05,28
229,Solid hotel north of the Liffey,"The staff at the front desk were very helpful and courteous.  Check-in was easy, and the small problems we encountered (like a lack of towels in our room) were immediately corrected. The restaurant in the basement was a nice setting, the food and service were good. The elevator was an unexpected surprise and very welcomed after a journey from the US.",5,2024,05,22
229,Nice family stay,"It was very hard to find an accommodation for the whole family in Dublin at this time but I'm glad I find this hotel in the end. The administration was without problems. The hotel is near O'Connell street and Liffey river.

All the staff was nice and no bad surprises awaited us anywhere. The hotel building is older and also the halls and room gives such impression, not in the negative way, though. The equipment is not new (except for the bathroom) but nice.  Daily replenished sweets, tea/coffee bags or water bottles are nice. We appreciated the breakfast - continental (buffet -rather basic but adequate) or Irish (served in a separate room - I recommend this one). The hotel offers afternoon teas and an evening bar (cannot judge on these but I liked their draught beer;)",5,2024,05,20
229,One star experience in a Four star hotel. Do not recommend.,"Stayed 1 night of 3 I had booked. Mattress and pillows VERY firm, uncomfortable. Window open at bottom, air hot and stuffy. Sheets and towels smelled of barbequesulphur. Didn't sleep until 3-4am, very poor sleep. Poor quality breakfast.",1,2024,05,15
229,Vegans - do not eat here,"I cannot speak much to the hotel itself, but my experience in the Castle Vaults Restaurant (where I was invited as a guest) was very poor.  The staff were very disorganised and the vegan offering came entirely out of packets.  My hosts had to ask about 5 times for the falafels that were meant to come with the salad that was my main course.  A second, smaller salad, with overcooked falafels, arrived when everyone else was finished and I had finished eating salad number 1.",1,2024,05,09
229,Sadly Disappointed.,"This is difficult. My wife and I stayed in room 30. It was a small room, very jaded. The mattress was so broken down it was absurd - we just could not believe it. The heating did not come on until 8am by which time we were off to breakfast and then we left soon thereafter. We found a used toothpick and cotton bud and hair on and in the bath; there were cracked tiles on the floor (risky walking in bare feet!). Two of the lamps (bedside lamp and shaving light above mirror) did not work. So why did I say this is difficult? Firstly, our friend stayed in room 31, a large airy room with none of the issues we encountered! Secondly, the staff were simply lovely (as ever). Thirdly, the food was very good (evening meal and breakfast). Fourthly, the prices for food and drink were  similar to a typical pub so we ate and drank in house.
We were hugely disappointed by the room. We know the hotel well but this was the first time we had stayed. We were planning to include this hotel as a stopover on our regular tours of Wales but as room quality seems like pot luck we simply are not prepared to take the risk.",2,2024,05,07
229,Enjoyable stay for a large group,"Our group of 10 stayed in 4 rooms.  The family room for 4, great setup with a queen and two twin beds.  The hotel had lots of different sitting rooms that you could relax in or use while waiting for others in your group.  The staff was helpful calling taxis when needed or suggesting which hop-on hop-off bus company to select.   

The location was nice and quiet, but it was a bit of a walk to South Dublin (15-20 minutes) but easy enough to find a taxi on the days we didn't want to walk. 

The Irish breakfast in the Castle Vaults was very good, but we preferred the continental breakfast upstairs.",5,2024,04,30
229,Bait and Switch Swindle,"The clerk at check in informed us that the rooms for us were not accessible by elevator, and that he could move us to rooms that were accessible by elevator if we’d prefer. We had large luggage bags so we opted for the switch. The rooms were at the complete back of the hotel requiring a long winding walk through several twists, turns and doors. Two twin beds, hmmm we were being charged for a room to sleep three. Asked for a refund of the upcharge for a larger room and was given some long story of why that wasn’t going to happen…something about no other rooms available because they’re sold out.
The room I am in is shockingly sparse and the quality of every thing is substandard. 
The list: security/safety issues…no doorknob to exit the room. Yea WHAT. No deadbolt. No door peephole viewer. One key for two people. You have to pull on the small door lock lever to open the door/exit. 
Space issues: small…No room to put two suitcases. One suitcase has to go on the desk. No small table even provided as there is no room for one. 
Quality: Thread bear towels, plastic cups, bathroom door and molding not finished. Door rot. Armoire and desk prefabricated wood, large removed sticker goo on front of armoire. Unimaginably small bathroom  sink. No enclosed shower, water everywhere on bathroom floor…curtain not adequate. Disgusting! No reading light. Walls painted stark off white. Room not inviting or comfortable in any regard.
The room does not comport with room pictures on line. 
Complete bait and switch!",1,2024,04,25
229,Dublin Stay,"This is what USA guests would refer to as a boutique hotel. Complicated to find one's room, as the floors are not on a consistent plane. The first room had no hot water; we were moved the next day of our three day stay. The continental breakfast was very good, but the main dining fare was forgetable. The staff, on the other hand, were excellent;knowledgeable, helpful, and efficient. Of particular mention is Jasmina, waitress, bartender, and conversationalist. But for the dining, this would rate a 5/5 for value.",4,2024,04,19
229,Convenience and Comfort:,"I stayed in room 353 at the Castle Hotel in the course of a  two day visit to Dublin this week. (April 8/9 2024). It was excellent. It has an old world feel with a really helpful and welcoming staff.

My room was clean and fresh, it was quiet and a haven from a busy schedule. I was able to safely park up my car and easily get around town on foot or by Luas. 

The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. My requests for assistance, directions and insights were all addressed in ways which exceeded expectations. 

The Castle may be the oldest hotel in Dublin but its management and staff give it cool and friendly feel. Its location is really perfect for center city business. 

I recommend it wholeheartedly.    

JB.",5,2024,04,11
229,nice hotel close to Dublin downtown,"The castle hotel is walking distance to Dublin downtown which makes it pretty convenient if you want to spend time there. They also have a family friendly pricing policy when you travel with kids. Otherwise the place is more a traditional English kind of place and has seen better times .... It's all not terrible but you see that renovation would be a nice thing some point soon. But everything is clean, just shows patina here and there.",3,2024,04,09
229,Wonderful hotel,"We stayed at the Castle Hotel for two nights, and enjoyed our stay. The room was clean and spacious, the mattress was very good and the shower was hot with good water pressure. Toiletries, coffee service and a hair dryer are all provided. Our room was across from a brightly lit cathedral which is being renovated. Light blocking drapes ensured we got a great night sleep. Breakfast is included and was excellent with lots of choices. The hotel is centrally located, so it was a quick walk to get to sights and areas we wanted to visit. They provide 24/7 concierge, which was nice because we returned to the hotel after midnight one evening.",5,2024,03,17
229,Great hotel in a convenient location,"Spent three nights here and really enjoyed the experience. The room was large as was the bathroom. The restaurant served excellent food, which was very convenient, after walking around Dublin all day and the Irish singer and dancer were entertaining .
The hotel would be perfect if the room contained a fridge and safe, also a top sheet on the bed, although there were plenty of pillows, which I always appreciate.Every member of staff we talked to were excellent, friendly and knowledgeable. I loved Dublin and hope to return soon, this hotel will be my first choice without hesitation.",4,2024,03,15
229,Great hotel and staff - let down by poor wifi,"The hotel itself is a bit dated, but that adds to the character of the place. The staff were super friendly and helpful and will go out of their way to help you. The evening meals and entertainment were great too, as was the breakfast. The rooms are decent enough, you are given a kettle to make your own tea or coffee etc. The bathroom was clean and the rooms are cleaned daily, which was a nice bonus. The reason why I am not giving the hotel a full 5 stars is because it is let down by their terrible wifi access in the room. The wifi was hit and miss at best, and in 2024 that is simply not good enough I am afraid. Shame because the hotel itself is great and the location is perfect for exploring the city. 

P.s. I appreciate keep the rooms warm in the winter months, but when I first arrived the room was stifling. It might be a good idea to not put the heating on so high and perhaps leave clear instructions on how to turn the heating down.",4,2024,03,15
229,Old school gem in a modern city,"The room was exceptional, beautiful high ceilings ,furnished too the last. The staff were very welcoming and helpful. Breakfast was lovely . The bar was flowing with music and chat.Can't say enough about the place . 5stars all the way!!!!!",5,2024,03,10
229,Excellent  beautifully decorated  hotel with excellent  friendly  Staff.,Really  impressed with the Hotel & Staff. Lovely  spacious  room and hotel has a welcoming  homely atmosphere. It is beautifully decorated  throughout in a Gorgian theme. Excellent  breakfast served efficiently in the Lovely  breakfast room.,4,2024,03,08
229,Dublin 2024,"Quaint, quirky, gem in the heart of Dublin, lots of original features, great location.
The staff are lovely, welcoming and engaging, if you're lucky enough to meet Fionn, the hotel owner, then you'll be meeting a true gent who is knowledgeable, friendly and charming. 
And don't waste time eating out as the food in the Vault restaurant is delicious
The evening atmosphere with the entertainment is not to be missed
Loved our stay thank you all",5,2024,02,12
229,Great Hotel,"I’m really not sure what all the moans have been about! Lovely hotel with very pleasant staff. Our room was very clean and comfortable. The breakfast is excellent, lots to choose from especially liked the continental. Location is great too.",5,2024,01,30
229,Good hotel,Good hotel with a breakfast in central Dublin within an easy walking distance to many of the Dublin attractions.  Abbey at the front desk was very helpful with booking me a taxi when I needed it. The only problem I had was the noise from the courtyard.,4,2023,12,20
229,Lovely hotel,"This is a beautiful family owned hotel. The breakfast was fresh, delicious and plentiful.  The room was spacious,  clean and comfortable.  The staff were friendly and incredibly helpful.  We really liked the location. There was so much you could walk to and we also took a cab to some sights. We enjoyed the live music and Irish dancing at the bar at night. ",5,2023,12,02
229,Don’t Book ,"I had no hot water during my 2 night stay so had to take a cold shower.  I also had to call down each night to get the heat turned on in the room. The second night I had to call twice and wait an hour.  

While I found the staff nice, lack of heat and hot water ruined my experience. Upon checkout I was advised to send an email to management which I did. No one ever responded to my email.  For this reason I would advise you to book elsewhere.  ",2,2023,12,02
229,Disappointing ,"We stayed here for 4 nights. The room was small and cramped. It was very noisy- we could hear everything outside from traffic to people talking to the garbage truck. We could also hear the guests above us- walking, dropping things, talking. The doors close loudly (it sounds like you’re slamming them). 
The front desk staff doesn’t acknowledge you unless you’re standing right in front of them- their heads are always down. 
The continual breakfast was rather disappointing. I was going to try the hot breakfast too but they only had 1 server taking orders and seating people. I got tired of waiting.
It was a disappointing experience overall.",3,2023,11,30
229,"Missed the mark, suggest booking elsewhere ","I would look elsewhere.  To avoid this being a totally negative review, here are some pros --- the hotel is centrally located and offers a breakfast (it is pretty mediocre but will get the job done) and has live music and dancing at the hotel bar/restaurant, which is very nice. It also seemed clean and safe. However, I would suggest that folks book elsewhere or avoid booking the Mews buildings. 

The Harry Clarke Mews apartments are advertised by the hotel as self catering stables and coach houses that have been converted into miniature apartments. The description of the location of the Mews on the hotel's website makes it seem like these are separate apartments that are part of the hotel. However, the Mews are located behind the hotel in a separate building in the parking lot next to trash bins. The staff did not help us carry our luggage to the apartment and seemed preoccupied during our check in. There does not appear to be an elevator to the Mews cottage, the entry way was filled with the hotel's linen and towel storage, and the heat was not on in the apartment when we arrived in it. We had to call the front desk to ask them for help with the heating and hot water which eventually worked. However, you would expect a hotel of this caliber to have the heat turned on and hot water running when guests arrive. The unit we stayed in also did not have a kitchenette or any cooking supplies, so it is unclear to me why the hotel promotes this as a self catering apartment. The rooms are also small, which is fine for two people, but again makes me question the practicality of this kind of arrangement if it is promoted as a self catering apartment for larger groups. Overall, I would save your money and look elsewhere. If you did happen to book here, I am sure your stay will be fine but could certainly be better given the price. ",2,2023,11,27
229,"Very disappointing, great if you want a sleepless night","So disappointed with this hotel. Their actions turned a fun get away with family into a mainly sleepless nightmare.
There was a problem with the heating in the room, number 124, and I was treated as though it was my fault. After a sleepless night, I insisted on moving for the second night as they couldn't fix the problem and this was agreed to reluctantly. I have tried to take these issues up with the hotel since being home and four days on from my email to them no response has been received. Shocking. We will definitely be avoiding this place in future. Pity that it gives wonderful Dublin a poor reputation.",2,2023,11,23
229,One night in Dublin,Stayed here for just one night - we had been to a wedding and decided to have one night in Dublin before flying home. Hotel very comfortable and clean. Staff very polite. Only stayed here for the night sadly so experience much of the hotel. We did have lunch and it was very nice. We had an early flight back to Heathrow so we asked for a takeaway’ option and they obliged.,5,2023,11,22
229,Don’t miss experiencing this gem of a hotel!,"We celebrated our 50th wedding anniversary with a trip to Ireland. Our son met us there and booked a room at the Castle Hotel too. The hotel is extremely charming with warm, inviting sitting rooms complete with beautiful antique furniture. The hotel room was immaculate and cleaned everyday by an efficient housekeeping staff. We had the choice of a full Irish breakfast or continental breakfast every morning. Both meal choices were included in the daily room fee and both were excellent! The front desk hotel staff were available 24 hrs/day and offered friendly, professional assistance with any of our needs. The live music offered nightly in the hotel restaurant was incredibly fun and enjoyable; authentic Irish pub music. I cannot praise this “gem” enough for its charm and unforgettable stay! ",5,2023,11,15
229,"Comfortable, convenient","We spent 2 nights in Dublin at this hotel.  It's conveniently located, close to the Dublin Aircoach bus-stop and a 15 minute walk to the Temple Bar area.It's an old Georgian-style building, and retains a lot of the historic and design elements, and several lounges/nooks for guests to relax. Staff incl the lady receptionist are very friendly and courteous.  The room was comfortable, although felt slightly small and dated and needs some TLC. The windows didn't close perfectly so couldn't seal off the road noise completely, but we slept fine.  Breakfast is served in two locations (unsure why) - so we shuttled between the two try some of the the cooked/Irish and some of the standard continental - enough choices for vegetarians.  Sensibly priced accommodation in an otherwise overpriced city like Dublin, look out for their direct bed and breakfast offers on their website.",4,2023,11,15
229,Well located Georgian hotel in Dublin,"Well located hotel within Dublin City - just a few minutes walk onto O’Connell Street and many other city attractions. Great links to the airport and the Hop On / Off Bus.
This Georgian Hotel has many old and original characteristics and plenty of cosy lounges and rooms to relax within. I can imagine it holds lots of history within it! 

We had a nice friendly reception check in, whereby we had rooms located for the 2nd floor. We were only staying for one night, so were very pleased with the choice of hotel . The rooms were very clean and spacious and had the usual tea/coffee facilities, hairdryer, tv etc
We booked for an evening meal in the restaurant, which was very nicely presented and equally as delicious. Live music was in the restaurant from 9pm, whereby we also chatted away with guests of other nationalities, who were also visiting Dublin City. A great atmosphere and would recommend.

The room rate included breakfast, which consisted of a full Irish Breakfast &/or Continental Breakfast. 
Service was very good and they were able to offer and provide Gluten Free alternatives, which was great.  

I always like to keep a positive outlook, as I do appreciate that the hospitality sector has its own constraints for turnaround times etc ..
But, I do have to mention that my only disappointment was that check out is midday and although I was up and showered early by 8. I had already had the housekeeping knocking to make my room up by 8:20 and I saw others awaiting in the corridor to make rooms up. This also happened to my friend in her room. 
To knock 3.5hrs before check out on a one night stay, is a little premature  … moreso if occupants have had a late night. 
We had checked out at 9:30 at reception, as we wanted to make use of our time exploring Dublin … so maybe communication between reception and housekeeping could be more proactive. 

The positives of everything else that this hotel offers in service, friendliness, location and atmosphere - outweighs the housekeeping aspect. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel and would look to book again when visiting Dublin.",5,2023,11,05
229,Beautiful traditional hotel,"Lovely traditional little hotel in the centre of Dublin. Great location being walking distance to most places but close to bus stops too.  Really helpful staff with a 24 hour desk which was reassuring for the late night we had! 
Room was clean, comfy and quiet. Nice big breakfast served until 10.30. Very relaxed and homely environent, just what we needed. ",5,2023,11,01
229,A bit dissapointed ,"To start with the positive: Good breakfast, clean room, friendly and helpful staff. 
Negative: The smell of sewege in the room. Not constantly  but very much in morning and nights. Hard bed. Had expectations since it is rated a four star hotel.",3,2023,10,28
229,Disrespectful and patronising ,"This was without a doubt the worst hotel experience I have ever had.
I was the check out at 12pm.
Every hour from 8-12 there was a member of staff either knocking on my door or walking straight in 🤦‍♂️",1,2023,10,20
229,A true Georgian gem owned by a dapper raconteur!,"Just back yesterday from an excellent weekend here and I can highly recommend a visit - it's true Georgian gem! 

Despite the lure of the city's bright lights, we ate here on the first two nights and enjoyed the live acts (a different one each night) - the food was very good indeed. The musicians were excellent too, especially Ray Cox, and a real treat/highlight was the Irish dancer......like a one woman Riverdance!

Breakfast was either a full Irish in the Vaults or continental self service in the Old Music Shop and both were first-class too. 

The hotel is superbly located at the top of O'Connell Street, so handy for the Aircoach and all the many attractions Dublin has to offer yet just far enough away from the bustle to allow you to recharge. Excellent pub (Murray's/Thomas Clarke) nearby too so not a million miles to wander for a decent pint of Guinness.

The hotel is family run and I had the great pleasure of meeting the owner Mr Finn O'Keefe, a dapper raconteur, and had an excellent chat with him about the hotel and history!

All in all, a superb stay and am already planning to return next year as there are distilleries yet to visit!

229,"Loved it, first time in Dublin, the hotel is central to everything and it's a lovely place to stay .","The Hotel is a lovely place, clean and welcoming.
Staff are brilliant., So friendly and helpful.
Entertainment every night, fantastic time here, will be definitely stay here again next year.

229,My castle away from home,"It’s two grand buildings brought together over the decades and so is wonderfully quirky with hallways and stairs that go every which way, aka Harry Potter style!
We were greeted with delicious chocolate mints in the bed…when I’m travelling it’s those little things that really stand out.
Both breakfast options were high quality and delicious.
We walked to the Guinness tour as it’s a lovely 45 minute walk down O’Connell and over the bridge (past the must-reserve Murray’s).
Of our 3-week vacation this was the most expensive accommodation-for some reason Dublin is expensive- but we were happy with our choice.",5,2023,09,23
229,Enjoyable stay at the Castle Hotel,"The greeting staff were super friendly especially Collin. The room was clean and comfortable. The breakfast that was included in the stay was delicious. The restaurant staff was friendly and efficient. The entertainment on Wednesday night was fabulous!  I believe his name was Ray Kochs/Cox. 
Would definitely stay here again",5,2023,09,22
229,"Friendly, fun and well presented. No complaints!","Upon arriving at the hotel, the staff were very efficient and handed us our room key. 
The room, from the very beginning was perfect for me and my friend. Two beds, a TV, desk, wardrobe - and most importantly, a kettle with teabags.
The room was clean and serviced daily, after our trip to the breakfast room - which is a large communal area where guests can find all the usual foods one expects for brekie. 
As we don't go on holidays to stay in the hotel, we found its location perfectly adequate. Right at the top of O'Connell street, and next to two ""Hop on, Hop off"" bus stops (which were used daily).
On our first night we ate in the basement restaurant of the hotel. The food was delicious (a hearty fish and chips hits the spot everytime), and the Guinness was as to be expected. Not the cheapest at nearly €70 for two fish and chips and four pints of Guinness (between us), but it was rather tasty nonetheless. The staff were cheerful and gracious there too.
We called it a night after our journey that day and missed the first night of live music, which started at 8pm, something we made sure to attend every night thereafter.
Generally the music is traditional Irish music, and from chatting with the ""balladiers"", it happens that they regularly play the venue. Each night was a different act, playing practically the same traditional songs (with some pop standards for everyone else). Suffice to say, you will know those songs off by heart by the end of your stay. Tip: learn ""The Wild Rover"", ""Whiskey in the Jar"", and ""Black Velvet Band"" to fully enjoy the experience of Irish pub music.
Overall, it was a fantastic experience.
Our room (123) was situated at the back of the building, our neighbours were opposite us, but made no sounds that I could hear, and I had no complaints.
We were backing onto a road, which could be loud, but let's be honest, if you're staying in a hotel central to Dublin, on the top of O'Connell street, if you expect total silence and tranquility, you must be mad!
Visitors to the hotel were always a great laugh, and we enjoyed joining tables and chatting into the wee hours with our American, Australian and fellow British friends.
All I can say is, if you're in Dublin, you could do much worse than stay here. It's, as we say, a corker! ",5,2023,09,09
229,Nice option for families in Dublin,"We found this because we need two triple rooms and prices for other options were really high late summer. We stayed here at the beginning and end of our visit. The first set of rooms we had #407 and #110 were small, cramped with darker rooms that had small showers with low water pressure. The 2nd time we had rooms #235 and #1 which were so much better and nicer. Beds were okay. 
 
Lots of good for this property:
1. Very nice staff. They offer a continental (mostly cold items, self service buffet) and Irish (hot, plated) breakfast options. You can eat both if you want. We had the Irish daily but also learned that we could customize what we wanted and they were happy to oblige. 
2. Pub/restaurant downstairs has nightly music which we enjoyed one night and it was fun. 
3. Parking is 15€ daily. On our 2nd stay we parked on the street since we arrived late in the day then left early and payment was only required until 7p. It was also easier than getting in/out of the parking area. 
4. About 30 minutes walk to the Temple Bar area, 45 minutes to the Guinness Storehouse. 
5, Ate at a nice place called 101 Talbot to get a break from the pub food options.",4,2023,09,02
229,Was up to expectations,"We enjoyed our stay here. We were able to walk everywhere to see what we wanted. The hotel is a bit of a rabbit warren with rooms, stairs and lounges everywhere. Although there is an elevator, there was still quite a few random stairs to haul luggage up and down. All tastefully appointed and plenty of places to take some time out away from other guests. Breakfast was ok although we never once got hot coffee. The bar and restaurant downstairs had live music every night which was really good as some of the area around there is a bit dodgy at night and it was safer to come home earlier. 
We were warned to avoid O’Connell street at night and have to say it was pretty rough with a lot of homeless and groups just hanging around. Might consider using a taxi later in the night, say after 10 pm.",4,2023,09,02
229,Great retum visit,"We spend two nights again recently in the Castle hotel right in the centre of Dublin. Location is excellent to see all of the sights in Dublin,the food was very good as was the entertainment in the cellar each night we were there. Staff were  lovely and we stayed in a delux room which was so quiet it was hard to imagine we were in the centre of a busy city.",5,2023,08,29
229,Good parking breakfast not as promised ,So we were in room 414 and had a good rate for B&B the room was fine the parking great albeit tight. Staff were pleasant though breakfast was underwhelming and we had to wait quite a while for the full Irish breakfast. ,3,2023,08,23
229,Love this friendly hotel,"Great welcome The room was comfy and warm   We stayed for 2 nights and ate in the Vaults both nights. Food was amazing. Entertainment was great and the staff were friendly 
Breakfast was great too 
Would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay again",5,2023,08,09
229,Don't listen to the poor reviews,"Hotel was great, good location, friendly staff, clean and comfortable rooms. Nice breakfast each morning either cooked or continental which were both lovely. Not sure why so many have complained about lay out of the hotel... you can clearly see that this hotel is old and has alot of character. Yes there are stairs you have to walk up and down and only one lift. We were on the 4th floor and still found it no hassle. If you have mobility issues then maybe not the right hotel but surely that would be looked into before booking the hotel? Reception staff were friendly and pleased to help :) noise was not an issue either although seen some complaints on this too. 
Some of the reviews on here are laughable yes the hotel is not the ritz but it is more than comfortable and accommodating. Would recommend ",5,2023,08,05
229,"Loud, arrogant - interesting hotel, ok food.","The hotel is nice, utterly confusing and feels like a labyrinth. Breakfast is good, even the Irish breakfast is well done. The cleaning personnel does a fantastic job for which they deserve to be commended. 
What leads to this rating? The rooms have paper thin walls, you can hear your neighbor making disgusting noises, all the doors don‘t have handles, they need to be slammed - at any given point of time, which makes you stand in your bed. So don‘t even think about sleeping unless you have kind neighbours, which I never had.
Another point is that the hotel reception staff leaves a lot to be desired. I come here as a customer, I don‘t need to be treated like a king or a queen, but I deserve eye-level contact - I do not deserve the arrogance of the receptionists during daytime, who are behaving as if it is none of their business doing their work. Apart from the fact that they are more busy entertaining themselves and not the guests, there is a snobishness, that I have only come to know from the English - never the Irish. And it is a behaviour that does not sit well with me. 
I could have liked this hotel so much more - but I chose to go to different venues, because I have found the Irish in general a likable and kind people - that is something that has been missing at this hotel reception and since it entails three people, I can only assume it is a general problem. 
Avoid if you want to be treated with some respect - and if you want to get some sleep.",2,2023,08,01
229,A fun quirky hotel with lots of charm,"I travelled to Ireland with 10 cousins in July and spent two nights at the castle hotel. I had heard about it from others but had never stayed there. It’s location off o Connell street was great, close to hop on hop off and easy walking, The restaurants served great food, we got the room with dinner package and ate in the vaults on our first night which was great and had live music, the full Irish breakfast in the mornings prepped us for our days of wandering as well.
The hotel is spread out over several old Georgian buildings and so quirky and fun to explore. The floors are all slanted and hallways are askew with several sets of stairs leading to nowhere so if you are looking for cookie cutter hotel, this is not it, but we loved it. The rooms were clean and comfortable. There is no air conditioning, which is common in Ireland but we were comfortable with the window open, just. A little more city noise, it was a great fun experience!",4,2023,07,29
229,Pleasant and Lovely Stay in Unique Surroundings,"The Castle Hotel is really a fun converted set of brownstones that have been organized into a labyrinth of hotel rooms. We were traveling as a group of family and friends and everyone had a different room and experience. All rooms were well appointed, with lots of outlets, USB ports, towels, amenities, sitting areas. The staff were lovely and helpful. The hotel offers both a full service breakfast and a buffet option (in two different locations). Fair warning; the full service can be a bit slow; if you are in a hurry, use the buffet. The hotel had lots of ""shared"" spaces so our gang could find side rooms to use for cards and hanging together in the evenings. Lots of vintage decor is present in rooms, in the lobby, and in shared spaces. There is no airconditioning, although they offer fans, but some of the rooms were quite warm, so traveling with your own top sheet gives you an alternative to the heavier duvet covers. Lower rooms on the main street could be a bit noisy (and in June, the windows had to be open) so try to ask for a room away from the main street. Location was great, most of central Dublin and all the things were wanted to visit were in great proximity.  The only other hiccup we ran into was having asked the hotel staff to arrange two large taxis for us for a timed event. We had confirmed the night before and again when we came down for breakfast and assured all was in order. Nonetheless, at the time we needed the taxis suddenly no large ones were available and the staff were scrambling to order 4 smaller taxis to get us all where we needed to go, and we cut that quite close on time. Other than that, we really had a fine stay and would happily consider the Castle Hotel again in the future. ",4,2023,07,12
229,Welcoming property close to heart of Dublin,"Had only a one-night stay here, following a long day of travel (from London by rail and Irish Ferries), before heading out next day to Dublin Airport and homeward. Room was lovely, clean and very comfortable, with peek of a view toward Parnell Square. (Only drawback: it had no bedside reading lights! Just power outlets where I'd expect to find a light. The USB charger in the outlet helped, as I could use my USB reading light.) The restaurant was packed when we went downstairs for a belated dinner likely because a folk-singer was still in his first set, but the bartender took our order before the kitchen closed at 10, and seated us and our drinks as soon as a table opened up. Hearing Irish music without having to take our weary selves out in search of it was a plus. Full cooked Irish breakfast in the same space the next morning was delicious (even if service was a bit scattered with an inexplicable wait for tea and coffee to arrive). Front desk staff very helpful, storing our big bags in a locked luggage room overnight, printing tickets and calling a cab to the airport the next morning. ",5,2023,07,08
229,"Charming hotel, highly recommend","We arrived early and exhausted from an overnight flight. The staff at reception was so welcoming and friendly. She let us store our bags and sit in a side parlor room where we could shut the door and rest while we waiting for the room to become available. She let us check in early. Room 100 is amazing! High ceilings, lots of room with a double and a twin bed, and a side area with a desk and closet. It is on the first floor and probably one of the cooler rooms. They also provide a fan. It was June, so the heat was not that bad. I was worried it may be loud on the main level but it was not at all. I love that the desk is manned 24/7, so you can leave the key at the desk. The hotel is charming with older furnishing. They offer two breakfast options, one sit down and one continental style. We preferred the continental versus the traditional Irish breakfast. The hotel is north of the the Spire and a quick walk to the bridges over the River Liffey. There are not a lot of restaurants and shops in the immediate area, but we were ok walking a bit. There is a great pub down the hill from the hotel with live music and traditional Irish fare - Murray's pub on O'Connell Street. The Temple Bar area is over the bridge down O'Connell and about a 20 minute walk. We also took a tour to the Cliffs of Moher while there and the pick up point was on O'Connell just a few minutes away from the hotel. We purchased hop on/hop off bus tickets as part of our hotel package which was convenient. If you are looking for a charming, intimate hotel with clean rooms and friendly staff at reasonable prices, I highly recommend this property. ",5,2023,07,06
229,Historic Georgian Hotel on Gardiner Row,"Our family of 4 had a very pleasant stay at this hotel for one night. We reserved a family room that had 4 comfortable beds. The room was clean and had everything we needed. A fan was provided in the closet because the room didn’t have air conditioning. We opened the windows as well. We had a quiet sleep. Breakfast was wonderful. Thank you to the staff who were mindful of our food allergies. Irish music plays each night. Staff are attentive and my emails were answered quickly and kindly. To give you an idea of location it is about 22 min walking to Dublin Castle, about 30 min walking to St. Patrick’s Cathedral, and about 20 min to Trinity College.",5,2023,07,04
229,Great start to trip!,"The hotel was perfect for starting our Ireland adventure.  We were worried about the location, but it was perfect for us.  The hotel is one of the oldest in Dublin and has great access to historic O’Connoll street.  The hotel was quiet and clean.  The people at reception were nice and attentive.    TIP:  they have a secure luggage room that they use to store your bags if your room is not ready.",4,2023,06,28
229,not a 4 star hotel as described,First of all would like to say the staff are amazing  now for the downfalls we booked expecting 4 star hotel which they advertise. The room was on the 3rd floor well away from the lift along coridoors dragging suitcases it was like a maze. The room has no refrigirator no aircon  and no safe not what you expect from a four star hotel in the 4 nights we were there we had no sleep due to the banging of the doors . I  asked if the could fix the door outside our room because when people were goingto there room it was slamming they came and put a chock under the door. The seagulls were noisy as they were scavenging in the bins and it was so hot could nt leave windows open. Breakfast a disaster  we both ordered together and they brought my husbands when i asked where mine was  they said they forgot and it was cold. nowhere to butter toast as they dont have side plates. on the 3rd night we decided to have dinner omg wish we had not bothered my husband sent the soup back as it was so salty i ordered sausage and mash 3 sausages and mash potato which tasted foul and they charged 17 euro for that. this is not wwhat we are used to been to many 5 and 4 star hotels which offer much more it was in a good location but i will not be going back.,2,2023,06,20
229,Great Dublin Locations with Nearby Bus Stops,"The hotel is well located off the Parnell Square in Dublin with nearly bus stops. The staff is top-notch; making me welcomed even though I got in super early and the room was not yet available. Skip the uninspiring full Irish breakfast and enjoy, instead, the yummy options in the continental buffet. Clean, comfortable room with included bottled water and tea/coffee making supplies. ",5,2023,06,18
229,Great Stay In An Historic Dublin Hotel," This is an Historic Hotel with all the quirks that come with being the oldest hotel in Dublin. Since it was converted from a row of Georgian style homes it has an odd layout with several stairs going to the upper levels. But that was the charm...it's not your standard hotel. It's not the Ritz!

With that said, we had a great stay...very friendly staff, great breakfast that is included, nice downstairs bar and restaurant, and music every night. Each room is unique and different but again, that's the charm of this hotel.

There is no AC which is not unusual in Europe. But the beds were very comfortable and there is daily maid service.

We stayed in their apartments in the rear of the hotel and enjoyed the extra space.

The price was excellent, and we would stay here again.",5,2023,06,16
229,Average hotel with a great location,"Even though this hotel is listed as a 4 star, it really is more like a 3 star hotel.  The location is excellent and within 15 minute walk to Trinity College and Temple Bar.  The bus stop is right around the corner.  The rooms were small.  On a wall in our room they must have done some repair work as the wall was badly patched and not painted.  Minor thing but I expect more if a hotel is listed as a 4 star.  Breakfast was OK.    We would consider staying here again as the price point for peak season was within our budget and it was a great location.",3,2023,06,13
229,Find another hotel!,"This review is not a reflection on the staff which were wonderful people!    As Jackie said in the previous review (friends we were with).   The hotel itself is not somewhere you would stay given the following issues.  Out of 5 couples,  three of us had to have our rooms moved because they were so substandard and in disrepair.  Our first room upon entering and turning on overhead chandeliers …the shade fell down off of it and hit me in the head. Went to use bathroom and the toilet seat fell off the toilet!   Lights over bathroom sink and in bedroom were not working.  The room was in the mid 80’s and stifling.  We stayed there the first night with windows open but because of trash bins nearby.  Seagulls were screeching the entire night!   The next day we insisted they move us so we went from the 4th floor to the 2nd.   I was told there was an elevator as our bags were heavy.  Upon getting off on the 2nd floor we still had to go down several stairs and of course drag our bags back up at the end of our stay.   No bell service.  There are staircases throughout hotel so be advised you will be lugging your bags yourself all over.  If you stay in the separate quarter in the Mews where my sister stayed you are dragging you bags up 30 steps as there is no elevator.   Our room was better than the first but of course no a/c so had to sleep with windows open to courtyard that was noisy all night every night for next 7 nights we were there.   The hotel is not maintained as it should be.  I have been to grand very old hotels well maintained and this is not one of them.  Please see attached pic of one of the walls!   The water pressure in our room was nonexistent.   As my husband said,  you have to run around shower to get wet!    Ate dinner there and was disappointed.   I ordered bangers and mash which are supposed to be mashed potatoes but what I got were powdered potatoes from a box!   We are in Ireland eating fake potatoes.    Went for breakfast first day and that was our last day as the service was extremely slow.   For remainder ate the continental which was ok nothing special.  The only hotel lobby bathroom is only one toilet for everyone so most days you had to wait if you didn’t want to go back to your room.   Location is a bit away from most prime areas and alot of beggars  even outside at front door.   This was not an inexpensive hotel and the quality, service and accommodations are poor.",1,2023,06,09
229,In my experience not even close to 4 stars,At the hotel for 10 days.  No rain in Ire the whole 10 days.  Room on 4th floor - hot!  First room was on the main road in Dublin (Frederick St N/Parnell Sq E - turns into O'Connell).  Lots of noise.  Quiet between 2a - 4:45a.  No water pressure and very spotty warm water.  Bed sheets feel like fine grade sand paper.    Requested a room change and received on 3d night.  Still on 4th floor (hot!).  Water temp better but water pressure not so much.  Room facing courtyard.  Noise better but now have seagulls making noise at all hours (it seemed).  At times seagulls sounded like cats fighting - guess they were territorial.  Lots of deferred maintenance in rooms/buildings.  Positives?  Take away water available in room.  Staff pleasant.  Breakfast nice.   Convenient location. Ask for a fan to bring to your room if you stay here.  ,1,2023,06,06
229,Truly a unique experience. Would stay here again,Very nice hotel situated close to shopping and more. Staff is efficient and friendly. Restaurant was a nice surprise with live entertainment on Friday and Saturday.  A unique hotel.  If you are driving here make sure you arrive early enough to get a parking place. Very few parking spots (<10).,5,2023,06,04
229,"Great Location, comfortable stay, good price with breakfast included!","We stayed at this hotel in May and had a wonderful time. Our room was  in the Mews Apartments and we loved the extra room with a living room/dining area and kitchen. Be advised that there is no air conditioning in the rooms but this is rather the norm in Europe unless you stay in a hotel that is much more expensive. Just request a fan at the desk, sleep with your window open or request a room on the first floor. The Staff were very attentive. The breakfast was very delicious and plentiful. You could either eat downstairs to a full service menu or upstairs with a continental style breakfast. They had nightly music in the Vault restaurant and Irish step dancing. All in all we enjoyed our stay in Dublin at the Castle Hotel.",4,2023,06,03
229,Fantastic,"Very friendly, great location, definitely recommend the evening meals and entertainment. Came for our honeymoon and the room had been decorated with balloons etc, lovely touch. Staff very helpful and even got to speak to owner who gave us a very warm Irish welcome ",5,2023,05,30
229,Ticks every box :-) ,"Huge thank you to the Castle Hotel for a wonderful stay. 
Fabulous hotel. Very friendly staff. Rooms clean and private. So many options to dine and great live music. Will definitely be back :-) 
Gillian. ",5,2023,05,08
229,Nice surprise,"Found this place as a bit more reasonable than other places in Dublin.
Would go back Restaurant was good and really enjoyed the music by Raytaht evening.
Glad I found it. My new go to hotel in Dublin.

",5,2023,05,05
229,"Good potential and location, needs a bit of a facelift and guest experience awareness","PROs: location, friendly staff, old-time charm, and full-service hotel.
CONs: fairly tired decor, trim, wall/noise control, extremely unconventional layout, and a bit chaotic during construction/renovation and busy times.  Cramped lobby/hallways and a bit of a maze-like feel in navigating throughout the space.  Hammering/sawing/drilling and such began well before we vacationers were ready to awaken, and it felt like we were having root canal noise level.  Front desk was apologetic but none compensating whatsoever.",3,2023,05,03
229,Very misleading reviews!!,"Arrived today to find a wet towel in our ""cleaned"" room..The room was of a very low standard   dust and grime in the room as shown on photos..we were shown another room that had wallpaper peeling off and holes in the ceiling.. We asked for a refund which we got, the Manager did not offer any form of apology for us then having to go and find another hotel in the centre of Dublin...For £264 per night this was not what I expected. On the plus side we got a much nicer hotel for the same money and it was spotless.  I would not recommend staying here.",1,2023,04,29
229,Peaceful break,"Great hotel, O’Connell street, easy to get to from airport by bus stops near enough outside, well located in Dublin not to far from centre, great reception staff very helpful, room was lovely warm clean walk in shower TV, everything in order? Great cooked breakfast to start the day, young lady advised go and see Howth, got a train from station had great quiet day and a few pints in O’Connells, great location would recommend",5,2023,04,02
229,Castle Hotel Dublin,"This a lovely hotel and we enjoyed our stay there.  The food was wonderful but the best aspect of our stay was the staff, every single member of staff was so friendly, welcoming and helpful, nothing was too much trouble for them. Would definitely love to stay there again!",5,2023,03,23
229,1st class Hotel 🏨,"Stayed at the castle many times in the past .always been well looked after by the 1st class staff and would recommend  the hotel to anyone.  Food lovely rooms very comfortable  will be definitely  going back 
",5,2023,03,13
229,Friendly warm and very helpful. ,"The hotel was lovely, staff so friendly, rooms, food excellent, the location is good about a couple minutes walk to the city centre.  It has been refurbished since the last time I visited, I would highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2023,03,09
229,Don't expect any luxury,"It is a historic buinding serving as a mid range hotel. Advertised as a 4 star, but I could give solid 2 stars. But it works well, if you adjust your expectation.
Location is very good indeed. Not absolutely central, but totally walkable. Many bars and restaurants around and also supermarkets. The area visitors explore isn’t very large. 
 There is elevator and the common areas are ok.
Breakfast included is a special treat and everything was nicely presented. Friendly service at restaurant.
Check in and out just standard. You have to leave the keys (no cards) when you leave, like if we were in 1980. Room was dated as expected, but actually all these disadvantages could be tolerated for the price, given the fact accommodation in Dublin is not cheap.
Bathroom was problematic for me. Absolutely no shower pressure, I wonder it could be a struggle for women with long hair.
I know there was night entertainment in site, but I fortunately couldn’t hear from my room (facing backyard). 
I would stay here again, depending on the price.",3,2023,03,08
229,Nice hotel. Would stay again,"Hotel is quite close to  centre - about 10 minutes to shopping area.  
And about 15/20 mins to temple bar. 
We   stayed in a newer room - some Of our friends had the older rooms. I think the hotel is being refurbished, so they must be re-doing all the rooms.  
Very clean hotel.  - our room was spotless. And cleaned each morning.  
The room was well heated - but big windows to open if you get to hot. 
The reception area and restaurant and bar were very clean as well 
We went for a hot breakfast each morning, and we all enjoyed it.  No complaints from us. 
Friendly staff on reception. 
We would stay again. 

It was Quite expensive to stay… I’m sure you would probably find something a bit cheaper with the same standard elsewhere.",4,2023,03,06
229,Very nice,"This is a nice hotel not far from the centre of Dublin. The restaurants were good, breakfast was excellent and the staff were lovely. We had a slight problem when the bathroom above us was being replaced and drilling started early but they were nice enough to refund half the cost of that night’s stay and get the workmen to start later.",4,2023,03,05
229,"Average, bit disappointing for the money!","Stayed here 2 nights last weekend, location of hotel further out from Centre, hotel a little dated, rooms small, hot breakfast slow, quality of ingredients poor, continental breakfast and room nicer. Expensive for what is was, not sure it’s 4 stars. Irish Staff on reception were lovely.",3,2023,02,24
229,Pleasant stay ,"The hotel is lovely warm clean and friendly staff. I felt very welcome.
It is a traditional hotel and is nearing refurbishment; which is already ongoing. I stayed in room 116 and the noise of the floorboards overhead were terrible, if you are a light sleeper you would struggle here.
The breakfasts were lovely, you get a choice of cooked or continental which is served to you. I ordered sticky toffee pudding one evening and was served a chocolate sponge, when questioned I was told ‘ this is how we do it here!’ So would not recommend ordering this,  as it was a nice chocolate sponge, but no toffee etc. 
there is a singer every evening , the one I saw was very good and i do recommend booking the taxi for the airport they are spot on, on time and very nice. ",3,2023,02,18
229,Good staff,Convenient place to stay nice walk into centre of Dublin. Staff were very good. Room ok a bit cold and very dated . Evening meal good and service very good. Breakfast a bit disjointed had cooked breakfast first morning down stairs then continental breakfast upstairs second day. Would be nice to be able to combine them.,4,2023,02,13
229,Perfect location for city centre,"Lovely hotel friendly staff and excellent breakfast and meals served in the restaurant, perfect location for visiting the city centre attractions, would stay here again if visiting Dublin again , room was ready earlier which was a lovely touch as my flight arrived early morning ",4,2023,02,03
229,Excellent service,"I would like to thank all staff at the castle hotel for making our stay there an excellent one.

From the cleanliness of the rooms the good food both at breakfast and it’s restaurant and the helpful staff working there, thank you for a wonderful experience.",5,2023,02,02
229,A very nice and welcoming hotel in the heart of the city,"Stayed one night, along with my adult son. The reception area was inviting and the staff were very helpful. We arrived prior to check-in time and our luggage was put into secure storage. Comfortable room and bathroom with nice toiletries and really fluffy towels. Dinner in the restaurant was good, and the gentleman who entertained us with Irish music and song added to the ambience. Good food choices and attentive waiters at dinner and the same applied to breakfast. The atmosphere was homely, rather than too corporate. Nicely furnished and decorated seating areas. My only criticism is that although the bedrooms were nice and cosy the sitting rooms were a little cool, but ok if you wore a decent sweater (I do appreciate that fuel is very expensive).",5,2023,01,26
229,Very good with excellent service and very nice straff.,"Good hotel and both the continental and irish breakfast were great. Although I missed the toast or to at least have more different kinds of bread in the continental breakfast.
The rooms were great and the hallways made us feel like we were staying in Fawlty towers with their ups and downs in stairs and corners. Wonderful environment!
The showers were as to expect in Ireland. Not a very good water pressure.
The staff is amazing and so nice. Always with a smile and they all seem to really like their working place.",4,2023,01,16
229,Great service with a good location,"This is my third time staying at the Castle however this time I was with my daughter. The staff in all areas of the hotel are amazing and will do anything to assist with your stay. The breakfast either the cooked or continental have a great solution to choose from. The dinner downstairs with the music and dance my daughter found very entertaining with again a good solution even for the younger members of a family that visit. The room was clean and beds very comfortable. Shower pressure was good and the shower itself you had good room to move around. Hotel also has had a nice coat of paint and renovations in the restaurant)bar downstairs which adds to the charm of the hotel.
Cons:
As it's an older hotel and found on a main road of Dublin you will hear outside noises. The floors are like a rabbit hole so it's a little maze possibly to get to your room. Saying that the signage to your room is extremely clear.
The cons in my eyes are very small and shouldn't stop you from staying in a beautiful and quaint hotel with great staff and excellent location to the centre of town",5,2023,01,16
229,Great bar,"Nice business hotel with friendly staff.  Very nice bar, great vibe.  Robert the bartender was awesome!  Great drinks and awesome atmosphere.  Nice selection of rum and whiskey!  Order a daiquiri, or a smoked old fashioned!  ",5,2023,01,13
229,A really excellent hotel,"Located in the Georgian part of the city, close to all amenities, this is an understated gem of a place to stay to which I’d definitely return.
The food was good, really swift and efficient service with very friendly and helpful staff. Highly recommended.
A very minor point which doesn’t detract from how good this place is; apparently it frequently hosted Michael Collins and Éamon de Valera as a hideout whilst on the run during the war of independence, yet there seems no reference to this. Perhaps this could be exploited by the hotel management in order to provide another dimension to what is a real find of a place to stay.",5,2023,01,12
229,Hidden Gem in the City,"Fantastic stay at The Castle Hotel , Johnny was the perfect host, hotel was spotless, in a fantastic central location and staff were very attentative ,  recommend trying the afternoon tea  or just a relaxing Gin n Tonic at the bar  A++",5,2023,01,04
229,Family Dublin break at Christmas ,We had a faultless stay in this fine establishment. The moment we arrived the front of house staff were excellent attentive & helpful. We stayed in the small apartments at the back of the hotel Harry Clarke Mews. What a find !! Spacious & quietly tucked away in the centre of Dublin. The breakfast choice is superb again the waiting staff were so busy but always polite & helpful. A special mention to Claudia on reception when the extra mile to sort our TV remote & find out bus information. They really fall over themselves to make the stay enjoyable. We'll done to a well oiled team. ,5,2022,12,21
229,Disappointed,"The staff here are lovely and helpful. The hotel has great charm. However, the mattresses are horrible. I could barely sleep due to the discomfort. The walls are thin and you can hear every single bit of noise from surrounding guests and street noise. We had children staying near us and it was typically midnight before they settled down. May have been a school group. Doors slamming, loud chatter. I suppose no one reminded them there were other guests to consider.  The breakfast was horrid.  We ended up finding a wonderful place not terribly far away to eat.",2,2022,12,16
229,Threatened by waiters,"This is supposed to be a 4 stars hotel, what a joke! No warm water in december we had to use the tea boiler to wash. The room was very dusty just look at the air filter in the bathroom. Restaurant  is the worst place of the hotel, slow and rude waiters, they completly disappeared for half an hour and when we payed 2 cards that worked all day were declined, we asked if it was possible to have a final bill at the checkout or pay later but instead we were forced to use all our cash, we had to take some in our room or they wont make us leave!!!! They knew our room number and ours documents but we were like robbers for them, under a bridge is a better place than Castle Hotel.",1,2022,12,14
229,"A, great hotel, for value for money. ","A great hotel for value for money, stayed 3 nights, the room very spacious & laid out well, it's a period building, so rooms have high ceiling. The room was decorated nicely & the bed super comfy, so much didn't want to get up some mornings. The Irish full breakfast very good. If coming to Dublin again, I'd certainly stay here. ",5,2022,11,28
229,Mrs,You might not like my review if our stay in this hotel Dublin ..The experience was good .but when it came to the morning breakfast well we where met with a member of staff who was very rude to my wife .she was very upset and I approched the staff member who took offense to me asking why he spoke to my wife at the table in the restaurant in front of other guests.i got the reply from this man to say he is professional and he walked off .leaving us up set .so we reported this incident to manger at the hotel .To this day we have never received a reply .and our experience in that hotel was a sad one .,3,2022,11,23
229,Great Hotel,"Stayed one night for a concert , very central hotel, walking distance to all the sights. The room was clean and the staff very very welcoming. Cooked to order breakfast was amazing 10 out of 10. Bed was comfy , I can't fault the hotel. Great stay,  thank you.",5,2022,11,08
229,Amazing stay,"Just returned from a four night stay.  Everything was perfect from arriving till we left.  Room was clean and serviced each day. We loved the room 102 with the high ceilings and very tidy decor.  Meals at breakfast and evening where filling and well presented. Staff were courteous and well presented.  We had afternoon tea which was amazing and the young waitress went out of her way to accommodate us. I have not one negative thing to say about the castle hotel and would choose this hotel again if I was to be in dublin. Thank you to all 
",5,2022,10,29
229,Great location and good breakfast,Friends and I shared a quadruple room for a two night stay in Dublin. We enjoyed the friendly and helpful staff who were very accommodating. We even met the charismatic owner. The room was comfortable for a short stay. Breakfast was delicious and a good range available for all. In a great location for access to bus routes.,4,2022,10,27
229,Charming building in city location.,"We stayed at the Castle Hotel for the last two nights of our 9 day Ireland trip. The building itself is very charming with lots of historical detail. With that said, old and charming can also include challenges when it comes to hotels. One thing to know is this hotel allows every movement in and around the hotel to be heard.  Our room faced the street so every bus, car, argument, siren was heard. We also heard every person walking down the hall, every faucet being turned on, and when our neighbors showered the pipes were very loud. Our friends were in a room that faced the court years in the back. They listened to drinkers and smokers sitting outside until 2 am. The bathroom was the smallest hotel bathroom I’ve ever seen and while it was updated it was just really really small. I know it’s a historical building but it would be good to get some additional ventilation in there as the window shade was covered in black mildew. Bed was very firm. The staff was friendly and the breakfast was good. Location is close to the airport and you can easily walk about the city. If you plan to visit Trinity College and Temple Bar area plan to have a healthy walk each way.",3,2022,10,12
229,Just do yourself a favor and book somewhere else.,"Arrived at The Castle Hotel from the airport—not a very long ride, was pleased in that regard. Upon checkin, only one of two rooms was ready. Not a huge deal, but after a long travel day it was not exactly the news we were hoping for. 

Hotel has a bag room on arrival if you show up before check in time. We utilized it, but noticed that it was more of a self service bag room (you physically put your bags on the shelf, nothing stopping you from grabbing someone else’s bag on the way out).

Rooms are a little…. Strange. 

One room had it’s own exit door to the outside, and is a full glass door—not the kind of security we expected. Nothing to block the light or vision of a passerby on this door, a peeping Tom would have quite the show. 

Lighting and electrical system seemed to be on the fritz throughout the whole duration of our stay. Seemed like the place was haunted, or someone was trying to talk to us from the upside down. 

Other room was off in it’s own little catacomb of the building, kind of like a maze of sorts getting around the place. This room had some sort of strange combination put in by a builder or something. The bathroom was conjoined to the bathroom in the room across from it, but there’s no sound deadening, so you have to listen to a stranger utilizing the bathroom at all hours of the day and night. Not pleasant. Pretty sure the neighboring bathroom vented into our room. Again, not pleasant. 

Lastly, a majority of the windows in this hotel are old, single pane windows. I personally love the look of old glass windows, they look beautiful and feel nostalgic. But in this case, they do absolutely nothing to stop the sound of vehicles passing throughout the day. Every car, truck, motorcycle, loud drunk guy, and fist fight was heard in our rooms. This made it incredibly difficult to sleep. 

Overall, can’t recommend unless you’re desperate.",2,2022,10,11
229,"Great Value, Nice Folks","The place shows it's age ... Carpet a bit tattered,  in need of a paint job  and the location could be a bit better...... That said, it was clean and the people here were quite nice.  There were a couple breakfast options which were included and were good.",4,2022,10,05
229,Trip from the 12th > 16th Sept,"I stayed at this hotel from the 12th to the 16th of Sept 2022, for a gig in Dublin for a group known as 'Gloryhammer'.

The stay was as expected, a great bed and was greeted with a clean room that had housekeeping clean up and remake my bed every morning while I was in the city.

The included breakfast at the 'Castle Vaults Restraunt' in the morning was a great start to the day to walk around Dublin city, which wasn't too far away from the centre of the city.

The bar below the Hotel was also very warm and cosy, serving a range of drinks.

I pre-paid for the hotel before arriving so found no expenses upon booking in or out of the hotel.

I only had three issues that I found with the hotel, my bathroom sink was wobbly for some reason and the rooms didn't have a safe, which would have been nice to have.

Although it should be noted that nothing did go missing.

And the walls seemed somewhat thin, on one of the last evenings a couple next door not really being very considerate were talking/laughing until around 1 am in the morning. The walls struck me as being moderately thin. 

But for the price paid, the stay was great value and the food was excellent. Thank you for a great service I'd defiantly come back again.",5,2022,10,05
229,Really relaxed and accommodating hotel,"Our room was on the fourth floor and due to previous reviews I was worried about the shower pressure…it was absolutely fine. The room was large, clean with great towels and facilities. Hairdryer was rubbish and kept overheating but a call to reception brought a new one immediately.
Yes, there are a lot of corridors but everything is sign posted so that was no problem.
Both breakfast options are good, we also had room service, a meal in the restaurant and afternoon tea - all amazing quality. 
Staff great fun and really helpful especially Owen who appears to work all the time!
Would definitely recommend",4,2022,09,24
229,"Booked for Garth brooks concert,11th September","Arrived a bit early so didn't expect my room to be ready which I had already received a lovely email. Sat outside, was given a lovely coffee while I waited. Got chatting to another guest, Lorraine, about the concert later in evening. Room was ready about 2.30pm. lovely single room, tea/coffee etc and chocolate mint on my pillow!!
Went and had some food which was nice. Went to concert, got lost on way back but managed to get a last drink before closing time! Breakfast was lovely next morning and also had evening meal which was good. Tuesday morning ordered full Irish again but no fried egg but Sinaed in the kitchen sorted me out!! Reception gave me some plasters, too much walking! I can't fault anything and if I get the chance, will go back again. Thank you x",5,2022,09,22
229,Overpriced,"Stayed here on Sept 16th, paid 379 euro .. 
Water freezing , hallway had toilet paper and water bottles laying around . No parking available when that was the main reason for my stay ! Overall not a 4 star hotel in my opinion... needs a good clean. 
Got a phone call from a director? No satisfaction.",1,2022,09,20
229,SO CLOSE TO EVERYTHING,"Nice hotel with lots of character.  Breakfast were excellent as were the staff, both waiting and reception.  Our room was a good size and overlooked the large church on O'Connell Street.   The location was excellent, close to everything and to the many eateries around O'Connell St and side streets.   My only complaint would be the bathroom, which was small and the shower was over the bath, which was quite a high bath.  We had no problem with the shower stream, it was fine in our room.   Recommend this hotel for its locality, charm, breakfasts and staff.",4,2022,09,19
229,Worst travel experience ever,"Arrived exhausted late at night from 4 hours driving. No parking at hotel and had to carry bags from public parking through dimly lit sections of town. The man at the front desk was rude to us. He made my daughter feel like a prostitute looking directly at her asking her if she was staying and saying the room was for two people. She did not answer him and he continued to check us out and handed my husband the key then asked my daughter AGAIN as she headed up with us if she was staying! I said “that is my daughter she is with us.” He said she could not stay we only paid for 2 people. I told him we had traveled abroad, we only needed two beds, one for my husband, one for my daughter and asked is that not ok? He said no, you have to pay more money. He charges 81 and did not even give us an upgrade. We paid 230 for the tiniest, dingiest room I’ve ever stayed in. In the states our $50 hotels are much nicer and spacious. We even had to carry our luggage up several flights of stay after a long walk.",1,2022,09,18
229,"Nice staff, dreadful showers and hard beds","The hotel is trying hard, the rooms are clean and most of the staff are polite and helpful. However the shower is unusable literally a dribble coming out, I’ve been to better campsite shower blocks! The beds were very hard, which if you like that then it’s all good, not for me though I had to take pain killers every morning and hobble about. Was in room 421 which had a tiny window you couldn’t close, the room faced the main road so we were woken through the night to drunken singing and police sirens. Not worth the money we paid sorry to say.",2,2022,09,18
229,Shower does not work!,So disappointed with this hotel. It cost €279 per night and the shower does not even work. A dribble of water comes out. We are in room 421 and complained to reception and they just said the water pressure is not good on the 4th floor. Not good enough considering the price of the hotel. It’s more like a b&b than a hotel yet not b&b prices. Really disappointing.,2,2022,09,17
229,Lovely hotel with a lot of character,This hotel has style and character. Lovely reception area and comfortable sofas and chairs. Very comfortable room and bed. Near to the heart of the city. Parking is round the corner from the main entrance.,5,2022,09,14
229,Noise from bins,"Lovely food room was a let down thease hotels rooms need to be painted and require new carpets. Staff where friendly but didn't know about the noise from the bins being brought in a 11pm at night and 7pm or earlier in the morning. Iam sure people would of complained about this before.
This is the only reason I would not stay again as we didnt sleep very well at all and the rooms windows where flithy was a minor issue.",2,2022,09,12
229,Fabulous,A great property.  Very charming. Excellent location.  A 12 minute walk to Temple Bar.  Staff is phenomenal.  Bathroom is on the small side if you have mobility issues.  Morning breakfast is excellent.  Lots of variety.  Hotel is a 6 minute walk to the pick up spot for many day excursions.  Quite convenient.  Downstairs restaurant was excellent. Great food and entertainment.  Reserve your table in the main area if you want to see the entertainment.,5,2022,09,12
229,Great hotel,"Stayed here for a concert.
Central location for Dublin and 15 min walk from Croke Park.
Warm welcome from staff on arrival after a very long journey.
Room basic but ok, comfortable bed and a decent shower.
Only negatives were a view of an alleyway, had to stand on the bed to close the window and ended up with a number of bites.
Breakfast was nice and although extremely busy staff were very attentive.
Georgian building with some uneven floors which adde to the character.
All considered a great stay and will return if the concert is held again.",5,2022,09,10
229,Handily located,The hotel is a nice old Georgian building a little tired and creaky in places. It benefits from a good location on O’Connel street across the road from the Dublin City art gallery (a small permanent collection - but really worth visiting). The staff were very friendly and helpful. My room was a decent sized and comfortable and I had reasonable sleep quality. The continental breakfast was a little underwhelming but still sufficient. Pricing was reasonable and competitive. An overall satisfactory stay.,4,2022,09,03
229,A little tired,"Staying at the castle hotel in the centre of Dublin- the room is very tired. Bed jammed right against the radiator (glad it’s summer otherwise you couldn’t sleep!) bathroom adequate but in need of renovation!
Breakfast basic, they call it Irish breakfast because it’s nothing like an English breakfast - think continental & you won’t be disappointed. Restaurant is basically bar food & the entertainment is not background but so loud he thinks he’s performing at a concert, you can’t hear yourself speak!",2,2022,09,02
229,Lovely hotel,"The building is lovely; a very fascinating old georgian house. Staff at the reception was very kind and helpful. The room was basic but clean. We choose the continental breakfast that was quite good; they offer the option of Irish breakfast but did not feel to eat a large quantity of food in the morning. The location is great; close to bus stop, shops and restaurants. Many attractions are walking distance! We took bus 16 directly from the airport (3.30Euro); it stops 50 m. from the hotel.",4,2022,09,01
229,"I loved, loved, loved this place","My 3rd floor room was basic but comfortable, overlooking a courtyard, but the main floor is just gorgeous, with many beautifully furnished side rooms.  I felt like a pampered guest.  For breakfast one has a choice of buffet in one restaurant or full service in another.  I was able to sample both, as well as several light lunches - delicious soups and salads.  All the food was outstanding.  Staff was great.

Great location.  Historic Ha'penny Bridge is a 15-min walk to the south, and Blessington Street Basin, a beautiful park, is a 10-min walk to the northwest.  

Please note:  from what I could see, there are stairs everywhere, even just to get to the elevators, so I suspect this hotel would not work for those with mobility issues.  Best to check with the hotel directly to confirm though.  Perhaps there are accessible rooms.",5,2022,08,31
229,"Beautiful, safe and clean hotel. ","I spent 14 nights at this hotel as a solo traveler.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay there. The hotel was very clean and had tour pamphlets in the reception area. The staff at reception were always polite and helpful. My room had a double bed and a modern bathroom. There were four pillows to choose from and a duvet for covering. There is no top sheet, so if you need one to sleep, bring your own. The room was very clean and had a kettle with tea, coffee packets and bottled water. There was also small bars of soap, shampoo, and body wash. No face cloths, so bring your own like I did if needed. I had the full Irish breakfast once but preferred the continental breakfast for the other days. There were plenty of choices and everything was very fresh. They also got an espresso machine installed recently. If you were leaving on an early day trip, you can ask for a takeaway breakfast. They give you a big muffin, a large apple and a box of orange juice in a brown bag with a handle. There were many different things to see in the hotel and it felt like a museum. The location was amazing. It is close to busses, a beautiful  church, remembrance park and a short walk to the city center. They also have a luggage storage room if your room is not ready yet.  There is no safe or fridge in the room. I highly recommend this hotel and will be back again in the future. Thank you for making my solo trip to Ireland a home away from home. See you soon. 💚",5,2022,08,14
229,Most helpful staff anywhere!,"A charming, unique hotel in a great location. What makes this place stand out is the staff - incredibly helpful, accommodating, and pleasant. They went above and beyond to help us, even storing our daughter’s two large suitcases (she is coming to Ireland as a student for a year) for two+ weeks while we traveled. Kudos and thanks to Team Castle!",5,2022,08,14
229,Charming,"A charming hotel, located just off o'connell Street, so close to the bars,restaurants and shops, and close to all transport links, so ideally located.
The hotel has a charm all off its own, the young man who checked us in, was friendly and polite and respectful, the room was compact and charming, shower and bathroom small but functional, the full breakfast was delicious, and there was a wide range of foods for everyone's tastes, the downstairs restaurant , was wonderfully charming . The only downside was the noise coming from outside, especially in the morning, from the workers ,which made sleeping a little difficult.
",4,2022,08,09
229,Traditional hotel with hospitality and warmth,"Our very first visit to this lovely hotel was for afternoon tea in the lovely simple Georgian room the service was excellent with great value for the afternoon tea especially if you have a sugary sweet tooth . We have returned on a number of evenings for the entertainment of traditional Irish music and dance  and have never been disappointed  the evening restaurant menus is reasonably priced  and tasty . A great location only fifteen minutes walk to central town .The bedrooms are comfortable and clean whilst the served breakfast was excellent  a special mention must go to Trevor who  represents  all the charm and warmth and politeness of this charming hotel  looking forward to our next visit 
                                                                                                     Mark & Florence",5,2022,08,06
229,Enjoy the music!,"I love European hotels with a maze of a walk to the room - which was perfect because we had a room on the 4th floor at the end of the hallway and it was great.  Note: seagulls are soooo loud! Nothing the hotel can do about it, but it was shocking how much noise they made throughout the night.  

The singer in the Castle Vaults restaurant was a great experience.  The singer was just lovely. I could listen to him again and again. Great stories to accompany each song. He took requests - and knew every song requested.  He was the highlight of the hotel. 

We parked on street out front - very easy. 

All of the employees were wonderful and helpful.  From the front desk to the waitstaff.  It was a wonderful way to spend our last night in Ireland.",5,2022,08,04
229,Adorable breakfast room,"The breakfast (full Irish) was plenty large enough and fabulous. the breakfast room was so Irish, I adored all the arrangements.  All the stairs and little corridors leading to our room had some surprise e.g. little antique recamier that was nice to look at and have some photos with. From our room we could hear and see the seagulls all night which was really nice, it is still echoing in my ears. The parking lot is really small but you can park on the street as well.",5,2022,07,19
229,Really Nice Hotel in a great location,"Location was really easy - just North of O'Connell Street and close to a Big Bus stop. 
Breakfast was great, choice of ground floor for Continental or downstairs for cooked - both superb.
Staff were always on hand and couldn't do enough to make the stay comfortable.
Next time in Dublin we will go straight back to The Castle Hotel.
We really enjoyed Ray the Irish Balladeer on Saturday evening - he was superb.",5,2022,07,19
229,"Convenient, adequate but wouldn’t be first choice!","Stayed in this hotel for the he weekend while seeing a concert. Conveniently located,
It is within walking distance of most of the city centre. 

The pictures online are a little misleading. It appeared to be modern but this is not the case. While the rooms are clean and tidy, they are in my opinion in need of a serious upgrade along with a lot of the hotel. 

This hotel is awkward to navigate to get to your room. There is a lift but if you are a disabled person you may struggle to enjoy the Full Irish breakfast or the bar and evening music as you can only access via stairs. 

The cooked breakfast is of fair standard. Freshly cooked. Would be nice if there was a choice of how you would like your eggs cooked as only fried available. Toast is provided prior to the breakfast arriving but the lack of a side plate made it a little tricky to butter my toast. 

The staff are friendly and helpful. 

I would consider staying here again but wouldn’t be my first choice if I can stay somewhere that is more modern.",3,2022,07,10
229,Excellent choice for three nights in Dublin,"As others have noted The Castle Hotel is old terrace housing which has been converted. We loved the style of the place with beautiful living spaces to relax in downstairs (particularly useful at night while our child slept in room) and art throughout.  Our room (115) was nice with a fairly newly renovated bathroom. Ability to open windows was appreciated. Only issue with bathroom was it wasn't properly designed - toilet too close to the wall and shower head right in corner of cubicle - poor design/workmanship that unfortunately will be difficult to change. Useable but could have been better.  Floorboards in room above also creaked but thankfully wasn't a huge problem. Beds are comfortable and curtains blocked out most of the light.  Reading other reviews it seems rooms and bathrooms can vary.  I've rated it 4/5 as I don't think the standard reflected the pretty high price tag - although all hotels in Dublin appear very expensive for what you get.

Staff were all really friendly and breakfast spread was very good. Good location and would recommend for singles, couples and families wanting a hotel with character.",4,2022,07,09
229,Nice Hotel,"This hotel was just perfect for us. A 10 minute walk to the city centre. The breakfast on offer was plentiful - you have either a continental option or cooked. The are within different restaurants in the hotel but you can eat from one then take into the other if you chose to have a different breakfast from the person you are travelling with.

The rooms are dated but it done the job. Clean towels everyday plus a bed make as well. Shower could have done with a bit more power and they was no extractor fan so it got very hot and damp

Very friendly staff who speak many languages",4,2022,06,29
229,"Nice hotel, poor room","On the plus side the hotel provides a Continental and an Irish breakfast, with had a very large and very nice selection of choices for each. The staff were all friendly and helpful. Also they have entertainment in the hotel with live music every evening and dancing some evenings as well.

On the negative side sadly was our room. The door to our room wouldn’t lock easily and we ended up having to slam the door shut every time we left the room to get the door to lock. The only way to cool the room was to open the windows. As the latch on the windows was high up, we had to stand on a chair to be able to open and close the windows easily. Also I discovered some bits of dried food around the skirting board in the room (pretty disgusting that). 

The big negative was the bathroom in our room, which was awful:

1) The bathroom was very warm, especially after using the shower. The air vent in the ceiling didn’t do much to get rid of the damp and the heat in the bathroom.
2) There was very little power in the shower.
3) When we tried to change the height of the shower head, the shower head holder kept falling out of its bracket. So in the end we just left the shower head alone.
4) The worst thing about the bathroom was that there was no shower cubicle, there was just a curtain around the shower, with a slope in the floor for the water to drain down. The problem was that this didn’t prevent you from flooding the bathroom when having a shower. So if you went into the bathroom after someone had used the shower, you had to go into the bathroom wearing footwear, or you would soak your socks.

Now I know that it is a very old Victorian hotel, so probably not easy to upgrade the facilities, but you still need to provide reasonable facilities in the rooms.",3,2022,06,26
229,Hotel offering good accommodation/ friendly atmosphere,"Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. A warm friendly atmosphere making it a memorable and delightful stay in the city. 
The hotel is fairly central, just around from the Hugh Lane Gallery which is a very worthwhile visit. 
Very relaxed atmosphere making it more like staying with family.",5,2022,06,25
229,Delightful stay,"We booked 3 nights at the Castle with another family, and while I'm sure there are lots of excellent hotels in Dublin, I don't think I'm ever going to look to stay anywhere else when I visit.  I adore this hotel.   The hotel is composed of several buildings that have been linked together and so it's a bit of a labyrinth inside.  A ridiculously fun labyrinth; we kidded we were in the Irish Hogwarts, as every time we left our room to go down to reception it seemed we ended up going down a different way.  It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but we loved it. 

We had a sizable suite on the top floor with two bathrooms.  Water pressure and drain in one of the bathrooms was not great, and the water never got really hot for us, but it wasn't a big deal.  Windows on two different walls in the larger bedroom so we got a nice cross breeze when we opened the windows.  Our friends had one large triple on a lower floor, with gorgeous high ceilings.  I thought both rooms were great.

The restaurant in the basement does good dinners (we ate there twice- I had the Guinness beef stew and the vegetable curry) and has a decent bar.  The second night we were there for the live music; a wonderful guitarist/singer who had the entire room singing along.

The served breakfast and the continental style breakfast are both very good; if you want hot food it'll be the served breakfast.  My husband opted for the Full Irish, and it's a lot of food.  I did the Vegetable (same as the Full Irish, minus the meat options) and also found it very substantial.

It's well located, a short walk from some shopping areas, and maybe ten minutes from the GPO.  And about 15 minutes to the Liffey by foot. We found it a great home base.  Excellent stay; I'm so sad to leave.",5,2022,06,13
229,Great stay,"I would certainly recommend this hotel for a stay in Dublin. It was converted from 5 Victorian townhouses and is privately owned. Although there are about 120 bedrooms it still has a personal feel. The decor is good, it seems to have been recently decorated. Room and bathroom both very good. Breakfast was a good choice between cooked or continental. 
There was live Irish music in the restaurant and even Irish dancing on Friday evenings. 
Good location, not in the centre but we got in a hop on hop off bus very close to the hotel.",5,2022,06,13
229,Average hotel,"The hotel is very old, one of the oldest ones in Dublin and it is in a good condition considering its age. However, there are some things that can and should be improved. 
First of all, the water pressure in our shower was extremely low and using the shower was a real challenge. At some point, even the pressure in the toilet was low so it kept leaking. Speaking of the bathroom, we were given a dirty rug and I don't think the bathroom was thoroughly cleaned because I found some hairs in the shower on the first day, before I even used it.

Second of all, we were given a room next to the staff and storage room so when we opened the door we would always bump into a staff member getting new cleaning supplies from the closet. I don't think our room was originally a guest room, I think it was just added there recently; even the key that we were given was different. Everyone got a big, fancy key that looked like it belonged to a castle, but ours was a small one with a pathetic plastic tag.

Now the breakfast; you can choose Irish or Continental and since we were in Ireland, of course we went with Irish. The food was OK, but the waiters were very confused and often brought us something we didn't ask for or a few portions of the same meal. 

Overall, it is a nice hotel, but you have to be very lucky and get a good room and you should be fine :)",3,2022,05,21
229,"Don’t bother staying here 
,","I was looking forward to my stay at the castle hotel Dublin. Very very disappointed. I booked a $200 a day room and got. a $50 a day room.I requested a city view and got a parking lot view.  The room was extremely hot with no way to control the temperature. The bed spread was soiled, no safe in the room. Just plain awful, DON’t STAY HERE.",1,2022,05,19
229,Only reviewing the restaurant,"We didn't stay at this hotel, but we had dinner in their restaurant.  The food was so-so, but there is nightly music and the Irish balladeer that evening was so wonderful!  We stayed for his entire set.  Everyone in the restaurant was quiet so that we could all hear him.  It was more like a concert than the usual background music in a bar or restaurant.",4,2022,05,19
229,What a lovely friendly hotel,"We stayed one night at The Castle after being moved there by a sister hotel who were full. What a great hotel, brilliant location and very comfortable rooms. Also the private carpark at the back is fab, very safe to park my car as its behind locked gates. The staff were lovely , friendly especially  on reception and cooked the breakfasts are so huge I couldn't eat it all! They have entertainment  at night as well and the drinks prices are very reasonable and cheap for a city centre hotel. Lovely place will definately return and stay longer.",5,2022,05,18
229,Wonderful place!,"The staff was wonderful, helpful and personable. The rooms were beautiful, the beds comfy. The food was awesome, they were very accommodating with all my allergies. It is very central to most of Dublin, being easy to get to shopping and different tours.  The staff was very helpful, offering advice on food and attractions. I would definitely recommend to anyone to stay there.",5,2022,05,15
229,Excellent accommodation.,"I visited the Castle Hotel in Dublin for the very first time, in fact this was my first ever visit to the island of Ireland.
Dates of visit: 8-10 May, 2022 (2 night stay).

My review: 

This hotel was perfect in every way possible.

On arrival I received a great welcome from the reception staff.
The bedroom was beautiful, clean & on a low floor as I requested.
The breakfasts and evening dinners were both delicious and well-presented.     
The Staff are well trained in customer service.

Wish I had stayed in this hotel for longer if I'm honest.
Highly recommendable so I am happy to return at some point in the future.",5,2022,05,15
229,"Good Location, Close to City Centre and Public Transport","Very Good Hotel close To the Hustle and Bustle of O’ Connell Street and Good Public Transport Links. Room was Comfortable and Roomy. Irish Breakfasts we’re Outstanding also have a good Continental option. Ate at the Castle Vaults one night and very much enjoyed the Live Music along with the Menu on offer. Only downside during visit was Wifi was Spotty at Times. Overall a good Hotel to base Yourself in Dublin to walk to Sites or If Doing Tours with Wild Rover Tours, only a 6 minute walk to the Gresham Hotel to Link up with Guided Bus Tours, or for those Catching the Air Link or Air Coach to Dublin Airport. Highly Recommend to those looking for a central location close to O’Connell Street. I look forward to a Future Visit",5,2022,05,08
229,"Great, cosy hotel","The hotel is really in the center of Dublin - we could walk to the city center within a few minutes. The Hotel is clean and looks cosy inside. Our twin room had a high ceiling, which made the room look bigger. The rooms are clean and there is a good room service every day. The staff is very nice and helpful. The breakfast is good. We preferred the Irish breakfast to the Continental one. The dinner at the hotel restaurant was good and the live music and dance show really great. 

Unfortunately there is not too much space in the bathroom to put your things. When the window was properly closed, you could still hear the street noises and some other noises inside the hotel. That didn't affect us much but it could annoy some people.",4,2022,05,05
229,Not a 4* experience but pleasant enough,"The location is great for access into town. The staff friendly and the bar area nice. Entertainment is available in the restaurant for a couple of hours every night. However, the overall experience was marred by the following; 
The hotel was very old fashioned. The windows in our room were very draughty making the room cold despite being double glazed and a lot of the outside noise came in so sirens could be heard through the night. The shower was very poor and had to be hand held as the height adjuster was broken. It also took a long time to get to a decent temperature with little pressure. The beds were not very comfortable and every time we moved (turned over) the headboard, annoyingly, banged into the wall waking us up. 
We arrived back late on Saturday night and asked if there was any food available. They didn't even have a packet of crisps or biscuits that we could have and we ended up walking up the road at nearly midnight to find some take away food. I would expect a 4* hotel to have some facility to feed hungry guests, even if just a sandwich or snacks. On our last evening we ate in the restaurant ordering 2 vegetarian curries. Two chicken curries were delivered to our table and it wasn't until we tried them that we realised they were chicken. Whilst this wasn't a problem for one of us the other has been vegetarian for over 30 years and was very upset to find chicken in her food. We pointed out the problem and a vegetarian meal was then served but the chicken curry was left at the table for quite some time before we were able to attract the attention of a waiter to remove it (this was before the replacement vegetarian curry was made and served). Even though the chicken curry was served in error my friend said she would eat it (as she isn't vegetarian and so that it didn't go to waste) we were still charged for a chicken curry when we could have insisted on both being replaced with what was ordered. All in all we think this hotel was over priced.",3,2022,04,25
229,Def not 4 star!,"Recently spent two nights in this hotel… supposedly 4 star?? Two star at best… it is an absolute warren of bedrooms… no rhyme nor reason to layout.. room was very functional but old fashioned. Spotless. Bed was very comfortable. Shower was disastrous. The staff were all lovely and extremely helpful. Breakfast was very mixed up… continental upstairs, full Irish down stairs. Good location close to city centre but would be reluctant to return.",3,2022,04,02
229,A comfortable stay with tasty breakfast and a great bar,"Our room was comfortable and clean and the hotel is nicely presented. Staff were very friendly and breakfast was very tasty. Hearty portions and an excellent selection. The bar area is very cosy and has a true Irish feel.

Our only feedback is that the shower could have been a bit more powerful. I would definitely recommend the Castle Hotel for a city break stay.",4,2022,03,27
229,Three Day Break,"I think you can always judge a place by the way they deal with a problem or complaint and the staff at the Castle hotel were polite, efficient and resolved my complaint and all done with a smile.
I was given a room that turned out to be above the arch where all the deliveries came in and it acted like an echo chamber when said deliveries arrived at 6am. 
Gillian at reception dealt with this perfectly and I was given another room without question. 
All the staff in the hotel, reception, the cleaners, cafe and restaurant serving staff were friendly, professional and welcoming. The hotel although old and not top end it was spotless. The bed was comfortable and you could actually open windows, the room wasn't unbearably hot like so many are.
The entertainment in the restaurant each night was fabulous, whether you were eating or coming in just for a drink, a really lovely atmosphere down in the vaults. The full Irish breakfast kept us going all day.
I would definitely return.
The Hop on - Hop off bus tour has a stop just across the road from the hotel and does a full circuit of all the places of interest in the city, Buy a ticket for a day or more and literally hop on and off at the places you want to visit.",4,2022,03,25
229,Lovely St Patrick's Stay,"My friends & I stayed at the castle hotel over the St Patrick’s day weekend & we absolutely loved it.
Now if you’re one of those folks that love everything modern & gadgets then this is not the place for you.  If you love ornate deco, history & warm hospitality then this is the place for you.
The staff from arrival were lovely & friendly plus if you ask, you’ll also get history info about the hotel too.
I was staying with friends & our room was big enough for the three of us & had all we needed.  To be honest we were hardly in the room as the location is very central & we were able to walk to all the places we wanted to visit.
The hotel breakfast was good, a cooked breakfast or continental, I am vegan there was food I could eat & they also had soya milk for cereal & tea.  The staff serving were all lovely & breakfast was a nice start to the day.
The hotel is compromised of several Georgian houses & it was like a little maze finding your room (thank goodness for the signs) that made us giggle after a few drinks.
My only criticism is the lack of choice for a vegan for an evening meal, there was only one which was a falafel & salad, which was lovely, but if you wanted a hot meal or something a little more substantial, you’d be disappointed.  However, there are plenty of food places to eat nearby.  We choose to eat in the restaurant as there was music & dancing (which was fantastic) It would have been good to see a vegan chilli on the menu too but the entertainment made up for it.
Location wise, as I said, it is within walking distance of Trinity College, the Post Office (good little museum there) Temple Bar etc.  We on arrival caught a bus in which was 10 euro return to the city centre & a 14 min walk (we had a further walk as we arrive on the day of the St Patrick’s day parade) so a lot of roads were closed.  We chose to take a taxi back to the airport which was only 25 euros.
I would absolutely stay here again & plan to, it really embellished the warm hospitality of Eire, a fab find.",5,2022,03,23
229,Quaint and handy,"This hotel is situated in old Georgian houses, because of this  it’s all on different levels. How many hotels do you know you that you  go in the lift to the 3rd  floor and walk down 7 stairs to the rooms numbered 400 +. Our bedroom was clean tidy and all we needed for our short stay. Please don’t expect ultra modern facilities. 
The staff are all friendly and helpful .
We had the the breakfast which was well presented and tasty. 
If you want a quaint hotel at a reasonable price at the top of O’Connell Street we can recommend this hotel.",4,2022,03,22
229,Weekend away with friends,"Stayed for a long weekend with friends. We found all the staff fantastic and nothing was too much trouble. Rooms were really clean and comfortable. We ate in the vault restaurant Saturday night. Food was really good. The live music was fantastic and the atmosphere was amazing. We stayed there all night listening to the music and stories. Hotel is in a great location for visiting and touring the area. 
Breakfasts were great. Plenty of food. 

Only a small negative point is the noise from the outside that can be heard in your room.

With that said we will definitely be back",5,2022,03,08
229,Afternoon tea,"We had afternoon tea this afternoon, with our two children. The food was fantastic with an ample selection of lovely treats. All the staff were extremely helpful and kind to the children. The manager couldn’t have done enough to ensure we had a perfect afternoon. Highly recommended. Thank you so much for an ideal first family post Covid outing!",5,2022,03,06
229,Ideal overnight stay,The Castle Hotel was ideal for a night's stay while exploring Dublin. It's located within walking distance of amenities and local attractions. The cleaning of the room could be done more thoroughly. Breakfast served in the morning was scheduled in time zones.,3,2022,03,05
229,Awesome Hotel with History,"My boyfriend and I recently stayed at the beautiful, over 200 year old, Castle Hotel. 

This hotel is full of antique furniture, decor, and paintings. The staircases are gorgeous! I preferred taking them over the lift!

The front desk staff are very friendly and helpful. Upon check out, I got a quick history lesson regarding one of the hotel's most distinguished guests, Michael Collins, from Mr. Quinn! You can find Michael Collins' portrait just off the reception area. I wish we could have stayed longer to hear more about hotel and it's place in history. 

The bar and restaurant are in the former wine cellars. It's very cozy. There was an Irish balladier performing traditional Irish music as well as a few ""newer"" tunes. The young lady who displayed her dancing talent was exceptional. It made for a very pleasant evening! 

I had the Irish beef Guinness stew. It was so good! My boyfriend had the chicken wings which were also very tasty. 

Breakfast was served directly to your table. You could choose from traditional Irish or continental. Since we had an early flight before normal breakfast hours, the hotel kindly prepared for us a take away breakfast! 

I love this hotel! We will definitely stay here again when we come back to Dublin!",5,2022,02,28
229,"The Castle Hotel - simple, comfortable no frills accommodation","The hotel is clean and comfortable with no frills. It's ideal for a city break. Rooms comfortable and clean, lounge and reception fine. Only negative is they are a bit disorganised at breakfast, but don't  let that put you off staying here.",4,2022,02,28
229,Tom and Nora,"We stayed 2 nights, a lovely, clean, quirky hotel. Sinead in the bar made our stay complete with her friendly, funny, joyful manner and is an asset to the hotel. We will definitely stay again because of Sinead.",5,2022,02,26
229,Lovely friendly hotel,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Castle hotel in Dublin. Good location, nice room and very friendly staff. Restaurant food was good, great breakfast and great singers on every night. Will definitely stay again. Thanks.",5,2022,02,17
229,Fab Hotel,"A fabulous quirky hotel. If you love Premier Inn don't stay here. If you want a hotel stay with great staff, a fabulous breakfast and great entertainment most evenings in the Vaults Restaurant then this is the place. Room clean. Bed very comfy. Even car parking. Great spot for whatever you are doing in Dublin.",5,2022,02,06
229,Excellent location. Only short walk into centre of  Dublin. Really lovely old hotel. Full of charm and history. The room,"Excellent location. Only short walk into centre of  Dublin. Really lovely old hotel. Full of charm and history. The rooms were reasonably spacious, clean, good quality beds and nice bathroom. The breakfast was exceptionly varied and suited all food choices.The restaurant food was really well presented and very tasty. The staff were so friendly and accomodating. Sinead in the restaurant was particularly helpful. We were celebrating a big birthday and nothing was too much trouble. The free parking was an added bonus. I have no hesitation in recommending The Castle.",5,2022,02,03
229,Lovely old hotel on a good location for a fair price,"This hotel breaths history and atmosphere. The rooms are old and the walls and floors might not be straight like modern hotels, but this all has a great charm. The room was clean, the beds were good, we heard no noice from outside or other guests, the shower was really warm and there was enough closet space. The staff was always very thoughtful and helping, both at reception as at dinner/breakfast. Breakfast was set with table service, but they had no problems with alternatives like an Irish vegan instead of veggie breakfast (delicious sausages!), providing extra fruits, serving soy milk, or even serving an extra dish like (non-vegan) pancakes along with the other breakfast options. Would definitely return to this when I would be visiting Dublin again and I would also recommend this hotel to others!",5,2022,01,09
229,Just as I had pictured and hoped  for in  a historic hotel,"I chose this hotel because it is the oldest hotel in Dublin. It is actually several Georgian Houses that make up this hotel. So the interior is beautifully decorated and has multiple staircases that go in all directions.( elevators also) There are so many different rooms where you can sit and relax. 
The price was very good. The room was comfortable and our bathroom was modernized. I can't say enough about the friendly staff. Each encounter we had was positive.  
We had to leave at 4:30 on am and the night receptionist (Ahmed?) cooked a breakfast for us in the restaurant since we were traveling and arranged for our taxi pickup. Above and beyond with an excellent and friendly demeanor. 
The hotel is just off O'Connell street which is a main thoroughfare for everything so we were able to walk everywhere from there. 
We had English Tea in the coffee shop which was a treat. The owner's son (Daniel?) spent time talking with us and welcoming us. Although we got into a political discussion of opposing views he was gracious. 
I would stay here again and recommend it to everyone.",5,2021,12,28
229,"Warm Bed, Good Food, Excellent Service","I have stayed previously when on business in Dublin City centre and the positives with this establishment have remained steadfast. I have deducted a star for a few niggling maintenance issues with the room, however in general I had a very positive and pleasant stay.
The service is absolutely the jewel in the crown of this hotel and as previously stated in many reviews, good service can make up for a multitude and is the lasting memory of any stay, whilst poor service will diminish even the most spectacular of stays / meals etc. 
All of the hotel personnel from the young man I spoke to after booking the wrong dates, to the friendly and efficient check in on arrival and the professional yet very pleasant young Spanish lady who greeted me at breakfast, the service on offer is worthy of special mention.
This hotel offers onsite parking, which is both desirable for me in Dublin on business and also unusual as most other hotels that offer parking in their lists of facilities, do not actually offer onsite parking. There is a € 15 additional charge for such parking, which is advertised on the hotel website and still represents value it to me.
My room to be fair, was small yet clean and albeit that it did have a few maintenance issues, it was more than sufficient for my one night stay. 
I stayed mid week and the room did have noise migration issues from the corridor, hence you may require to stipulate a quiet room when booking should you be staying on a weekend.
The room was warm, the bed was comfortable, albeit the pillows were like pancakes and the en-suite was clean and well equipped as a wet room, which I believe to be a far superior facility for a hotel room over the ridiculous practice of standing in a bath to shower. One downside of this was that the drainage was slow and therefore the floor remained wet for use after showering which resulted in wet feet and wet footprints in the room.
As stated the room had a few niggling maintenance issues which weren't sufficient to request a room change and which I did report to reception on check out. 
The breakfast was served in a comfortable setting and as stated I was greeted and served by a very friendly, efficient and professional young Spanish lady. The breakfast itself was fresh, clean and crisp, cooked to order and ate every bit as good as it looked.
My stay provided everything I required at reasonable value for money and pleasant service, I would certainly stay again should I require to be in Dublin's City Centre.",4,2021,12,13
229,Afternoon tea,"What a beautiful experience we had today, an absolutey wonderful ambience with super attentive staff and sublime foods perfectly sized. Every mouthful better than the last, sandwiches to suit every taste and an array of cakes and petite fours worthy of any patisserie. Will definitely be going back.",5,2021,11,24
229,One night stay,"Lovely greeting upon arrival. Staff very helpful. Food was excellent and affordable too. Room was clean and spacious. Breakfast was well worth the eat. Secure carparking available for €15 a night - well worth it. 
Most importantly - the bed was very comfortable - a great nights sleep even with a little noise from the main street. 
Overall, a lovely hotel with friendly staff and beautiful décor.

We will be back thats for sure.

The only flaw was that they did not ask for vaccination confirmation but they had plenty of sanitiser stations in the areas.",4,2021,11,19
229,Warm & welcoming hotel in a great location,"We booked relatively last-minute through a third-party website as a previous accommodation booking fell through. I was pleasantly surprised to get a reasonable rate, including breakfast, at such short notice. When we arrived we were pleased to find the hotel so close to our bus stop (take the #16 Dublin Bus if you're travelling from the airport.) We discovered the agent we'd booked through had passed on the wrong rooms details (twin, not double) but hotel staff sorted this out with no hassle or delay. The room we were switched to was a very luxurious-feeling ensuite double with high ceilings and a comfortable four-poster bed. We'd mentioned that we were visiting Dublin for our anniversary after meeting here 15 years ago, and found 'happy anniversary' banners awaiting us which was a very sweet touch.

The room was cosy and comfortable - a little too hot when we arrived but the radiator was adjustable and a fan was provided. The bathroom was clean & a nice size with fresh toiletries & towels each morning. Perhaps a shelf for toiletries would be helpful as ours kept falling into the sink, and the lock was faulty so the bathroom  door didn't shut 100% securely but these were minor issues. 

The included breakfast was plentiful and filling, although a better range of options for vegetarians/vegans wanting a cooked option would have been welcome. 

Staff were all friendly and helpful, including at reception, bar & dining area and housekeeping. The breakfast team in particular did a great job of seating & serving everyone while maintaining social distancing (the covid-19 safety precautions in place kept us feeling safe the whole time, without being intrusive.)

We needed to stow our bags for a short while upon both arrival and departure and this was no problem. The hotel's location (5 minute walk to O'Connell St) meant we could easily pop into town  and back without making a huge detour. 

All in all this was a really welcoming and relaxing stay, and I'd happily stay here again - thanks so much to the hotel team!",5,2021,11,19
229,Thanks,Such lovely staff at this hotel and I slept very well. I would like to say a massive thank you to Gillian for sorting me out with a meeting room. I love the Georgian architecture and I highly recommend this hotel.,5,2021,11,18
229,A perfect place to stay,"A lovely hotel, central to all attractions and close to all public transport. The staff were so helpful and friendly, a lovely group of people. The meals were really good and not overly expensive. I wouldn’t stay anywhere else.",5,2021,11,12
229,Would stay again,We had a large room on the 4th floor. Breakfast was included. Hotel is clean well maintained and excellent location to trains buses and trams. Front desk staff was very helpful. I would like to especially recognize Emmett.,5,2021,10,14
229,A home away from home,"This hotel really is stunning. The staff could not have been more helpful - from providing me with an early check in (and after a 6am flight into Dublin, this was gratefully received) to giving me advice on the local public transport. They were all so friendly and their customer service was top notch.
My trip to Dublin was my first time travelling on my own in another country, yet this hotel and it's staff made me feel so at home, my travel anxieties disappeared as soon as I walked through the door to check in! Just at the top of O'Connell Street, with bus stops nearby and cheap taxis available, the heart of Dublin is easily accessible from here. My room was clean, spacious and very good value for money. The hotel have put screens in place and everyone wears face masks which made me feel much more comfortable from a COVID point of view. Thank you Team Castle!! If I ever find myself back in Dublin, I'll be sure to book with yourselves again!",5,2021,10,12
229,A great place to stay.,"I visited with my brother, we had a big family room. Lovely hotel, very pleasant and accommodating staff and management. Nice bar. A decent breakfast. The Old Music Store Restaurant does a delish crumble. The location is very convenient for the airport bus and for town itself. All in all I would highly recommend.",5,2021,09,13
229,Great value hotel,"I will definitely be staying here again if I ever make it back to Dublin. This hotel is right by city centre and has such a cute old atmosphere. This hotel has a lot of character with a great and welcoming staff. The room that I had, had a great view of the church across the street. The breakfast was delicious with a vegetarian option as well. I highly recommend eating at either of the restaurants downstairs. This is an older hotel so there is no air conditioning and the floors are extra squeaky. Yes, it is an older hotel but I think it gives it a nice history. The windows do open so you can open those if you need to cool off. With the floors being squeaky, if you are a light sleeper I suggest earplugs or a white noise machine to block out people walking down the hall or down the stairs. It was a cute little room and it is PERFECT for the solo traveler.",5,2021,09,06
229,Friendly and familiar,"Very nice experience, although room cleaning service should be automatical as it is what you expect from an hotel (we had to ask for it since due to covid they do not do it unless you ask). We'd rather have a buffet type of breakfast, although the one served was abundant and correct. The personnel was very friendly and correct. ",4,2021,08,29
229,"Been before, back again","We stayed again at the Castle from Tuesday 24th August left this morning. 
Honestly could not meet a nicer staff team, had some stress with current covid flight guidance and the lovely girls on the desk helped us stay calm and supported us to identify what would be needed.
The hotel itself holds the same character it has since we visited years ago.
Covid continues to enforce social distancing measures but staff make you feel at ease.
We were in room 233 which was big enough for me and my friend. The beds were comfortable. The shower was a little small, I banged my arms on the cubicle each time I turned around.
Sleep was problematic but no fault of the hotel, there appears to be a resident seagull nearby. 
Location is great can't go wrong, straight walk down to O'connell Street. 
Breakfast was nice, we had a irish breakfast every day made to order.
Today having to leave early we had toast and drinks provided.
We had a meal at the Castle last night, the steak was absolutely beautiful.
Had yet another fantastic stay would definitely recommend.
Well done! ",5,2021,08,28
229,A tired but absolutely welcoming place to stay,"Slightly out of town but still easy for public transport in and out. The hotel is tired and in need of a general makeover but with Covid it’s expected with a fall in income. Room was very clean as was bedding and bathroom. Window ledge was completely cracked in half and when reported, nothing was done. Had to ask for an iron and ironing board 3 times and then again for the iron a 4th. We had to queue for breakfast which was a little dry and cold on day 1 but day 2 was lovely and again with Covid the distancing was expected as was the wait..  However you cannot take away the attitude of all staff who are friendly and welcoming and all the bits and pieces that make this a 3 star basic are forgiven.  The price reflects the hotel and we did because of walking issues pay out for Uber a number of times but it’s around a 30 min walk to Temple Bar but plenty of buses and a tram locally so not too much of a drama. I would recommend if you have a budge at are happy with public transport",3,2021,08,10
229,Exemplary. Unique.,"This is the kind of hotel the world needs more of- a distinctive, superior and most importantly non-chain hotel. This is an elegant, perfectly located and well-managed hotel whose attentiveness to its guests needs cannot be faulted.  I stayed there in late July 2021 and again in early August. I will certainly return in the future. It's worth spending some time just walking through the  living rooms  and lounges on the ground floor of the hotel just to experience the atmosphere of the place-you will be impressed. On its website, the hotel also offers ome very good special deals which are worth looking into. The only rather minor fault  fault is that breakfast while excellent in all respects is not served as wswiftly as might be hoped.  It does get very crowded especially at the weekend. There are simply not enough staff on duty in the breakfast room at the weekends, But as I said that is a rather insignificant matter. I cannot recomend this hotel enough.",5,2021,08,08
229,Post covid  break,"We had a lovely stay for 3 nights..room was warm and clean ,had everything we needed ..staff were excellent especially as we had to change dates ..food was fabulous .. breakfast was so relaxing  with plenty of choice ..I can honestly say it was the best hotel for tea ..I'm Irish and love hot fresh tea for breakfast and the staff had large pot of tea each morning..it's very central and has all you could need within a short walk ..we would have no problems returning again or recommending to family and friends .. we met the owner as we were leaving a lovely warm friendly gentleman ..can't wait to go back 🤞👍🌟🌟🌟",1,2021,07,30
229,Beautiful Hotel & Fantastic Experience!,"My boyfriend and I visited the Castle Hotel for my birthday trip just a few days ago and we really enjoyed the two nights we stayed here. From the moment we arrived we were stunned at how beautiful the hotel is on the inside and the staff were extremely polite and helpful!. The food we had in the hotel was delicious too, I highly recommend the tapas sharing platter!
Overall this is a stunning hotel with great staff and delicious food and we will definitely be staying here again!

229,The Castle 'Fawlty Towers' Hotel,"This review is more rated on Quality rather than service or staff.  A really disappointing stay in this Four Star Hotel - on arrival we got the key to our 'Superior Room' with Four Poster Bed - it materialised that both of the windows in this room had been glued shut and considering it was one of the hottest days in Dublin with only a very basic small fan - staying in this room was not an option.  At reception we were give 5 keys to explore other rooms and one of the rooms we entered had not even been made up/cleaned.  I do appreciate that this is an old Hotel but there was not adequate ventilation or fans.  We opted for a room with 2 Juliet balcony windows that did open but there was another large window that did not.  Luckily we were able to use the fan from the initial room.  We were disappointed to find no fridge in the room nor complimentary water which we later purchased in the bar at €6 for 2 small bottles of still water.  We had booked dinner in advance however after an hour waiting for our starter to arrive a member of staff came out to apologise that they had forgotten about us.  They only had one bottle of Rose wine - we only took one glass each as it was not to our taste plus when I ordered a Gin they had ran out of Slimline Tonic water.  I believe that Tea/Coffee was included in this Dinner but it was not offered.  After an extremely restless night Breakfast was no better and I do appreciate that they are extremely short staffed.  The breakfast room had inoperable windows and there was no ventilation therefore extremely hot.  No buffet was available so it was menu order only.  I had ordered some fruit (which again they forgot about); when I asked it arrived after the cooked breakfast and it certainly did not appear to be fresh fruit and presentation was awful and the yogurt with fruit coulis was minus the coulis.  This one night break away had been much needed after illness and a recent bereavement however was very expensive @ €166 for Bed, Breakfast and set Dinner we paid an extra €56 for wine and a drink in the Hotel.  The few members of staff however that we did encounter were doing their best to cope and were very pleasant.  If I didn't know this Hotel was rated 4* I would have guessed at a 2*.  We shall not be returning.",2,2021,07,19
229,Brilliant!,"Well maintained and comfortable hotel with obliging staff.  They are gold dust. While North Dublin may be patchy in areas in genteelaty,  the hotel is ace, well priced and clean and comfortable. The bed sheets are a treat. Love the food even if the portions are bigger than my restricting tummy, but love the place a lot. In terms of comfort and hospitality 100%!",5,2021,07,17
229,Ideal location ,Stayed here for 1 night and from start to finish staff could not have done more for us. From checking in at reception to having dinner(delightful) to full Irish and pancakes for breakfast. Staff throughout were professional and polite. Definitely worth a stay again on the onsite parking a bonus. ,4,2021,07,12
229,Took a friend here for a birthday lunch,"Went to the Castle Hotel for lunch today. 

We sat outside in the rear of the hotel in a lovely area, filled with plants and shrubs - a rustic Italian ambience.

The sun was shining and the whole experience was incredibly relaxing and enjoyable.

The food was top class - soup, toasted sandwiches, hot chips, battered fish etc. ... 

Every member of staff was friendly, helpful and polite.

- Will definitely be returning.",5,2021,06,30
229,A jem,Been here a couple of times before ... had lunch on the terrace this time ..... it was really nice and relaxed ... we had lovely food and drink .... and coffees ... the staff are always very pleasant  and service was excellent . Will definitely go back again soon and bring our friends 😁😁😁,5,2021,06,20
229,Customer Service Next to non,"Unfortunately we didin't get to go on our trip but i wanted to leave a review to praise the cusotmer service i received. I book for my partners 40th and got in touch with the hotel who kindly offered to organise decoration of the room and a booking at one of their restaurants, they were so polite and helpful and reponded so quickly. We will 100% be booking back here when we can.",5,2021,05,25
229,Brilliant hotel and staff.,"Stayed here as we had early morning appointments in the Mater hospital and as the hotel is only a 5 minute walk it made sense to stay here. 

Cannot pay high enough praise to everyone working there. Laura who checked us in was so very helpful and explained all the covid safe procedures that the hotel have in place(was also incredibly helpful in another issue post checkout). 

The rooms themselves are beautiful, very large and very modernised bathrooms considering the beautiful old style Georgian decor of the building. 

The cafe was open and the food was delicious, both lunch and dinner and very reasonably priced. Trevor, the lad working there, was such a good laugh. We could of spent the whole day just chatting with him and having the craic, really helped to put us at ease as we were quite nervous.....an empty hotel can be quite unnerving!!

All in all we loved it so much that on the way back home we booked 2 nights for early June when they re-open. We could of booked anywhere but it really is down to the great staff, service, food and location that we decided we have to revisit.",5,2021,05,05
229,The Castle Hotel Review,"We booked this holiday as a lockdown break with our children: Layla (4), Zac (7) and Felicia (11). 

Our family arrived and found free parking immediately, thanks to marked spaces. We checked in and found our room. The beds were appropriately positioned and very comfy

Thanks",5,2021,03,23
229,Lovely afternoon tea experience,Went there for festive afternoon tea before Christmas. Lovely cosy and festive setting. Friendly staff and delicious food. An escape from the world for a couple of hours in an historic Dublin hotel. I would recommend a visit here,5,2021,01,23
229,"Awful loud room, Poor attitudes, Rude, lies","The location is brilliant but that is all this Hotel has going for it. 

First of all, I stayed at this Hotel during the latest COVID restrictions so can appreciate it is a difficult time for a lot of people within Hospitality but the experience I had was genuinely horrible and has nothing to do with COVID. 

First of all, there was a loud noise (similar to a washing machine constantly going) above the room I was staying in which made it extremely difficult to sleep, every night I was there. Only on the last night when I asked the reception staff to come over and listen to the noise for themselves did they allow me to move to another room just to sleep.

My breakfast order was wrong on every day and late twice and over an hour and a half one day. 

The worst part of the whole experience is when I tried to highlight my concerns and experience with the Manager Yvonne. 
I reported all my issues to a lovely lady (the only member of staff who seemed to care and genuinely listen) on reception when I was checking out who advised that Yvonne would be in contact. 

This did not happen and despite being promised on 3 occasions that Yvonne would be in touch since I have checked out I've not heard anything. It feels like now that they have taken my money they do not care. I have since tried to contact Yvonne via calls and over email but she has refused to come back to me.

If I was you I would save your money and go Somewhere else.",1,2021,01,21
229,The Elf ...,"Been here a few times ... 1st time stay over .,. Room was comfortable and spotless ... food was lovely ... had lunch and Christmas dinner ... our waiter Trevor .

229,Loved every part of my stay,"I came for two nights with my boyfriend on a voucher in October. Our voucher was for a dinner and 2 night stay. The staff were so accommodating, i think there was only 1/ 2 other guests as it was during lockdown. Let me say the food was great! We got our  complimentary meal (3 course) in the restaurant. I appreciated that they let us eat there since it takes more effort, rather than just placing us in the breakfast area or something. The waiter was so nice and patient. Food = amaizing! I loved my soup to start and bf loved his seafood chowder. He had a lovely steak as main course while i had the salmon- both cooked to perfection with lovely flavours. I had a gorgeous chocolate brownie dessert and he had a fruity one. The bedroom was so clean and really luxury decor. The lady on the desk gave us a room with a bath as i requested and they offered if we wanted a view of the street or the courtyard. We opted for the street view- i love hearing the buzz of the city outside. There is free parking in the hotel and it is secure within the gates. Amazing location just 2 mins walk from oconnell street. We will defo be back! 5 stars from me !!!!",5,2020,12,09

229,Would definitely come back!,"Very nice staff and service, would definitely come here again. Highly recommend! Specially when Becca, Paul, Millie, Charis and Faye are here. Family oriented place, fast service...didn’t fault to disappoint!",5,2020,09,14
229,Friendly and safe welcome,"We stayed overnight as a family of five.  This was one of the few hotels in Dublin we could get a room for five at a reasonable price. Our room was very spacious, clean and so quiet at night. 

Upon arrival we felt very at ease and could see the hotel had put a lot of work into ensuring their guests are safe. It was not crowded in any way and had a well marked one way system.  

The hotel is in a brilliant location for anyone wanting to explore the city centre and has the added bonus of parking spaces available. 

Breakfast was provided and we were provided with an allocated time slot of our choosing. Upon arrival at breakfast all the tables were very well spaced out and only a few other families were present at any time. The food was excellent and certainly had more than we expected. The staff were extremely attentive and pleasant.  the hotel owner took the time to go around the guests ensuring everyone had a pleasant stay.  We had a great wee chat and my daughters especially enjoyed exchanging cupla focal with him. 

As a family and even when I will be travelling for business in Dublin again this will be first hotel I will check for availability.",5,2020,08,28
229,Perfect afternoon tea,"This was the nicest afternoon tea we have ever had. The food was delicious, service second to none, the hotel is a lovely old world gem. I would like to thank Trevor especially for his top class customer service. Other restaurants should take a leaf out of Castle Hotels book on quality and service.
Highly recommend and will definitely return.",5,2020,08,19
229,My favourite Dublin accomodation,"Today we've just returned from Dublin. Family trip, 2 rooms booked. A nice surprise in the heart of Dublin, walking distance to the Spire and Grafton Street. Very friendly staff, cozy rooms, quiet and very very clean. Good food, had the pleasure of talking to the owner, a lovely gentleman, who said that they don't believe in storing frozen foods and that's one of the keys of being able to offer such a good quality meals. Parking is private and accessible only for the guests of the hotel, costs 15 euros daily. I highly recommend to arrange in advance with the hotel to reserve you a spot as parking on the neighbouring streets is more expensive and not safe.
The restaurant was great, seafood chowder is amazing. I have to mention Stefan here who is a great asset to the hotel, friendly and accommodating our special requests with the highest level of professionalism.
For sure we'll return here.",5,2020,08,14
229,Lovely charming hotel,"Booked this hotel for a last minute family trip away.staff were lovely over the phone when I was booking.the hotel itself was spotless.we had a family room that was also spotless, had everything we needed and the beds were comfy.
We had dinner in the hotel .food was delicious a tad pricey but that's to be expected for dublin.we sat in the patio area afterwards which is beautiful.breakfast was lovely no request was to much kept asking did we want more!staff were friendly and always happy to help.
I would book this hotel again.the price for a family of 4 with breakfast Inc was prlerfect for us.if your budget is limited this hotel is value for money but that doesn't mean it's a budget hotel far from it.",4,2020,08,06
229,Memorable way to begin tour of Ireland,"Initially, our room for 2 nights was pre-booked by our travel agent, so with this in mind,
we hadn't researched nor had any expectations towards this accommodation. We had arrived early in Dublin, and the staff at the Castle were extremely helpful securing our luggage, and letting us into our room a few hours prior to check-in. The
Castle, from what we were told, is the oldest hotel in Dublin, and has a history to back
up such a claim. It is by far one of the most unique stays I've had anywhere, and I've
travelled a great deal. It has an aged charm, a sense of cozy grandeur if you will, and
to me at least, a character worth flying over the Atlantic for. Portraits adorning the walls in the sitting rooms, with large windows looking out into the busy streets, it has a
rich personality that compels one to explore further each time. The staff were on hand, and available to assist, and enlightened us regarding the Castles history in the
form of a printout which visitors may keep. The room we made home for a couple nights was small, everything functioned as it should, and like many properties marking
a lengthy existence, it wasn't soundproof. I say that simply to be truthful, as it had no
bearing upon the visit itself. Situated below the main level is the restaurant/pub area
which served standard fare, and where performers ply their trade each night. There
is a breakfast/brunch area on the main level as well where a buffet style of service is
offered, and I highly recommend it as a great way to start a long days hiking about in
Dublin. If you are seeking an experience of a historical nature in Dublin, with kind staff, and comfortable rooms, and a wide array of food options, the Castle Hotel will
be able to satisfy that objective. There's no doubt that I will revisit this wonderful, and
and incredibly unique location at some point in the future. Cheers to all of the fine
individuals that made this stay so very special!",4,2020,08,03
229,Eddies afternoon tea,"We had afternoon tea 1/8/2020 .. it was really nice . Plenty to eat and plenty of tea and bubbles ... staff were very friendly ... spotless clean ... lovely garden area ... a hidden jem .., will definitely  go back and recommend  to my friends .... ",5,2020,08,02

229,Brilliant nights stay,"First family trip out since lockdown eased and chose the Castle for a night in Dublin. Very friendly welcome, sanitizer everywhere and immaculate rooms. Dinner was amazing and breakfast also. Really well done to the hotel for making our stay as normal as can be possible in these times. Really lovely staff throughout our stay, couldn’t have been more helpful.",5,2020,07,16
229,Lovely Stay,"I live just outside of city centre, but my wife was at the Rotunda Hospital for a few days.  I wanted to stay close, so this hotel was a great option.  We weren’t sure when she and the new addition to our family would be able to leave, so I did need to extend my stay a couple times.  The staff were extremely polite, professional and accommodating throughout.  The room also had a kitchenette and plenty of space, so my uncertain time away from home and family was a bit more practical and comfortable than I expected.",5,2020,05,09
229,Perfect stay,"We had limited time in the city so the location was great for walking around. But the surprise was the charm of this gorgeous old hotel and we were lucky to meet the owner as well. Clean rooms, hearty Irish breakfast and stunning interior. Enjoyed it so much would recommend to any family. This is a place with character and actually the oldest hotel in Dublin. Thank you.

229,"Amazing hotel, cannot wait to return","Had a lovely 3 night stay here for my sisters 40th birthday.
The hotel is absolutely huge, it is made up of 9 Georgian buildings.
The bed was so comfortable and the room was very big. It was all very clean throughout.
The breakfast was included in the stay and was delicious.
Dublin is such an amazing and beautiful place with lots to see and do, unfortunately for us the Coronavirus stopped us doing things we wanted to as it was all closed but we did the hop on hop off tour twice and saw everything.

We will definitely be returning to Dublin and we will be staying here again, all of the staff were so friendly and helpful.

Thank you for a wonderful stay, see you again.",5,2020,03,17
229,Flawless Stay,"This was my second time staying at the Castle Hotel and I had a perfect stay.  I’d booked a single room, which was spacious for being a single and looked as if it had been recently renovated.  Everything was immaculately clean in the room and it was convenient to have breakfast included just downstairs.  The best part for me is that the hotel is made up of several old Georgian houses, which gives it its historic and quirky vibe.  The pricing is also incredibly reasonable for being in city centre Dublin.  I will definitely be returning.",5,2020,03,12
229,Quirky Hotel - Excellent Accomodation,"The location the hotel itself and best of all the staff were excellent.

Very near to many attractions and buses and taxis close by.

Live music in The Vaults every evening and great food, drinks and bar staff.

Laura on reception was great, friendly, helpful and full of knowledge.",5,2020,03,12
229,"Quirky hotel, but a wonder stay","The hotel is a jumble of georgian homes that have been converted.  The place is a maze of stairways, ramps, and hallways.  However, the staff was amazing and friendly.  The included breakfast had something for everyone - coffee, tea, eggs, toast, beans, tomatoes, fresh fruit, pastries, yogurt, sausage, bacon and more.  I ate in two of the restaurants and the food was always good.  A short walk to shopping and sites, but not right in the middle of all the activity.  Close to Airlink stops to and from the airport.  I was traveling by myself for the first time and felt safe and looked after by the wonderful staff at the front desk and the restaurants.  Would stay there again on my next trip.  It was also a great value!",5,2020,03,04
229,"Great Staff, lovely Hotel","Large Georgian Hotel very well placed and easy to find in Dublin. Stayed 3 nights midweek and everything was as hoped, decent sized room and en suite. The Hotel takes up several buildings and lots of different levels all decorated in Georgian style. The breakfast was very good with lot's of options. Evening meal and folk singer first evening were a great welcome to Dublin! The Hotel website is a good place to plan your trip, eg we used bus 747 from and to the airport, very easy!
At all points the staff were a pleasure to deal with, including putting our luggage in a room for our last day as we had a late flight home.",5,2020,03,03
229,Superb hotel,"Recently stayed at the castle hotel for my sisters 40th birthday. The hotel is in a perfect location right in the heart of Dublin City center. The hotel staff were excellent always happy to help and nothing was too much to ask. All very friendly. The hotel owner is lovley and very funny!! The food was excellent, there was a good variety to choose from for the breakfast and the restaurant in the vault the food was delicious. Excellent hotel and will definitely stay there again! Highly recommend.",5,2020,03,03

229,Bad service for surprise birthday gift,"After emails to vendor explaining this was a birthday surprise,. We arrived to be seated outside the nice dining room advertised and in a basic restaurant. We were left waiting to be served.  Had to go get the prosecco myself by collecting it from the barman.Had requested vegetarian options by email day before arriving, but this was given as excuse for half hour wait for any service.  Emailed next day and complained, but no reply surprise surprise.  Book afternoon tea somewhere they really don't care once you've paid for the voucher.",2,2020,02,12
229,Georgian charm,"If you are looking for old world Georgian architectural charm this is the place to come. Hotel is made up of 9 Georgian buildings. The size of our room was adequate and clean. You are sure to meet the proprietor who likes to mingle with the guests. They have live Irish music every night in the Castle Vaults restaurant. Meals and buffet were good but the evening menu could be a little more extensive. Lots of small sitting rooms to hide ones self away in to relax. Could hear some outside noise from people and trams. Doesn't appear to be very wheel chair friendly, too many steps. ",5,2020,02,11
229,"Lovely hotel, friendly staff","Stayed here for 3 nights and what a lovely hotel it is. Oozing with character. Staff are very friendly and rooms are spacious and comfortable.
Customer service was amazing. Arriving back to the hotel on second night, we wanted a shower, only to find we had no hot water. After a quick phone call to reception, a staff member came up within 5 minutes to see what she could do. As the problem couldn't be fixed, they happily moved us to another, bigger room 2 doors down. 
This was all sorted quickly and easily and did us nicely for the rest of our stay. 
Breakfast was amazing, with plenty of choice.
Hotel has a great location, within walking distance to all attractions. Or if using public transport, has great transport links.
Overall a fantastic stay.",4,2020,02,04
229,Working visit to the Dublin World Travel fair,"Came over from Spain for 4 days to participate in the Travel Fair at the RDS. Stayed at the Castle Hotel, couldn't have been happier. From the minute we walked in to the minute we left. The staff in all departments were friendly, helful and just so nice and polite, the rooms very clean.The breakfast was to die for, the staff very efficient and pleasant. Ate twice in the Vault and both times the food was cooked to perfection, the cod ws amazing and as for the rib eye steak well the best I've ever had also worth trying was the brownie, I would go back just for that. Hopefully we will be returning again next year and I have told my company to not bother looking for another hotel as the Castle hotel is the one for us. Thank you for making us so welcome..   ",5,2020,01,30
229,Boyfriends birthday weekend,"I contacted the hotel before arrival and arranged for prosecco and birthday paraphernalia to be in the room for when we arrived which they did, plus a birthday card. Very nice hotel, lots of furniture scattered throughout which adds character, very helpful and friendly staff. It was a good size room with a comfortable big bed and decent shower but I think at certain times there's a struggle for hot water and pressure, we were on the top floor. Breakfast was included and very good service, especially considering how busy it is, the staff are very efficient and good quality breakfast. Very good location, 8 minute walk to centre. Would stay again",5,2020,01,29
229,"Short, city break.","Decided that we needed to revisit Dublin after our last attempt was a disaster. 
Remember the ""Beast from the East"" Feb '18.
This time we went for a fairly central city hotel.
And glad that we did.
The staff were very friendly and very helpful. 
The food was very good, in the Vaults restaurant. 
The no16 bus from Dublin airport to Parnell Square is only €2.50 so what a bargain. 
The DoDublin hop on hop off bus is just across the road and is great for city tours.
All in all, I think we chose the perfect spot.",4,2020,01,26
229,Wonderful Accommodations,"A very nice Georgian hotel in Dublin. I sincerely enjoyed my stay. Initially I was only going to stay for two nights but found the staff and facility to be so accommodating in both location and amenities I ended up staying all 7 nights here. The breakfasts in the morning are wonderful, the restaurant and bar are lovely with live music every night. There was a different performer every night and a demonstration of traditional dancing on Friday and Saturday night. I would definitely stay here again",5,2020,01,25
229,"Location 10, service 2.","The hotel itself looks good, like a castle. I was really satisfied with it’s location, the main street is literally a few minutes walk, airport transfer or hop on hop off pick up points are within minutes.

The variety of the breakfast was above average, huge selection every day. Now the room... 1: it was cold! And when I say cold, I mean it. This hotel doesn’t have air conditioning system, the heating works centrally and it has a TIMER!!! - in the winter is not too useful (although I agree at some point, maybe the want to save some energy perhaps...). When I went to the front office first day they looked at me like I’m a fool, as I couldn’t check the radiator...  joke...
2: the room was small but that’s okay as I was alone, but the bathroom was really tiny. It was renovated apparently but there was no heating at all in the bathroom.
3: they gave me a brochure which mentions daily housekeeping... no one emptied the bin or changed towels or tided the room at all... when I went to the front desk they said it’s unusual but bad luck, housekeeping went home.",2,2020,01,23
229,Great location,"Great location and very close to everything.  Staff very friendly. Car park small but car was secure for the night. Great food in the bar and excellent guy singing there. He was funny and entertaining and great to listen too. Lovely youch to have entertainment on a Monday night. 
Our room was a little ran down. Paint off the wall in 1 spot. Good tea/coffee facilitates and a good big bathroom.  
Our only real complaint was that the hot breakfast  was only luke warm. It ruined the breakfast for us. There was a good selection of food but the hot buffet was disappointing due to being cold. 
Would recommend for location and staff alone.  Adequate for a quick visit. ",3,2020,01,21
229,Great hotel,"Stayed right after Christmas. Had an early check in because rooms were available. Staff super friendly, great location and perfect breakfast! Just my room location was in a bad area, window faces the loading bay. But i certainly would stay there again!",4,2020,01,19
229,Very welcome staff,"I staied here with my cousin for 3 nights and we enjoyed the stay. The location is very good cause it is not at a noisy area and it is 8 min walk to the temple bar street. The employees of the hotel are really nice ,friendly and always available to help. Our room was good, it has space for our stuff, it had a closet, two sofas, good lightning, the beds were really comfy, and we were warm all the time. The bathroom was big and modern with some amenities products always available. Beware that they have the electric connection as UK and we didn’t remembered that. Fortunately, the ones next to the bed has usb connection so you can charge your electronic devices in cause you forget 🙂 The breakfast was really good, but since it is a 4⭐️ hotel I think it could have some natural juices or more variety of juices and pancakes. Besides that, very good food, really tasty and very well done. The room of the breakfast is very good and pretty. I would recommend this hotel.",3,2020,01,15
229,A great stay at a great Hotel for both of us.,"Myself and son Daniel stayed in this excellent Hotel for three nights while doing some research into family ancestry. Couldn’t have wished for a better experience. The rooms were lovely, both clean, comfortable and quiet, overlooking the central courtyard. Meals were excellent, breakfast and dinner. All of the staff were a credit to the Hotel, very pleasant and helpful. We had the pleasure  of meeting the very friendly owner Fionn, who  was most  informative about the area and it’s history. On his recommendation, we walked to  the Botanical Gardens which were well worth the visit. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Castle Hotel.",5,2020,01,12
229,"Wonderful staff and owner, charming hotel and and a great location.","It's been too long since my last visit, but there's no where else I would want to stay in Dublin. The place oozes character and charm, a tranquil hideaway which  is just a stone's throw from O'Connell Street. 

Without exception all the staff we met were pleasant and professional and no doubt a credit to Fionn the amiable owner, who embodies the hotel's welcoming approach.

Many thanks and I hope to see you all again!",5,2020,01,11
229,"Lovely hotel, amazingly friendly and helpful staff, great location","Just returned from 2 nights at the Castle and was extremely impressed. The hotel is lovely - Georgian building, high ceilings, velvet sofas etc; comfy modern and very clean bedroom; modern breakfast room and tasty breakfast with lots of choice. But the most amazing thing is the staff - they couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. We were allowed into our room in the morning as we arrived early; the reception staff helped with information and printed our boarding passes for us, and all the staff were extremely cheerful and friendly. Price was very reasonable too.  Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2020,01,11
229,Just friendly and helpful staff. Good location. Very pleasant stay,"This hotel is ideal for a Dublin stay. Close to airport bus and Hop and Hop off bus. Room lovely, comfortable and very clean. Breakfast good choice and good quality.  Staff helpfully printed our boarding  passes and stored our luggage. All staff we spoke with were very friendly, helpful and clearly enjoyed working at this hotel.  Would definitely stay here again when we come back. Thanks",5,2020,01,11
229,Amazing place,"I am staying at the hotel and I have enjoyed the services offered. The reception staffs and waiters are very attentive, in addition the breakfast and bar serves delicious meals. Beside it, the room service and the gym are great! This hotel is very cozy and quiet place. I highly recommend. Michel Fernandes (Brazil)",5,2020,01,08
229,"Good location, good value","There's nothing fancy about the Castle Hotel and I mean that in a good way. Friendly staff, well-kept, walking distance to a lot of Dublin. It does the job; just know that you will not be overwhelmed with opulence.

I booked the Castle Hotel through Expedia as part of an air/hotel package. The price was great, the room was not big but it had everything I needed, and there is complimentary breakfast (very good) each morning.

Come for the price and location. Don't expect a magnificent hotel experience. Definitely recommended.",3,2020,01,03
229,Afternoon tea,"Afternoon tea was amazing, the food was delicious and presentation was beautiful. Staff were very helpful and nice. We arrived 45 minutes early and were seated straight away with no issue. Will definitely be returning.",5,2020,01,03
229,the Castle Hotel is a Gem,"The Castle Hotel is a gem in a great location. I stayed at the Castle Hotel as a layover for two nights and wished my layover had been longer. The staff, from the front desk to the restaurant and the Castle Vault, were all welcoming, friendly and helpful.   

The hotel, which the staff told me is the oldest hotel in Dublin, is lovely with old world charm. There are a number of different themed sitting rooms to relax and enjoy the moment.  My room was small (I had chosen a single) but it was perfect for me.  It was clean and comfortable with strong WiFi and nice amenities.

Breakfast in the restaurant included a nice mixture of hot and cold items. I also had a very nice dinner at the Castle Vault while listening to music. I loved it and plan to return.

229,Birthday stay ,"We spent 2 nights here for my Birthday. So the good points , it is a little further out of the main town so good if you want a good nights sleep . Yes there is noise from the trams and cars but nothing I’d call excessive and stopped me sleeping . The bed room is a good size and have comfy beds , check in was quick and easy and was good that you could choose to pay in pounds or euros , yes the hotel does creak and groan did it affect us in any way . Now the bad points , Breakfast really average and the room fills up and gets busy and you do struggle to get a table for 4 people , there was 2 of us so we got a table straight away , our room was stupidly hot and that was with no radiator switched on which stifled the room which is very odd in December . The room is also very dated , cracks in the bathroom floor tiles , cap missing on the shower so didn’t have my instructions for temperature settings mould in the shower cubical . Bathroom door doesn’t fit people either . The Tv has very few channels . The hair dryer has 1 button you have to hold in constantly which becomes tiresome if you have long hair like me and its plugged into the back of the tv . You have to plug the kettle in next to the bed as well . Curtain hooks missing ,mis matched furniture so the room doesn’t particularly match up . The common areas are so beautiful done that I feel the rooms are a bit of a let down £225 for 2 people for 2 nights with breakfast does seem a bit over priced for the state off the room ",3,2019,12,29
229,"Perfect, quiet location",I stayed at The Castle Hotel for 5 nights with two friends. We had a large triple room on the third floor. The room was clean and quiet. The breakfast was filling and a good variety available. The hotel bar offered traditional Irish music nightly. The restaurant had really good food. The hotel is located blocks away from the bustle of O’Connell Street. I would definitely stay here again.,5,2019,12,25
229,Stunning cosy hotel with amazing staff,I had the pleasure of staying in the Castle Hotel last night for the 1st time. The hotel is in an excellent location in the city centre. It is spotlessly clean and so cosy. My room faced the courtyard so it was so quite at night. Really comfy bed and spacious room. The staff were so welcoming and friendly. Highly recommend- look forward to coming back.  ,5,2019,12,20
229,Lovely stay,We stayed at the Castle Hotel for 3 nights when we arrived in Dublin. The staff on the front desk were always friendly and helpful. Our room was cleaned well and we enjoyed the chocolates left for us each night. Breakfast in the morning was beautiful and the staff were just lovely. We ate in both of the two restaurants at night which were also great. We will definitely be back!,5,2019,12,14
229,Great Hotel and Great Owner and Staff,"The Stay that me and my Best mate had at this Hotel was one of the best I’ve had. Fionn the owner was such a lovely character. Talking about Farming and other topics and was such a down to Earth, kind hearted Bloke. The food in the Vaults bar is gorgeous. The breakfast was just what you would want to start your day. The Jameson whiskey tour as hinted by Fionn was one of my favourite parts of the Trip. Our Room was Spacious and had everything you could want. Even if you wanted more the Reception were always there to help and give you suggestions on where is good locally. 
I would come back to this hotel in a heartbeat. You are always going to see bad reviews of places but this place doesn’t deserve any. The Steak is amazing and is sourced locally! So nothing is hidden. If you want to Visit Dublin this hotel is within walking distance of everything but it also feels out of the hustle and bustle. 

You can also hold your bags if you turn up early or are catching a late flight and want to look around the place.

Many thanks to Fionn and his amazing Staff",5,2019,12,13
229,Lovely afternoon tea in the Castle Hotel.,"This was my second time having afternoon tea in the Castle Hotel. The reason I returned was because the first trip was lovely, and this time it was even better. The staff were attentive but not overly so, there was a great selection of teas on offer, plenty of delicious cakes and sandwiches, the teapot was refilled several times without hesitation, and my friend's gluten-free afternoon tea was provided without quibble - and all this for an extremely reasonable price. The decor is a delight, the atmosphere is a little bit magical, and overall I would highly recommend the Castle Hotel for afternoon tea.",5,2019,12,11
229,A real gem!,"We were there from Monday to Friday so can't vouch for what it's like at weekends, but we loved everything about our stay and really hope to return.  The staff are brilliant, the location is ideal, the rooms are very nice and the arrangements for meals excellent.",5,2019,12,10
229,Good location,"The hotel was in a good location for us, only about 10mins walk for where we wanted to be. The staff are happy and helpful. Breakfast was good. We didn’t eat in the restaurant at night but food looked good. 
The bar was lovely to sit and have a drink and listen to the live music. 

We did have one complaint, you can hear everything!   Just a noisy hotel...my boyfriend was woken up early to doors banging. The Monday morning my mum and dad were woken up to drilling and banging.",4,2019,12,10
229,"Charming and cozy, wonderful staff and excellent location - the Castle Hotel just has it all!","The hotel is absolutely lovely. I spent 6 nights there...the locations is wonderful. It's close to the very city centre, just a few steps from O'Connell street and the GPO, the Irish Writers Museum, the Dublin City Gallery and the house on 14 Henrietta Street. The staff is lovely and was always super helpful with everything we needed. The room was well decorated (retro style!) and definitely big enough, the bed very comfortable and overall, the atmosphere was very cozy! Overall, the time spent there was great and I will definitely go there again on my next visit to Dublin. As well, both restaurants were great, good food (lovely breakfast!) and the Vault restaurant has live music every night - which was great, so much fun!! Huge shout out to the singers - Roy Cox, Paddy Brown, Dave and Mike....I loved listening to every single of you!! And a big shout out to everyone else - all the waiters, all the receptionists, absolutely everybody involved. The hotel is gorgeous and full of charm but it's the staff that makes up most of the hotel's experience and it was great! Thank you all, can't wait to see you all again! :)
P.S. in terms of value for money - it’s definitely and absolutely worth it 😊

229,2 night stay for a graduation,"I loved staying at The Castle Hotel; everything from the food, staff, rooom and location make for the perfect package. The owner appears to pay huge attention to ensuring everyone is satisfied and its a real family run business which is lovely to experience in a 4* Hotel. I was actually disappointed to be leaving after the two nights. I was joined by family and friends and we had great fun. Parking was secure and just a fifteen minute walk to Grafton Street. I'm heading back for the christmas and can't wait...thanks to the staff and management for everything. Top Class Hotel",5,2019,11,25
229,Great Hotel in Dublin ,"Perfect Location for a trip to Dublin. Just a walk of 15-20 minutes away from the popular Temple Bar District. Staff was very friendly and helpful during our stay over a long weekend. Our two rooms were renovated and clean. Bed was very comfortable. Breakfast was very good. Everything you can imagine for a full irish breakfast. We would choose the Castle Hotel again, when coming back for a Guiness and a glas of Jameson. ",5,2019,11,24
229,Very clean friendly family run business that I would go back to.,"A very nice friendly family run  hotel. We arrived to the warm welcome of the reception staff who were very friendly and helpful. The same goes for the entire staff all happy and helpful. The 2 course meal was superb, the rib eye steak was cooked to perfection. Our room was warm and clean and had a nice modern en suite.. I recommend the breakfast which had a good variety. We found this a ideal place to stay with bus stops just around the corner that went into the centre and back to the airport. We walked sometimes into the centre which was only a 20 minute walk. Ideal hotel and convenient for getting anywhere. ",5,2019,11,21
229,very spacious room very clean well serviced every day,this was my first visit to dublin and on my arrival i was made to feel very welcome to the castle hotel and dublin every thing was explained to me on arrival the reception staff were very welcomimg and nothing was 2 much trouble i had trouble printing off my boarding passes for my return journey and the gentleman was very helfull in helping me in fact he did all the work in printing my boarding passes for me nothing was to much trouble or effort all the team were exellent and i will certainly return to this hotel again very central to everything 15 to 20 min walk takes you to centre for shops bars and restaurants ,5,2019,11,20
229,Castle Hotel Dublin,"What a great hotel, friendly staff who went out of their way to help. Bar and restaurant staff efficient. Food excellent with good potions. Rooms clean and very comfortable. Reasonably priced hotel, near to central Dublin.",5,2019,11,14
229,Great Location,"The location of this hotel was great! We were able to walk around downtown Dublin and get to every tour without having to taxi or drive ourselves. The room we had was very basic, nothing to brag about. It was clean though. We had to walk through a few doors and hallways to get to our room which we laughed about because we felt like we were in a maze. Still laughing haha! 
Staff was kind and helpful with all of our questions. They had an elevator which was nice for our friends who overpacked for this trip lol They weren’t so lucky at our hotel in Scotland.  The restaurant staff was kind and offered coffee, tea and toast before they were actually open on our early mornings when we had to leave for the day.
The parking for the hotel is not the best. They have 2 parking areas in the back, both of which don’t have many spots. We were lucky enough to always snag the last one though! I believe the street parking across the street is free between 7am and 7pm. If you’re lucky enough to snag a spot in the back, a compact car is best lol very tight spots. ",3,2019,11,11
229,Perfect Location,"This hotel is the perfect place to stay! The staff are fantastic, food is great, and the location is perfect as well. It’s not right in all the action, so you get peaceful sleep, but it’s close enough to everything to walk. Highly recommend this hotel!",5,2019,11,09
229,A nice place to stay,The Castle Hotel is charming with lots of sloping floors. Great breakfast included in the price. Nice and central for easy walking and only about 200 metres or so from the express bus stop to the airport. Friendly staff. No safe in the room.,4,2019,11,08
229,Beautiful hotel with caring staff,"We spent a night here after a problem with our initial
Hotel.  I cannot state enough how accommodating the staff where in finding us a quiet room in which to get some much needed sleep. The whole hotel, from rooms to reception to restaurant is exactly what is needed at the end of a long day.  I would stay here again in an instant.  Quiet, clean, comfortable and an easy walk into Dublin.  Food is good and atmosphere wonderful. Thank you to the reception staff for all their help",5,2019,11,06
229,"So-So Hotel in An Expensive, Drab City","Ok hotel with very friendly staff. Lobby and first floor quite nice. Within easy walking distance from the river and maybe 15 minutes walk to the (overcrowded) Temple Bar area. 

We stayed for a week after getting a good deal on orbitz including free breakfast. But the breakfast was not so good - each day the poached eggs were over-cooked and hard, sausage either burnt and (apparently) from yesterday or almost raw and not very tasty. After a few days we decided to go elsewhere and pay for breakfast. 

Basement restaurant not nearly as nice-looking as some of the advertisement photos and the beer was over-priced - 6.8 Euros for a pint when most pubs even in the downtown were about 5.5 - 6.5. 

Our room on the 2nd floor (3rd floor to Americans) was ok but the bed was hard and each morning my back was sore - as were my ears from the uncomfortable pillows. Door had chipped and peeling paint around it. WC had an odd smell, & the shower was minuscule. Walls paper thin and floors mostly creaky - in other words whenever someone walked down the hall it was LOUD. The bland framed pictures on the walls were screwed in and each one was at an angle - not one was level. The tall, slim mirror by the window tilted most obviously. 

  Staff told us not to go looking for a pub north of the hotel - gave us the clear impression the areas north of the hotel were not so safe and that the pubs would not be welcoming or friendly towards us.  

Overall it was - at best - an average hotel in an expensive and not very pretty city. But, the staff really was very nice and the first floor really was pretty and had old-world charm. Maybe the more expensive (or newer) rooms are much better, but our room left alot to be desired. 

Oh, the hotel envelopes a coffee shop on the corner - exactly catty-corner from the Garden of Remembrance. Now THAT place was very nice and friendly and we had a very good coffee and slices of cake in there.",3,2019,11,05
229,A Great Place to Stay,"I am so glad that I chose to stay here. The Castle is the oldest hotel in Dublin, a series of Georgian buildings that have an old world charm. The hotel has been modernized but without destroying its Georgian character. There are rooms everywhere, many of them for sitting and relaxing in an atmosphere akin to a 19th century drawing room. For those that want modern 21st century appeal it might not be for you but if you care about style and atmosphere you will like it.  

I stayed for a total of seven days my first two in Ireland and then five more after traveling. The hotel is clean and rooms small by US standards but roomy enough and en suite. A great breakfast is served between 7am and 10 and there is a bar downstairs in the old wine vaults where you can get a good meal and that has traditional Irish music every night at nine. The hotel is a block or so from other venues and a 10 minute walk from Temple Bar. The main post office is also a few blocks away. Another great plus is that the airport bus stops about half a block from the hotel and runs throughout the night. I cannot say enough about the staff. They were so helpful. From the front desk to the restaurant personnel who served us breakfast every day (and what a breakfast) to the staff in the bar and restaurant at night the service was exemplary. It sounds sounds corny but I felt at home here. 

If you want some history and a feeling that you're in a 19th century home, this is the place for you.",5,2019,11,04
229,A weekend stay in Dublin,Stayed 2 night's very comfortable bed staff excellent very polite and helpful. Enjoyed the e entertainment both evenings . A good choice at breakfast . Everything within walking distance would happily recommend this hotel,5,2019,11,03
229,Fantastic stay,"Stayed for 4 nights at this welcoming and friendly hotel, staff were always attentive and knowledgeable. Room was spotless and had everything we needed. The vault bar was great with music each night and the breakfast was amazing. All in all a great stay and definitely be back!",5,2019,11,02
229,Lovely!,"Spent two nights at The Castle Hotel in October. The hotel is lovely and has a real homely feel to it, my room was quite small but was clean and had everything I needed. The location is fantastic, walking distance to the town centre and Temple Bar. The staff were all lovely and extremely helpful and the Irish breakfast was fab! Would definitely stay here again. ",4,2019,11,01
229,30th borthday,"Me and my fiancé came here for four days in February this year. Castle hotel was massive and the staff are great, I emailed them before our trip and asked if they could put some birthday decorations in the room which they did with no hesitation. Food in the hotel was lovely and we really enjoyed the breakfast and vegetable soup.

Dublin itself was great with loads of bars and restaurants to eat and drink, our favourite was the rolling doughnut which is on the banks of the river Liffey. Only issue with Dublin is how expensive everything is which ruined it a little bit. One night we had a few drinks bill came to 90 euros for 7 bottles of corona and 7 pints of Heineken!

All that being said we will be back and definitely be booking the same hotel as the castle hotel is on O’Connell street and as stated before rooms, staff & food are all excellent.",5,2019,10,27
229,Old World charm,"I loved this hotel!  It had a relaxed, historical feel that was just what I was hoping for.  It is literally a few steps from the train station and within walking distance to all the shops, pubs and restaurants.  We were happy to have the convenience of a hotel restaurant and bar at the end of a very long day of touring.  We also liked the hot breakfast served in the morning.  Great value for the money.",5,2019,10,25
229,Fantastic Hotel!,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at The Castle Hotel. The room, breakfast and evening in-house meals were fantastic and great value. The staff are all extremely helpful, kind, cheery and friendly and the entertainment every night of the week is a real bonus. Ideally located for the town centre, shopping, eating places, buses and several attractions this is a gem and a real credit to Dublin. Absolutely 100% recommended and I can't wait to stay here again! 5 stars!",5,2019,10,22
229,Nice and friendly,"Had a lovely stay here for a large family group
Service and staff and facilities were great 
Only concern was breakfast very busy and as a large group (13) we would have appreciated a private room where we could have eaten together.",4,2019,10,21
229,The Castle Hotel,I was there for seven full days. Irish songs by Ray Cox was great. Irish dancing by Jean Kennedy was excellent. Both of them gave this hotel a romantic atmosphere. Full Irish breakfast was very good. Staff was very friendly and helpfull. Room was very clean. I want to come back in due time. Best wishes.,5,2019,10,18
229,Great for access to Dublin,"We stayed for 3 nights whilst visiting Dublin. The hotel is conveniently located for walking to the central Dublin attractions, although it is uphill from the centre. Plenty of bus stops within 100 yards, including some of the Hop-on-Hop-off tour buses. Bar and restaurant downstairs with Irish entertainment on some nights. Excellent breakfast buffet. The hotel is converted from a row of Georgian townhouses with many period features, including very creaky staircases. There is a lift. Limited parking spaces available in the rear courtyard, accessible behind an electric gate, costing Eu15 per night.",4,2019,10,16
229,one night stay -- very nice!,"Very much enjoyed our stay -- great restaurant, great room!  Excellent staff, very helpful.  Beautiful ambiance.  Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes the nostalgic charm of old Ireland!",5,2019,10,13
229,"Lovely staff, great location","Our stay in a family room (2 adults, 2 children) was conveniently located close to the centre of town and transport , was clean and very quiet. The staff were friendly and the hot chocolates were amazing.",5,2019,10,02
229,Good location,"Not knowing our way around this proved to be an ideally located hotel.  5 minute walk from  us stops where you get tourist tours or the airport bus it is also close to many bars, shops and attractions.
An unusual hotel which does appear cluttered with different furniture it is several older houses which have been linked together.
My room, I booked a single, had a double bed but was quite small.  The bathroom was small and reasonably well equipped.  The shower controls however are impossible to teach from outside the very small shower due to the folding door.
The hotel is dated and could do with a bit of decoration.  The walls are quite thin, I could hear next door snoring.
Food was excellent.  Breakfast was tasty and fresh with a good selection.  Have as much as you want.
We did eat downstairs one evening having the set menu.  Excellent value and delicious, all courses.  This was our last night and our group wished we had eaten there earlier.
If and when I return to Dublin i would be happy to stay here again.",4,2019,09,30
229,Castle  hotel  Dublin Ireland,Great classic hotels. Rooms are spacious  and large  windows.  Good service from desk and breakfast  was excellent. Restaurant  was a little slow service  for dinner. Hotel was central to all local tourist  spots.,5,2019,09,29
229,brilliant digs,"3 nights at this hotel early September, walk to everything in 15 minutes, good food, exceptional service. Music in the basement dining room, also very good. Happy to endorse as a fine base for touring the City. Front desk and dining room people could not have been more obliging.",4,2019,09,29
229,Eropean charm is a great location,We had a great time staying at the Castle Hotel.  Rooms are a bit small but very charming.  The included breakfast is delicious.  We had dinner at the two restaurants and food was very good.  Location is good just a short walk from O'Connell st.  Bus to the airport AIRLINK 100 is just steps away. The Hop on hop off bus is nearby. We will definitely stay at the Castle hotel next time we visit Dublin. The hotel and restaurant staff are helpful and super friendly.,5,2019,09,28
229,Lovely stay,We spent two nights here upon arrival in Dublin.  Accommodations were a bit crowded for two friends.  Bathroom had a tiny shower and the smallest little sink I have ever seen. The people at the hotel were delightful and always very helpful. I would stay there again.,4,2019,09,26
229,Nice City Stay in Dublin,"Castle Hotel is a great little spot about a 20min walk to the bustling Temple Bar neighbourhood of Dublin. The staff at Castle were all very lovely and super helpful at all hours of the day. We drove right from the airport to the hotel, there is car parking available on site though make sure you have a tiny car rented as it is VERY tight to get around in the lot. Our room was good, nothing over the top, mostly just a place for us to sleep in the evening. The breakfast area at the hotel was very cute and they have a good sized breakfast buffet. The bar/restaurant in the lower part of the hotel was my favourite and it was a great spot to wind down in the evening. The hotel is also really close to a pub called Murray's which we highly recommend as they have live music and dancers in the evening which was a lot of fun. If you're looking for a hotel that is a little more cost friendly than some of the over the top hotels in Dublin then castle hotel is a great choice.

My only complaint really was It was very noisy in the evening in our room. The windows from our room faced the main street and it was quite noisy at night even with the windows shut as they didn't really have much sound proofing. If you are staying here you may want to request a room that doesn't face the main street.

229,"Dirty room, terrible breakfast and a very long walk to the points of interest in Dublin.","We booked the room that was available a couple of days before we left for Ireland and evidently it was their lower teir room.  The tub wouldn't drain, the sink had man's whiskers in it and also wouldn't drain.  The paint was peeling off the wall.  When we called the manager he moved us to a clean room with an updated bathroom - why were we put in that philthy room in the first place.   The breakfast was literally the worst I have ever had, canned tangerines, watery eggs, etc.  This is a hotel that is a very very long walk from all Dublin has to see.",2,2019,09,19
229,Great experience!!!,"Good location, excellent hot breakfast. Room was very clean. The staff was extremely friendly. Bus stop is just around the corner. The windows do not block out much sound. Can be noisy at night. We will be back!",5,2019,09,18
229,Not impressed,"I requested a quiet room but was given 216 which is anything but. It has double aspect sash windows which would normally be a positive but because they are single-glazed and overlook traffic it is not a positive. I could not sleep. By 6am I'd had enough and phoned reception to request a different room. After some initial resistance ""we haven't got anything, we are fully booked"" the hotel agreed to move me. 

I packed my case and after lunch I had been given a different room -226- it was better than the first room which looked like something from the '50s. Having a sleepless night spoilt my first day in Dublin.

My second room was less noisy. There was noise but it didn't start until after 7am by which time I was normally awake and not too bothered. 

I have been staying in hotels in Dublin for more than 30 years and would not choose to stay here again. Breakfast was ok (some buffet items were a bit tepid, the toast looked like it had just glanced at the toaster). 

I was here for four nights, three of which were in 226, Had I been in 216 for the duration I would have given a 2* rating but the fact that the hotel agreed to move me elevated my rating to 3*",3,2019,09,18
229,Charming hotel downtown Dublin,"Good location, and just across the street from the DoDublin Hop-on-hop-off bus stop. Well appointed rooms, excellent hot breakfast and meals in the restaurant.  Reception was very helpful, and a young woman named Ciara helped me figure out how to use the TV and we had a lovely chat.

Dublin was playing Kerry in football and I could watch the crowds walking the streets in anticipation of the game.  It was especially loud that night.  The windows do not block out much sound and the front desk has sleep kits - ear plugs and an eye mask.  Ask for a quieter inside room.

There are several rooms where you can sit and read a book in charming surroundings.  Newspapers are available in the lobby.",4,2019,09,15
229,"Delightful hotel, friendly, accommodating staff","The Castle Hotel was a delight. The staff was extremely friendly, gracious, and accommodating. The room and bath were well appointed and the bed very comfortable. The hotel is a fun connected combination of several buildings with obviously rich history, winding staircases, art and furniture pieces and several welcoming sitting areas. When we had early day tours and were leaving before the hotel’s breakfast service, they gladly packed us a lunch of sandwiches and fruit for our day and had it waiting at the front desk as we departed for our tours. The breakfast at the hotel offered a wide selection of traditional Irish breakfast and pastry items with comfortable seating and attentive wait staff. The location is convenient to bus stops and tour starting points. We would definitely stay at the Castle Hotel again on any travels to Dublin.",5,2019,09,14
229,Close to everything,"Little classic hotel in city centre, not cheap, but not expensive, small cute rooms, they serve breakfast too, we want to be close to everything, walking distance to some of them or Uber ride for the others, next to a very busy street too, we liked it.",4,2019,09,13
229,Nice furnishings,"The location is fairly convenient to shopping,  food & bars.  The room is nicely decorated.  The issue is noise. We could hear the band in the bar. We only had to go up a few steps to get to our room. It does have an elevator. ",4,2019,09,12
229,Very average - crappy rooms for the price,"Very expensive for a very low rated room. Two single beds for a married couple, shower with no protection meant the water flooded the bathroom. Room smelt of mold. Long corridors that seemed unsafe if there was a fire. We will not be staying here again and glad it was only one night.",1,2019,09,12
229,Last minute stay,We had to travel to Dublin as a family member had taken seriously ill ..I booked this hotel as it was close to the hospital & we needed a bed ..The receptionist on duty on the 2 September could not have been more helpful & certainly made our stay easier.we stayed two nights in a very comfortable relaxed clean friendly hotel within walking distance to O'Connell Street ..The hotel is an old building which ment the rooms were large and had thick walls so were quiet . The decor was lovely such a change from all the modern hotels with paper thin walls . It had character & a few squeaky stairs but I have to say if I have to go to Dublin again I'll be booking here first ..Breakfast was great the menus in bar was limited it done the job a little expensive but then we are in Dublin & the food we got was lovely ..If you are looking for an ideal location within walking distance & want old-fashioned comfort & friendly staff look no further .we told them our room was fine but the cleaning staff replaced all towels & sorted out the beds great service..,5,2019,09,11
229,Our expectations were met and then some,"This little gem has everything you should be looking for when staying in Dublin.  It is in a safe area; within minutes walking distance to all the top attractions; it has character, comfort, history, and THE BEST BREAKFAST included!  It's hard to describe the staff in such a short review:  personable, caring, accommodating, pleasant.  The owner, Mr. Fionn Mac Cumhaill, personally sought to alleviate our anxiety with a problem we had with a double booking upon arrival with our party of two couples.  I can't say enough about this special place and the people who made our trip even more memorable.",5,2019,09,03
229,Central location ,I picked this hotel because I was looking for a centrally located hotel in Dublin . My main reason for ranking is for the cost of the room over $200 a night per room (incl taxes ) I don’t think this hotel is worth that . The hotel is located in a good location and is close to the hop on hop off bus and other bus lines . There is a breakfast with hot items eggs sausage toast pastries and yogurt and cereal . The front staff is amiable if somewhat distracted . Hard to get their attention . It is noisy but this is due to location . Hotel is quirky as it is composed of a few diff building s cobbled together so interesting corridors . Our room had a small bathroom with a shower and very few hooks or shelves while another in our party had a bathtub and more space to put clothes . I tried to reuse towels but they fell to the floor because of the small hook . Room was small and had tea kettle and an anemic offering of a few packets of coffee . The breakfast staff and workers were nice . I think nicer amenities and more focused front office would help . Location is good ,3,2019,09,02
229,Top Location and friendly staff,"Very nice Hote, larger than expected, excellent location, so everything is in walking distance. Very friendly and professional staff, Breakfast also good and no problem to get an early breakfast which was necessary due to early flight.
Rooms are clean and in almost good shape, only the doors of our wardrobe where in bad condition and close to fell out.
Finally I would highly recommend the hotel",4,2019,09,02
229,Very happy customer,Accidentally booked the wrong two nights through booking.com mid August and didn’t have the option of changing our booking so rang the hotel and they were so helpful and understanding and gave us the opportunity to change our booking to the nights we meant to book. Hotel is so well situated within walking distance of so many of Dublin’s main tourist attractions. Staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Food is great both for breakfast and also downstairs at the bar in the evening. The live music in the evening at the bar is also very enjoyable! Would definitely stay here again if i visit Dublin again. ,5,2019,09,01
229,Trip to Dublin,"This is our second visit to The Castle Hotel Dublin, again a most enjoyable stay staff very pleasant and helpful rooms very clean housekeeping left chocolates on your bed each day plenty of tea and coffee and biscuits also. Hotel very close to city centre so not far to walk to all the wonderful pubs that Dublin has to offer. Hopefully we will be returning again next year.",4,2019,09,01
229,"Old World Charm, Great Location & Breakfast to Boot","I recently stayed with my family - wife and two teens - and had a great experience. I reserved a family quad room - two twin beds + a double bed. I requested a room with a shower via email and was easily accommodated. 

Our flight arrived at 5 am local time, putting us at the hotel a little before 7 am. They said our room was not yet ready but allowed us to store our bags and have tea and scones for breakfast at no charge. As we went out to explore the city, they told us our room would likely be ready by 10 am, so we timed ourselves to return to the hotel after lunch, so we could go to our room and nap for a few hours. 

The room was large with high ceilings and lovely moldings on the edges of the ceiling. There was plenty of space even with two sitting chairs, an ottoman at the foot of the double bed, a small desk, and several end tables. In addition, the room was equipped with USB ports for each bed, which came in handy even though we brought a power converter with four USB ports. The linens were clean. The room was quiet. 

Breakfast each day was delicious. Eggs, sausage, toast, oatmeal (on request), coffee, tea, hot chocolate (also on request) along with cold-cuts, cheese and fresh fruit were available and plentiful every day. The staff was very accommodating. Portions were generous and we even were able to take a snack with us in a take-away box/bag. In fact, the two days we had day tours that departed before 7 am, we were invited to come to breakfast early - 6 am - to pack our own cold breakfast to go. 

The front desk staff was helpful and knowledgeable. They recommended restaurants. They gave us maps and directions. They even helped us get the best price for the DART - local transit system - for our day trip to Malahide. 

My only warning is that when charging our stay, they gave us the option of charging in Euros or Dollars. They didn’t know whether the exchange rate for charging in dollars was any different, but when I got the receipt, I found it was quite different. I ended up paying a 3.5% (about $53) more for my stay than if I had paid in Euros as my credit card charges no foreign transaction fees. Oh, well. 

Regardless, I recommend the hotel highly for any family traveling with teens. Everyone got their own bed and we all slept and ate well each day. ",5,2019,09,01
229,Noisy but in city centre,Stayed for two nights the hotel is well placed near all city centre services the rooms are a bit dated the breakfast is good . The price was slightly high for the standard of room but it’s in the centre of a big city there is a lot noise from outside and you can hear every noise round about you,4,2019,09,01
229,"Wonderful Service, Lovely Atmosphere","Our stay at the Castle Hotel started off on a high note and stayed there the whole trip. We arrived at the hotel around 8am, far before our check-in time. We were just hoping to drop our luggage off  (they have a locked room for it) but the woman at the desk surprised us by offering us complimentary tea, coffee, and pastries in the breakfast area. It was exactly what we needed after an overnight flight from the US. 
The room (two twins) was small but well decorated with a very Georgian flair. The bathroom was thankfully quite modern. The standard in Ireland seems to be to only provide a duvet for the beds, no top sheet. They will give you a top sheet if you ask for it, and will also give you a fan for the room. The workers at the front desk were extremely helpful and accommodating our entire stay. 
It was centrally-located enough to get everywhere easily, but to still be nice and quiet. The breakfast each morning was great - same options each day but they were good so I can't complain. The Vault restaurant in the basement was great- they have live music every night and it was quite good. We went back twice because we enjoyed the atmosphere so much!",5,2019,08,31
229,Best place we have stayed in Dublin so far.,"A beautiful hotel in central Dublin,perfect location,not too noisy outside.Staff were amazing and nothing was too much trouble.Breakfasts and Dinners were fantastic.The beef and Guinness stew was the best i had ever had.Evening entertainment in the vaults was worth staying for,singing and irish dancing.Will definitely be booking a return trip.",5,2019,08,28
229,Not as great as made out to be,"The photos of the rooms didn't live up to their expectations. My room was dated, and the woodwork was in dire need of a paint job.
My room was facing the street, which meant constant traffic noise. Room had no ventilation system, which made the room very warm, and the windows could only be opened for a few centimeters.
Staff was on/off friendly. Some behind reception appeared to not wanted to be there at all, and everything seemed to bother them. 
I had dinner in the Old Music Shop once. Staff was stressed out over something and seemed to have beaf with each other, which didn't make for a welcoming vibe. Food was ok, but nothing special. Breakfast was crowded, and the layout of the breakfast room leaved a lot to be desired. 
My bed was worn as well, and leaned towards one side while in bed. I didn't mention this, as I was there for only a few nights. But you pay good money to stay there, especially as a solo traveller. And while it is located close to the centre, it's not really THAT great. I've stayed in better places.",3,2019,08,27
229,Great place to stay,"This Victorian hotel is a great place to stay! Staff are friendly, food was great, bed was comfy and has a central location. My daughter and I stayed here for 2 nights, we had a great experience!  We were going on a day trip on our 2nd day of our stay and  we had to leave early because we’ve booked a day tour and that means no breakfast for us, I asked the reception if we could have a packed sandwich to take with us and there was no problem at all.  It was prepared and ready for us to take when we leave for our day tour that day!  Also, I had some question regards my payment when I came back home, I emailed the hotel and soon got the reply and eased my worries. So overall I had a great experience at this hotel I would certainly recommend this to anyone!",4,2019,08,27
229,"Seedy hotel, good location","This hotel needs a renovation. It was a seedy hotel, very close to O'Connell Street. It is the kind of place that is packed with German tourists. The room was comfortable, but there was peeling wallpaper. The buffet was extensive and okay. Staff was quite friendly.",3,2019,08,26
229,Brilliant Hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights last week at the castle hotel, brilliant location, spotlessly clean and the staff were so helpful and friendly, my husband had breakfast and it was lovely, the guys down in the bar 'the vault' are great guys and the hotels entertainment was pretty great too.  Only complaint was lack of air conditioning, however we did stay in August and it was super hot, but it didn't effect our stay, just opened the windows as we were on the third floor it was perfectly safe.

Thanks for a great stay Castle Hotel",5,2019,08,26
229,3 day break,"Stayed at the Castle for 3 nights with friends,great central location, staff brilliant and so helpful nothing was to much trouble,we had triple room which was spacious the bathroom a little small, yes it's a little loud at night but you are in the middle of a city and hotel supplies ear plugs if needed,we ate in the cellar bar a couple of nights again great quality food,the only thing for me would be to have breakfast a lot hotter. Great old hotel with character. 
",4,2019,08,26
229,Well located,"Booked to stay here for a couple of nights with friends. Great location - a 15 minute walk from Temple Bar!
The rooms were spacious; the only small gripe we had was that the showers were pretty weak.
Smashing breakfast included in the price too, so excellent value for money. Would definitely stay here again. ",5,2019,08,23
229,"Historical, lots of character, not quiet","If you want a hotel that is quiet and level with limited corridors, don’t come here. If you want an interesting, quaint, old hotel with antique furniture and lots of cosy sitting areas, you will enjoy this hotel. The hotel is comprised of 9 Georgian buildings. We were on the 3rd floor which we accessed via a lift then walked down a long passageway down a slope, stairs and 3 doors before we reached our room. It was a comfortable room, no aircon, so the window had to be open and it became quite noisy, especially on the weekend but also rubbish trolleys - we had ear plugs at night which I would recommend. WiFi was good and good position to O’Connell street, Writers Museum, James Joyce Centre and Gate Theatre. The breakfast was excellent but gets very busy. The Vault restaurant had an Irish balladeer singing on Saturday night, who was very entertaining. There is a book case near one of the lifts where books can be taken or left. The staff on desk were busy but always pleasant.",4,2019,08,19
229,"Good Location, Noisy Room","Located close to centre of the city. Nice breakfast. However, room did not feel clean, especially the bed. Was very noisy, could hear everything happening outside and next door. Would choose to stay elsewhere next time.",3,2019,08,19
229,Perfect city centre location with some lovely Irish charm!!,"I stayed at one of the apartments of the Castle hotel with my 11 year old daughter and found it to be a safe and comfortable place to be and just ideal for some Dublin sightseeing. The apartment was very nicely furnished with a sitting area, dining table, desk and a big, comfy bed. It also had a kitchen with a big fridge, microwave, kettle and stove top- although the cutlery and kitchen equipment was a bit inadequate. The bathroom was good too- plenty of towels, hot water and toiletries. We enjoyed the good Irish breakfast served at the café in the hotel. What we loved the best was getting down to the bar late night (and yay!!kids are allowed!!) and enjoying some live Irish music and dance. My daughter even had a go at Irish dancing with an award winning Irish dancer. I highly recommend the hotel and would gladly rebook again!!",5,2019,08,17
229,Great location and comfortable stay,"The hotel is in a great location, close to but not directly on the main street. Attractions and public transport are only moments away. Room was relatively big with a decent bathroom and comfortable bed. My room faced the internal courtyard, so got some noise/music from the restaurant downstairs but no street noise.",4,2019,08,17
229,Sister’s trip!,"I returned to the Castle Hotel with my little sister and was not disappointed in the least! I expected and was delivered the same top notch hospitality I experienced my first time visiting. 
My sister and I stayed in the Castle Lofts, which comes complete with a kitchen, fully equipped.  As vegetarians we loved having the ability to shop and prepare some of the local produce for a few of our meals. Of course, the foods available at the Castle Vaults and the Old Music Shop were wonderful and we enjoyed dining in both restaurants. 
Thank you Castle Hotel, for another fabulous stay!  ",5,2019,08,14
229,Mr. James Sherlock,"Stayed 8nights and this hotel was exactly what I expected. ""Quirky"" three Georgian terraces make up the hotel so it's a labyrinth of up and down in and out of corridors with three impresive staircases all leading to reception.(don't worry there is two elivators as well) 
I class it as a typical European hotel clean, functional but don't expect all the amenities that a typical North American hotel would have.
The staff however outshine any American hotel I've stayed at (and I've stayed at some fancy 5☆ resorts) As expected there are quirks in a Georgian building, expect to run the hot water for a few minutes before it actually arrives but there was always ample supply. Rooms are small but comfortable and housekeeping good (unless you want a face cloth they don't supply them😉) amenities in the hotel great the Music room for breakfast excellent free full Irish breakfast everyday if you want but continental too if you prefer lighter. Personally i had the Irish set me up for the day and didn't need to eat until supper time. Have supper in the vault at least a few times great food, great atmosphere and live music.
I gave it 4☆ because of it's quirks which might not appeal to some but it is definitely higher than the 3☆ rating it gets on most travel sites but then it's competing with your cookie cutter plastic modern hotels. Personally I'll go for character everytime.",4,2019,08,11
229,Back to Dublin,"Spent quite a few nights in Dublin last few years and I keep returning to Castle Hotel. They have 24 hours reception, breakfast and is affordable. Last time I met the owner who was a nice gentleman. Location is good and last time I found out they have excellent music sessions also. Ray Cox played and sung Irish tunes with class. Very good at his trade. Hotel is close to airlink bus and a tip from me to you is to get a tourist Leap Card and head out into Dublin’s surroundings. Also, will return to Castle Hotel. Thanks guys and girls",5,2019,08,09
229,Castle Hotel Visit,"My family stayed for a week in July. We had later returned for one more night with my grandparents and we stayed in this huge and beautiful room. The following day my boyfriend and I wanted to try a different area in Dublin after checking out of the Castle Hotel we headed to our AirBnB, which was nothing like it stated on the website. We couldn’t stay safely at the AirBnB and headed back to the Castle Hotel, hoping we would be able to get a room. The front desk staff is friendly and amazing. They were able to get us a room and we were so excited to stay at their hotel. We dined in the hotel restaurant and enjoyed drinks while listening to Ray Cox, who sings wonderfully and is quite entertaining. The following morning we enjoyed a wonderful breakfast and headed to the airport. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin. The staff, the rooms, the dining, the entertainment, it was all simply wonderful!",5,2019,08,07
229,Dublin's oldest hotel,"We had comfortable three nights in Castle hotel. We had family room where was five beds for two adults and two teenagers. Room was recently renovated and I was satisfied to room quality. Air condition was missing, but fortunately temperature wasn't that high during our stay. Breakfast was good enough, but the only vegetebles were tomato and water mellon. Location was pretty good nearby O'Connell Street.",4,2019,08,07
229,Comfortable vintage hotel,"The Castle Hotel is an interesting amalgam offering great value in central Dublin.  Originally founded in 1804, it has linked multiple 19th century buildings into a fair sized hotel.  The numerous public rooms on the first floor are vintage, comfortable 19th century -- while the rooms, though varying one from the other are basic, Ikea furnished rooms.  The breakfast buffett in the Music Room Restaurant is wonderful and the Restaurant is quite good for dinner as well. 

The hotel appears to rest on the good side of the border with a poorer side of town - so if you approach through some of those areas (as I did) you might be disconcerted.  Not to worry, walk out the front door and south down Parnell and you are comfortable all the way.  A good value.",4,2019,08,05
229,A great hub for a stay in Dublin,Nice little vintage style hotel... Very friendly staff... Only a block & 1/2 from the LUAS so a very convenient place to stay... $7 bus to the airport less than a block away... Room a little dated but with only 5 days in Dublin who is going to spend much time in their room... Fantastic Full Irish Breakfast included in the price of the room... For a not too expensive stay I would highly recommend !!!,4,2019,08,04
229,"Castle Hotel in Dublin is a comfortable, vintage hotel in a good location","Castle Hotel is older style, but comfortable and clean. It is located a little outside of the main bustling tourist area, still close enough to walk to most sites, but also close enough to have a bit of street noise. (We were in a third floor room but were woken several times by revelers and sirens.) There is no air conditioning and the window doesn't open enough to ventilate well. Lots of stairs, might be a problem for some people. There is an elevator, though. Tons of charm, but you do give up some convenience of a modern hotel. The breakfast was excellent in variety, quality, and service. We also had a good lunch in the corner cafe.",4,2019,07,29
229,Convenient Location But Average Accomodations,"The hotel is well situated within walking distance of much of historic Dublin, and very easy to access by public transit.  The staff were friendly.  The hotel has charm, but is a bit dated and we wished it offered just a few more amenities in the room.  There was also poor ventilation so it was very hot in the room.  Breakfast was not particularly special.  A decent, mid-range hotel, but wish it had just a little more (or maybe offered at a little lower of a price) to make it a place worth recommending.  Overall, an average deal.",3,2019,07,29
229,50th Birthday Celebrations,"This hotel is great, it offers good food and drink alongside comfortable large rooms.
The staff are very hospitable and give great customer service.
A special thank you for the welcome in the room. The balloons, banner and card got my celebration stay off to a great start.
See you next year.",5,2019,07,28
229,Time ofYear?,"At best this is a 3.  We visited in July so it was as hot as it gets.  No a/c in the rooms.  The climate is not terribly hot but is humid, so the windows were open for at least a little bit of breeze.  The rooms on the back surround a courtyard adjacent to the cafe and pub.  While they supposedly close at a reasonable hour patrons are rude and talk loud and laugh long while echos bounce from wall to wall.  Then, at 2:00 am when they’ve finally run out of steam it is quiet for 38 seconds when the night birds take over with screech that goes on until time to arise for the day.  We heard these complaints from other guests, as well.  We commented to the staff the first morning who said to call them.  Many did but nothing happed from them for the free nights we stayed.

On a positive note, aside from the above, the staff were most informative, helpful, courteous, and jovial.  They could not have been better.  Once the above is resolved, a little updating is in order.",3,2019,07,26
229,Excellent Place to stay in Dublin,The location was perfect and walked to many of the places we wanted to visit. The hotel was so full of charm and the most friendly and helpful staff. Also ate dinner in the pub there enjoying music and excellent food.  Our room and room service was great. So enjoyed ourselves there and would definitely stay there again.,5,2019,07,25
229,great hotel  with good retaurant and entertainment,we stayed here for a long weekend. Hotel quirky and rooms not large but well equipped. good ensuite with towels and toiletries. Breakfast included and good. visited the restaurant celled vaults ;food really good and entertainment was super.the hotel kept our cases so we enjoyed our last day without carrrying them around. it was 5 minutes walk to the airport bus stop and less than 10 minutes down to the river Liffey.,4,2019,07,25
229,Find somewhere else ...,"The hotel is quite old and worn but well maintained. We stayed for two nights but seriously considered finding somewhere else for the second. The main complaint is the incessant, very loud screeching noise from seagulls, which are a massive nuisance on the top floors. We were woken up at 4 a.m. each night - and the constant screeching was unbearable. While this is somewhat outside the hotel's control, there are measures that can be taken to deal with this problem - and as a minimum guests should be informed about this before making their booking ... and complimentary ear plugs would have been appreciated. (There were one pair of earplugs in the room - left on the floor - used - by the previous guests ...)

We were 2 adults and a child and paid €242 per night - and this is honestly way, way too much for the standard of this hotel and this kind of experience. 

I will not recommend this hotel - there are so many other options in Dublin. Book somewhere else. 

P.S. I have written to the hotel to try to get a dialogue about this before posting this review, but I have not had any reply.",2,2019,07,24
229,Unique hotel with personal touches,"I stayed here with a friend from 19 to 21 July. I took a chance when booking this hotel as it’s not the one I usually stay at when I’m in Dublin.

However the chance worked out well. The hotel is gorgeous, unique and classic with amazing chairs/furniture around the common areas.

The rooms were fine and a chocolate on the pillow as a welcome was a gorgeous touch! 

Breakfast was really nice, and the fact it was included in the rate was great.

The hotel is in a good location, a few minutes walk to the centre and easy to find etc. 

Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel! ",4,2019,07,22
229,Great hotel!,"My wife and I just returned to Canada after a week-long stay at the Castle. This was our first trip overseas and we weren't sure what to expect but the Castle exceeded our expectations in every possible way.

Obviously the location is perfect and it didn't take us long to realize that this wasn't some faceless chain hotel that could be anywhere in the world. It had lots of quirks (we got lost trying to find out room on the second night but after some other guests pointed us in the right direction we never made that mistake again!), character and history. Our room was great, the bed was very comfortable, the pillows were awesome and the towels top notch. We had great weather thorughout our stay but never missed air conditioning. The wifi was strong everywhere I used it.

The staff, without exception, was outstanding, whether it was the front-desk group (setting us up with breakfast to go which was much appreciated when we had to hit the road early a couple of times for day trips out of town) or those working in the restaurant at breakfast (the full breakfast was a great way to start the day).

We often ended out night in the downstairs bar, enjoying the music and unwinding with a beer or two. Again, the bar staff was great, very attentive and helpful with suggestions of other establishments to visit and, just as important, those to steer clear of. We took advantage of the four-course meal deal on our final night and it was tremendous.

Not sure when we will be back in Dublin again but we will have no issues recommending the Castle to anyone we know heading there.",5,2019,07,19
229,"A hotel with character, great service and good value","This hotel is full of character and ambience, with its sitting rooms off the lobby and hotel rooms with all of the basic needs. Wifi was strong, breakfast was very good (can be busy but be patient). Location is excellent, just off O’Connell on the north side of the Liffey, walking distance to all of the main sites in Dublin. The bar in the basement has live music most nights and it was very good - good vibe, great selection of beers and whiskey. Overall, a tremendous experience for our family. ",5,2019,07,16
229,"Location, location, location.     We loved this hotel!","We spent four wonderful nights at this hotel    The rooms are clean and nice. The staff is competent and friendly.  The complimentary buffet  breakfast each morning was plentiful with endless delicious coffee.  But best of all, is the convenient central location. We would definitely come back",5,2019,07,14
229,Great choice and value,The hotel has a lot of character and is the oldest hotel in Dublin ....the rooms are nice though small but it has nice lounges and has kept it s ancient character . Great value and awesome location . Breakfast was not very great for vegetarian food,5,2019,07,14
229,First trip to Ireland with many friends & family for my Daughter's wedding.,"This historic Georgian House hotel offers all you could want. The staff were friendly, helpful. We appreciated each and every one. Chech in was a breeze. We arrived early and room was not ready. Our luggage was stored in a locked room and we explored the property which is vast and decorated with fine antiques. There are many sitting rooms through this 9 combined Georgian houses. There is a lovely outside garden with tables & chairs jus of a bistro serving breakfast & lunch. The Vault Pub & Restuarant served fine food and drink. We enjoyed it a few times. There was live entertainment each night we went. The music was both traditional and modern. There was always a lively, friendly customers and staff. Owen was a wonderful bartender and waiter. He was charming!  I highly recommend this location. From here it walkable to the Temple Bar district, Guiness Storehouse, Jameson Distillery, Christ Chuch Cathedral, Dublin Castle, Ha'Penny Bridge & Trinity College.",5,2019,07,14
229,Great comfort and good Location,"We stayed here for four nights while we enjoyed and explored Dublin. The hotel consists of at least three large older city houses connected and updated into comfortable hotel rooms. Our bed was comfortable, our room and bath (shower) were very adequate, the breakfasts were fresh and abundant and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We were within easy walking distance of Temple Bar, Trinity College and Grafton Street so we recommend this hotel.",5,2019,07,11
229,"Ideally positioned, fantastic food","We were at the end of a four week trip with my family of five. Sleeping arrangements were similar to the others we had stayed at but was easily the most comfortable. Room was clean and nicely presented. The owner was at reception on arrival and gave a glowing review of the Castle Vault restaurant. Best meal I'd had the whole trip. Hard to find a good steak anywhere but this one left me wanting to order the same the following night. Paddy had an amazing voice for an older chap and it is clear why he is still doing gigs, he was fantastic. Overall a lovely stay, breakfast was delicious too. No hesitation recommending to others. Modern enough in an old gem.",4,2019,07,10
229,Nice Hotel,"I will start by saying that I traveled with a group of students.  The lobby area was somewhat small for a check-in of our size.  The lobby is very quaint and pretty and the receptionists were very friendly and helpful. 
The rooms.....it was a bit of a mixed bag on the rooms.  There is an elevator to reach the rooms, but the hallways to reach the rooms could be confusing.  For example--there is a 2nd floor to the right of the reception area and a 2nd floor to the left of the reception area, but they do not necessarily connect to each other.  Once we reached the 2nd floor, there were still small sets of stairs and a series of fire doors and ramps to reach the rooms. This could become a bit confusing.
My room (and those of my students) did not have air conditioning. This is normal for older hotels in Ireland, I am sure.  They probably do not need it more than a few days in the dead of summer.  However, we did hit a 'warmer than usual' time (yellow alert) while there.  The rooms that faced the HOT and the hotel management did not have enough fans for our group.  My room faced a back alley so it did not get too hot. I did need to sleep with the windows open to cool my room down. Unfortunately, the garbage needed to be wheeled out of the building around 10:30 pm and the wheels of the carts rumbled repeatedly over the alley below.  That did only happen on one night, but with the window open, I could hear voices in the surrounding area.
My room was comfortable and a decent size by European standards.  The bathroom was fine---the shower was a bit small, but I am not a large person, so I fit just fine.  There was body wash, shampoo and soap provided, but no washcloth--not unusual for Europe though.
There was also a nice hot pot with coffee, teas and sweeteners provided along with a few biscuits to enjoy.  This is always a plus in my book!
Breakfast was very good with a chef cooking eggs to order--there was also bacon, black pudding, sausage, bacon, cereals, yogurt, breads and fruit.  It was included with our stay.
Overall, it was nice.  If visiting Dublin again,  I think I would stay closer to the center of the city.  This was fine for my group since it kept them at a good 10 walking distance from the main bar scene, but still had a convenience store and a few pubs around.",3,2019,07,10
229,Recommend the Castle Hotel,"We would highly recommend the Castle Hotel in Dublin.  Located north of the River Liffey, the hotel faces a quiet street but is nonetheless close to the center of action and to nice restaurants and bars.  We appreciated the kind assistance of the hotel staff, including Leah, Owen, Marco, and especially Maciek, who went out of his way to make us comfortable.   Another nice feature of the hotel is the restaurant on the lower level.  It features live music by good local musicians.",5,2019,07,08
229,Great hotel in central location,"Stayed in the Castle Hotel for one night as we were in Dublin for a concert in Croke Park. 
The location is fantastic - just off the top of O'Connell St, so central to buses, Luas etc. We were able to stroll to the concert in Croke Park in ~15 minutes which was great. 
Staff are wonderful; friendly and accommodating. Breakfast was included in our rate, and everything was high quality and really tasty - it was very busy so there was a bit of a wait for some items to be re-filled when we visited. 
We had a triple room on the 4th floor - we were happy with the size considering we were in the centre of Dublin, and there was nice toiletries provided in the bathroom - my partner did complain the shower pressure was very poor though. The hotel itself is a charming, old fashioned hotel with a lot of character - it does has a maze-like feel to it to get to rooms etc. and the old-fashioned nature does mean there is no air con, so if the weather is humid, the rooms do get quite warm.
For those considering driving to the hotel; while there is a car park at the back, it is first come first served, and there is only ~10 spaces for the entire hotel, so gets very busy. We were lucky enough to get a space when we arrived, but the car park itself is very tight and difficult to maneuver in and out of (be prepared for 20 point turns!) If we were to stay again, I'd leave the car at home / park out of the city and get the Luas to the hotel.",4,2019,07,08
229,Okay for one night - close to Croke Park,"I stayed with my daughter 05.07.19 for the Westlife concert - 15 minute walk to Croke Park. My huge gripe with this hotel is the parking. I chose this hotel over others as it said there was parking. There are very few spaces and, as there was a wedding in the hotel, they were all taken. The entrance to the car park is on a side road. I had to cross a road through the busy Friday traffic, pull up onto a driveway which ran across the pavement, push the buzzer and be told it was 'booked out'. I had to reverse back out through pedestrians and across the stream of traffic and drive almost 30 minutes around and around to find a space. Why not put up a 'car park full' sign which in my humble opinion is common sense. I witnessed several people ask at reception how to get into the car park to be told it was full. The hotel is grand, staff are grand, breakfast honestly not great but the parking situation was the worst. Would I return? Probably not as I like a hotel where I can access parking without being stressed out in traffic. ",3,2019,07,06
229,"No hot water, not a happy guest","I usually don't require much as long as room is clean and bath private and functional, but this hotel won't be on the list of coming back to.
It's my second day here and there is still no hot water in the bath even after talking with front desk.
Taking cold showers is annoying, I'll request new room in the morning.
Location is excellent.
Bar in basement is good although service is slow. Nice music.
Breakfast is good.
Hallways are very weird, full of stairs and fire doors. You can easily get lost. Even if you take the lift to your floor, you have to go through 2 or 3 sets of stairs to your room.
Room locks should be updated to modern ones.",2,2019,07,05
229,Awful.,"Pros:  maid service
Cons:  Gaudy furniture clutters the lobbies. A maze of Long winding hallways, with slopes and fire door after fire door.  Cheap, bland barely functions furniture in very small rooms.  Nothing is well maintained. Crack in shower floor caused slipping while showering. Shower doors don’t close, mold on ceilings, lack of grout in bathroom. Hard beds, flat pillows and squeaking birds all night.  No AC and no fans!  They admit they do not have fans for every room. No concern for guest comfort.  Miserable heat. Courtyard has great acoustics, and you will hear every conversation below.  Walls are paper thin and you will hear all the frisky business going on next door. 
Maids are superb.  Rooms are the worst.  ",1,2019,07,04
229,Pride day,I’m not one for posting reviews but I couldn’t let this pass. I was in the castle hotel for pride day on Saturday. Never here before it’s an amazing place in the vaults bar I think they call it. It’s underground like something I only seen in movies. Anyway it’s packed and I could only see one guy working he looked so busy I tried to catch his eye but he disappeared into another room as he came back he said I’m not ignoring you just a sec I have a party in the other room just need coffee. No worries I said. As he came back the bar was filling up with thirsty patrons. I could see his face change and I knew he was thinking oh mammy well I would have but no he was cool and calm took my order and as he pulled my pint and made my g&t he was taking orders from 3 other people like it wasn’t a bother that there was about a dozen customers surrounding his small bar. I left for the beer garden to enjoy my drink and another group where talking about how good the barman handled a crazy rush of thirsty gay folk I went back down for another drink the bar was quieter and I laughed as the Barman was having his photo taken with none other then panti bliss they shared a joke as he winked at me to let me no he’d be right with me. We chatted and laughed as he told me the bar isn’t normally open now. That’s when I asked his name cos I knew he needed praise for what he did and how he handled that mad busy day. So Darren I thank you and your a so professional at what you do and I hope your day was as good as ours from the Galway girls,5,2019,06,30
229,Perfect place to stay,"We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. It was close to everything, but not overrun. It had a lovely bar, live music, and a great breakfast. We felt very welcome and truly enjoyed our time. The staff was excellent and helped us whenever we had an issue. We would stay here again!",5,2019,06,30
229,Great place! ,"Located walking distance to shopping district, the river and temple bar area .
The room was very spacious! 
The front desk are very helpful and very friendly . 
The breakfast was amazing! Lots of options, buffet style, hot items such as roasted mushrooms, eggs, potatoes. 
I would definitely come back and stay here . 
We also went to the restaurant for lunch , healthy items, vegetarian friendly, coffee is amazing .
",4,2019,06,29
229,"Stylish room however, not best value for money ","Room was lovely, stylish and very comfortable. Fourth floor so shower pressure was questionable/non-existent. 

Dinner in the Castle Vaults was good; breakfast was busy, very tightly packed in but good selection. 

We paid nearly €200 for our room, which felt expensive and would normally expect something a little more luxurious for this money but then maybe Dublin is a bit more expensive!",3,2019,06,28
229,Wonderful stay!,"Our two day stay at the Castle Hotel was absolutely fabulous. If you like old-fashioned charm with modern conveniences, this is the perfect place. The decor was amazing, there were plenty of outlets in the room, and the staff was without exception super friendly and helpful. The food in the Music Room and the Vaults was very good. And the location of the hotel was excellent. Ask the front desk team about the history of the property. It is very interesting and the team is proud of where they work. Great stay!",4,2019,06,25
229,"Great location,  very friendly staff.","Just got back from our stay at the Castle and can't  recommend  this hotel enough. On arrival  we were greeted by the most welcoming  reception  staff I have ever encountered.  Literally  nothing was too much trouble for them. We arrived  several hours before check in but they happily stored our luggage  until the room was ready and even offered us complimentary coffees. Our room 107 was beautifully  decorated with lots of original features including a stunning four poster bed.  The bathroom  could do with a bit of an upgrade  but given the age of the property that was a very small gripe. The only warning I  would give is that the traffic was very loud from the street outside.  I mentioned this at reception  and although they had almost  full occupancy they offered us an alternative room. On viewing the alternative we decided we preferred our first room as the bed was much nicer. We bought some ear plugs from a pharmacy just down the street and that solved the problem. The complimentary  full Irish breakfast was of a very high standard and again the staff could not be more helpful.  The meal we had in the restaurant  was beautifully cooked and again the staff were very friendly and welcoming.  Overall I  would say if you're  looking for somewhere  with original  Georgan charm, good food and very welcoming staff and are not put off by some minor disrepair which is in keeping with the age of the building and only adds to its charm, this place would be hard to beat.",5,2019,06,21
229,It worked,"This is an older building, really weird ways to get to your rooms (not just a simple elevator).  The room was good, a smaller double bed, and it was hard to control the heat, had to open windows which meant the birds were really loud.  Breakfast was good but not amazing, there were no fresh scones which is uncommon for an Irish breakfast in our experience.  The location was good.  Had one enjoyable evening in the pub, excellent entertainment.  Not sure I would stay here again though, I would look around for other options in that area,  We are still trying to resolve an issue with our credit card being charged twice, the hotel did help and it's only been a couple of days so hopefully that will be resolved soon.   Staff we dealt with were good.",4,2019,06,21
229,AWFUL HOTEL DO NOT ACCEPT ROOM 104,This has to be the worst hotel we have ever stayed in.  When we opened the door to our room we were so dissapointed.  This hotel had such high reviews and looked lovely from the outside and very central...that is the only positive I can think off.  The room looks as though it has not been decorated since the 70s ( no exaggeration) the ceiling has a big flaky moldy looking patch on it.  The room was filthy dust that looks like it has many years of build up there was also cobwebs on the lights.  The windows has cracked glass panes it also has open plumbing pipes going up the wall.  This was a trip we were really looking forward to and so very let down by the accommodation.  There was much better hotels we could have booked into for €400.  We did not complain at the time but the more I think about it the more annoyed I get at myself for paying this for a room that looks like it has not been opened up for decades.   What ever you do do not accept room 104.,1,2019,06,18
229,Great location - be selective of where your room is.,"This is a really lovely old hotel with lots of period furniture, great staff that welcomes you and seems to genuinely want you to enjoy your stay, a nice full Irish breakfast included, and a restaurant with full-bar and live Irish folk music.

One caution, be sure to choose a room on lower floor as water pressure is non-existent on upper floors. 

I booked our three rooms several months in advance as two twins per room that were to be pushed together to make a king. That was not done in any of our rooms, but at least two rooms where on 1st or 2nd floor -- so couples decided to just deal with it.  Unfortunately, our room was on the 4th floor and we had no water pressure (think water hose), but when we informed staff they promptly moved us to room 22 on the 2nd floor which was a huge upgrade in decor and view from our ""attic"" room and had great water pressure.

The live music is great, but watch your restaurant bill as the waitress did not take off any of our discounts and overcharged us for drinks. The bartender quickly corrected the issue when we came back downstairs.  I really think the issue was that our waiter changed in the middle of ordering and it was a breakdown in communication.",4,2019,06,18
229,"Great location, Great breakfast, and nice staff but.....","The hotel is a bit dated and oddly arranged.Like going through a maze to find our room. Make sure if you have trouble getting around to let them know at the time of booking. Be aware- The airlines  had to cancel our flight due to tornados from SAT to DFW and could not get us into DFW for our 11:05 pm flight. For this reason Castle Hotel charged us for the first night because we couldn't give them 48 hours notice. Although I did email them within an hour of cancellation and 24 Hours before check in explaining the situation was out of our control.
Breakfast was excellent as was the staff. The room rate did not equal the quality.

229,Cozy hotel with lots of character.,"If you like a hotel with a delicious included breakfast buffet in an older building with lots of history, you might like this one.  I did.  Lots of nooks and ways, a delightful breakfast area, a classy basement restaurant, and a cool pub.  A good place to unwind after a busy day of sight seeing. Across the street from Remembrance Park, just off O'Connell St. Close to transportation and Grand  Theater.  I would stay here again.  But I prefer older hotels.  This one is in good condition with a very accommodating staff.",5,2019,06,15
229,"Dublin for 4 couples, old friends, on holiday together!","Castle Hotel has a great location north of the Liffey River and only a block off O'Connell; hop-on, hop-off buses both Big Red and green Go Dublin stop 2 is just across the street in front of the Dublin Writers' Museum (delightful place!). A lot of history to the Castle which comprises 9 Georgian town houses along quiet street.  Lovely parlors, Vaults pub and bar with nightly music, Music Shop restaurant serves buffet breakfast daily from 7:00.  Rooms are adequate in size, clean and comfortable.    We had a party of 8 and they arranged for our rooms to be along the same hallway and were ever so nice in arranging tables for us to sit together in the Vaults. Staff is especially congenial and helpful. They arranged a take away breakfast at 5:00am the morning several of our party departed early for the airport.  Trevor in the Vaults was ever so patient and generous with his time helping to sort out a credit card charge question we had after returning to the States.  We definitely would stay again next time we return to Dublin.",5,2019,06,14
229,AI CLUB TRIP,"Nice hotel, central for Dublin attractions, great for busses / trains / taxis, clean, good price. Most of all - great staff: warm and friendly without being intrusive. My first call when next in Dublin",5,2019,06,09
229,"Great location, great staff","I was staying in the hotel only few nights and majority of the time I was out exploring city so really didn't spend  much time there. The hotel is very charming - if you love the old architecture and décor this is a place to stay. Location is fantastic- close to the center, walking distance everywhere, airport bus 3 minutes walk. Rooms are basic however bathroom was neat and it feels like it has been recently renovated. The only comment I have regarding bathroom is privacy. My room was located on the half floor so windows were on the bottom of the wall rather than top. The bathroom window had only sheer curtain and the window was facing inside court and other windows - this may pose some privacy issues for some people. Bedroom had a thick curtains that you could pull over the window when needed and I feel the blinds should be installed in the bathroom. The amenities were sufficient and eco friendly in the bathroom which is a big plus. Comfortable bed, coffee , tea and electric kettle, hairdryer also available in the room. The most amazing thing about hotel is their staff. Everyone was extremely nice and helpful - always greeting you with a smile and answering any questions you might have. Special shout out to Alex and David from breakfast service where they treated all guests so nicely, professional and accommodating with huge smiles on their faces. Wonderful experience !!!",4,2019,06,06
229,"Will Not Be Returning - Rude Staff, Noisy Hotel and Exotic Dancers.","We checked-in on June 2 and had problems from the first night. 

To start our experience, the staff was completely un-helpful. As new tourists in Ireland, we asked very simple questions (if we could mail a postcard, if the front desk could help get a taxi, etc.) and were responded too with very short, rude, general responses. 

From the first night, the hotel noise was so incredibly loud no one in our room could sleep. Our room was right next to the staircase and the second night it sounded like a group was having a party. For 2 straight hours from (2-4am) it was people walking up and down, screaming, yelling and laughing in the hallway. When we let the front desk know, they said “well no one else complained.” 

To top our stay off, my husband and I tried to do a quick workout in the gym. The equipment was so old and faulty that after my husband racked his weights, the machine fell on top of his neck and cut his face escaping the weight. Thank god he didn’t have heavy weights or it could have done serious damage. 

And not to mention, the gym was dirty and trashy. We walked to the back of the weight room to see what equipment was available and there was an exotic dancer practicing in what looked like a door that should have been kept shut. That was incredibly unprofessional for a hotel guest paying almost 1000 euro for our stay. It made us so uncomfortable that we actually wanted to leave that night. 

We will be returning to Dublin in the future, but will not be staying at the Castle Hotel and will also not be recommending it to friends and colleagues traveling to Dublin. 

I hope this hotel will reinvest into its rooms, staff and equipment. Our experience and the service we received was unacceptable for the price we paid.",1,2019,06,05
229,Genuine hotel in Dublin,"The Castle Hotel is located in the central part of Dublin and allows to see most of the attractions by foot. The hotel itself, although a 4 star, still has the charme of the Edwardian era. One has to take this into account when staying there. The breakfast is included in the price and serves typical Irish dishes. There is a bar in the lower basement with life music. Nice to relax in the evening after dinner.",4,2019,06,05
229,Noisiest Hotel ever!!,"Not for a long time have I ever been in a city centre hotel which is not at least double glazed! We were located on the second floor overlooking a Main Street where buses ran most of the night and stopped outside the window, we may as well have slept outside for how noisy the room was, we were unable to change rooms the first night as the hotel was full, it was an abysmal night with little to no sleep, even with ear plugs we could hear the traffic. The only saving grace was the food was very good, that wouldn’t however convince me to stay again! They should use some of their profits to at least put secondary glazing in the rooms facing the road. ",2,2019,06,04
229,Historic,"A very historic hotel located well, easy walk to O’Connell Street and Henry Street precincts.  Hop on hop off bus stop two minutes away, plus the airlink bus pick up is also just a five minute walk.  We had a night in the Mews section which was sweet - no lifts here so if you have lots of luggage the stairs could be challenging.  For us it was part of the ambience of the place.  Rooms are basic but comfy.  Second night we had in the main section of the hotel which does have a lift.  Staff are very obliging, assisting with luggage storage, extra linen, directions etc.  Ate in the Vault restaurant downstairs both nights, the beef and Guinness stew is amazing, as is the Oven baked salmon.  Live music from 9, which is nice but too loud in a small area and while trying to eat and chat.  But overall it was a great stay and would be happy to stay here again should the need arise.  We even met Fionn, the lovely owner.  Thanks for looking after us.",4,2019,06,01
229,North of the Liffey Gem,"Arrived after long overnight flight from the US and were ecstatic that even in mid morning our room was ready. The hotel is a lovely, older establishment filled with art on the walls and antiques. Beyond the reception area are several lounges that invite you to sit and relax after a long day of traveling. Our room was small but cozy and a nice surprise was a hair dryer so that my ""bed head"" from the long flight could be tamed. The location is ideal--out the front door, one turn to the left, and you are walking down O'Connell Street, the major artery of downtown Dublin. The hotel is located across from the Garden of Remembrance and the Writers' Museum. Every staff member we met greeted us warmly and were so helpful. The breakfast in the hotel dining room was outstanding--you could go the full Irish breakfast route or go lighter with yogurt, fruit and cereal. And this Starbucks addict can attest that the coffee was very good! Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend to others traveling to Dublin. We certainly plan on making a return visit here!",5,2019,05,31

229,Doesn’t appreciate the needs of long-distance travelers,"We arrived at the hotel, exhausted following our long overnight flight. Greeted nicely, and hotel has a lift, but no mention that every level of the hotel has stairs in the hallways to haul your luggage up and down while sleep-deprived. No USB ports and when asked for AC adaptor, will direct you to a hardware store. Sad. No tissues in room, and when asked for them, they will direct you to supermarket. One old-fashioned key with huge fob per room; they assume you and your partner are joined at the hip. Shower in our tiny room is smaller than that found on a cruise ship. Do not accept any room looking over the patio: noisy and smoky days and nights. Bed mattress was more like a hammock. Restaurant has great food.",3,2019,05,30
229,Hen Do,"We stayed here over the weekend. The hotel staff were friendly, front of house, restaurant staff, house keepers and bar staff. The evening entertainment was live music , the bar had a 'nice feel'. I only ate breakfast here, which was good and had a lot of variety. The hotel overall had a 'homely,  family run feel' , which I liked.  The hotel was located within a short walk to local bars, shops and restaurants, very  good location. 
The rooms were clean and spacious,  at times far too warm, but once the windows were open , that helped. Had to leave them open 24-7 (can't imagine what it would be like in the heart of summer). 

Overall,  a good experience  .",4,2019,05,29

229,Ok if you know what to expect,"If you know what you are getting into it will be ok, its a very old hotel, creaks everywhere, no air conditioning, and very noisy if you have to open your window as it faces a busy street. It’s very hard to find your room (a maze of doors and stairs) , and there is very limited parking in the back , staff will bring up your bags for you.  Family rooms are rather small, but they have four single beds that are comfortable and the rooms were very clean.  The place does have a certain charm and I think they go out of their way to assist you with good customer service. The restaurant for breakfast is very nice and service great even though they get very busy.  Location is great and you can walk into Dublin centre very easily.  The area seemed safe, and fully of tourists. And its  less expensive than some of the other hotels.  ",3,2019,05,21
229,Nice Hotel; Great Staff,"This is a good hotel with a few negatives but the positives definitely outweigh them.

Positives:
15 min walk to the River Liffey
On historic O'Connell street
Near the tram line and Connolly Station
Fantastic staff - helpful, cheerful and friendly.
Clean, comfortable rooms with modern bathrooms
Good restaurant and pub
Historic - oldest hotel in Dublin created from a series of Georgian homes

Negatives
The breakfast area is very hectic and not a pleasant way to start your day. Although the food is okay and the selection excellent, it is over-crowded, noisy and intrusive.
There appears to be a lot of tour groups staying at the hotel

Overall, a great hotel and a big thanks to all the staff!",4,2019,05,16

I highly recommend this hotel. ,5,2019,05,12
229,Afternoon Tea made all the better by lovely staff,"Myself and a friend went for afternoon tea  at the Castle Hotel on a rainy afternoon in Dublin. The staff we dealt with (Camelia and a new staff member from Croatia ) were exemplary in how they dealt with this.  They were both attentive, friendly, and extremely helpful.  We were asked on a number of occasions if we needed anything like extra  tea/coffee. The afternoon tea itself was lovely -beautiful sweet and savoury items included and everything very freshly made.  The room we were in was very nicely decorated and we had a large window seat to watch the world outside .  Very happy customers and all down to the staff going the extra mile ...Thank you

229,Nice Hotel well located for Dublin Centre ,"We stayed at this Geogian Hotel for two nights with the centre of Dublin in easy walking distance.
Hotel is old with lots of character. Staff are friendly and very helpful. Lots of little lobby lounges, stairs and corridors. Our room was dated with no heating or extract fan in en-suite. Breakfast in the Old Music Shop Cafe is a very good way to start your day.",4,2019,05,08
229,"Great Value, Great Staff","A no-frills hotel in the very best sense.  The room was of a good size, the bed was big and comfortable and the linens and towels were good.  It was hot and a bit stuffy, though, and this might be a problem in the summer where it is hot outside too.

The buffet breakfasts kept us going through days of busy tourism.  I am reviewing the restaurant separately but it was the best (and cheapest) of our three Dublin dinners.

By far the best thing about the hotel is the friendly and helpful staff -  as good as any hotel we have stayed in.  Every time, there was an easy, informal charm  and a willingness and ability to inform or help.  

And it was a fantastic bargain for a city centre hotel.",5,2019,05,07
229,"Great location, staff, ambience!","Spent a week here recently on our first trip to Dublin and could not have been more pleased. The Castle offers so many amenities. The space: converted Edwardian town houses was charming and very clean. The location: right around the corner from O' Connel street, with shops and stops for tour busses and the Garden of Remembrance and The GPO for history. The Liffey and the Joyce House are a 5 minute walk. The staff: always charming, friendly and helpful. The food: FREE full breakfast, and they don't scrimp, always delicious. Had 2 full dinners there as well, also awesome, with exceptional service from our server, Camelia. The Vaults: cozy bar downstairs, with free live music. I could go on. Highly recommended.",5,2019,05,04

229,Excellent Stay,"Very friendly and helpful staff. Convenient location - close to everything in Dublin, but a little away from the busy areas. Restaurant and Vault Bar were excellent - the menu had a good selection and the food was very good. A great place to eat, drink and unwind at night after seeing the sights, and the live entertainment was enjoyable. Not a breakfast person, but they offered a nice full, hot breakfast to start the day, with many choices (eggs, bacon, cereal, home fries, etc.).  We actually met the owner and he spent some time filling us in on the history of the hotel, Ireland and his background.  As mentioned earlier the staff was excellent.",5,2019,04,27
229,Underwhelming,"The room was spacious but the bathroom was quite pokey. Downstairs there are a lot of fairly grand looking communal sitting rooms filled with sofas and ornaments, but the room in comparison was quite basic and dated looking, for example mismatched carpet, cracked and damaged plaster, damaged old drawers.The bathroom sink also took an age to drain. I assume our room hadn't been renovated as some others have been. The WiFi was non-existent - honestly, totally useless and we had to rely on WiFi when we went out instead. Breakfast was ok (cheap and basic) but pretty poor if you're veggie or vegan, I tried eating it on the first morning, on the second morning I just ate fruit and on day 3, I didn't even bother going down to the restaurant.",3,2019,04,26
229,Excellent Choice,"If you are traveling under a budget, this is your place. Well located in Central Dublin, close to bus stop and  close to the Green and Red line. 

This is a Bed and Breakfast hotel that also have a restaurant and a bar with live music every night. If you are a solo traveler, this hotel is perfect for you. 

Excellent customer service and the food is delicious.",5,2019,04,25
229,THANK YOU!  ,"I have stayed here for years!  I even know the other “regulars”!   I appreciate the staff, they call me by name now!  I truly thank Emmett, whom assisted me with my luggage since I have a “bad knee”!  I appreciate the management, the people in the Old Music Room, the Castle Vaults, etc.  Even “Sarah”!  You make me feel at home!  I love the Castle and the people!  I am always “at home”!  I could never get the friendly help and assistance anyplace else!  I personally want to take everyone who works there and recalls my yearly stays!  You are my true home!  I respect everyone there!  Management to cook!  Thanks for always making me “home”!  ",5,2019,04,25
229,A grand stay!,"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights, celebrating a friends birthday. Having stayed in Dublin twice before I was impressed with the value for money at the Castle Hotel! Just a short walk from the air-link stop and an easy walk to O’Connell Street and Temple Bar - top location. Our room was small but pleasant and very clean. The hotel is comfortable and full of character. It has a nice simple charm about it. The bar in the cellar is fantastic! They had live music each night of our stay and an Irish dancer. Wonderful! The drinks were reasonably priced and the atmosphere truly Irish! Breakfast was also excellent, a variety of options and all included in the room tariff. An excellent stay, we would certainly return!",4,2019,04,22
229,3 days in Dublin🍀,A wonderful location and amazing service is what you get when you stay in the Castle. As soon as we arrived we were greeted by a warm welcome by the reception staff. The room was spacious and comfortable. All the main tourist hotspots are a short walk away which was exactly what we wanted. Would definitely stay here again and the breakfast was absolutely on point.,5,2019,04,20
229,Lovely Stay,Traveling with family. My son and I really enjoyed our room. The hotel is a mixture of houses joined together and we were in a courtyard room that was an apartment. Excellent and comfortable. We did crack the windows to cool the space in the evenings. ,4,2019,04,16
229,Nice hotel with great location to downtown Dublin,"Neat, clean rooms.  Helpful desk clerks.  Extensive breakfast options.  Very good restaurant for dinner.
Easy walking distance to downtown Dublin.  On and off bus stops nearby for those who don't want to walk.  Rooms overlooking the street can be a bit noisy.",4,2019,04,15
229,Great hotel. Very friendly and welcoming staff.,The Castle Hotel was a brilliant base for our first trip to Dublin. The staff were very welcoming and the hotel had everything we needed. Room was very clean - the staff had even decorated it with balloons and a birthday card for my husband's birthday. The choice of food at breakfast was very good too. My husband was unfortunately taken unwell during our stay and the staff were very helpful in getting us quick medical attention. We were very grateful. All in all we would thoroughly recommend this hotel for a visit to the wonderful city of Dublin.,5,2019,04,15
229,Great Hotel for Dublin Trip!,"I stayed in this hotel in 2018 for 3 nights with 2 other couples. It was a great base hotel with short walks to the city center. The hotel itself is stunning and had a little bar in the underground. The bar was lovely and was a great starting place to start drinking! 
Would definitely recommend!!!",5,2019,04,15
229,Great Place for Home Base,"We stayed at the Castle Hotel, a converted Georgian mansion, for five nights. We selected it for price and proximity to O'Connell Street where tours begin. It is a five minute walk from the 747 Airport Express bus stop.

We requested a quiet room away from the bar and street. We were placed on the top floor with an elevator available if you did not want the stairs. The room was comfortable with a temperamental heater. The water pressure for the shower was poor but plenty of hot water.  Tea/coffee service in the room was used daily. 

We are the provided full Irish breakfast daily. Eggs, bacon and sausage, potatoes, beans, tomatoes,  mushrooms plus you have to try the black and white pudding. Fresh fruit, yogurt, cereal and pastries complete the offering. Best to eat in the 7:00-8:00 time slot. Great service.  We also had one dinner in the Vault. We recommend the fish and chips and the goat cheese and fig salad. Don't forget the caramel covered brownie and a cup of Irish coffee.

There are fancier places and cheaper options as well but we enjoyed our stay. Close to lots of other food and drink options on Upper O'Connell Street. It was a pleasure to meet the hotel owner upon arrival. ",4,2019,04,13
229,Frustrating and noisy,"· The building was beautiful and characterful.
 · When we arrived at our room there was a few issues, firstly the toilet didn’t flush properly the sink plug didn’t work and the shower light wasn’t working either. We raised these issues with reception staff they assured us that someone would look at the issues and get them sorted. We collected our key a short while later to be told “if you push the button on the other side for a bit it will flush” and then rest will be sorted by maintenance in the morning. Next day came and it wasn’t sorted nor was we informed about what was actually happening. Also the walls between the rooms were shockingly thin we could hear the people in the room next to us putting their clothes in the wardrobe and the room above us well we thought they was coming through the ceiling the floor boards were ridiculously creaky now we know it’s an old building but it just topped us other the edge. There was no apology for these issues no offer to switch rooms and for over £125 a night we expected better. We wouldn’t stay again unfortunately which is a shame as the food entertainment and building it’s self it good",2,2019,04,13
229,Nice hotel in the centre of Dublin,"This hotel is three star and it's exactly that a nice clean friendly hotel with plenty of little alcoves to sit in and it's own bars and restaurants. You even get a free drink in the bar it's all great!

Well it was till our last morning when we arrived for breakfast. We were shown to a table ordered tea and coffee which arrived and got ourselves a fruit juice. Then we went to get our cooked breakfast from the buffet.

As we arrived back they were just finishing clearing our table all the coffee tea fruit juice plates and cutlery gone. We found someone who got us some cutlery. But made no attempt to replenish our drinks. 

We had to then stop someone else to ask for tea and coffee this time we were given extremely small pots maybe they were trying to tell us something?

I then went to the buffet to get a slice of toast they kindly said they would do some fresh and bring it to the table. Well it never arrived and I suspect if my family hadn't rushed me out the door to go sightseeing I'd still be sat there now.

It's such a shame it was a very enjoyable stay but after this I think next time in Dublin I'll stay somewhere else.",3,2019,04,12
229,Great restaurant,We stumbled upon this hotel for dinner per a recommendation from someone we met earlier in Dublin. He said it had great food and spectacular service--he wasn't wrong! We had great Guinness stews and the atmosphere was perfect for a quiet dinner after a long day of exploring the city. The owner even came to our table to personally introduce himself--definitely recommend this place.,5,2019,04,11
229,Best lodging,"Hotel was fun and quirky. Absolutely loved it. Best staff ever. Concierges were so helpful and accommodating and the Bartenders & Wait staff(Tino, David & Shannon)were amazing. Loved them all. Cant wait to go back.",5,2019,04,10
229,"An excellent hotel, wonderful staff and the Patron, Finn, was delightful with a warm philosophy, re his hotel and his s","All facilities were excellent.  However, as I was with a very large party (50th birthday) scattered throughout Dublin, I was unable to use the restaurant or bar apart from breakfast and a late night drink in the bar, which was hosting, what seems to be the norm in Dublin, live music.
Many thanks Finn (apologies for not asking how to spell your name)

229,"Vacation, St Pats day",The Castle Hotel is an excellant place to stay.The staff and manager were very helpfull with any questions or help that I needed. Room was very clean.The staff in the restauant was very nice and made us feel right at home. The valt pub was great with live music every night and the the bartender was right on top of drinks.Overall I will be going back to the Castle Hotel next year. Thanks to all at the Hotel,5,2019,04,01
229,Great Hotel,Stayed 8 nights  over St Pattrick weekend and it was excellent.Hotel was near the main streets and just a walk from tram.Room was good and had tea making facilities which is a bonus/Breakfast was excellent and the staff more than helpful.Would defininately recommend this lovely friendly hotel,5,2019,03,31
229,Afternoon Tea  Experience a delight,"I have been to the Music shop restauant a few times when in dublin for a tea or a coffee. I saw an offer on pigsback for afternoon tea a few weeks back. On heading to Dublin one day to see my sister, I remembered the afternoon tea offer and phoned the hotel first to see if they had availablity for that same day. They accomodated us with a timeslot so I purchased the offer for €22 in Pigsback. The experience was lovely and the teapot was very big so plenry of tea. They even refilled it with more hot water.  Selection of teas, sandwiches, and sweet desert selections for each person.  Staff were friendly and professional.",5,2019,03,31
229,All-Round Good Choice,"We were fortunate in getting a room very close to reception and on the ground floor, which meant that (a) we were unaware of the size of the place and it felt like a boutique hotel and (b) it being a Georgian property we benefited from a high ceiling which made our already spacious room seem enormous. The bed was comfortable, the decor pleasantly chintzy and storage space was ample. A bit more pressure from the shower would have been welcome, but you can't have everything...

We hadn't intended to dine here, but on exploring the hotel we came across the vaulted cellar which was the dining room and decided that we would book a table. The food was fine and not expensive by Dublin standards and as we finished our meal a very good musician started up playing traditional Irish music in the adjacent bar, so we remained for a couple of drinks as well. 

Only when we went down to the crowded breakfast room did we realise the size of the hotel (147 rooms!), but the excellent breakfast buffet coped admirably with the numbers. 

Just off O'Connell Street, less than 1 km from the Liffey and three minutes from the bus-stop to the Airport: we would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,03,28
229,"Great Location, Friendly staff, decent rooms","This is an older hotel, so the rooms are a bit on the smaller side. The hotel staff was great during the entire stay. The breakfast was tasty and had a good variety. My only complaint was the noise from the neighboring rooms.",4,2019,03,27
229,"Dublin, Ireland trip","Castle Hotel is a great hotel. Great location, staff very frieyand accommodating, walking distance to O’Connell St.  Loved the old Victorian style of the hotel. My room was cute, quiet, and clean. Free continental breakfast is a plus. ",5,2019,03,23
229,4th time......and we'll be back! ,"We stayed at the Castle Hotel 14-16th March. We were on the 3rd floor room 334.
Room was spacious enough and clean, beds comfortable. Hairdryer there, and a shower (which did drip alot) amenities good enough for our purpose.
The Castle hotel is an ideal base to explore Dublin just a short walk to O'Connell Street. 
Staff very friendly and helpful absolutely could not fault them. We had to return home two days early due to unforeseen circumstances and all of the staff were most helpful and supportive during this difficult time.
We plan to return in 2022, would definitely recommend.",5,2019,03,19
229,Great Hotel,"We loved this hotel. From the minute we walked through the door we were made so welcome. The hotel has an unique character and elegance of a bygone age but with all the modern additions a modern traveller has come to expect. Our room was very clean and our beds were comfortable. Despite being so close to O’Connell Street our room was quiet so we were able to get a good nights sleep.
When we arrived we were very tired, as our flight had been delayed by over three hours. The owner Fionn, was very quick to ensured the kitchens knew we had only just arrived and stayed open so we could get something to eat. The food was delicious. After eating in the hotel any other food we ate out seemed second rate. Even when we decided to have a sandwich in the hotel, it exceeded our expectations. In the evening, we ate in the Vault so we were able to enjoy the musical entertainment. The entertainment we really good and if you want to eat there I would recommend you book a table so as not to be disappointed.
There was a good choice of food at breakfast setting us up for our sightseeing during the day. The hotel is in a good location for sightseeing. There is so much to see and do in Dublin we quickly decided we would need to come back again.
When we return, we will definitely be returning to the Castle hotel. This hotel is so much better than the bland corporate hotels which have flooded the market. The owner Fionn has a passion about his hotel and cares about people. His staff reflect this.",5,2019,03,18
229,Irish Gem,"What a darling place to stay! From check-in to check-out our stay at the Castle Hotel was wonderful! Thank you to the front desk staff Laura, Kiara and Emmet!

The room was very comfortable and the water pressure was great (nice and hot, too!) The beds were comfortable and loved having the USB plugs to make it so easy to charge phones. 

The free breakfast was great! Thank you David for making my gluten free toast each morning! So appreciate you taking the time to change gloves to avoid any cross contamination. Thanks for the gluten free choices! 

The Vault Restaurant is such a neat room! The Beef & Guinness Stew was delicious! The service was great and the Irish folk singer Paddy Brown made our first night in Dublin a sweet start!

Great location and easy to get around  to about all you want to do! Loved having shopping and a Teso's near by.",5,2019,03,16
229,Bitter Memory,"I stayed at this dwelling in August 2018. The experience was so upsetting to me that I just wanted to try and forget it all. But I think I should write a review to help others avoid what happened to me. I traveled alone from Boston to Dublin to attend a religious event. I am a middle aged lady, just an old fuddy duddy. I had been saving for this trip for 6 months. My flight was an overnight one, and I had a connection in Iceland at 5 in the morning which was delayed for hours. I was exceedingly exhausted by the time I arrived in Dublin. Those of you who travel know what one endures, so I won't go on. When I finally arrived at this property it wasn't check in time. So I wandered about Dublin in the rain. I was so, so tired!!!! I bought some beer to bring back to the room to help me sleep. From experience I know the time change can make it tough to sleep even if you are beyond exhausted.  Now the room was ready. I should have stayed out in the rain. This room, this filthy cramped room, was at the top of a labyrinth of hallways and staircases. I entered and saw a threadbare dirty carpet, walls which were scraped and damaged, a filthy bathroom which had mold on the walls and thick dust was blanketed everywhere. I was so darn tired I just wanted to down a couple beers and figure out what to do tomorrow. I needed ice, so I went out into this funhouse, down stairs up hallways, up more stairs..nope dead end, down hallway again, up stairs (I am not exaggerating) I finally found the front desk, help I cried... They thought I was looney. I was just very tired, and had been flying and stranded in Iceland, and left out in the rain, Anyway, I got back after much ado over the stupid ice. I got in the bed, sheets were dirty with bodily fluid stains! Called front desk, they weren't at all happy with this. They treated me as such a nuisance, some crackpot American. Well, they informed me the room was perfectly clean, and I would not get a refund!! What refund I said?? All I want are sheets that are clean, for some crazy reason I can't sleep on dried semen. They sent a member of their staff to the room. She stood with the most hateful and sour expression while I pointed out the VARIOUS filthy areas. She glared at the beer cans obviously trying to make me feel as I was some unruly drunkard. When I travel ANYWHERE I am extremely well mannered as I feel I am a guest there, and I wish to make a good impression. So I was very nice, and just wanted these problems to be addressed, they on the other hand were not. I managed to find a lovely hotel on the other side of Dublin, but this horrid experience really ruined the trip for me. My mother's family came from Ireland to the US and I am so thankful they did. I will never return to Ireland again, this is how cruel those people at The Castle were to me. They must have many unsavory guests to be so distrustful, I WAS NOT looking for a freebie, why on earth would I go to all the trouble of traveling all the way to Dublin to save a couple hundred bucks, it's absurd. I spent that on souvenirs while waiting for the room to be ready. All I wanted was a clean place to rest, I was hoping for a beautiful memory and it was dashed to bits by heartless people.",1,2019,03,16
229,Trip to Dublin,"Lovely, quaint hotel - Ideally situated for a base to travel out and about from. Staff friendly, helpful and always with a smile. Breakfast great, buffet style and more than enough variety to suit all tastes. Vault bar a unique experience food great and the Guinness just as it should be!! Definitely recommended and we will visit again. Sally Smith and Jackie Elliott",5,2019,03,15
229,"Great stay in cosy, quaint hotel! ","Myself and my boyfriend recently visited Dublin for the first time for a sightseeing trip and chose the Castle Hotel for our stay. It is ideally situated for sightseeing, being only a few minutes walk from O’Connell Street, and about a 10 minute walk from the bridge over the Liffey, taking you to the Temple Bar and Trinity College areas. 
We got the Airlink 747 bus from the airport, which stops on O’Connell Street. The bus only cost €7 each. The Castle Hotel is the oldest hotel in Dublin, a Georgian townhouse and so full of character! It’s full of beautiful historical curios and interesting bits and pieces such as lovely china cabinets, paintings, grandfather clocks and a gramophone. Just walking from our room to the breakfast restaurant was fascinating as we’d notice something different every time! 
Our room was a good size and had a nice tv. Free Wi-fi is available, along with complimentary teas/coffees and a hairdryer. The bathroom was fine and the towels were thick, and a really good size, which you don’t always find in hotels! There was a gym in the basement, which I had great intentions of using while there, but I didn’t get up early enough in the morning! There are two restaurants, one of which being the Old Music Shop, which is also used for breakfast from 7-10.  A large variety of continental or cooked breakfasts are on offer, and we really enjoyed them. The other restaurant is the Castle Vaults in the basement, which we ate in on our last night, it was very good and you get a voucher entitling you to a complimentary wine, beer or Irish coffee. 
The Castle Hotel made a nice change from the usual bland, soulless hotel chains you get with dull brown decor and rows and rows of corridors. I would definitely stay here again! ",5,2019,03,09
229,"Warm, Cozy Hotel","This hotel is well located, equidistant from Botanic Garden and St. Pats Cathedral. As noted, it's a Landmark, family operated hotel and has lots of cozy nooks and crannies. There is an elevator, but I enjoyed the stairs. My first room had a nosy  radiator, they moved me to another room that was spacious, warm and quiet. The rooms vary considerably because of the age of the hotel and time of renovation. But the bathrooms were modern and clean.  TV had more options than any other hotel I have stayed in on my travels throughout Ireland. The breakfast met the average travelers needs and started refreshingly early (7am!) but I wish they had fresh fruit and higher quality baked goods...which are in abundance throughout Ireland. The 16 Bus from the airport drops you almost directly in front for 3€. I would use this hotel again - its a great value and is a great quiet place to return to at the end of a long day exploring Dublin. ",4,2019,03,08
229,lovely hotel and weekend in Dublin,"Lovely hotel nice and clean, staff very friendly. Breakfast very good nice variety. One night had dinner in the Vault one complimentary free drink per person,very nice food also live music and also one night a young lady doing irish dancing. Thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2019,03,06
229,Afternoon Tea,"What a treat !!  Brought our 88 yrs young mother for afternoon tea and it was fabulous.  She really enjoyed it. Staff were so nice.  Food was really excellent.  Dainty sandwiches, scones and mini pastries. So good, we are going back to celebrate her 89th birthday at the end of March ! Well worth a visit.  ",5,2019,03,04
229,"Clean hotel, friendly staff, great location!","This hotel is great. From the moment we arrived, the staff were extremely hospitable and friendly. We got chatting to Fiann (hoping I have spelled that correctly!!) upon check-in, who arranged for us to receive a free dinner and drink courtesy of the hotel restaurant for my boyfriend's birthday - such a friendly gesture and it was very much appreciated. Similarly, when we arrived back at our room the next evening, there was a card, balloons and a happy birthday banner on the bed. It was such a lovely touch!
Unfortunately there had been an issue with our booking between Booking.com and the hotel, and so they weren't expecting us to arrive when we did, however they popped us in a room straight away and told us to pay over the weekend when suitable as they had to sort the booking out on the system. They were apologetic and told us not to worry, whereas they could have easily have resented us for the systematic error (it was 10pm on a Thursday evening, and no doubt wanted to get home!). 
The hotel was clean, authentic, and the breakfast was great. Location couldn't have been better, as not only was it less than 15 minutes walk to Temple Bar, it was also just a few hundred yards from the Airlink Express stops. 
I would have absolutely no issues with recommending this hotel to anyone who wants to visit Dublin.",5,2019,03,04
229,Don’t miss out on Dublin hospitality,"Anyone looking for a soulless experience of a hotel that could be anywhere in the world should avoid coming to a place that prides itself on individual charm and hospitality 

All the staff without exception - housekeeping included- could not have been more helpful or courteous in making our stay extremely comfortable and memorable 

The icing on the cake was the bar in the basement- the vault- where the bar staff have X-ray vision to tell exactly when a glass needs refilling- special credit to Eoin for this- and the live music entertainment that is a great way to send you off to bed, or for some people start the night off as intended

The owner introduced himself one evening with a wistful charm and clearly takes great pride in his team",5,2019,03,03
229,"Authentic, wear and tear, hotel with heart.","Some local history attached to this charming hotel. Irish nightlife available right under your feet. I didn't feel as if the ambiance was forced in any way or stereotyped for the tourist market. Staff were friendly and accommodating. Location provided easy access to O,Connell St and all it has to offer and within walking distance. Well priced if you you like character in a building rather than minimalist perfection.",5,2019,03,02
229,Gorgeous georgian hotel,"Set in a fantastic location walking distance from shops, museums, the river and irish nightlife! 
Amazing breakfasts and delicious steak dinner
Only 10 mins taxi from the airport

Dublin is so easy to explore",5,2019,03,01
229,Very nice hotel,"Great hotel, well positioned just off O’Connell upper street. Nice bar, great beer choice and with live music.
Breakfasts excellent and freshly cooked.
Free WiFi.
Only negative was different meal deal pricing between  website, information given at check in and the restaurant menu.
To be fair the staff were great and honoured the lower price.",5,2019,02,26
229,great hotel and service yummy breakfast!,"very pleased with the service at this hotel- was greeted nicely on our way in, managed to move rooms to the other side of the building as it was very noisy on the main road side. what I will say is the rooms are very different depending on which side of the building you are on-  our first room was very small, nice bathroom but very different to our 2nd room which had a big bathroom with a spacious shower. the bed was also bigger in our 2nd room. breakfast is fantastic apart from the fact they don't have any hash browns. the seating area is clean and a nice atmosphere. glad we came to this hotel as it was near everything and we paid a good price for this hotel, we learnt about the history of it and got some nice photos on their quirky chairs.",4,2019,02,25
229,Brilliant!,"A very spacious, clean and comfortable room. Great location for visiting Dublin. The breakfast was nice. Most of all, the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. We were able to store our luggage and have any questions answered. Would highly recommend anyone visiting Dublin to stay here.",5,2019,02,24
229,Second visit,"I stayed in this hotel in 2017 and on this my second visit I was delighted to say that the standard of welcome, cleanliness of the rooms, was still extremely high. Such a great position for exploring Dublin, the staff are great and cannot do enough for their guests. Reasonable priced , great breakfast, visit the cellar bar for dinner, what an atmosphere with some good Irish music thrown in.....thanks to all for the Irish welcome.",5,2019,02,24
229,Excellent! ,"We stayed at the Castle Hotel for Valentines Day and could not have been happier with our choice! 

We arrived in Dublin at 7.40am, caught the bus to the Hotel and upon our arrival (around 8.40am) were told we could check in straight away as they had the room ready for us! I have never experienced this before! 

The staff were very friendly and helpful. 

We stayed 3 nights, bed was comfortable and the room was huge, clean and the maid went in every day to clean and replenish. They also changed the bed whilst we were there. 

The hotel is about a mile outside the centre of Dublin, but located in a lovely area, with lots to see around. 

We had a Valentines meal in the hotel which was great. Breakfast was similar. A lot of choice and enough for even the fussiest of eaters.

We only had a drink in the bar downstairs one night, but again, the staff were very friendly and brought the drinks over to you. 

Can’t fault this hotel and we will definitely be back ",5,2019,02,21
229,Nice hotel conviniently placed!,"Very friendly staff. The hotel was very quaint, tastefully decorated with some creeking floor boards.  The room was very big, the bed definitely comfortable, and the bathroom not huge but very practical.  The breakfast was very comprehensive, with buffet to start with and then cooked breakfast with several options.  The staff was very efficient.  The Castle Vaults offered a good dinner in the evening with music from 9 to 11 every night.  This was ideal after a whole day visiting the city as it meant you did not have too far to walk to your room after a little drink.",4,2019,02,21
229,A warm welcome awaits,"Stayed here from Friday 8 February until 10 February 2019. We arrived very early but the young man on the reception desk was more than helpful and let us park our bags in the luggage room, He gave us an overview of the history of the hotel and a map of Dublin pointing out places of interest, most within walking distance.
When we returned at check in time we were shown to our rooms which were huge, very warm, clean and comfortable and well designed - a mirror, dressing table and plug socket all aligned.
We had our evening meal in the Vaults restaurant - we were a party of 6 with varying dietary requirements. There were plenty of choices for all of us and the staff who looked after us were so friendly and welcoming and made our evening so enjoyable.
The entertainment in the bar was super - a great singer and a fabulous Irish dancer. 
Great choice at breakfast  - again something for everyone (vegan and gluten free)
The hotel is beautifully decorated with plenty of space to relax and read the newspapers etc.
We were there to celebrate my birthday and the friendliness of the hotel staff made it so special,great birthday cocktails on each evening.
We will definitely be returning.",5,2019,02,18
229,"Most happy, friendly, wonderful people","We have now been there 5 times since 2013 and we still find it consistantly friendly warm and great entertainment nightly and great food , wonderful breakfast. Atmosphere and location very good. We are looking forward to our next stay there.",5,2019,02,18
229,Week-end stay,"Stayed here from Friday 8 February until Sunday 10 February, arrived well before check-in time(7.30 am), no problem for the really friendly reception staff, who let us pit our bags in the baggage room, leaving us to explore Dublin until check-in time.

The rooms were very nicely presented, very clean, plenty of tea and coffee available in the room, along with  a welcome chocolate on the pillow.

We had our evening meal in the Vaults, very good food at very reasonable price, all finished off with a Gaelic coffee, courtesy of the voucher from the hotel.

Our servers were very good, and very funny, they created a great atmosphere down there, as well as the singer, and the Irish dancer, who must have had an awful shock when my sister was ''volunteered'' to learn a dance with her.

Breakfast was good and hot, and plenty of cereal, yoghurts, etc, if you wanted them, soda bread was divine.

All in all a great stay, and much to recommend, particularly the close proximity to O'Connell Street.

Would most certainly stay here again.",5,2019,02,15
229,"Interesting historic hotel, but looking a bit rough/worn","Our stay at the Castle was fine, not great, not terrible.  It is a bit outside the real city center.  Staff were nice, breakfast buffet was good.  Pub downstairs was dark & not cozy or inviting.  We went down to check it out & get a pint after checking in (late afternoon).  They were open but we were the only customers & no one came to help us so we left & found a pub down the street.  The room was pretty good.  A bit noisy since it faced the street.  Beds were comfy.  Bathroom could use updating.  There is an AirLink bus stop nearby and the Hop on Hop off bus also stops at the same place.",3,2019,02,12
229,Great staff and amazing location!,"I absolutely loved my stay at Castle Hotel. As a solo female traveler, it was import. That I feel safe and comfortable for the week that I visited. The only drawback of the hotel for me was the slight hill from the majn drag to the hotel but that’s only because I’m asthmatic. It was still extremely convenient and walkable- even in the rain and show!

The staff were super friendly and helpful every single day! The breakfast was great- there’s a big selection and it was never too crowded when I went. The hotel is so cute and charming and the rooms were very well equipped.

My room overlooked O’Connell Street but there wasn’t much street noise until later in the morning. The hotel is quite old so the floors creak and groan a lot but it was never enough to wake me up when I was sleeping. 

A huge thank you to Castle Hotel and it’s staff for making my accommodations on this trip so relaxing and enjoyable!",5,2019,02,04
229,a warm welcome," was a wonderful surprise as it didn't look big from the outside but was like a luxurious tardis inside. Luxurious furnishings a warm welcome really comfortable beds and great entertainment in the bar oh and a sumptuous breakfast all at such a reasonable rate just wished we had stayed longer would recommend this hotel also for its prominent location.",5,2019,02,03
229,City break,"First class hotel rooms very clean and comfortable, food very good , staff very helpful can’t do enough for you they go that little bit extra to help highly recommend and close to the centre and all bus routes",5,2019,02,03
229,Great location and friendly staff,"This was my second stay at the Castle Hotel, one of the oldest hotels in Dublin which suits my interest in history very well! It is full of character and elegance and has a friendly 'small hotel' feel to it. It is in a very good location, easy walking to many attractions and transport. As a female solo traveller I always felt very safe. Although an old building the facilities are modern - the rooms are very comfortable and clean, and breakfast is generous. I'll definitely be back.",5,2019,02,03
229,Cosy old-worldly place very close to city center,"Lovely hotel, very old-wordly and walking distance from O'Connell street and all the bars and shops. Apparently one of the oldest hotels in Dublin, it has reasonable sized rooms and creaky stairs in a stairwell but also an elevator. (you don't hear the stairs from the rooms though). 
Room is basic, but considering Dublin is one of the more expensive cities in the town it's still very decent value for money with private parking and a fabulously generous breakfast.",5,2019,01,30
229,Beautiful hotel with fantastic staff!,"I've been coming to Ireland now since 2016 and whenever I come to Dublin I always stay at this beautiful, friendly and spotless hotel that has very friendly and helpful staff. My most recent visit to Dublin was in January 2019 and as always I was greeted by the fantastic reception staff who are always happy to help and deliver a great customer service. My room was spotless and clean and the breakfast was absolutely outstanding!  The hotel itself is well positioned as it it within walking distance to O'Connell Street and Temple Bar, and is a 25-30 minutes away from Dublin Airport. A fantastic hotel and one I would highly recommend! Can't wait to visit again soon! 

Thank you

Ben",5,2019,01,26
229,Enjoyable stay!,"Centrally located, Castle Hotel is one of the oldest in Dublin! Rooms were recently renovated and really, really clean - the bathroom especially! Breakfast was OK with a variety of choices that would satisfy most. I would definitely recommend it!",4,2019,01,26
229,A magical place,"My friend and I came to this wonderful hotel for a 4 day break. The breakfast was excellent, the dinner in the restaurant first class, the bedrooms and public rooms charming and beautiful. But the ace in the deck is the staff and their fabulous service. Friendly, welcoming, sweet, helpful, knowledgeable, nothing but nothing was too much trouble for them. And with smiles the whole time. Niamh one, Niamh two, Leah, David, sorry I can’t remember all the names. Fantastic. ",5,2018,12,09
229,What an amazing place,"The castle is worth every penny 
The staff where always smiling
The rooms where clean and large
The breakfast was of a good quality can not be faulted
Quality craft beers at bar and Guinness of a good standard
I now tried them all 
We will be back in summer 
We done to all from cleaners to top managers
15min walk to temple bar on need to bus ,cab or drive",5,2018,12,07
229,Amazing value!,"The reviews are true-- this is better than your average 3-star hotel, in my opinion. The room and washroom were extremely clean and well kept. The hotel overall was very nice with very helpful, kind staff. The included breakfast every morning was nice with a good selection and there were no lines this time of year. 

At the airport, someone from the tourist board asked me some questions about my stay and commented on how the nightly price was pretty cheap for Dublin. Still, you'd never know it! The value for this hotel is incredible. I loved staying here and would absolutely come back and for longer.",5,2018,12,06
229,Above and beyond,"Everything was above and beyond our expectations. Great service from the front office to the cleaning staff, quallity food served from breakfest to dinner, and most important part was that everything was impecable.

We loved our stay here, the owner is a sweet old man, who made a point of comming to meet his guests at least once per week, he was kind and asked us about our stay and about our home town. 

As for the room we had one problem with a tiny leak, but it was fixed immediatly by their staff, and another with the heater in the room, bur everything was fixed with efficiency.

Our room has great wifi connection, the bed was comfy, the sheets were changed out daily, the bathroom was impecable, towels changed daily if requsted.

To anyone looking to book a room, you can be sure that your money are well spent here.",5,2018,12,05
229,"Friendly, Welcoming and Comfortable","We booked this as a last minute trip and got a great deal on B&B. A lovely hotel, the rooms are on the small side, but the bathroom, particularly the large walk-in shower was lovely.
Very friendly staff with a 24hour reception desk. Situated at the top end of O'Connell Street, it is in a quieter area of Dublin but it only takes about 15 minutes to walk down to the Liffey and across to the city centre.
Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would recommend to anyone else visiting Dublin.",4,2018,12,05
229,Comfortable room and great staff.,We had a large  comfortable room for 5 people that was reasonably priced (especially with the full Irish Breakfast included). Close to the city center site that are walking distance. Staff were very helpful planning our days.  All staff were exceptional in making our first trip to Dublin memorable.,5,2018,12,02
229,Great trip,"I was very happy with my stay. The room was clean and comfortable and I enjoyed in particular the music in the bar in the evenings. The meal we had in the restaurant the first evening was decent with good VFM. If I had to be critical I could say that the quality of the breakfast could be improved; the full Irish is buffet-style rather than freshly prepared and the sausages and bacon used were not of the best quality. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the location is fairly central. On the whole I would recommend this hotel.",4,2018,11,29
229,comfy hotel with a 'visiting your grandmother' feel,my daughter and i spent last week here - all good! the hotel was originally 9 georgian homes so navigating within the hotel takes some practice. period architecture and victorian style furniture in the public spaces (there are many!) makes it feel like you're visiting your granny! bed very comfortable and i had a room in the interior - very quite and good for sleeping. the breakfast was very good and we never really had to wait to be seated even tho the hotel was full.  the main server is a very lovely man who teaches pole dancing in the hotel when he's not dishing out breakfast.  sure wish i knew that while we were there!,4,2018,11,28
229,A great hotel for a weekend,"Very comfortable and clean, warm, and close to O’Connell St. just in 5 min walk you can be in one of the city centre of Dublin: O’Connell St. full of shopping centres and restaurants, also 20min walk to the other city centre Grafton St. so it’s a very wise election if you don’t want to use the bus. 
The breakfast is very nice and with many food to choose, nice coffee and tea, and toasts, fruit, yoghurt, jam, etc, 
Also there’s a bar with live music, and a restaurant in the hotel. 
The room was very clean, comfortable and warm, with the heating on during the evening. 
Amenities in the toilet.
Would come back again",5,2018,11,27
229,Great Hotel,"Lovely Hotel, great rooms, clean, spacious, breakfast were lovely, castle vaults was fun, friendly staff, my only complaint is that the windows need to be double glazed as the traffic was noisy, but that’s the only fault, the location is spot on, 2 mins from town centre",5,2018,11,20
229,Good central base,"We requested a quiet room, high floor and our request was met so we were quite happy about that. Our room didnt overlook the road but an inner courtyard. It was quiet and it was only the low flying gulls that woke us in the morning! The hotel is situated at the top end of O’Connell St and the airlink bus from the airport stopped just a few minutes walk away. The room itself was a twin and fairly compact but it was fine for our 3 days in Dublin. The beds were very comfortable and we slept well. All of the hotel staff were helpful, efficient and friendly. The breakfasts were very filling and set us up for the day and we ate each evening in the Vaults and again the food was good and as it was the weekend there was live music and a display of Irish dancing. We enjoyed our stay at the Castle and loved Dublin and its people....such a beautiful city!",4,2018,11,19
229,Excellent Traditional Style Hotel in Good Location,"This is a really friendly hotel located near the north end of O'Connell Street, convenient for transport or a 10/15 minute walk to Temple Bar area. Clean rooms, comfortable beds and excellent bathrooms. The breakfasts are really good and served in a very nice restaurant and the staff are friendly and helpful. This is a lovely traditional style hotel with a personal style. Recommend a 100%. ",5,2018,11,19
229,A great basecamp,"Just spent 3 nights at the castle hotel, a great place nice room (we stayed in 211) lots of nice little rooms to chill out in. A great cellar bar a nice breakfast and a good evening  meal with a complimentary beer.  Good  music though a bit to loud. 
All in well recommended to a visitor to Dublin. Well done to all the staff for making our stay a nice one. ",5,2018,11,17
229,"Friendly, clean and quiet hotel","We were very pleased with the Castle Hotel! It was well kept, the staff was excellent and especially enjoyed the breakfast. Location was perfect for us, not noisy at all (except for few seaguls in the morning) and short walk to everything. Will come again!",4,2018,11,17
229,Loud and stuffy.,"The location of this property was fantastic only a few minutes walk from town, and right next to many bus stops.
The rooms were roomy and with plenty of space to put cloths however the building itself was very loud. With very nosie floor boards i was awoken when people moved about outside of the room. The windows were also usless in blocking the nosie from the busy room. 
There was also no heating control in the room and with most evernings it was very hot and stuffy meaning a window had to be opened and resulting in even more nosie from the road.
The hotle offered breakfast whch was lovely, however i did feel squeezed in when sat in the restrunt, despite getting up earlier to aviod hussle and bussle like recomended.",3,2018,11,13
229,Fab hotel and ideally placed for city break,"I am writing a review on the second time I have visited this particular hotel and both times I cannot speak highly enough of the place. The Castle is perfectly placed for a city break to Dublin and is just the right distance away from the city centre to enjoy a peaceful stay. The hotel itself is very clean, comfortable and good value for money. The staff are warm and friendly and greet with a smile at all times. The rooms are clean, beds comfy and bathroom spotless with walk in showers available. There is a TV in the room. However there are few channels available, which should not really matter as there is plenty to do in Dublin and the hotel as an excellent restaurant and a superb bar called the Castle Vault. The Castle will remain my go-to place whenever we return to Dublin.",5,2018,11,12
229,Great Hotel,Stayed here Aug 17 and Nov 18 for 2 concerts Great little hotel 15 mins from Croke Park 30 min walk from 3 Arena Great location at the top of O Connell St Bar and restaraunt 1st class Friendly staff Pay the extra and give it a try,5,2018,11,07
229,From a guest's perspective,"The Castle was a totally different experience, one I wouldn't wish to repeat any time.  The first night we arrived (Sept 12) very late so we just went straight to our room and crashed since we had to be up and at the train station by 6:45 am the next day.  We asked for the continental breakfast of toast and coffee.  What we got was soggy toast and no coffee.  Our return stay wasn't much better.  Again, we arrived late.  The room was so hot we had to open the windows which resulted in our hearing loud road noise and people yelling.  I went to the desk the next morning with my complaints (no wash cloths, MOLD in the shower) and the young lady there asked me if I wanted lighter blankets.  Even that wouldn't have helped it was so hot and uncomfortable.   A rather arrogant ""gentleman"" asked if we (my husband and me) would share a bed if he could locate a different room, to which I responded it would depend on the size of the bed.  He handed me a key and waved vaguely in front of him and told me to check out the room.  I spend half an hour looking for this room and then finally gave up and went back to the desk.  I told them I was lost, couldn't find the room to which he rudely replied ""I told you it was that way"".  The room he was offering had been closed for a while and recently renovated from the smell of it and smelled of glue or something that was so strong I couldn't even breathe in the few minutes I was in there.  It was so strong it wouldn't have cleared the air if they had left the door open for the day.  I'm afraid I was rude when I returned the key.  Unfortunately he wasn't at the reception desk to be the recipient of my rudeness.

Service at their bar (the only facility open by the time we returned from our tour) was less than stellar.  I would have thought it was closed except for the other people in there drinking.   Unfortunately after the wonderful experience at the Lake House, this lack of service was abundantly obvious.  No one seemed to care about the service (or lack of) that was offered.  

The Castle had no complimentary tea or coffee in the room.  I had thought that was an industry standard worldwide these days.  There wasn't even so much as a note pad or pen.  I thought at some point I was going to fall through the floor in the hall on the way to our room at the Castle, it sagged and squeaked that much.  

I haven't really compared the price we paid but whatever it was, The Castle was vastly overpriced for what we received, both in terms of the room itself and the service (or lack of).  As I already mentioned, I most definitely would never recommend this establishment.  If not for the fact that our stay had been booked prior to our leaving on our trip, and that there were no vacancies that were open to us at the time, we most definitely would have moved to another hotel",1,2018,11,06
229,Overnight stay ,"Immediately greeted by professional and friendly receptionists. This quirky hotel is wonderful. It's location, value for money, comfort and superior standard of cleanliness add to a wonderful stay. But the staff make this a ""return to"" hotel. We'll be back to discover more of it's chequered  history. ... It was wonderful hearing snipets of it's history as we checked out. Ab Fab! And if you like Georgian house design you'll absolutely love this hotel. ",5,2018,11,06
229,Lovely stay,We stayed at the Castle along with six other friends and we had a great time. The staff were very helpful and friendly couldn't do enough to help us. The room we had was clean and the bed was very comfortable. We dined in on one night and I must say my meal (Lamb Stew) was a bit lacking but overall the service was great. The breakfast's we had were superb the Irish white pudding and the thick bacon absolutely lovely and you could have as much as wanted. We were met by the owner on our last day and I must say what a lovely man. I can recommend this hotel as we had no complaints whatsoever.,5,2018,11,05
229,Castle Hotel,Traditional hotel. Excellent location to explore Dublin. Staff very helpful and friendly. Rooms very comfy and clean. Breakfast was beautiful...large selection of hot and cold food. Would definitely recommend and return.,5,2018,11,03
229,Mrs Ashcroft-Tulley,"Loved our 3rd year staying at the Castle Hotel!!. I even had my honeymoon and 1st and 2nd anniversary at this hotel. Excellent location,rooms very comfortable like always. Everything was clean and well maintained. The staff all very helpful especially with my disabled mum especially Emmett on the front desk. Totally enjoyed our stay and did not want to go home . I would highly recommend this hotel!! . See you all next year and once again a BIG THANK YOU",5,2018,11,02
229,Amazing Hotel,"This hotel is beautiful. Set in 4 Georgian houses, the features and décor have kept to give a luxury feel. The room was nicely fitted and the en-suite had a lovely large shower. The restaurant, the food was nice and the waiting staff very good, happy to talk you through the menu and show you how to make the most out of your visit, they are also friendly as are all the staff. The bar is downstairs in what used to be the wine cellar. Great bar with loads of character and live traditional music whilst we were there. I enjoyed it so much I can't wait to go back.",5,2018,11,02
229,Very modest property with nice location,"Negative:
- no elevator to the room (152), no help from staff with luggage. Long corridors with lots of doors.
- room was very cool , heater - absolutely cold (+5 C outside) , no air condition, even no heater in the bathroom
- very noisy - single glass in the window so you hear every sound from the street
- very loud ventilation in small bathroom + you can not switch it off. No conditioner.
- lock broken in the bathroom
- bed sheet with a hole
- no door handle from both sides 
- no safety deposit box
Positive:
- polite staff
- nice looking sitting areas on ground floor
- tea pot in the room
- nice view to the Abbey church from our room
- Hop on Hop off bus stop right behind the corner",3,2018,10,31
229,Simply Wonderful,"Very friendly staff from beginning to end who cannot do enough for you. We were staying at the hotel for 4 nights with our friends who were in a different part of the hotel. Fion the owner introduced himself and was a really warming guy who put us at ease right away.
The hotel itself is a labyrinth of corridors, stairs cases, lifts and rooms but set out beautifully in such a way it seems small and cosy.

The rooms are of a reasonable size and very clean in decor and cleanleness. The only slight grumble was the shower was not that powerful but not unusal.

The breakfasts were out of this world with a huge crew of staff to set, seat and clean away. The Irish breakfasts were perfect with thick bacon, good sausages and black and white pudding which all went down a treat, with pastries and coffees and teas no problem.
The location is a short walk up hill from where the bus dropped us and within easy reach of the bus routes and the river.

Overall a wonderful stay and  would not hesitate in staying there again.",5,2018,10,27
229,Great Hotel,"On arrival staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Our room (116) was comfortable with everything you need. The Hotel if huge with lots of seating areas, breakfast room, bar, restaurant even a gym. Breakfast was very good, hot and cold food and as much as you like. Live music in the bar at night with a good atmosphere, Gin and tonic with fruit was lovely. Location is good for walking to all the attractions like we did or buses train nearby (ask anything at reception very helpful) On check out you can store luggage in a locked room until you have to go to the Airport. The Hotel is run like a tight ship, very clean and staff always pleasant. A visit to Howth is recommended.",5,2018,10,24
229,Fantastic hotel,Great friendly hotel! Staff welcoming and helpful! Bar manager Joe made our stay here extra special! Spotlessly clean! Amazing food and fantastic  entertainment. Irish singer Dave Dunn is a must see! Would definitely recommend!,5,2018,10,23
229,Wonderful,"On arriving at the hotel the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The hotel is very quirky there are loads of seating areas for relaxing in. The room was perfect, in fact there is nothing in this hotel I could fault. It is utterly charming. We ate in the restaurant on our first night and the food was ample and tasty. Live entertainment was also provided which made for a great ambience.

The breakfast in the morning was tasty and plentiful. On checking out the staff allowed us to store our luggage until it was time to go to the airport.

Everything is within walking distance of the hotel you can get hop on hop off buses round the corner. I loved my stay at The Castle and would stay again .",5,2018,10,22
229,Second visit here this year,"Mid range hotel at the top of O’Connell st.
Short walk to everything, clean rooms, good staff, good food... plus a bar with music most nights from 9:00.
Served buffet breakfast with good selection.
Will come back",3,2018,10,22
229,Great Stay in an awesome location with character,"This hotel is located just a few steps from Grafton Street and a short walk to the river and Temple Bar, but remains quiet and cozy on the inside.  Staff was all wonderful, including letting us use the luggage room prior to our check in.  Breakfast was good, but the dining room was overcrowded and loud.  The Vaults served excellent food and poured an excellent pint.  Joe the Barman and the other bar staff were amazing and made our night.",4,2018,10,17
229,Great stay ,Got off our flight from the US and headed to the hotel. Jet lag quickly caught up with us and check in was still hours away. We sat down on a couch to consider options and fell asleep instead. Staff popped in when a room was ready and our trip was off to a dozy but nice start. The hotel is just a few blocks from the busy tourist areas so easy to get to the different sites. Breakfast was very nice as others have noted and the staff are lovely. We enjoyed this quirky hotel and would stay here again. ,4,2018,10,17
229,Vacation 2018,"Hotel is very clean, and charming with friendly attentive employees.  The breakfast  which is free with your room was delicious. There is a choice of bread, croissant, danish, meats, potatoes, cereal and yogurt to name a few. You also orange juice to select from along with tea and coffee.  ",4,2018,10,16
229,"Homely stay, good food..","We stayed here three nights on our arrival in Dublin from Australia.  The front of house staff were fantastic when we arrived at 8.30am. They allowed us space to sort our luggage before we travelled into the city for the day and showed where to store the luggage we didn't need until our room as available later in the day.  All staff were great during the remainder of our stay. The room we stayed in was comfortable and clean. There are many areas in the hotel to just sit and relax if you need.  Breakfasts were great with a good choice of foods and great staff again.  The Vault Restaurant within the hotel was exceptional and was always well patronised whilst we were there..  Great food at reasonable prices, try the steaks, yum.  This hotel is better than it's 3 star classification. We highly recommend a stay..",5,2018,10,15
229,Great location ,"It is a group of old buildings put together and the floor plan reflects it.
The floors are uneven and you go up and down stairs to get to your room.
The staff was very friendly and the room and hotel very clean.
I had mentioned on booking it was my friend's birthday and they placed a banner, balloons and a card in our room. It was a very thoughtful gesture. Thank you Owen!
The room is average size. Rhe bathroom was a good size, but only came with a shower which was ok for us.
There is a dryer and amenities in the bathroom. Flat screen TV. Beds were ok as were the pillows.
 I had to open the wi dow as I found the room stuffy. I could imagine it being quite hot in the summer.
The breakfast is cafeteria style. Lots of  choices. The staff was also very friendly. You can go back up and order more if you wanted.
There are elevators. The stairs reflect the buildings age.
The hop on hop off bus is right across the street. The Airlink bus is about a block away.
I would definitely stay here again.

229,Lovely visit,"The Castle Hotel is the oldest hotel in Dublin.  Location very good.  Within walking distance to the main core and the Hop on Hop off bus.  The room was comfortable although warm.  They did supply us with a fan so that and the open windows were pleasant.  Very high ceilings.  Bath tub the largest I have seen and comfortable.  Not any room in bathroom for sundry items but a shelf outside of the bathroom where we kept our necessities.  The staff was very pleasant and the breakfast quite adequate.  We had dinner in the Vault on two occasions.  The fish and chips weren't so good but the Salmon we had was quite nice.  We had dinner once in the Music Room and had a bit of a laugh.  We asked for the ""prawn"" appetizer.  When they brought it the ""prawns"" they were tiny salad shrimp. Even the waitress knew the difference and said that's what they call them.  Not something to order if you really want prawns.  A number of patrons over the next few days mentioned that if you eat there don't get the ""prawn"" appetizer .  We enjoyed the Irish dancer and the different entertainment.  Our disappointment was that once you ordered a drink you never saw anyone again to get any additional beverages.  Not too sure why.  I would definitely stay again and recommend it for those that want the true Irish flavour.  Lots of little nooks and crannies and comfortable sitting areas on main floor.  One small elevator but it worked fine for the size of the hotel.",4,2018,10,04
229,Had a Goods Stay,"Very clean. Room was very large and comfortable, Large size bed, 2 arm chairs large wardrobe. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Live Music each night of our stay, Food menu was not as extensive as one would have liked.",4,2018,10,04
229,Very disappointed,"This hotel is an old Victorian style. We had an awful experience with our first breakfast. We picked the wrong seats as they were setting up the outdoors cafe and the doors were opened. We were cold as was our food. Ordered tea, got coffee, and got tea after others were served. Toast was ordered and to our dismay the bread was moldy. This was brought to the servers attention They offered us French toast. I think not. The room was very small with nowhere to put your luggage. The room was so warm that we had to open the window the first daywe were there.  the best part of this hotel was the Vault, the bar which was efficiently run by Joe, the best bartender there is. Wouldn't return or recommend to a friend.",2,2018,10,02
229,Excellent Stay!!!,"Loved our stay at The Castle Hotel!  Excellent location. Close to bus stops for the Air Link and Hop on Hop off busses. Room was very comfortable.  Bathroom was great. Everything was clean and well maintained. The staff was very helpful, especially Emmett on the front desk and Alex in the Music Room. Totally enjoyed the Vaults restaurant for dinner and the Music Room for breakfast. It’s very convenient to have the restaurants connected to the hotel. Highly recommend!",5,2018,10,02
229,Awesome Location,"This hotel was awesome. The rooms were spacious and clean. In the basement, they have a lounge/bar area that is open late night and has very friendly staff. The breakfast in the morning was also lovely. It had a nice selection of different things you could choose form. The best part? You are just a short walk away from restaurants and shopping!",4,2018,10,01
229,This Hotel Provides Outstanding Service,"The staff at this hotel consistently went well-above and beyond what could be considered outstanding service for their guests.  Yvonne, the General Manager, has assembled a team that ensures every guest's stay will be a positive experience and a memorable one.  If you're interested in having all of your travel needs met, time and time again, choose the Castle Hotel.  Thank you for making our stay in Dublin a most memorable one.",5,2018,10,01
229,Overall good simple hotel.,"Stayed here for 4 nights and no complaints.  Got in early and was able to get them to hold my bag while I explored until it was check in time.  This is not a modernized hotel, they still use old fashion keys to unlock your room (so you turn your key to front desk every time you leave and give them your room number to collect it when you come back) but there is an elevator so you don't have to lug your luggage up the stairs.  Because its an older hotel, the floors do creek while walking thru hallway and walls aren't thick enough to block sounds (thankfully didn't have noisy neighbors).  Bed was comfortable, shower pressure strong and temp good.  Remember to bring travel adapter, but if you forget, they have this little vending machine that sells adapters $4 euros next to elevator.  Only had breakfast the last day because all my tours started before breakfast was available, overall it was just okay, nothing extraordinary.  Wifi was good, no issues connecting and staying on.  One thing management should probably work on is maintenance in the bathroom, for most part clean but definitely showed wear and tear, needed regrouting.",4,2018,10,01
229,Birthday treat,"The castle hotel was clean friendly the rooms could do with updating. The breakfast was lovely plenty to choose from. The receptionist were very helpful and informative of the buses and things to do.The location is a short walk away from the shops, bars, etc. 15mins to temple bar which is a MUST. The hop on hop off buses are a must and go and see the Guinness factory well worth it.",4,2018,09,30
229,Clean/Great location,"We arrived a tad early, 6:30am, and had to have them hold our luggage until the room was available at 2:30, so we had to find something to do from 6:30 until 2:30. We were able to go for a walk into the downtown area, and catch breakfast at Murray’s. The hotel is close to the center of Dublin and all the main bus routes, but not so close that you’re dealing with too much noise and chaos right outside your door. The rooms are clean and well kept, and the staff is professional and extremely helpful. If we ever go to Ireland again, I’m sure we will stay here. Try and get there close to or after the check in time, because we were absolutely exhausted by the time the room became available.",5,2018,09,29
229,"Cool hotel, wonderful staff","Castle hotel is a few mansions joined together to make a quirky hotel. It has an amazing history too. The entire staff is spot on & the food was quite good. Great location for sightseeing. If you get to meet the owner, Fionn, you're in for a treat!",4,2018,09,29
229,A Safe Harbor in Tumultuous times,"I arrived at the Castle Hotel to find that I,along with my husband and father had been swindled by a travel company out of our entire vacation package! We had lost all our money, along with all our reservations as the company had plunged into bankruptcy with NO NOTICE to us whatsoever! A rude awakening and a terrible way to begin a vacation - on my birthday nonetheless! Castle Hotel staff agreed. They made a makeshift “ situation
room” for us, set us up with tea and coffe and went to work to find us rooms straight away! (Our vacation was saved, along with our money, with some quick work on our part, and amazing people helping.) Castle Hotel resurrected our vacation from the jaws of defeat. They were able to set up my husband and me in a loft, at the last minute, complete with a kitchen, that was just lovely. They never once complained about the extra time and work they had to put in to accommodate us. We were given the room rates originally offered through our travel package and The Castle Hotel honored our original rates without any argument. They happily went to work to help us with smiles all around. We were treated like family and felt very much better in a very terrible situation. I cannot say enough how their professional and kind handling of our situation saved our vacation. We were able to stay two complete nights with Castle Hotel. We dined and were entertained both evenings at the cellar bar. The bartender Joe and his gregarious nature was just what we needed to lighten our moods. We ended our stay feeling like life long friends. The Irish dancer, Jean Kennedy, even got the three of us to dance with her on the last night of our stay! If you knew my husband, you would know what a remarkable feet this was!! Castle Hotel and the staff earned every one of the of the five stars I am giving them. I will stay with them every chance I have to visit Dublin!",5,2018,09,29
229,Castle Hotel Go Brah,"Ever dance with a World Champion Irish Dancer in front of a pub full O’people? Believe it or not, me and my party of 3 did while we stayed here. I’m not a dancer, but the bar keep (Joe) set it up on the sly, without our knowledge. That was a blast. In addition to really nice rooms, nice restaurant with great food, convenient location, great staff, and affordable prices (for the city) this place also has very good live entertainment! We stayed in an apartment styled loft which was as close to a residence as you can for the price. Sixt car rental was a short walk just a few blocks away. Great place! I would DEFINITELY stay here again, and I’d recommend it to anyone.",5,2018,09,28
229,beautiful old hotel in the middle of Dublin,"Gracious , elegant hotel with many rambling halls. The room was quite small and not much of a view. The hotel had it's own secure parking and a lovely back courtyard. breakfast was included and was excellent. The staff were very friendly and accommodating.",4,2018,09,28
229,Lovely and charming Georgian hotel right off O'Connell Street,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Castle Hotel. Our room was a good size and nicely appointed in keeping with the overall hotel decor. Bed was very comfortable and had windows that could be opened.Bathroom was spacious as well.
Full breakfast was delicious with plenty of choices and served in a delightful breakfast room, Staff was very pleasant and helpful.
The Vault restaurant in the basement of the hotel was very good.",4,2018,09,26
229,A walking holiday in Ireland,"My group stayed here at the Castle Hotel fo r athe 3 days we spent in Dublin.. The employees were super friendly, helpful with a couple minor issues, and very informative whenever we had any questions regarding directions or general information about Dublin. There was a decent selection for breakfast which was included, and the hotel was reasonably priced. It was very clean and had a great location near all kinds of public transportation.",4,2018,09,25
229,"A right little gem this one! If you don't want modern, this is THE hotel for you :-)","Easy to find and a 10/15 min walk from the river.

Stayed here for one night on business. Fantastic Georgian house (massive) spread over 3 buildings I think, but does not loose any of its very unique charm or individuality.

If you want Premier Inn sort of hotel do not stay here, the Castle is for those that appreciate refinement (all be it ""old""). Lots of antiques and oil paintings adorn the walls. even creaky floor boards :-). It 's an old building but has so many little rooms that you can sat sit, drink, chill,chat etc.

Good bar and restaurant. Nice little ""beer garden""

Fixtures & fittings are very good quality, the bed.....OMG.....the best nights sleep I have had in years!#

Staff are very friendly and helpful, some of the best I have encountered in my global travels.

Only three very MINOR points:

1. Hoot cooked breakfast is 0700 on wards but before that is continental, absolutely no problems with that (early flight back to the UK)  but when I asked (0545 hrs) are there any croissants I was told not till 0700 hrs! But ye there was ham, cheese, jam etc out???
2. Asked for a takeaway Latte (at breakfast) and was give a normal hot water coffee. 
3. TV reception channels were not that many/good (room 503)

Very highly recommended and would i go back? Oh YES most defo. Told the family about it.",5,2018,09,25
229,"Great hotel, lovely staff, good location",Had a great mid week break here in early September - 2 couples. Loved the hotel and going back to live music every night was fabulous. The staff couldn't have been nicer and the hotel is full of character and a really good location. It was our first trip to Dublin but when we get back again which we hope is soon we want to stay at the Castle again.,5,2018,09,25
229,My favorite hotel in Dublin,"This is my second year visiting Dublin and staying at this hotel. It is still an excellent place to stay. The service is excellent and all the staff very friendly. They really  do make you feel like family, It's within an easy walk to all the local attractions, museums, galleries, temple bar area. It's a beautiful hotel and very quite. I will always stay at this hotel when I go to Dublin.",5,2018,09,24
229,Character well located Hotel with restaurant and vaults bar,"We stayed here for 4 nights while we explored this city. Well located, we could easily walk down to the centre of the City. O’Connell Street is close, where the City Sightseeing buses start from and over the river is the Temple Bar area - lots of pubs, entertainment and places to eat.
We did the Guinness and the Kilmainham Gaol Tours.
We had a big room, but the closet had limited hanging area. Room faced busy road, but earplugs do the trick. Refreshing of tea making facilities in room was random, but staff were very helpful.
Breakfast was busy and cramped as there were too many tables too close together. Impossible to keep accessing the self service breakfast without disturbing other guests. Full Irish Breakfast was first rate.
We spent several evenings in the Vaults pub where the local food was good, and there was live Irish music every night (mid week).
Limited Parking on site was advertised, at a cost,  it this was so cramped, it was impossible to safely access and park on our final night, so we parked on the road and paid at the meter. Accessed down a narrow passageway, cars parked illegally restricted entrance and manouvering - should have been clamped, as warned.",4,2018,09,23
229,Good choice and value for money,"Pros:
Hotel is located in a beautifully decorated Georgian house .
It is basically located  on central o'connel street,  very close to public transportation, including aircoach from the airport.
Stuff is incredible - very helpful and friendly.
Room is comfortable.
Cons: 
Breakfast has quite poor variety, and it is the same breakfast every day.
Location is quite central, but could be better.
We received a room with windows on o'connel street. It was quite noisy, even at nights.
Overall: good value for money
",4,2018,09,22
229,Loved it,"Loved this hotel.  Don't understand how you couldn't !  We had a large (slept 5) family room.  Tiny bathroom but clean and modern and sufficient. The daily included breakfast was great and the dining room in which it was served was bright, cheerful, and bustling.  This hotel is very well situated.  This hotel is so charming and comfortable and we enjoyed every minute of our stay.  We would stay here again and recommend it to others!",5,2018,09,21
229,Fantastic Hotel!,"We loved this hotel, it's full of character, we got an excellent deal and a huge room and the staff were amazingly friendly and helpful.  It's conveniently located within easy walking distance of the city centre, shops, attractions, bars and restaurants.  Its own restaurant offers delicious food that is reasonably priced and there was Irish entertainment thrown in too. We had plenty of tea/coffee/ shampoo/towels in our room. The breakfast is delicious with an extensive hot buffet. Special mention to Eoin in the bar who happily provided us with an ice bucket and ice for our own bottle of fizz and actually helped us open it when the cork broke. Great stay!",5,2018,09,21
229,"Moderately priced, moderately comfortable","Nothing wrong but not is exceptional either.  Located at the edge of center city, all attractions are at walking distance.  Do not go to the other direction. The room and the shower were small but for a few nights the place was OK.  Breakfast is adequate but boring.  Front desk staff was very nice to us and we could leave the suitcases at the storage for a few hours after checking out.  In general I do not want to go back to Dublin but if I have to I consider this hotel again.",4,2018,09,20
229,Great hotel with exception of front desk personnel,"We just returned from an eight day stay at this property.  Can't say enough about how nice the rooms were, bar staff and breakfast room staff.  The only hiccup was the front desk staff.  We found them very unfriendly, they seemed pit off by any of our questions.  We all got the impression that they did not like Americans.  Other than this the stay was perfect.",4,2018,09,20
229,"nice hotel ,bad room","We liked the decoration of hotel interior,the breakfast was very good,the staff excellent,the location supreme,the wi fi good.
We really hated the noise in our room nr.236.there was noise and sounds from downstairs-there is a bar-,from the room next to us,from the room above us,from the stairs.When you are walking into the room you feel the earth moving under your feet.There was no refrigerator in the room,there were no slippers but thre were bad smells from our bathroom(no window ,no fresh air in there).Also you have to buy or borrow adaptors for charging mobile phones .",3,2018,09,19
229,Brilliant hotel!,"Just come back after a lovely stay at the castle hotel. Breakfast very nice and rooms very clean. Free tea and coffee in the rooms with tolietries in the bathroom. There were chocolates left on the pillows everyday which was a nice touch. The location of the hotel was good, only a 5 minute walk to the hop on hop off bus service which was very useful. Hotel staff very friendly. The hotel has entertainment in the bar every night 9pm-11pm with some brilliant traditional Irish singers. Great cocktail menu aswell and the staff do table service for drinks so we didn’t need to keep going up to the bar all night. The only downfall was that the rooms were very hot, even having the window open did not seem to make a difference. Air con or a fan needed. Apart from that, we had a lovely stay and would defiantly recommend staying here!",5,2018,09,18
229,A lovely stay,"Great staff and service, breakfast great, entertainment in the Vaults at the hotel was fab, 10% discount for a second visit booked direct. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. WE WILL BE BACK!!!!",5,2018,09,18
229,An excellent place to stay in Dublin,"Being the oldest Hotel in Dublin, it's pretty obvious that the place is going to be a maze of corridors and stairs and various function rooms. All part of the splendour of the place, apart from the inability to close one's bedroom door without making a quite substantial noise. Quite a disadvantage in the morning when trying to sleep. The hotel is situated perfectly to explore Dublin's fair City, the rooms are pleasant, clean but understandably not gifted with much of a view. The restaurants are well worth a visit where the service is excellent and the food tasty. The evening artists that perform are superb and well worth listening to. In all a very good place to stay and we would return.",5,2018,09,17
229,Truly Outstanding,"We were checked in very quickly on arrival by the most friendly and efficient staff on reception.Our room was extremely clean with furnishings of a very high standard.The hotel is located within two minutes walk of O’Connell street, and bus stops. Along with the excellent food and great entertainment in the evening, it is a place we will return to again, and, again. We even had the pleasure of speaking to the owner on the day we were checking out,a very nice man who was obviously proud of his hotel and it’s staff. Absolutely faultless in every department.",5,2018,09,14
229,VERY WELCOMING,"Stayed here last weekend with four friends. Hotel in such a convenient position for either a 10 minute walk into the City Centre, or to the Hop On and Hop Off Bus, which is opposite the hotel,
We received a warm welcome. and shown to our rooms. The hotel is rather a maize, but you soon find your way.The rooms were a good size, with Ensuite Bathroom, all spotlessly clean. Toiletries, Hairdryer etc. Hotel also has free Wifi.
Breakfast was excellent. Full English/ Irish, fruit, cereals,cheeses and pastries, Staff at breakfast were very friendly. Good service.
On the day we left the reception staff put our cases away for us so we could spend the morning having some retail therapy in the City. We returned and collected our bags just before being collected by our taxi.
Would definitely return to this hotel, so would recommend it to anyone wishing Dublin.",4,2018,09,09
229,5 star service in a great location,"My daughter and I just stayed there for a week. I was enchanted the moment we walked in the door. The staff are exceptional- nothing is a bother to them. Our room wasn't quite ready on arrival so they brought us tea in the beautiful lobby area. It was actually quite warm the first few days there and since it's a very old building- no AC. They had fans available for use and it was exactly what I needed. The decor is stunning- many small nooks with overstuffed sofas and chairs. Interesting artwork on the walls, and a small area with computer access so you could print out tickets and itineraries as needed.The room was very comfortable (room 232) and nice large closet to store luggage and clothes. Great shower with good water pressure. This hotel had perhaps the best wifi access (free to guests) that I've ever had in a hotel. Breakfast was included in our stay- you will not go away hungry. Large assortment of breads, fruits, cereals as well as hot items- eggs, bacon, sausages etc.One of the best perks is the location. Literally across the street from multiple bus stops that will take you to the city center- although we walked it more than once. There is also a wonderful Tesco supermarket a 5 minute walk from the hotel that is open weeknights until 11 PM. Great place to stock up on drinks and bottled waters (you can get a 6 pack of sportsbottle waters for 2 euro). They also have OTC medicines, sundries and food as well.",5,2018,09,09
229,Beautiful hotel stayed twice never disappointed!,"Stayed at the Castle Hotel once before sometime ago so decided to give the hotel another visit as it’s in such a great location 
Wasn’t disappointed arrived mid morning spoke to hotel they happily let us drop off our luggage in a secure area and check in so we could head out for the day, all we needed to do when we got back later that day was grab our keys! 
Hotel was beautiful and clean, bedroom lovely and spacious, loved the decor gave us such a homely feel, reception staff were so helpful happy to help with anything you needed. We only ate once at the restaurant for dinner over our long weekend wasn’t disappointed food was of a good portion size and very lovely. Breakfast was buffet styled which I prefer so you can chose the hot foods that you want, also served fruit yogurts and cereals so plenty of choice for everyone, I have a food allergy and didn’t struggle to eat a good breakfast before we headed out for the day. Bar staff were so friendly one chap in particular who I sadly I can’t  remember the name off was so welcoming and a good laugh really made us feel right at home. You won’t be disappointed if you stay at this hotel if you want to feel welcome and be central to everything with a short walk you can’t and won’t go wrong with this hotel.

",5,2018,09,09
229,What a great place to stay,"Great location, rooms are good, very clean and comfortable,   The Cellar Bar is fantastic, great entertainment, great food and drinks, meals good, the cellar room is amazing.  The hotel is more of a guest house which is a bit of a labyrinth which adds to the charm. Great breakfasts and cafe next door has lunches which are fresh and tasty.
Walking distance to town, museums and buses. Highly recommend",5,2018,09,08
229,Absolutely flawless stay - would recommend in a heartbeat!,"We stayed at the Castle Hotel for 4 nights on a family holiday to Dublin - and we're so glad we did! 

The hotel itself is full of character, with its Georgian decor really bringing the history of the buildings that comprise it to life. The rooms were more than adequate (we stayed in one double and one twin room between us), perfectly clean when we arrived and equipped with everything we needed for our stay. Although situated near O'Connell Street, one of Dublin's main roads, the noise caused hardly any disruption. 

When one member of our party needed a fan in their room, reception were only too happy to help, with our experience of the reception staff as a whole being totally positive. We were checked in quickly and were offered the use of a room to store our luggage, which was handy as we arrived a couple of hours before our official check-in time of 2.30pm. This meant we could explore Dublin and enjoy lunch while not having to drag our suitcases around, which was definitely a plus! Reception were also extremely helpful in organising taxis for us on more than one occasion. In all, I really can't praise them enough! 

The Old Music Shop and the Vaults Bar were the real icing on the cake when it came to our stay. The food was great (I'd recommend the wild mushroom pizza) and we even had the pleasure of meeting the hotel owner, Fionn, one evening, who was extremely interesting and was great fun to talk to. The live music in the Vaults Bar each night was fantastic, which meant we spent every evening of our holiday there savouring the atmosphere with a pint of Falling Apple cider (also faultless) and a couple of glasses of wine.  

Overall, an enjoyable and completely flawless stay. When we next come back to Dublin, we'll definitely be returning to the Castle Hotel!",5,2018,09,08
229,Fantastic stay,Stopped here for a 3 night break it was a really lovely hotel food was fantastic ...room was great plenty of space ..great to have a bath and shower ...tea and coffee facilities  loads of ..staff great .. well worth a visit ,5,2018,09,07
229,Tired worn hotel but good location,"This hotel is centrally located but pretty poorly decorated in a very worn and somewhat jaded style. The rooms are quite overheated and in our case the window did not open at all and the light bulb was gone when we arrived. It has an attached restaurant/cafe which is ok.

What salvaged our visit was the staff - the happy smile of the young man who cleaned the room was a pleasure to see and he left our room spotless each day. He made us feel very welcome and was the highlight of our stay here.",3,2018,08,31
229,Tried and tested,"After being let down by Dublin 1 Apartments, we returned to our faithful Castle Hotel. And lesson learned always come here first... This is our third visit and love the location of the hotel, the quirky bedrooms and the live music.. This is great for a weekend trip for a couple or a family. Rooms are clean, spacious and staff very helpful if more milk etc is needed within room. 
Breakfast have greatly improved over the years and are now first class. Fresh with plenty of choice and breakfast room pleasant - just get there early.. 
Will definitely be back.",4,2018,08,27
229,Tasty,"I didn’t know this was a hotel. We went into what was the music shop cafe - now obviously part of this hotel. We wanted pre-theatre eats. Just before 7pm, there was one staff member present, service was slow and almost all of the salads were gone. Groups were still arriving for dinner. 
We didn’t get all we wanted but the food was really tasty and a good standard. ",3,2018,08,25
229,Traveler,Beautiful hotel!  Staff was excellent- friendly & helpful!  No air conditioning though -  had to leave the windows open and the traffic below was going all night...lucky that the beds are really comfy so sleeping was not disturbed!  Irish music in the bar was perfect!   Would stay there again!,4,2018,08,24
229,For the same price there are (much!) better hotels on O’Connel,"We were given a room on the 4th floor, which felt like an old attic. Cramped, too hot, with no ventilation or a/c, and soooooo much noise it was unbelievable! From 7am the noise from the buses was too much and we had to get out of bed... the bathroom was so tiny we couldn’t put our toothbrush on the sink... the shower had no pressure at all, we needed to lean against the wall to catch the few droplets. And for 200€ a night? Are you kidding? I’m usually all for small, boutique hotels, which is why we chose this, but this room is simply unacceptable and a total disrespect for the customers. We fled the hotel and for less than it’s rate we checked in to the Holliday in around the corner, which I know, it is a big charmless chain but offered comfort. You could also stay at the Gresham. Forget about this place! Run for your life and protect your money! ",1,2018,08,23
229,Dublin stay,"We loved Castle Hotel and the staff. We approached with an open mind because there are some ordinary reviews, but not many in relation to overall. It all depends what you are looking for. We are not fans of big corporate hotels, overpriced and overrated so always prepared to try something like this. The location is great, staff are very friendly, place is very clean and great eating. Great music below as well. Perfect base for Dublin and the staff sealed the deal for us. Thanks Emmett and Co!! Fin McCool the owner, hilarious and engaging! Would definitely stay again!",4,2018,08,22
229,A perfect place for traveler,"We stayed here in January for a few days and the staff were very helpful and happy to assist with anything we needed. 

We flew from Edmonton Alberta Canada and our bags didn’t make the transfer in Amsterdam so we ended up staying a few days longer in Dublin at the castle hotel while the luggage issue was being sorted out. 

The location was perfect, walking distance to anything we wanted to checkout and anything further was a short taxi away. 
They have a secure gated car park in the courtyard which was so relieving for peace of mind. the cellar has been converted into a restaurant and pub which we had a great time in having a pint and listening to the live music.
The breakfast was super fresh and lots to choose from. The look and feel of the hotel is like stepping back in time and the hospitality couldn’t be better. The rooms are quite dated but it kinda worked for the ambiance I suppose.
So glad we stayed here during our trip to Ireland. If I can, I will Definitely be back!

",4,2018,08,20
229,Family stay,"Great place to stay with lots of history. The location is fantastic. It’s outside of the main Temple bar area but only a short walk or taxi ride away. there is a good pub in the basement with entertainment and good food and drinks. The bus from the airport (700) drops you off Near by on its second stop. You can then pick it up on the other side of the road to take you back. 
The hotel has great character and is worth exploring. The wifi in our room was okay. There are lots of stairs all over so keep this in mind if you have mobility issues. 
The included breakfast was fantastic. Lots of food and top quality. 
I will go back for sure. Great value.",5,2018,08,17
229,Slightly Underwhelmed,"Given all the very positive reviews we were slightly underwhelmed by our visit.  Some may say the hotel is quaint, and all the public rooms are ,but our room was rather tired and rough around the edges.

Firstly the bathroom window had no catch on it so would not stay closed and swung fully open in the breeze,  how the cleaner didnt realise this is beyond me. Grouting in bathroom could also have been cleaner. We reported window which was sellotaped closed for us when we returned from dinner that night. 
We mentioned said window on our way out next morning because now we had no ventilation and were assured it would be dealt with. On our return early evening we collected our key from reception and found window still sellotaped!  Back to reception, too late to fix now, no real apology, but we could change rooms . As we were only there for 1 more night coulnt face the hassle of moving so decided to stay put.  After a bit of persuasion duty manager gave us a free glass of wine with our dinner! 

Our other issue was with the hairdryer fixed to the wall and nearest mirror 10 feet away.  Asked if we could have a freestanding mirror or hairdryer with plug!  After 3 visits to reception one appeared only to cut out after 3 minutes of use. Fed up at this point so used wall one and tiny handbag mirror!

On a positive note we enjoyed the evening meals in the restaurant, breakfast was okay but a bit congested and our table got cleared at one point when we popped back to the buffet!

Great music in the cellar bar each evening, which made up a little bit for our other issues.",3,2018,08,17
229,weekend visit,My husband and I spend two nights in the Castle Hotel.It is a lovely hotel close to all central Dublin.We ere able to park our car in the hotel car park for the whole weekend and walk everywhere. The is a lovely restaurant in the hotel a friendly bar with music and a delicious breakfast  included in the price. There is a lovely garden and the staff were very helpful and friendly..,5,2018,08,16
229,very friendly staff,"charming hotel, near O'Connell Street, very tidy.
No matter what request they are always there to help in a very friendly way!
We stayed there for four nights and didn't want to leave anymore. We felt very welcome and comfortable there.",5,2018,08,15
229,Nice hotel ,"This hotel was clean tidy and staff very helpful and friendly only bad areas were the breakfast is not help yourself at the full English staff a bit tight on servings got 4 mushroom slices and one bit bacon. With one egg and a sausage , but rest of food can help yourself  , also live music can be heard till gone 11pm so if like me with children ask for room away from back of hotel apart from that a lovely hotel only 7/8 min walk to main areas ",4,2018,08,13
229,"Brilliant hotel, Not your average 3 star establishment.","Just returned from a fabulous short break at the Castle Hotel in Dublin and honestly didn't want to check out, completely fell in love with the place and wanted to stay longer. If you are visiting Dublin I would highly recommend this hotel. We had booked it expecting 3 star quality from its official ratings but had a 5 star experience.
We arrived in Dublin early morning, the reception staff were happy to let us leave our bags in the store room and filled in our registration details so once we returned later in day we could get straight into our room. 
Our room was amazing, so big and beautiful. We had requested a twin and actually had a double and single bed in. There was a table with 3 chairs and settee in, so plenty of space to relax. Loved the old fashioned, individualised decor, so much nicer than standard chain hotel offerings. We had chocolates left on our bed to welcome us and there was tea and coffee making in room with plenty of supplies. We also had a large bathroom and clothes store.Being on the ground floor we had 2 windows with colourful flower boxes outside. Despite the very old world feel there are modern touches such as free WIFI, so my teen was as happy as me. Free toiletries are provided and nice large bath sheets.
The hotel has lots of little lounges and seating areas around it, so plenty of space to relax. Each room is a feast for the eyes, with books, nik naks and pictures all adorning the walls, they have such a comfortable, homely feel to them.
We had breakfast included in our meal, which is served in the Old Music Shop restaurant. Its self service for cold items and juice, hot items are served to you from a counter and fresh tea and coffee is brought to the table. There's plenty of choice and you can eat as much as you want.
We used the Vaults bar, an atmospheric converted cellar, with very friendly barmen. There's live music on each night.
Every member of staff we had contact with was incredibly friendly and helpful, giving the impression that nothing would be too much trouble. Brilliant service.
The location is good, we found we could walk most places in the city from here, its also just a minutes walk from O'Connell street for bus and tram stops. Being off the main street meant it was quiet at night to allow a good sleep.
For us the only thing we could suggest that might add to the rooms would be a small fridge / mini bar as we enjoy cold drinks, but had nowhere to keep them cool. That said it would not stop us from returning here again.
Thank you castle hotel for a brilliant time.",5,2018,08,10
229,Excellent hotel,"Stayed here for 3 nights in August 2018. Breakfast is great, room was nice and big and the service was faultless, staff were very friendly. Location is ideal and we slept well, not too much noise outside from traffic. The only niggle was the shower in the bathroom as the water pressure was poor and the shower was little more than a dribble of water, but otherwise this hotel is ideal and I would definitely stay there again.",5,2018,08,10
229,Did not disappoint!,"We stayed at the Castle Hotel this month as a family with kids. We loved it!  The hotel is adorable and charming with so many books and crannies and lounge areas. The rooms were very spacious. The staff were welcoming and helpful. They recommended restaurants, tours, and even running routes. The location was perfect for us as we could walk to everything. It was minutes from Trinity College and the Temple Bar as well as O’Connell Street. It was a good area and our room was very quiet at night with the windows open. The breakfast was amazing!  We all loved it.  The owner of the hotel was on site and very friendly as well. I would highly recommend the hotel. I will not be staying anywhere else when in Dublin!
",5,2018,08,09
229,A Great Place to Stay,"We stayed at the Castle Hotel for 3 nights in August and couldn't have been happier. The room was beautiful, clean, and spacious....the staff wonderful.....breakfast delicious.....and the restaurant/bar cozy with great food and drinks! The hotel is in a great location which meant we were able to walk to any attraction we planned in visiting. We would definitely stay here again!",5,2018,08,09
229,Excellent Service - wonderful location,"We arrived to the hotel after a long driving day from Belfast. We were greeted by a young man by the name of Emmett who became key to us having a great stay. There was a heat wave in Ireland and hotels typically don't have AC. The Cast does not. We got our room which was on the top floor, quite cramped and a small window. The room was very hot. Nothing they could do of course. In the evening we opened the window and cooled it off. Emmett moved us to a bigger room the next day and was an excellent ""tour guide"", telling us about the great sites in the area. He really was a rarity and an asset for a hotel. The hotel has a great breakfast and a cool pub in the basement with really good restaurant. A very nice stay. Will probably return but only if its normal weather for Ireland. Cool.",5,2018,08,06
229,Best hotel in town,"Best hotel I've ever stayed in! Loved its charme, the friendly people working there and the owner of course. He was the most welcoming and hospitable person I've ever met. Will definately go back there again soon. 
They serve great food, do a breakfast you can wish for and the rooms are gorgeous. Loved every second of my stay!",5,2018,08,06
229,Great hotel!!,"Great hotel with a really good location. The rooms are nice and clean. 
The staff is very friendly and helpful and the in-house restaurant Castle Vaults is really good with great music during the weekend. 
The breakfast is ok/fine. 
We enjoyed our stay a lot!",5,2018,08,05
229,Lovely ,"A lovely stay. Tucked away nicely but in a good location that you're within walking distance of the high streets and endless pubs/restaurants  and you're just around the corner from the stops if you're doing the bus tours. The staff we encountered were professional, polite and helpful. We'd like to come back to Dublin and if we do, we're definitely staying here again! ",5,2018,08,02
229,Perfect location,"We stayed for 3 nights, room was clean, but needs a few minor adjustments, such as shampoo holder broken so bottles wouldn't stay on it etc ... nothing major.  Nice breakfast, room cleaned each day.
We arrived early and couldn't check in we left luggage and started our weekend straight away, although very friendly it would of been nice to be offered a drink before having to go walking, we was lucky to have some lovely weather (heat wave) so would of been nice just to be offered a bottle of bottle or something.
When we got back to the hotel around 5pm we were en our key and pointed in right direction for room.  Room was clean although I was amazed to find 3 packs of monster much type crisps open in my side drawer, I didn't use that drawer for obvious reasons (smelly) lol
Our room was fine although hot but like i say it was a heat wave, our window had to be open all the time, due to heat so it was a little noisy early in morning because courtyard was behind our window.(room number 133)  Also the seagulls my god but Im sure thats all hotels.  Noisy things they are!!!!
The building was lovely and downstairs was really nice.  Staff friendly in reception.
Overall a lovely stay, would we stay again YES would we recommend YES.",4,2018,08,01
229,3 NIGHT STAY,"Room was very clean, lovely shower and cleaned daily. Breakfast was great choice and you could order i.e poached eggs if things were not laid out, very friendly staff throughout the hotel. Especially enjoyed the vaults and the food was excellent, Dave for the entertainment was superb even if he didn't know 1 of the requests we made, he did the others. Mr Finn thank you for buying and keeping one of the oldest hotels in Dublin as it should be and not letting it be sold as office development. Lovely gentleman we met him yesterday, walking distance for most placed during our trip.",5,2018,08,01
229,Quirky but Charming Hotel,"This hotel has its quirks and is  a bit on the older side, but I would recommend it! The service here is top notch. I am pretty sure no hotel has better service. We checked in to find out (from the sweet blond man who always wears suits at the front desk) that our one bedroom room had a plumbing issue and we had to stay the night in a room with two beds ( on our honeymoon!) but the next day they would upgrade us to the superior room.  The room we spent the night in was okay for perhaps friends traveling but not for a honeymooning couple.   The next day they upgraded us to a Superior room which was fantastically beautiful with ceiling to floor windows and a wonderful bed.  I have to give a special shout out to the breakfast they provide here! It is yummy. I had coffee, fresh butter, toast, jam, eggs, potatoes, pudding, bacon, fresh croissants, and cereal every day and everything was delicious and it was a wonderfully decorated restaurant. The staff was attentive and never judged me when I went back for my 3rd plate. They also have this service that if you are leaving for a tour before they serve breakfast, the night porter will be available to provide a light breakfast which helped us save money. Sure the stair might creak, but the hotel was clean, the housekeeping was excellent with fresh towels and crisp sheets, and the staff extremely helpful. Shout out the blond guy again who bought up our luggage when he saw how exhausted we were and all the people at the front desk. The restaurant in the bottom was okay too and room service was delicious. In addition, this hotel is close to everywhere and we were able to walk to the town center and take public transportation. We would recommend it!",5,2018,07,31
229,MagSteD,"Stayed here with my husband for a long weekend in June 2018 on B&B board . Lovely friendly staff and very helpful. Breakfast excellent, plenty of choice. We had a room at back of hotel overlooking the courtyard . Room was clean and bed very comfortable. The hotel is far enough away from the busy O’Connell street so quiet at night , but within walking distance of the River Liffey and temple bar area. We would stay here again and look forward to our next trip",4,2018,07,30
229,2 night stay with mates ,I stopped in the Castle Hotel for 2 nights stop as was meeting mates for the weekend. I was delayed on my way out because of usual Ryanair. I messaged the hotel and they replied straight away telling me that the reception was open 24hrs pet day. The hotel was comfortable and my room was clean but quite small particularly the bathroom which was tiny but all adequate for a weekend stop. Great lock fir the city easy to walk in to all areas you may want to see. Breakfast was good so would recommend for the cost compared to other Dublin hotels ,4,2018,07,29
229,My single bedroom was an 8ft square cupboard,My single room was a tiny very hot 8 ft  'cupboard' plus shower room on top floor. The 2 male receptionists couldn't have been less helpful. Just offered a fan. This cost me £120 per night . I also booked for 2 single friends who thought there rooms were very tired and over priced . The breakfasts were good and freshly cooked and the female receptionists couldn't have been more helpful. There is no way I could recommend this hotel .,1,2018,07,24
229,A wonderful Hotel full of Character and Charm,"I loved this Hotel . I found the staff to be friendly and helpful and the room was clean with a comfortable bed and a  good hot shower . Going down to Breakfast was such a Pleasure . The Old Music Room Café is lovely with welcoming staff and delicious food . I enjoyed the Local Area and the Green Hop On Hop Off Bus Stop is a short walk away , which is a fantastic way of seeing the City , I would absolutely stay here a second time.",5,2018,07,22
229,Avoid Room 151 - Music in Downstairs Pub Was a Plus,"I slept in hotels for 30 nights the first half of 2018 all over the world so I am used to extra noise.  When I asked to change rooms (for the first time ever) due to the noise and was told that there ""is city noise"" I was a bit annoyed.  This corner room is right by an intersection with a very noisy crosswalk signal that goes all night.  If the hotel were to put an inexpensive noise maker in the room that would make it easier to get a good nights sleep.  The second night I used a noisemaker on my phone and I was able to sleep much better.  The location was good and they did have parking.  The music in their downstairs pub was very enjoyable.",2,2018,07,22
229,"Great location ,friendly staff good restraunt very small noisy room","We were given a room on the fourth floor in the roof on corner of the building  down a very narrow corridor. The room was cramped , hot and noisy with no air conditioning . However the Castle  is very well located to get around Dublin, the staff friendly and a great breakfast was included in room rate",3,2018,07,21
229,Great Place!,"Great little hotel - clean rooms, great staff, great breakfast and vibe - would highly, highly recommend.  The Old Music Shop restaurant offers a lovely breakfast for guests and the Vaults restaurant is well done.  Beds comfortable, bathrooms well-appointed, food from room service was great.  Would stay again in a heart-beat.",5,2018,07,20
229,Maybe too old,"Positive points - location and friendly staff, nice bfast set up
Negative- the inside looks very old instead of quaint, our bed felt like a wooden board
 ( we were only there 2 nights so didn’t want to change rooms, we did let the staff know when checking out). Lots of odd halls and steps up to the rooms, not sure how it would be accessible to motor needed folks. Would try somewhere else.",3,2018,07,20
229,4 sunny days in Dublin,"Get the 747 express bus from the airport to O’Connell street.
Takes about 15 minutes walk to the hotel.
Staff very pleasant and helpful, able to leave our passports at reception.
Our room on the 3rd floor via a few stairs and near the lift. Great hotel lots of nooks and crannies and plenty of character. 
Great comfy bed, lovely shower, white fluffy towels changed every day. Tea and coffee facilities.
Buffet breakfast cooked or continental. Every night in the bar live music played and good food served. 
Take a free guided walking tour around the city, meet at the Spire.
Tour Trinity college and see the Book of Knells, if you can’t too close it’s worth visiting the library alone. See the castle with it’s stunning state rooms and learn the history of this beautiful city. The gaol too can be visited via the hop on hop off bus or the dart train. Stand in the courtyard where 14 were executed during the Easter rising. Don’t forget the GPO building, beautiful, still in use today and experience what really happening on that fateful day when many innocent people lost their lives in April 1916. 
If you love history and wonderful Georgian buildings, old pubs playing Irish music and friendly people this is the place to come.",5,2018,07,17
229,Weekend break,"Very friendy welcoming staff in all areas of this hotel. booked direct with the hotel, and they were very helpful when I needed to rearrange dates. Thank you for the unexpected room decorations and birthday card. (lovely unexpected touch). Quirky hotel with lots of lovely sitting areas. We had a room at the back of the hotel so it was quiet. Good choices at breakfast- as noted by others can be busy around 9am but you are pre-warned about this and the staff ensure you are seated as sooon as possible. Good music in the bar with everyone joining in. Thank you all for your lovely welcoming service.",4,2018,07,16
229,"We began our 2 week ""Ireland Adventure"" with two nights at the Castle. Excellent place to begin!","Not knowing anything about Dublin, our choice of the Castle Hotel as a place to begin our 2 weeks in Ireland was one of pure luck! Walking distance to almost everything to see/do in Dublin and excellent pubs and music right nearby.

We arrived at the hotel quiet early in our hire car from the airport after a long (and delayed) overnight flight from Toronto. Our flight got us to Dublin at mid morning , an arrival which found us exhausted, un-slept and in need of some kind care. 

As soon as we walking into the Castle Hotel lobby and approached the reception desk, we found ourselves in very capable and helping hands. The front desk staff were vanguards  of the level of quality service we found in the rest of the staff we encountered during our stay..from the reception to the breakfast room staff, to the bar staff in the Vault cellars, as well as the wait staff in the Dining room of the Vault and patio bar staff. All around, a wonderful beginning of a what would prove to be a wonderful stay.

Castle hotel is, indeed, a quirky old girl but the level of care she has received is obvious. It is easy to see how much has been lavished on the old girl herself, over the years. 

Our room, while not huge, was comfortable and clean: Amenities all there and nothing ended asking for.

We were able to easily walk to Murray's Pub for our first evening of food and great music.  We purchased a LEAF card and had unlimited transport on busses which gave us access to the rest of the city, and many important historical and cultural venues...All from a bus stop only a short (less than two minute) walk from the Castle Hotel's entrance. 

Convenience, a superb staff of caring and willingly helpful people combined with an excellent breakfast room and restaurant plus the convenience of the location make Castle Hotel a real find in Dublin!

It may. to be all Chrome and Mirrors, but it is a real treat and a great stay! We enjoyed it, very much.",4,2018,07,12
229,Good service and great cellar bar!1,The Castle is well positioned for central Dublin and for Croke Park stadium. Room was newly refurbished but no air conditioning....shame. Staff were great and very helpful. The cellar bar is well worth a visit or two...with live music each night. The hotel is homely and comfortable.,4,2018,07,10
229,Nice stay,"Had a lovely few days in Dublin, although much busier than my last visit. The staff at the  hotel are very friendly & helpful, but unfortunately we stayed during an extremely hot spell & there is no air con in hotel, although they did have fans we could loan for €10. We ate in the vault one night & had a very nice meal & enjoyed some Irish songs, however another evening we ate in the Old Music Store  & it was a disaster. The service wasn’t good, waited ages for our food, being told the kitchen was very busy as they serve both restaurants from the same place so must have been rushed offf their feet, as after booking ahead to arrive at 8.00 we were still eating at 10.00. Another tip, ithe hotel is on a road junction so if you want a good nights sleep ask for a quiet room at the back! Despite this we did enjoy our stay and would recommend but  be aware!",4,2018,07,10
229,Very cozy hotel,We arrived and were greeted and treated so nice. We arrived at the room and was pleasantly surprised how comfortable the room was. The breakfast was outstanding with so much to choose from. The entire staff treated us so nice. The check in and out was so easy. I would say if you are looking for a cozy hotel this would be a spot to be.,4,2018,07,09
229,Not much...,"This hotel have not meet our expectations. Well located, but nothing more. The rooms are small and equipped with old furniture(also the TV). Strong point on cleaning, they did a good job. The breakfast is too traditional(limited) for a foreigner.",3,2018,07,09
229,Absolutely a Gem! ,"I stayed in this hotel for the first four days of my trip to Dublin. It is an absolutely fabulous little place. Like other reviews it could be described as quirky. There are lots of lovely little sitting rooms and a gorgeous stairwells up to the rooms . While the rooms are not overly glamorous they are clean and well serviced. What makes this hotel is the ambience , the staff and the availability of both the restaurant and a bar .  The staff osphere overall is welcoming it actually feels like a small guest house rather than a hotel. Unfortunately the castle hotel was unable to accommodate me on the following Saturday night and I needed to move to another local hotel. Oh boy what a terrible contrast. I will of course write review on that hotel separately. My best advice to you is book ahead as far as you can to get into The Castle prepare yourself for cracks and squeaks and all the things that go with quirky older style hotels. Make sure you make time to go down to the vaults and have a drink and listen to the music it is a little like a local pub.Oh and by the way the other advantage is that you can actually get some limited room service orders up until 9pm . My room 429 was at the back of the hotel and did overlook the courtyard .  When the windows were open you could hear people sitting having drinks but what you could also hear was music playing from the bar below which was rather lovely and did finish at 11 PM so all in all this is an absolutely great little place and I wouldn’t hesitate to stay there again.",5,2018,07,07
229,Last leg of our 2nd honeymoon ,This hotel was our favorite. Good location-easy walk to the hop on hop off bus stop. Also short walk to Jameson. The oldest in Dublin and full of character. Quirky. Many common areas with beautiful antiques. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The food was great. We enjoyed dinner in the cellar restaurant more than once. Very good fish and chips. A very nice garden area to relax or eat or enjoy a drink. Loved it ,5,2018,07,07
229,The perfect hotel,"We have just returned from a four day stay in this lovely hotel.  I cannot recommend it enough. It is spotlessly clean, the staff are very friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble for them. Both my husband and myself have walking issues so we were given a room on the first floor quite close to the lift. The flower display on the outdoor patio made it a pleasure to sit there and relax.

The bedroom was impeccable. Fresh towels every day, a lovely bathroom with full size bath, shower etc. 

The food was very good, my husband thoroughly enjoyed the Irish breakfast. I’m vegetarian and don’t use cows milk. They were quite happy to make me porridge with almond milk. 

Excellent evening entertainment.

We will definitely stay there again on our next trip to Dublin and can’t thank all who work there enough for making our stay just perfect.
",5,2018,07,07
229,Good Hotel : Close to Centre,"I spent two nights at The Castle Hotel, I chose this as it looked a decent hotel with a reasonable price (for Dublin) and the bar had entertainment in the evenings.  Bring a solo traveller it provided entertainment when not wanting to be out late at night.

The hotel provided all that, friendly staff, food good, although probably need to update their poster saying breakfast is fairly quiet at 8am!!!
Breakfast included in price and was a good selection.  Ate dinner in Vaults each evening and was great.

Only issue I had was incredible warmth of room, however you can’t blame hotel for weather!  The hotel provided a fan on asking which helped greatly.",4,2018,07,06
229,Rugby weekend,Not far from the centre. Hotel was friendly with first class service from the staff. Lovely breakfast each day and fantastic variety to choose from.Would definitely visit again and would recommend this hotel.,4,2018,07,05
229,"Nice Room and Staff, Amazing English Breakfast","The room was very nice, quite spacious, but not air conditioned. The breakfast included in our room cost was probably the best we have had at a hotel that was not a large buffet. The quality and choice of food items was excellent.  The staff were very friendly and helpful. We walked to the city centre tourist attractions taking 30 - 45 minutes depending on the attraction.",4,2018,07,01
229,The best hotel in all of Europe.,I have been staying at the Castle Hotel since I was a child and now I bring my children here when we visit Ireland. The hotel staff is incredibly helpful and welcoming. The in-house restaurants are amazing and the food is always perfect. The wait staff is impeccable and the free live entertainment is awesome. I wouldn’t stay anywhere else.,5,2018,07,01
229,Fabulous Quirky Hotel,"With one day and night to spend in Dublin, this was a perfect choice. Rooms are a bit small but very clean and well appointed. Staff was helpful and efficient. Location is well suited to walk Dublin.  Ate dinner onsite at the Vaults. Good meal and excellent entertainment - Paddy Brown. This evening event was the perfect way to spend our last night in Ireland. Breakfast onsite was included and delicious.",4,2018,06,29
229,Short stay in Dublin,"The room was comfortable and extremely clean. The staff were helpful and polite. The food was reasonable but expensive for what it was. There was free entertainment every night in the bar/restaurant, Ray Cox was particularly good. Overall the hotel is value for money and we would be more than happy to stay there again.",4,2018,06,28
229,"It’s great, really great but ....","Good things - friendly reception staff, glorious furniture in the public areas, rates are not cheap but they’re not bad by expensive Dublin standards. Dublin is not cheap. I really enjoyed my stay. Excellent breakfasts and it feels like a slightly dated but loved independent hotel

Not so good - room was a bit dated and the bathroom needs some refurb.  Breakfast is busy, very busy.  You may have to queue for a table at any time, not just after 9 as the welcome sheet says.  It’s not a relaxing experience and the mainly lovely staff are run ragged.

bad things - the woman who seemed to be in charge of the restaurant at breakfast was clearly stressed but telling off a member of staff in front of customers for wearing the wrong colour shoelaces was embarrassing and unprofessional.  The staff member was behind a counter so shoes were not even visible.  Never bollock a colleague in front of other people and definitely never in front of customers.

I’d happily stay here again.  It’s a great location, not far from everything but slightly away from the madness of the centre.    A wee refurb and some staff training and it would,be hard to beat.",4,2018,06,27
229,Hotel Perfection,"The front office staff greeted us warmly, nothing was too much trouble.  Our bathroom had a problem, shower over bath, Upon telling the front desk they asked us to pack up our belongings & they moved us to a much better walk in shower.  We have stayed twice in 3 weeks & each time the staff have been wonderful, they have been very well trained.

The hotel is not far from the luas(tram), buses run right passed the door, & the main street (O'Connell St)is 500 metres away.

Our rooms have been spotless with plenty of space, An area for the computer and another for sitting and relaxing or reading.  Our breakfasts have been great & we have enjoyed both of the on site restaurants.  It was also great to have onsite entertainment too.

It feels almost like home!",5,2018,06,26
229,"Castle Hotel-go for the history, stay for the charm!","I stayed at the Castle Hotel recently for a total of five nights and was very happy with my hotel choice. The hotel was formed from several Georgian homes, all attached, and the hotel retains many charming details in the woodwork, high ceilings and chandeliers. I had two different rooms because I went out of town to visit relatives over the weekend. My first room faced the street and was a bit noisy with traffic sounds since I was on the 1st floor (which in the U.S. would be called the 2nd floor). The room was attractively furnished with a very comfortable bed, and a clean and updated bathroom with shower. The second room was bigger, and faced the inner courtyard, so it was much quieter. I could hear other guests talking at times, because the sound traveled a bit. Otherwise again, the room was very nice, clean, attractive, with a very nice bathroom. I am not a light sleeper so any noises I could easily ignore. I loved the full Irish breakfast which was included in the room price, and also had several meals in the dining room. The Irish chicken dinner and the various soups were all excellent. On several nights I went to the lower level restaurant/pub which featured live Irish music. I heard three different singers and they were all very good. There was no cover charge and it was so convenient to stay in the hotel at night after a long day of sightseeing. The staff members throughout the hotel were very pleasant and helpful, and went out of their way to treat me like a special guest. If you want to feel like you really are in Dublin, stay here. If you want everything just like it is in the States (or wherever you're from) then you might prefer a different hotel. I really cannot wait to return to this hotel again.",5,2018,06,24
229,Fabulous hotel,"I have just returned from 2 nights staying at this wonderful hotel.  My mum was celebrating her 80th...and on arrival they had put balloons, banner and a card in our room.  The staff are so lovely and helpful.  Our room was 103...very pleasant, comfortable beds, fluffy towels etc.  We ate in the Vaults restaurant...delicious food followed by live music and a gorgeous Irish dancer.  My mum absolutely loved the atmosphere.  Breakfast was excellent...loved the Music room...huge choice and wonderful staff looking affter us.

The hotel is in a great location...15 mins walk from the river, Temple Bar, Trinity college.  We took the airport bus (12 euro return) which was really easy.

We would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends.",5,2018,06,24
229,Mrs Mary O’brien,Was at this hotel on the 15th of June it’s a lovely hotel very clean hotel staff were friendly the breakfast & meals were good the only disappointment was the bathroom in the room when going for a shower it was very hard to get into the bath as it was very high it was the same when you got back out and the tiles on the floor were very slippery my friends husband fell come out of the shower and hurted his back so hopefully the hotel will do something about it so if you visit this hotel be careful if going for a shower,5,2018,06,24
229,Perfect location after long flight,"We were not planning on staying in dublin for most our trip but knew we needed accommodations close to the airport since we were going to need to rest before we took the ride to our first destination. For this reason, it was a great location!!!  It was about 15 minutes from the airport, centrally located and really easy to find. 

Beds were ok comfort wise.  Staff was helpful in giving us walking directions (and I'm sure driving if needed).  We were in walking distance to Grafton St., Dublin Castle, Temple bar, and Trinity College.  Also, we got there on a Saturday and there was a local farmers market where we got to start trying some local food.  We even grabbed some fruit and veggies for the week!  

There is a car park at the hotel...it was 15 euro which was fine for us.  Everything really worked out fine for us staying here. ",4,2018,06,23
229,Restaurant,"What a really good restaurant, i had chicken wings to start, really good quality, followed by Rib Eye Steak, beautiful and generous portion, sides really good too. House Wine Red, a lovely quality for the price. Live entertainment at 9pm onwards, had a really good night with 4 friends, i have dined here before but thought this time i would give a review as verry good night and staff so attentive and friendly",5,2018,06,23
229,Reservation there June 8 for 3 nights. UGH!,"This was awful. First an employee would not let us ride the elevator, saying the weather was too hot. Very rude and confrontational. Then we got to the room................. over 85 degrees. Unbearable, we asked to cancel the next two nights.............. the Hotel would not. But they did bring us a fan that was broken.............. then they brought us a 6 inch fan. That did a lot of good. 
This place is very poorly managed. We paid over $300 a night and nothing has been refunded. I would NOT recommend to anyone.",1,2018,06,23
229,Quirky hotel,"Stayed for one night only - lovely hotel.  Staff were super-pleasant, my single room was fine and breakfast was good if rather crowded.  Definitely recommend this hotel - the location is very central too.",4,2018,06,23
229,Over nighter before. Ferry ,"We booked this hotel as it was handy for the ferry and walking distance from town. Was the most pricy hotel of our trip and most disappointing. They have some secure parking and we were able to get a space. Lovely hotel and rooms and pleasant welcome at the desk. We dined out but did visit the bar and listen to the Irish singer. The negatives were all on the day of our departure. We ordered an early breakfast, continental as it was an early which was fine, but on arrival there was no toast, no crossant, limited fruit juices and cereals. We did eventually get some soggy toast and decided to leave. At reception on returning the key I wanted to complain about breakfast but the 2 people on reception were so deep in conversation that I neither was acknowledged nor had time to speak so just left. Won’t be visiting again",2,2018,06,23
229,Short break,Just returned from a three day break to celebrate a special birthday. This hotel has lots of character. Lovely breakfast and friendly and helpful staff. There was a lot of noise from traffic outside but the hotel is well situated for most places in Dublin. Would go again ,4,2018,06,21
229,Great Location,"This hotel is in a great location on O'Connell Street. You can get on and off of the Airlink Express bus to and from airport just a couple streets down from it. The rooms were nice with a large bathroom, but very small shower. There is no AC, but they will provide you with a fan for your room. They have an elevator, but also there are some steps in the hallway. You should probably let them know if you have mobility issues. They provide a free breakfast every morning, but it did not change at all from day to day. Their restaurant also had really good food.",4,2018,06,20
229,Lovely georgian hotel in great location.,"I love the higgledy piggledy nature of this hotel with staircase, sittings rooms and lifts all over the place. Seems to be made up of over 9 georgian terraced house all joined up. Lovely staff, all very helpful. Rooms decorated to a high standard to retain georgian character where possible. Restaurant a little disappointing my sister had fish and chips fish, which was dry and chips undercooked. Also 'no hash browns' for breakfast! I will come back here again though!",4,2018,06,20
229,Excellent way to use Aer Lingus's layover promotions from the US to France,"Fares for travel from JFK to Bordeaux were in the mid $1,500 range in the spring of 2018, when Aer Lingus offered $700 round trip fares, provided we were willing to spend a day and a half in Dublin on our return trip. Sold! The Castle proved to be a great layover location. Reasonably priced, with a decent restaurant and bar, and within walking distance of the central city attractions. We dined in the cellar, came back after a walk to hear a local Irish journeyman troubadour in the pub, and had a wonderful Irish breakfast upon waking the next day.",5,2018,06,19
229,wonderful friendly staff nothing phases them comfortable rooms like being at home but with all the delights of Dublin,great place to stay .if your getting on dont use the down stairs bar its for young people though i still loved it Breakfast included in the price and full Irish was lovely and with a smile from the staff   will be staying there next time i go to-Ireland xxx,5,2018,06,18
229,Taylor Swift concert in Croke Park,Me and my brother stayed here for 1 night for the Taylor Swift concert the location of the hotel was perfect because it was only a 5-10 minute walk up the road to Croke Park . All the staff were friendly to speak to and was very helpful with getting us a taxi if we needed it. Overall I would definitely recommend staying here if you wanted to stay down in Dublin for a couple of days,5,2018,06,18
229,Cozy and accommodating,"Located right off O’Connell street and close to most of the tour bus stops. This hotel feels like you are staying at your grandmas house with its thick carpets and antique style sitting areas. The staff was extremely helpful with information and tips for getting around Dublin and for our planned day tours. The shower was nice and hot! Breakfast is included and offers a full Irish breakfast as well as different fresh baked pastries every morning. 
The restaurant and pub located inside the hotel offer live music every night for a full Irish feel. You can’t go wrong with this hotel.",5,2018,06,17
229,Just got home and had to review,"Just spent two nights at Castle Hotel and had a lovely time. Really friendly staff who couldn't help enough. The room we stayed in was lovely and ideal for myself and my partner. Breakfast was lovely (again) staff were unbelievably friendly and helpful. We were ideally placed for getting to the main sites, but some walking was required. Great hotel, great stay and we are both so happy we chose Castle Hotel.",5,2018,06,14
229,A lovely place to stay near the center of Dublin,"We stayed here for three night at the start of our round Ireland road trip.  What a great way to start our trip!  The staff here were all warm and friendly and extremely helpful.  The rooms, albeit very hot due to the warm weather, were otherwise comfortable.  One of our party has mobility issues and found the warren-like maze of corridors and up and own steps a bit difficult to cope with however, but she managed nonetheless.  Breakfast in the Old Music Shop restaurant was very good--I recommend the sausages!  We ate in the Old Music Shop one night and downstairs in the Castle Vaults two nights.  The food and service was fine.  The waiters downstairs quite funny, in fact.  There was live music downstairs too and that was an added bonus.  All in all, a great stay and if you don't mind steps, I'd say stay.",4,2018,06,12
229,"Really helpful staff,but even they couldnt cool unbearably warm rooms!","I stayed for two nights at this lovely looking, clean, quirky hotel.  We arrived on a very early flight, and were able to store our luggage whilst we went out for the day which was appreciated.  On returning around 6pm and going up to our rooms they were unbearably hot. (even the complimentary chocolate on the bed had melted)! The hotel does not have air conditioning which may not have been an issue in other parts of the busy hotel, but for the rooms facing out onto O'Connell street (2 out of the 4 of our group), they really were the hottest rooms we have ever encountered.  Curtains were drawn, windows opened, door left open and fans requested, (which were supplied very quickly) but these actions made little improvement.  This was such a shame as everything else about this hotel is great. Breakfast in the Music Room is plentiful, and we ate evening meals in The Vault which was a super bar and restaurant area in the cellars.  Food was reasonably priced for hotel food, and service from the restaurant and bar staff was great, particularly on the Saturday evening when we did not have a lot of time before leaving for an event at the 3 Arena.  There was live music each night accompanied by a talented Irish dancer.  Location is good as it is only 5-10 minute walk right into the centre, and 15 minutes or so to the DART station.  I would love to have given this hotel a higher rating but trying to sleep in a greenhouse for 2 nights with the hum of fans, just isn't my idea of a nice break...sorry Castle Hotel as everyone at the hotel were lovely, and helpful....I may possibly return but only in winter!",3,2018,06,11
229,Friendly and helpfully staff,"I was there for 3 days over the long weekend in Dublin and I have to say it was a great old hotel on the main road. The staff the day before allowed me to store my luggage as I was going a night trip to Belfast which was extremely helpfully to me. 
I had a corner room on Gardiner and Great Denmark St which for some people may have been a little noisy however I loved the noise of the people and the city.
The pub downstairs was excellent with great pub food and big servings. The drinks weren't too expensive the music and entertainment over the 3 days was superior. This pub was kid friendly and a great example of this was the staff allowing a young girl on holidays sing to all of us while the guitar player backer her up.....Great work....
The bedroom was clear and the shower was hot however you did have to let it run for a while to heat it up.
Breakfast had a good solution of food which was hot and cold and of course juice, coffee and tea.",4,2018,06,11
229,"Fabulous, Friendly and great location","We arrived on 02/06/2018 for 3 nights to celebrate my birthday. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left nothing was too much to ask of the staffs, they were helpful and knowledgeable. 

Having read previous reviews about noise from the front of the building,  we requested a quite room. This was granted, I was left a birthday card balloons and a banner, a very nice and thoughtful touch. 

The room was modern, clean and service daily. Breakfast was good and plentiful. The only suggest is it would be nice if they provide at least a bottle of water in the room, having arrived late at night.  Having asked  we were able to obtain a glass from the bar.

We had the opportunity of meeting Finn the owner and his son. A very jolly and charismatic gentlemen. (I understand from the staff that he makes a point of meeting the guests) another nice touch.  

A special mention to the barista (I think his name is Jo) who was very helpful informing us about the various types of whiskies and introducing us to our first Guinness.

 Overall, a very enjoyable stay,  will definitely return and would highly recommend.

Thanks to the Castle Hotel for making our first visit to Dublin memorable .

229,"A Palace, not a castle!","We stayed as a school group in April, 32 16 year olds, and had the best hotel experience possible. Both teachers and students loved every aspect- fantastic helpful staff, beautiful rooms and probably the best breakfast in the northern hemisphere! I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone going to Dublin. Access to the centre is a short walk, shops are a stone's throw away from the hotel. Thank you to everyone at the Castle for making our trip so enjoyable.",5,2018,06,06
229,Our Saviour.,"My girlfriend and I had originally booked an apartment in this part of town as we were attending a concert at Croke park that evening however we had a no show from the owners and after a lot of fuss from hotels.com we were relocated to the Castle Hotel. 
By the time we arrived to check in we were pretty frustrated and had lost a bit of our buzz for the evening ahead. This changed very quickly as soon as we explained our situation to Emmet and Jonathan at reception.
Jonathan gave us a tour of the new apartments just out the back of the hotel and let us have our choice of room and provided us with some complimentary drinks to help get us back in the mood for the gig.
The hotel bar was beautiful. An underground annex with bare brick arches which keeps in with the character of the oldest hotel in Dublin. The best thing about this bar though I have to say is the prices, they have to be some of the cheapest drinks I've ever had anywhere in Dublin. Served again by very friendly, upbeat bar staff. 
There is 2 large screens showing sports and the volume kept down pretty low so you could still have a chat without shouting.
We didn't try any of the food from either the restaurant or the onsight cafe but seen some coming out and all looked and smelt very good. 
During our stay the owner came to say hello and then again to say goodbye as we were leaving.(sorry I forgot your name) a lovely stereotypical jolly Irish man who I'd loved to have had a pint with given more time. 
All in all I can't recommend this place enough. Clean, family run, friendly staff, close to Croke Park and O'Connell street and my next time in Dublin I'll definitely be stopping in. 
Thanks for turning our frowns upside down. 😊",5,2018,06,06
229,No response from manager,A friend and I had booked Castle Hotel in Dublin for the nights of May 17th & 18th - the last two nights to a week long trip through Ireland. (Hotel was standard - very noisy - thin walls and street noise.) We found out that the airline we were flying might go on strike beginning May19th. We both had to get back to work in Canada - so ended up having to switch our flights to the 18th to avoid getting stuck without a flight home. Not only did we miss our last day in Dublin (first time in Ireland) - but were told we had to pay for the hotel whether we stayed the second night or not. We paid - and I have emailed the manager - Yvonne O'Keefe - three times since returning - asking that they consider refunding the second night due to the circumstance. (Front desk provided email and told me she was aware of the situation.) She has not so much as replied - even to say no. I find this terrible customer service - and for the first time in Ireland - left with a bad impression...,3,2018,06,05
229,"Quaint, Quirky & Charming","This hotel has the honor of being the oldest hotel in Dublin.  It's not perfect but it was perfect for our needs.. We used it as our base as we traveled each day around Dublin and the rest of the country.  The hotel is a bit of a maze as it links several building together on Great Denmark St.  Although they have an elevator, there are still hallways and ramps to navigate on each floor.  I got lost a couple of times trying to find my way back to my room. 
We did have to change rooms after the first night as our room faced the street and was quite noisy.  The weather was warm and the windows were open.  Ask for a rear facing room in the ""newer"" section as there's no view to speak of on either side. The staff was very nice and accommodating.  As it is an old hotel, the rooms are small, but the shower was very nice.
Breakfast is included with the room and it is served in the adorable ""Music Shop"".  it was good, and when we were up and out before breakfast, we were able to go into the breakfast room and pack sandwiches and coffee from the buffet.
We really enjoyed the Cellar bar & Restaurant.. it's downstairs in an old wine cellar and it very cozy and lively.  The food was good and the bar has a nice selection of beer, wine and cocktails.  We enjoyed live music every night and the weekends offer music and Irish step dancing.  There is a different balladeer each night and they sing mostly traditional Irish tunes, tell stories, etc.  It was a perfect way to end each day.",4,2018,06,04
229,Scout leaders,"We had an awesome adventure in Dublin using Castle Hotel as out base. Beautiful place lots of nooks to sit and chat . 
Free wifi 
Tv and very comfortable rooms 
Breakfast in the old music shop was always glorious.
Food in the vault with live music and irish dancer was a wow part of our trip. 
Staff very helpful 
Car park availible at fee per day 
That was a little tight for parking 
We had a chat with finn the owner what a lovely chap. 
Food and drink was wonderful 
Well worth a visit",5,2018,06,03
229,Old time feel,"Stayed here 12 days. Loved it. Room cleaned every day. Staff awesome. Free breakfast has something for everyone. When we needed something, the staff got it fast. The only bad thing, people SLAMMING doors. Easy walk to shopping and sights. Highly recommend, and would stay there again.",5,2018,06,01
229,Amazing hotel,I found this hotel through booking.com and wasnt disapointed. About a 10min walk from oconnell street which was perfect as you dont get all noise but still close by. Reception staff were lovely friendly nothing was to much trouble. Our room was ideal for us and spotless. Had cleaner in everyday and chocs left on our pillow which was nice touch. Breakfast was lovely and again staff were efficent and friendly. We had meal down in vault which was best thing i ate all weekend in dublin it was amazing. We stayed to watch irish dancer who was great and a guy singer who was amazing his voice was wow but also funny and entertaining. Hotel itself is pretty and old fashioned decor which i loved made it feel cosy would defo stay again!,5,2018,05,31
229,"Lovely stay, thoroughly recommended - perfect location","Stayed here last weekend in a quad room (4 blokes on a rugby trip) no real complaints, the room was fine, breakfast was absolutely superb and location near the top of O’Connell Street was just perfect for exploring the city. There is a bus stop to the airport (number 747) about 50mtrs away and a taxi for 4 of us cost about €27 which was cheaper than a bus, when split 4 ways 👍 ok the hotel in places was a little tired looking but after all it was a georgian building with great age so I can overlook that to a degree. Staff were excellent and couldn’t be more helpful - would we stay there again, without question 😬",5,2018,05,31
229,Great hotel - but use the car park!!!,"We stayed at the Castle Hotel the day we arrived in Dublin.  I had requested an early check-in as we flew over from the States.  They were unable to accommodate us upon our arrival (but we were VERY early).  We found some couches on a lower level and crashed until they came to get us to tell us our room was ready (which was very nice of them to do).  Our room was comfortable and clean.  Unfortunately, we parked on the street in front of the hotel and our car was broken into over night.  The staff called the Garda and loaned us a sweeper to get the glass out of the car.  There IS a car park at the hotel for something like 19 Euro a night.  I would definitely suggest parking there.  :)
",4,2018,05,30
229,"Charming, comfortable, reasonably convenient","Charming old hotel, updated rooms, very well-maintained.  Lobby areas have gorgeous old furniture. Great service. Cooked breakfast. Three minutes walk to Hop On and local buses, tram. Seven minutes walk to river. Good pub in basement, with live music. The hotel is nine buildings pieced together so you may have to walk long winding hallways to your room.",4,2018,05,30
229,Very quaint hotel,"The outside of this lovely old hotel, hides the quaintness within.  Room was ok, we had a rear facing room so it was quiet, but no view.  Bathrooms are small but everything was well appointed.  Breakfast was excellent and the basement bar had live music and Irish dancing.  Very central and close to the main part of town, so an easy walk or hop-on/off bus to main attractions.",5,2018,05,28
229,"Good hotel, great location","Stayed here for a weekend of rugby watching with friends. Great location for the city centre and very easy to get to from both the airport and ferry, no messing about with the much heavier traffic further into town. From arrival to departing the staff were friendly and attentive. Our room was good, a decent size for a Georgian house, and nice and quiet, but our friends room faced onto the main road which they didn’t like too much, such is life in the city. Breakfast was very good as was the entertainment in the bar at night.
My friends wife cut her foot on a tile in the bathroom on our last day, but once reported to reception they dealt with it very well and showed lots of concern for her. The manager was very caring and took the room out of use until it could be repaired, really nice to see during a very busy period for the hotel.
All in all, a great find, close to all bus & tram routes and 5 minutes walk from O’Connell street. I will be back next time we visit Dublin.",4,2018,05,28
229,Wonderful position right at top of O'Connell St so very handy for tour bus etc.,"Hotel lovely, lovely rooms and amenities and staff so helpful. Many thanks to the wonderful young man on reception who reunited us with lost belongings! and also to other staff on reception who were so helpful and a mine of information in order to make our trip a success. Would not hesitate to stay there again, so may thanks to everyone.",5,2018,05,28
229,Quaint and cute ,"My boyfriend and I fell in love with this spot. Super cute! Although, they don’t really have working air conditioning so if you get hot easily you may want to stay somewhere else. (Although they will give you a fan to use if you need!) We loved it though. It’s just really old and adorable! ",5,2018,05,27
229,Loved this beautiful quaint hotel,"We stayed here for a couple of nights during our recent trip to Ireland.  Of all the hotels we stayed at, Castle Hotel was my favorite!  The people were wonderful and the food in the hotel was amazing.  Especially the breakfast!  The people who worked there were friendly and welcoming!  I loved the little village and plan to stay again on my next trip!",5,2018,05,26
229,Splendid!,"The service was unprecedented and we were warmly welcomed by the owner who personally made sure we were comfortable throughout our stay.

The rooms were clean and the breakfast was excellent. If you are staying in Dublin, you should consider no other hotel.",5,2018,05,26
229,Special Birthday visit,"My partner and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights recently and have nothing but praise for for this establishment.The staff were very helpful,polite and knowledgable. The rooms were very clean and tidy and hotel food and drink prices were very reasonable. The hotels position is very central for walking to the city centre and bus links if required are excellent.This was our first visit to Dublin but will not hopefully be our last and we will certainly look to stay at The Castle Hotel again. Thank you very much for making our stay so enjoyable.",5,2018,05,25
229,No complaints,"Myself and my husband stayed here for the Ed Sheeran concert! Staff are extremely friendly and can't do enough to help. Hotel is beautiful and very clean. Breakfast was one of the best i've had in.a city hotel. We used the bar both nights, again staff very friendly lovely cosy bar and open until late. Hotel in good walking distance to central Dublin. We loved this hotel and would definitely stay here again!! ",5,2018,05,22
229,Excellent location and great facilities,"The Castle Hotel was only a couple of hundred meters from where the the airport bus dropped us in O'Connell st.  very handy! we could walk quite easily to many of the city's attractions.  Breakfast was excellent.  The restaurant and bar in the basement was terrific, we loved the Irish music and dance.",4,2018,05,22
229,All that you need,"Situated just off the top of O' Connell Street, it is a Georgian house hotel with a lot of it's original features. Rooms are spacious and clean and have all you need in mod cons. Staff are friendly and efficient. Breakfast is good and ample. There is a nice bar which also does food. A excellent hotel, within walking distance of all th sights. Going back there in October.",5,2018,05,20
229,Not impressed ,Arrived into Dublin early AM flight. Rented car and off to the Castle Hotel we went. Reception staff was extremely friendly and helpful but room itself was a bit dingy. First part of the window frame was rotted and a small piece of the actual window was broken. Next major cobwebs on the ceiling and Lastly the heat was turned high and not at all comfortable. For the price i would certainly find somewhere else to stay ...,2,2018,05,19
229,Love this place,"Friendly staff, very clean, nice bar, good food, very quiet with a pool and gym. A great place to stay to relax and close to many attractions. This is an older hotel but well worth the stay - as I said clean, quiet, helpful staff.....",5,2018,05,18
229,Charming hotel in a good location!,"Castle Hotel is definitely an older hotel, but very charming. Enjoyed all the little sitting areas as well.  My room wasn't ready, but it was lovely to be able to leave my luggage. I had a twin room, which was small...but honestly, it was just me, so who needs something bigger?  The door kind of hit the end of the bed, but I actually found it charming and I had no problem closing the door and frankly, with older hotels, you expect little quirks. But the room was clean. Water pressure in the shower could have been better, but also something I expect with older hotels. And not a deal breaker at all. 

Breakfast room was nice, busy, but the staff was efficient and I never had to wait. Letting the guest know when it's busiest helps for planning!  Breakfast was tasty for the most part. I see what people are saying about serving themselves, but I see both sides to that as well.   

Staff was very friendly and not only gave me a good recommendation for lunch when I arrived, but helped me secure a taxi back to the airport.  I booked this through Orbitz, but I would book directly with the hotel next time. 

The hotel is also in a good location!  The hop on/hop off bus stop was very close to the hotel and it's in walking distance of a lot.",4,2018,05,18
229,Great location,"What an enjoyable friendly staff this hotel have. The bar staff in the Vault and the reception staff, especially the females, are so helpful. Rooms are clean and adequate. The Vault bar has live entertainment every night. Ray Cox last night was utterly brilliant.  It’s a hotel in an old building, with lots of stairs and different rooms to relax and rest.  Our only complaint was the lack of water pressure in the shower and no working bathroom extractor fan. But it’s an old building, that is kept immaculately clean, in a great location, with fantastic food and great staff. A piddle of a shower is excused :). We will be returning. ",5,2018,05,17
229,Cozy traditional hotel,"Just returned from a busy weekend trip to Dublin, could not have planned a better hotel for its location, comfort, good food and welcoming atmosphere.  The hotel itself is full of old style tradition, with high ceilings, cozy sofas and creaky floors.  Loved it, so much nicer than a featureless chain hotel.  You can leave your bags/cases securely whilst you go off and explore the city before/ after you check in, which is always handy on a short stay and the bus to the airport is close by so you don’t have to go out of your way to pick your bags up when going home.  We loved the Castle Vaults bar which is in the cellar in the hotel, the bar staff are friendly and they have an Irish singer playing beautiful Irish folk songs.  Breakfast is good, plenty of choice from cereals/yoghurts to full cooked breakfast would be nice to serve yourself the hot food though, felt a little like being back at school having to ask for your choice and it being served to you.  The location is fantastic, a short 10 mins walk and you are in the busy shopping/ bar and river area of the city so close enough to enjoy but away from the noise so you can definitely sleep well.  I would definitely stay here again and would recommend this hotel to friends.  ",5,2018,05,16
229,Wonderful ,"Visited with my Mum & niece this week & had a lovely time.

Hotel is so lovely & the staff went above & beyond to be helpful & so friendly 
Owen on reception was so patient & kind helping me book my boarding pass. Thank You.

We loved all the seating rooms with comfy sofas, & the first night stayed in the hotel & went down to the Vaults, so cosy with great food, music, Irish dancing & lovely bar staff
Great gin selection..not cheap though, but then no drinks are in Dublin.

I had a twin room with my niece
Room was clean but had an unpleasant grubby mattress protector, this was changed as soon as I told reception 
Bit of a pain with the blind in the bathroom, would it be possible to get a Venetian blind so you can have daylight but not be seen in opposite building when showering?!
Bed was very comfortable.

Breakfast room is lovely.
Really kind & lovely staff
Breakfast was ok, definitely had better, & some cutlery was not clean , staff were so busy but remained professional & lovely 
Great cappuccino & lemon drizzle cake.
Loved soda bread 
Unsure why you can't serve yourself.

The location is brilliant..short walk down the hill and you're in O Connell street,
Temple Bar is 1 mile walk away over Ha'penny Bridge.

I really wanted to give this hotel excellent & actually in my eyes it is..just needs couple of tweaks!

We love it so much we want to book to go back for my son's 21st in October 
See you again hopefully 

",4,2018,05,15
229,Good location,"The hotel is only a 20 minuite walk from the temple bar area,  and easy walking distance to a lot of other places of interest in Dublin the open top tourist bus stops just across the road, it costs 10 euros, you can hop on and off all day, 
the hotel is quite old but maintains it charm with old furniture and pictures, 
the breakfast was excellent with a very good selection, cooked breakfast , cold meats and cheese, fruit, yoghurt, cereals etc, but it does get busy between 9 and 10, 
The hotel has its own restaurant in the cellar offering pub grub and traditional dishes, and a bar where on some evenings they have a folk singer,
The only 2 downsides to this hotel was that we stayed in room 152 and when the buses went past the window rattled, and if you tried to have a shower at busy times in the morning the water was cold, other than that we enjoyed our stay, we would return but in a different room.",4,2018,05,15
229,Convenient Location,"I stayed in the Castle Hotel from May 1 through 8, 2018.
My room was #419. It was a very small room but it is clean and there is a window you can open for ventillation. If you are a seasoned traveller, you must have developed the 'will do' mode. The size of #419 is a 'will do' room.
It has the usual necessities, i.e. bath towels (large and small) floor towel, but they do not have face towels or wash cloths.  It has a bathroom and a shower. The water pressure on the showe is a very low. It has a water kettle for hot water, they provide with instance coffee, tea, sugar and cream.
They service and clean the room everyday unless you instruct them not to.
The hotel is very conveniently located in the northern section of the city centre. It is walking distance to public transportation. 
The staff were very helpful and acommodating. 
The hotel offers free traditional Irish breakfast.",3,2018,05,13
229,Cosy and well located,"I picked this hotel for its location. It was convenient for me to walk to the city center and to the railway station to travel to other cities.
Nice small rooms, but it was enough for one.
Staff was pleasant and helpful.",4,2018,05,11
229,"Nice stay, good location","The staff were very friendly and the room good-sized. Our room was very noisy with street traffic as well as sounds carrying throughout the hotel - voices I. The hallways, doors shutting etc. I was awakened at 3 am by hallway noise and had a difficult time getting any rest. The location was good, music in the basement pub, and staff seemed very accommodating. ",3,2018,05,10
229,Visit to Dublin,We stayed in this hotel as a family of 4 in a quad room.  It was very cramped completely different than in the pictures.  The cleaning service was poor. They did not wash our glasses or cups or take our rubbish out or replace our coffee or tea.  The shower was a dibble at best.  The walls are paper thin and you could hear evey word in the next room.  We did not have a hair dryer as the fuse was blown and we had to complain before they would give us a replacement.  The remote for tv was missing and it took a day for them to find another one. The breakfast was cold and the eggs were overcooked.  On the up side it was in a fairly good location.,2,2018,05,06
229,Great place in great location,"Good service, food and music at night. About 10 min walk to center (central Post office) but second stop on hop on hop off bus route is 2 min walk away. Airport buses also stop at this stop. Other Dublin city bus stops are 2-5 min walk. Good breakfast, free wifi, quiet. Will stay here again if I visit the city again. Offers free wifi too",5,2018,05,01
229,Castle is a gem,"I checked in at the Castle Hotel this afternoon following a cruise. Very easy to get here by taxi from the ship. The Castle Hotel is a true gem, just half a block from buses and hop on hop off shuttles. The staff is super friendly and helpful, rooms are nice sized and spotless. We went down to the pub in the basement and had the best seafood chowder I've ever tasted. Bar staff is tops. I recommend this hotel 100 percent! Even met the owner and he's supreme!",5,2018,04,30
229,Quaint,Daughter and I stayed here in April.  Old Georgian style hotel...formerly a number of houses attached...great character and quirkiness...perfect location to see the sights.  The younger staff were very pleasant and helpful.  The downstairs pub and restaurant was wonderful.,4,2018,04,26
229,Great hotel,Good location. Away from noise of Temple Bar. Breakfast really good. Get on the go bus ireland. Great hop on hop off bus. Drinks down stairs in the vaults. Music great. Food excellent. Bar staff very friendly. Right opposite Remembrance park. ,5,2018,04,24
229,Beautiful Hotel,"We have just spent 2 nights at the beautiful castle hotel and will deffo be back.  Check in was quick and informative, our room WOW a 4 poster bed and spotless, breakfast was yummy, castle vaults bar fab food and fab entertainment.  Dublin a fun friendly addictive place to visit.",5,2018,04,23
229,Lovely little hotel ,"There’s literally nothing to complain about here. People are saying it’s dated, I call it charm.

They serve up a very good breakfast, the staff were very helpful. WiFi was great. I’ll definitely stay here again when I’m back in Dublin. ",4,2018,04,22
229,"Good location, but dated","This hotel is excellently located to be able to walk to all the Dublin sites. However we were disappointed that the hotel didn't meet the expectations given the other reviews we had read.

Our room was very dated and the furniture looked a bit battered. There were also big stains on the ceiling. However, the room was cleaned well and comfortable to stay in.

Breakfast was always quite busy but they had a good selection to choose from and were quick with the coffee!

Overall I think the hotel was pricey, but think we paid more for the location, which we were happy with. Staff were pleasant, but not sure I'd stay here again.",3,2018,04,21
229,Excellent Place to Stay in Dublin,"I was very pleased with our stay at this hotel. With hotels in older buildings you'd expect to make a few compromises but this hotel was clean, comfortable, and nicely appointed.

PROs: 
Two elevators, a surprise for a hotel in an older building.
Nicely updated rooms with en suites.
Walking distance to just about everything.
Downstairs pub serving warm Irish classics. 
Kitchen serving a full hot breakfast.
Friendly staff.
Fast Wi-Fi.

CONs: 
Limited power outlets. Our room only had two and one couldn't be accessed using our 110/220 adapter-converter. Other rooms may have more, though. 

The PROs definitely outweighed the CON and I would definitely consider staying here again.",5,2018,04,21
229,Excellent hotel.,"The staff were really helpful at the desk and friendly. And the room was really, really clean! Especially the bathroom, and I'm pretty perfectionist in that area. The room was small but quiet. The hotel itself is very quaint, with cozy Georgian era details, sitting rooms, chandeliers and open staircases.",5,2018,04,18
229,Lots to like.....,"PROS:  comfortable bed, allowed us to check in upon arrival, good breakfast, clean and well maintained old hotel.
CONS:  our room got very stuffy, asked and was told we could turn off the old heater but it didn't do anything....requested a fan and received a desk size one; therefore, we had to leave the window open.  If we weren't always busy or exhausted, we would have asked to switch rooms but that is a huge pain after unpacking for a one week vacation.  Cover on the bed did not help, no top sheet and comforter was too warm.  
If you are going to do any amount of walking, this hotel was a little too far from city center.  TImes given in hotel description are a little too low.  We always walk on vacation but unless you are power walking through the busy O'Connell street pedestian traffice, Trinity College is NOT 15 minutes away.
Coffee at breakfast wasnt always hot and was always terrible!  Maybe I'm fussy and just needed cream or at least creamora!
",3,2018,04,17
229,Let down by breakfast,"Stayed here with a couple of friends, bedroom was basic but clean and roomy.  The ensuite whilst small was very clean.  No iron in the room which is a bit unusual in hotels these days but I'm sure one could have been delivered if we had asked for it. 
 Beds were comfortable and the room wasn't hot and stuffy due to the window being left open which was a welcome change compared to other hotels. The entertainment in the bar on the Saturday night was very good.  Staff were pleasant, however they seemed to lack local knowledge and were incorrect when telling us where the nearest luas stop was.  Breakfast was disappointing, seated at a table which though set for breakfast was very greasy having not been cleaned properly from previous diners.  Breakfast finishes at 10 which is early enough for a weekend, however several of the items had run out and even though we asked staff, they were not willing to restock them.  Considering that you are paying for Bed and Breakfast this really isn't good enough.  Food was lukewarm and the tomatoes served with the cooked breakfast were raw and hard, not very appetising.  All in all, the bed side of the hotel was fine however the breakfast end need to up their game.",3,2018,04,15
229,"Great city,great base","Fantastic hotel in great location for dublin attractions. Staff very friendly,rooms are a decent size, breakfast good.Downstairs bar very nice but only used once as we were out mostly. Would recommend and will definitely return.",4,2018,04,15
229,Best in Dublin!,"Stayed here many times, every year to be exact!  The front desk staff are always friendly, the entire staff are very helpful and go “out of there way” to always assist you.  I always stay enjoy my stay here.  The Vaults is an excellent area for a  pint or spirits, additionally the excellent eats.  I feel like it’s my true “home away from home”!  Personally, I give everyone a gold ⭐️!  
I just checked in yesterday, however; nothing has changed!  If I could I would just live here!  Must also mention the Music Room!  Excellent Irish breakfast, love the black pudding, grand portions of whatever you desire.  
Most of the staff, I know or I recognize, and have been here for years.  That’s a good indication of how great this Lovely and Lively delight in the Heat of Dublin City!  
Additionally, it’s the oldest hotel in Dublin!
I always appreciate there services!  

Thanks,

229,Great place to stay ,Spent four nights here with my wife on bed and breakfast basis. Cannot speak highly enough of all the staff we encountered. The food in the the restaurant was also very nice and with a 10% discount for residents and live music it's tempting not to go out. Would not hesitate to stay again. ,4,2018,04,13
229,Great Rooms. Great Food. Great music. Great staff.,"We stayed there over the Easter weekend. We got into Dublin around 7am (check in at 230pm). Thought we would leave our bags and go exploring. Once we got to the hotel we were greeted with a very friendly staff and told that actually our room was ready - that made us very happy but its probably best not to expect that. 
We went to the bar/restuarant the first night and had lovely table/bar service, whilst enjoying the live irish music and irish dancing. 
We had the buger and hands down of my top5 burgers (I have had a lot of burgers). I have food allergies and they were so helpful and cautious - I felt very comfortable. 
The beds were comfortable and the breakfast was self service. I talked to the managers every morning and they went down to the chef and made me a separate breakfast which was incredible. 
When we had 30 mins to get to a train on our last day - they called a taxi driver expained the situation and he had us their with time to spare. 

Every single memeber of the staff were kind, helpful, reassuring and funny. 
I will defnitely go back.",5,2018,04,13
229,Great hotel for my arrival.,"The Castle Hotel were so helpful, arranging my taxi from Dublin Airport after a very long flight. The room was cosy and quiet, the bed was soft and warm, clean bathroom, good tv, great food especially the breakfasts which were included in the booking fee. Excellent location. I’d definitely stay again! ",5,2018,04,13
229,Lovely place to stay ,We had a really good stay here and we enjoy the music the food was great and we would pick this place again if we r in Dublin. We had a good laugh we how the manger of the bar in the evening esp my choc martini ,5,2018,04,11
229,Great mini break,"We visited Dublin for two nights and had a lovely time.
This hotel was really nice, within walking distance of all the sites (approx. 15 min walk). The hotel was clean, lovely breakfast and a nice bar that had live music.
Really enjoyed our stay! ",4,2018,04,09
229,City break,"Beautiful building, lovely room, friendly staff. From check in to check out it was great. Perfect location close to everything! 
The live entertainment every evening was great. Each evening a different musician entertained locals and visitors alike. 

",5,2018,04,06
229,50/50,"I stayed at the Castle Hotel for 6 days during the last week of March. I am basing my review only on the room I stayed in ( Single room, 104) and the experience I had. 

Good: 
-The historic character and decor of the hotel
-Location 
-Free breakfast ( although not that great)
-Nice staff,, particularly one young man who I don’t know the name of but looked of Indian descent 
-Bed area of the room was a decent size
-Easy check in and check out

Bad:
-One whole wall of my room didn’t have electricity, therefore I could not use the mounted blow dryer, outlets or lights. The hotel had to bring me another blow dryer.
- Only had 1 working outlet in the room
-Guests do not have control of room temperature. Heat was turned on and off by the staff.
-The last 2 days of my stay the heat in my room didn’t work so I was given a space heater. 
-The bathroom was ITTY BITTY! 
-No washcloths in bathroom
-No tissues in room
-The bathroom sink had separate spouts so you used hot or cold. There was no way to have warm water. ( See pictures)
-One day I had a towel with black stains on it. ( See pictures)

It’s a nice hotel but, not sure I’d stay here again. I’ll probably stay somewhere else in the same neighborhood.

229,Excellent stay,Stayed here as a couple 19th-22nd March. A warm and friendly. Room was comfortable and very clean. The breakfast was excellent. The staff were very helpful. Good location to explore the city. Would recommend the hotel.,5,2018,03,23
229,Great hotel!!,"First stay here, 2 night w-end stay with friends for St Patrick's day. My friends mums uses the hotel whilst in Dublin so it came highly recommended.
The hotel is spotless, rooms spacious and fairly central. Breakfast was very nice and well varied and 2 course menu was great value for money. Also had an afternoon menu which was tasty, between us all we ate off all menu's and the food was tasty and always served hot.
The hotel is slightly further out if your not a walker, usually wouldn't have bothered us but snow and ice hampered our stay slightly but that's not the hotels fault!
Best of all were the staff, sooooo helpful and always chatty!! They opened the bar early for us with no grumbles at all and staff all helpful and whole of hotel spotless, well done on how well it is run!! 
Will return and will definitely recommend!!!",5,2018,03,22
229,Evening meal,"Everything about this visit was excellent ... the staff, the ambience, the food, and the value ... well worth a return visit. It is nicely situated in an iconic old building close to the City Centre and well serviced by the Parnell LUAS.",5,2018,03,21
229,"Great Stay, perfect location.","As first timers to this awesome city, my wife and I couldn't have been more pleased to stay here. Perfect location and just a 10 minute walk to all things Dublin. Great food downstairs too. Hallways can be a bit tricky to navigate and when the elevator is on the fritz it can become an adventure, but it all works out in the end. Hope to come back soon!",4,2018,03,19
229,Very comfortable and welcoming,"We booked a twin and a single though the single was upgraded to double. The staff were very welcoming when we arrived. Our rooms were clean and comfortable. We enjoyed the tea making facilities. The breakfast was excellent. There was cereals, fruit , juices and yoghurt to eat before we tackled the cooked breakfast. The cooked breakfast included a vast range included fried potato, black pudding, white pudding, sausages, bacon, several varieties of eggs, tomatoes, mushrooms, beans etc. It was all accompanied by soda bread and tea. The hotel has several sitting rooms which we enjoyed. We would definitely return as the hotel was excellent and very central.",5,2018,03,17
229,Fantastic,"Having stayed here before, we were treated like family. A lovely warm welcome from Fionn. We won't stay anywhere else when we go to Dublin. The breakfast is amazing, loads of choice. Rooms are wonderfully comfortable. The hotel is close enough to the city yet faraway from the hustle and bustle. The bar in the vault is a must, again the food is excellent and staff very friendly and attentive.We shall be returning again very soon. Thank you all for a wonderful couple of days",5,2018,03,17
229,Nice Stay,"Excellent friendly staff, good food nice atmosphere in the heart of the city. Highly recommended.Dinner and music in the hotel restaurant which was reasonable and tasty. The music was great too, often playing local music",5,2018,03,16
229,Friendly staff,"I arrived in Dublin on a very early morning flight.  The individual working the desk at The Castle Hotel (when I arrived at 6:30 AM!) was very friendly although unable to initially offer me an early check-in.  He invited me to make myself at home in any of the many lounge areas they had.  Around 8:00 AM he came and found me and let me know he had found a room for me.  I was extremely grateful.  The room, a single, was very small but clean and well-appointed.  There was quite a bit of noise outside my window but that has been my experience anywhere I've stayed in Dublin.  Throughout my stay the staff continued to be very friendly, accommodating and professional.  The location is quite good - right near the Garden of Remembrance - and a quick walk to O'Connell Street.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.  They have multiple lounges and a couple of on-site restaurants and live Irish music on certain nights.",4,2018,03,10
229,18th birthday celebration ,"We went to Dublin to celebrate my daughter’s 18th birthday, we had a fabulous time! The hotel decorated her room with banners and balloons and wrote her a card, what a lovely touch! The staff are wonderful and the owner spends a lot of his time there, mucking in and generally making sure everyone is happy, he’s an absolute star! The hotel itself is very quirky and does an excellent breakfast, the rooms were spotless with a hairdryer and kettle.
I would definitely return here as it is in the perfect location to visit all of the wonderful sights Dublin has to offer.
Thank you Castle Hotel for a fabulous break! 😀

",5,2018,03,10
229,Great place to stay,Went there with the family for husbands 50th birthday very warm welcome.Great rooms great breakfast excellent location nothing to much trouble. Great bar downstairs with live music. Highly recommend.Would definitely stay again all attractions within walking distance or hop on hop off bus 5 minutes away. ,5,2018,03,08
229,Wonderful base for a city break (And the rugby 😊),"Our taxi driver told us that The Castle hotel is the oldest hotel in Dublin....so it was  a pleasure to stay there.
If someone has mobility issues then I'm unsure as to how theyde cope with the multiple creeking staircases, although the Castle dose have a lift... if you are reasonably mobile it adds to the fun of finding your way around.
The front of house staff were always friendly and helpful & would go out of their way to make our stay a happy one.
The food was a delight, we ate in the cellar restaurant 3 times and chose something different on each occasion,  both the food and the waiting staff were faultless, friendly and fun....and didn't seem to mind the fact that we attempted to drink them dry of Guiness lol
The Castle hotel is perfectly situated within a few minutes walk of the city centre where you can catch a hop-on hop-off bus to see the sights, catch a tram or the dart (train) which can take you further afield
The Guiness factory with it's Gravity bar, the Post office museum (in the main post office) , and the old prison were really interesting to visit.
The ONLY one thing that I could say was a bit of a negative about our stay was the large, old, single glazed sash windows...if you are a light sleeper maybe ask for a room at the back as sometimes it can be a touch noisy throughout the night.",4,2018,03,04
229,Wonderful Stay,"As many people have stated the Hotel is very close to many attractions, Busses, and Airlink bus.  I had stayed here many years ago back when it was a small Hotel.  It had charm back then and still does, character, charm, and a bit of Elegance thrown in.  We stayed on the 3rd floor and we loved taking the stairs down the back, thru all the Antiques and nooks and actually see how it was put together.  Our room was cozy, warm, nice bed, clean bathroom and quiet.  The front desk staff all seemed nice and knowledgeable.  The Manager greeted us personally and she is spot on.  The breakfast was pretty good my wife loved the brown bread :) The breakfast staff Amazing !!! I cannot remember everyones name sadly only Christina she was lovely , they were all friendly and always busy doing something for everyone.  Great job.  The Hotel bar we only went twice...for a Pint it was about average price but a cocktail ..they were very expensive.  They charged me 16.50 for a Long Island Ice tea ...crazy !  And they don't make Aperol spritz which my wife enjoys.  But there are many places about the city in which to drink . This would not keep me from coming back , just not back into the bar.  I would recommend The Castle Hotel and hope to visit soon and see some new friends .  Cheers",5,2018,03,03
229,Fabulous Hotel/Very Friendly Stafff/Great Location,"Where do I begin...... This is a wonderful hotel located centrally right off O'Connell street and very close to everything else.  The hotel itself is a combination of 4 old georgian mansions with lots of quirky rooms, beautiful antiques, gorgeous multiple stairways, history and is very well maintained. Our room, 207 was quaint--with a bathroom carved out of an old fireplace decorated with antique furniture.... just incredible.  Even before my husband and I arrived, Ciara from the hotel staff answered all my questions via email and gave us hints of what we should do and see in Dublin. Everyone in the hotel was extremely courteous and actually directed us on how to take transportation to different areas of Ireland--printed maps, train schedules, etc.The castle vault-- the bar/restaurant was lovely, with live music on the weekends. We even met the hotel owner, Finn, a very knowledgeable and extremely friendly person.  ...In all our years travelling, we have NEVER met a hotel owner and especially one so proud of his hotel.  While we stayed for 4 days during that time it was my birthday-- and the hotel staff surprised me by decorating my room--I didn't even mention it. My husband and I felt like family...... Wonderful, Wonderful experience.",5,2018,02,27
229,Nice ,"We quite enjoyed our visit to the Castle hotel. Good levels of cleanliness, the staff were very friendly and professional. The breakfast was vey good, something to suit everyone. A short walk to the centre.
There are parts of this hotel that are Georgian which does mean than pipes make sounds and sometimes things like the shower take time to heat up. To me this was part of the charm. If we had any problem the staff did their best to help. I would recommend this hotel.",4,2018,02,27
229,Friendly & convenient base to explore Dublin,We stayed at Castle hotel for one night. It was a great choice to access the city centre - just a short walk to nearby pubs and attractions and only about 30 minutes to get to the Guinness storehouse on the other side of the city. Staff on reception were all extremely helpful and friendly - they answered questions about things to do and let us leave the car in the car park a little longer after check out. Parking was 15 Euros and worked out better than parking on the street which was 2.90 an hour although it was free 7pm-7am. Breakfast was good and again staff were warm and hospitable immediately offering my children a hot chocolate which went down very well. There were communal areas in the hotel including a little outside bit - although it was too cold for it at this time of the year!! Our room was nice with plenty of space for the 4 of us. The bathroom had a nice double shower. My old niggles were the slightly dis-attached toilet seat and the temperature of the room which was rather hot despite a draft coming through one of the windows. Overall a great base to explore Dublin - I would definitely recommend and would happily stay again.,4,2018,02,25
229,Amazed ,"When booking this hotel for my birthday I wasn’t expecting great things. However I was wrong. The hotel was lovely!! The staff were very friendly, the beds were very comfortable and the room was a lovely temperature. Now let’s talk about the breakfast.... I was amazed at the choice and quality of food, the waiter were welcoming and the food was good. I would book this hotel again just for the bread (haha). One night during our stay, some other guests were being noisey and slamming door, we complained to reception who offered us a room in a different part of the hotel ans personally came up stairs to address the other guests. (Very well handled). Let’s talk about the room, it was clean and a very good size. There was always tea and coffee available to make in your room and fresh towels everyday. The only criticism of the whole hotel is.... the phone chargers weren’t very close to the bed. So if you like to go on your phone at night you would need a long phone charger like me. Also the hotel is in a great location and you can walk to most tourist destinations. 
Overall lovely experience and would definitely book again!! ",5,2018,02,23
229,Fantastic hotel,"Lovely hotel. The staff were friendly, the room was a decent size and at the back of the hotel which meant we didn’t get any street noise. Perfect location, less than 5 minutes walk and you’re in the centre of Dublin. Good food and music in the restaurant (not fantastic service though!) would stay there again and recommend to anyone.",5,2018,02,18
229,Ok for price,"Cleanish, cleaned everyday if you wanted or not. Didn’t get given towels one day. Breakfast was cold and staff rude. Only stayed 3 nights and glad it wasn’t any longer. Restaurant was slow and food average.",3,2018,02,17
229,"Nice stay, character building","Just returned from a really nice 3 nights at the Castle Hotel, Dublin. Location is good, 5 mins walk from middle of O’Connell Street, 15 mins from Temple Bar area. Room was clean, bathroom having clearly been refurbished recently. The building is old and has tonnes of character. Some areas are refurbished and we saw some builders onsite so the renovations must be continuing. The bar in the basement was great, brilliant food, great friendly staff, a real hidden gem. We had live music most nights, brilliant. My negatives would be lack of water in the shower at peak morning time (so I showered the nights before) and the breakfast, which was a bit limited in choices and nothing special at all. Overall, I would stay here again, very happy.",4,2018,02,16
229,Castle hotel ,"This was my 2nd stay at the hotel. A little disappointed when compared to the first time around which was 3 yrs ago. 
The room was a triple and quite small. Although very clean it had a few downsides. The tv did not work. It was full of static and impossible to watch. They tried to fix it but eventually realised it needed replaced. No recompense from hotel though.  The tv was part of the price of room so I thought this would have been appropriate and fair.  The window jammed too when we opened it. Decor in room needed some updating also.
The main areas in the hotel are beautiful. Full of charm and Georgian character.  This I loved. It's a lovely kind of grand home from home.
The breakfast was good enough. Sausage egg bacon mushroom beans hash browns tomatoes. Some bread rolls and chocolate croissants. Cereals and fruit. Coffee ok. 
The lunch menu was quite limited. There did seem to be far too many tables squashed up together.  Don't remember this from last time.  Sitting on top of others isn't much fun. 
The restaurant in the vaults was good enough. Ten percent off bill if you're guest of hotel. Very unfriendly waiter who told us the bar hotel didn't serve coke although I'd bought it in the breakfast room earlier.  He got us one once I told him that.  
Overall some issues with room which I thought staff  should have acknowledged more but the usual quirky and full of character surroundings.  ",3,2018,02,14
229,Friends first trip to Ireland,"Friends first time in Ireland lost two days off there trip due to Ryanair/Leeds-Bradford Visa mistake but Castle Hotel treatment more then made up for the error, Room lovely and spacious,Staff so so helpful they knew of the problem they had getting into Ireland even the Manager contacted them, Breakfast great variety,they also enjoyed the Bar and the music.i will recommend this hotel to any other friends I have over for sure.",5,2018,02,13
229,Our stay,"We had excellent customer service. The staff were amazing, nothing was to much trouble. The rooms were comfortable and meticulously clean. Both restaurants and the bar were excellent, food good.Would definately stay here again. Really central. I was suffering with a very painful knee, they were very considerate booking taxi's and making sure I had somewhere to sit on a busy night in the bar.",5,2018,02,12
229,"Friendly, perfect stay","The reception staff were so helpful and had great knowledge. The luggage storage was secure before and after checking in and out. The room was lovely, great beds, shower and storage. Breakfast was lovely and a good range of foods. The location is great, not on the more noisy o’connell Street, quiet yet short walk to any bus stop. The owner seems to somewhere about every town where the guests are from. Real personal touch. Computer and printer to use, very handy for printing off directions. Stayed in February and rooms were very warm. We had our window open and radiators off and were never cold.",5,2018,02,10
229,2nd time  staying not very good at all. ,"Stayed here before whilst visiting family . Enjoyed first stay a couple years ago, but not very good this time at all.

Windows didn't shut properly so draughts had to put cushions against curtains to try  warm room up it was so cold. Taps loose, electric sockets loose, half light bulbs not working which made room very dark to do hair and make up. Bathroom was even smaller this time.... really very small indeed.

Breakfast was not good . Last time they used downstairs as overflow but this time virtually sitting on top of each. Way to many people for the size of room. Everyone  getting in each others way.  Tables way to close to each other touching elbows nearly. Made us feel quite uncomfortable eating so close to strangers , people opposite not knowing where to look. Food it self was average at best. 

Even with the good location I will not be returning again too many issues this time. And not a cheap stay.  ",2,2018,02,09
229,Great experience!,"I have only good things to say about this hotel. I particularly was pleased with the staff, both reception, cooking and cleaning staff: they proved the stereotypes that the Irish are lovely, warm people. Every request of mine was accommodated. The location of the hotel is ideal: it is right smack on O'Connell Street, which makes getting around Dublin very easy and convenient. I have only good things to say about this hotel. ",5,2018,02,07
229,Great stay,"Spent a night at the castle on a short break. Had a great time and hotel was great too. Friendly staff, good food, good entertainment made the hotel a place we would definitely go back to. The hotel was situated in the heart of the city and it was easy to get around",5,2018,02,04
229,How very Lovely,"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights with friends the end of January.

The hotels location is awesome, just off O’Connell street and a short 10 minute walk from the River and Temple Bar.

The hotel is just charming it has such character it made our stay. Such fun with all the stairs and corridors, trying to remember which way your room was after a night at Temple Bar or in the Hotel Bar where the wonderful Joe makes you an amazing cocktail, is just hilarious and so much more interesting than a clinical modern hotel.

The hotel facilities were perfect, the rooms are simple and comfortable. My only criticism if there were one would be the tiny Tv, but who goes away to watch Tv so really not an issue for me.

The staff are amazing, helpful friendly and oozing in Irish charm. Nothing is too much trouble.

Finally the room rate includes breakfast which was lovely.

I would definitely come back and urge anyone going to Dublin on a short break to stay here you will not be sorry.

",5,2018,02,04
229,Very friendly owner managed hotel in quirky 18th century building,"This hotel consists of about 7 rather grand townhouses opposite the memorial garden and very near O'Connell Street.  On the ground floor there are lots of sitting rooms all furnished in keeping with the age of the building with lots of individual touches and a bistro type restaurant in what was formerly a Music Shop.

We were surprised that there are around 150 bedrooms but they are all over the upper floors with a few on the ground floor.  There is a bar in the basement which also serves food but unfortunately there was no live music during our midweek stay.

We ate in the Music Shop where the menu was varied and well presented and served.  Prices are not cheap but this Dublin and prices overall are expensive possibly in part because of the high rate of VAT.

Our room on the second floor was fine and the standard of housekeeping was good.

The Castle is near enough to walk to most of the city and there are lots of things to do.  It is not suitable for anyone with mobility issues because there are lots of different levels and steps although there are two lifts.  Bus and tram transport is excellent if you don't want to walk and I think you can buy a discount card from the transport office on O'Connell St.

All of the staff were friendly and helpful and Fionn the owner was charming.",4,2018,02,03
229,Perfect location,"Enjoyed a long weekend over New Year, joining in with the celebrations organized in the Castle Hotel's vaults restaurant and the firework concert on the banks of the Lithy by the Customs House. The whole weekend was characterized by the friendliness of everyone in Dublin. The Castle Hotel is charming albeit a bit rough around the edges in our yet to be refurbished room at the back, which was beautifully quiet compared with our family's other room at the front overlooking a busy road. Taxis, trams and buses stop near by, although it is only a 15 min walk to the center. The meal in the Vaults was excellent and very good value compared with similar offerings in the city. Good live music but no space for dancing. Breakfast is served until suitably late for a lie in, and the quirky coffee shop setting adds to its charm although the small space and inexperienced waiting staff struggle to keep up as demand peaks towards the end. The hotel has several quiet sitting rooms and alcoves adding to the relaxing feel.",4,2018,02,03
229,Quaint & full of character,"I stayed here for three nights. The decor is adorable—reminiscent of a castle's interior. The staff were lovely—not only were they able to check me in early on account of another guest checking out early, but they have a small car park out back that I used all three days, and one of the staff were kind enough to park the car for me in the super narrow spaces, as I was still getting used to opposite-side driving. They even let me leave my car in for the day I checked out. I liked the location well enough—15-20 min walk to Temple Bar area along well-lit streets, although there were plenty of bars/restaurants/shops along O'Connell St. My one issue—and I know this is temporary since it won't go on forever—was that they must have been doing construction above my room, and the walls/ceilings were so thin that a few times I had to turn around to make sure someone else wasn't in my room. If there's no construction near your room, you should be able to have a comfortable, late-morning sleep in.",4,2018,01,30
229,Excellent,"Considering it is so close to the centre of Dublin (about 15/20 minute walk from Temple Bar) the pricing is excellent and to our suprise the standard is not reflective of the price. Room cleaning is attentive and thourough, breakfast is quick service with great choice and the downstairs bar features live music friday, saturday and sundays. It has that wonderful knack of being lively enough to not be without atmosphere and not busy enough to be unenjoyable. The staff are also friendly and knowledgeable about what they offer. I wholly recommend a stay here, especially for short trips.",5,2018,01,29
229,Amazing stay!,We regularly come to Dublin and this was the first time staying at the castle hotel; needless to say it won’t be our last! Amazing cleanliness throughout the hotel and fabulous complimentary breakfast. The best part is the underground Irish bar... live Irish music and fantastic food and drinks! What more could you want! We will be back for sure! go raibh maith agaibh go léir,5,2018,01,27
229,Anne croft ," A lovely weekend good breakfast was more than sufficient for the day ,room was lovely and clean ,well stocked with tea/coffee lovely and warm ,evening meal  with the choice of 2 restaurant   Irish musics in hotel  Friday Saturday evening staff were top class 
Lots of lovely walks and coffee shops a very good hotel will go back ",5,2018,01,26
229,Our go to hotel for Dublin stays ,"This is our 4th stay here and can't imagine staying anywhere else. Great location to explore the city. Nice rooms which have been updated since our last trip in May. Lovely breakfast selection every morning in the cafe restaurant attached. If you want to eat, drink or listen to live music then you only need to pop into the castle vaults below for a good evening. The hotel went out of their way on our last visit for our honeymoon and again went the extra mile on this stay for the wife's 30th. Claudiu arranged for the room to be set up for her. All the staff were great throughout our stay. We will be back ",5,2018,01,26
229,Nice hotel,in enjoyed the clean room and was very practical to get to the center of Dublin - parking was a bit more difficult - had a good evening with live entertainment in the basement restaurant - breakfast was good ,4,2018,01,26
229,Good place,"Was rather apprehensive in the beginning, for the hotel since we were a rather large group, and did not have a say in the choice of hotel. Given the tendency of the leader to choose economic hotels I did not know what to expect. The comments were so and so. First impression <<Thank God it is warm in here >> Haunting memories of the Sofia hotel (same leader). Checking ok efficient and polite personnel (English well spoken and understood … lol )    
We were prepared for the corridors to reach the room wasn’t so difficult, no porter service.
Reached the room, which was COLD… telephone the reception you know….. bla.. bla.. etc.. etc Yes yes of course find the knob turn it to the left  give it few minutes it will start .After a few too many minutes call again … yes someone is coming right up to fix it . A very polite young person (let’s say little bit confused as myself did turn the knob to the left {Oh!!! You’ve turned it already!!!!!! Yes you poor devil I ‘ve done it   this what they told to do} .The room was getting colder and colder   call to the reception…. Yes yes we will see (there was no offer for another room) and all of a sudden the young one ( I bet when the other people left, and the room was cleaned  someone turned off the switch that provides  gas to the room ….) and yes that was the problem ……It took quite some time for the room to warm up and  for us to feel comfortable. So next time when you are expecting guess do make sure that someone turns on the main switch for the room .
Asked for slippers the lady on the phone very straight forward (don’t bug me) the hotel offers no slippers SIR. Actually the same that person when you talk to her face to face in the reception it is a very polite and a smilly person. 
Room ok don’t expect much, space wise , the fire place in the room not  for use, was making it rather difficult to move around , but there are no complaints. 
Sleep comfortable, quite outside, no complaints.
Bathroom ok, there was no ventilator, with all the ….expected problems that may rise due to the lack of it…… Bathroom amenities every day there, no complaints with that. It took us some time to work properly the water mixer in the bathtub, but we managed. More than enough towels. Did not see the usual sigh …. Save the environment etc etc leave the towels to be replaced in the bathtub etc etc, the lack of it doesn’t bother me.
 Nice touch the sweets left on the bed every morning. Did not locate refrigerator, did not look for it but probably there isn’t one. Plenty of one side coffee portions and tea. 
One notice of safety???? Let me call it as a safety caution. We were on the first floor. Next to the elevator there is door that leads from that side of the floor to the elevator. The door is pushed to open towards the elevator really really close to it. The door window, shaded doesn’t really allow you to see if someone is standing by the door, so when  you push it  no matter what amount of force you use there is a definitely possibility to hit the person that is waiting for the elevator. I don’t know if they have such incidents but we did make sure we were far away from that door.
Breakfast, well there you might face a problem, the hotel realizes this and that is information   explaining the traffic flow in the medium size breakfast room. Even though there seems to be plenty of personnel in the rush hour,  the queue can be bothering. Did not have any problems because we were there before the main crowd. Good breakfast  plenty of offerings to satisfy just about everyone. Someone noted that the cappuccino wasn’t good and it was expensive. Since in no hotel so far have I found a <<descent >> cappuccino did not see the need to pay 3,50 for a cup of coffee that  may not satisfy me . Did not like the sausages nor any other meat that was offered during breakfast, but then taste is something very individual. I did remember a commentator about the sausages, I did tried them but were not to my taste. All and all  no major complaints , remamber the hotel rating .
We visited the basement bar-restaurant, nice place, did enjoy the performer liked the beers I tried two different brands, I would stick to Guinness, somehow the taste in the rest of Europe can’t reach the exact taste it has there. We had pizza and fish and chips for dinner, nothing out of the ordinary, the fish crusting was too oily for my taste, I have tasted better. Let me call  the food price somehow over priced 
But we had a good time, the guy was really good, and we enjoyed ourselves.
Location very good 5- 10 minutes’ walk to the main street with all the shops, plenty  shops around ,across the street the hop on off busses the bus to the airport centrally located for sure . Plenty of shops around. As all over Europe water rather expensive 2 euros a small bottle of water in the hotel 1,90 at LONDIS 
Finally the first  A+++ rating for the people who work there especially the young ones in the breakfast room so kind and good people the second  A+++ rating  for something that no other hotel has offered us so far . We had a very early departure 4 in the morning. Never the less they offered us continental breakfast, which was the highlight of the stay there, we really appreciated that gesture, and do note that besides the person working in the reception, who could serve us coffee there was also someone else there to look after us. IT was very thought full of them and very professional, since the breakfast of that day was already paid. Like I said have not found it somewhere else.
The taxi driver that took us in the airport very polite and kind. Given my bad opinion of taxi drivers he is probably the exception to the rule.
If I ever go back to Dublin, which I would like, I would have a hard time in deciding if I stay again there or try another hotel in the other side of the river near the temple area. Difficult decision because I really enjoy our stay there.
Thank you for  being a special part of our stay .",4,2018,01,25
229,Weekend visit to Dublin,"Conveniently located and within easy walking distance (15-20 minutes) of central Dublin. Very comfortable room and surroundings. Excellent breakfast. Very friendly and helpful staff.
Highly recommended.",5,2018,01,22
229,Luck of the Irish,"Found my own bit of sunshine with this hotel, meals were tasty and inviting especially breakfast which really does start your day off after a nice comfortable sleep in my hotel room, great to have a shower ensuite that delivers.
Staff were very friendly, even when busy they were always smiling and obliging to help even with travel recommendations to get around Dublin, although this hotel is close to everything to make your trip easy.
Live music in the bar was a good atmosphere staff here friendly and helpful and nice that the owner is present, friendly and approachable ensuring his guests are happy and enjoying themselves. 
Looking forward to visiting this hotel again

229,A Dublin visit,"This hotel is central and near all of central Dublin areas of interest. It is an amalgamation of 3-4 Georgian properties. The renevation of the public areas is impressive and in keeping with the period.
The staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfast is what you would expect when catering for a large number. But is supported by a large number of attentive staff. Coffee could be better.
If you are a light sleeper request a room away from the main (busy) road.
The hotel is just across the road from the 747 bus to the airport.",4,2018,01,18
229,Nice hotel in a historical building,"If you do not look for much comfort, the hotel is nice. Breakfast is classical British type. In a walking distance to the most of the popular places.

The bar inside the hotel is also great.

The type of rooms can change because the hotel is combination of more than 1 building and sometimes it can feel like walking in a lybrinth.",4,2018,01,15
229,Castle Hotel,"The hotel is at a great location on the north side of Dublin and easy to access from the airport via the 747 bus.  It is also walking distance to all the major sites (5 minutes to the spire, 15 minutes to Temple Bar, Dublin Castle, St. Patrick's Cathedral, 30 minutes to Guinness Storehouse). Good bar downstairs.",5,2018,01,15
229,Dublin trip,"I stayed at the Castle Hotel for the new year and it was a perfect hotel! The location was great, the staff was helpful and the food was excellent. The love music every night also made the stay very enjoyable! ",5,2018,01,10
229,Excellent position,"We were on the 4th floor and the room was quite cold, however, this was fine for us as we find most hotels are far too hot with little ventilation in the winter.  The room was light and airy and was very quiet.  The breakfasts were fantastic but you do need to take note of the busy times that are posted in the lift.  We had a Dublin Pass which enabled us to use and extend the use of the red/blue hop on hop off buses which stopped close to the hotel - especially stop 23 at the end of a day sightseeing.  Evening meals were very good too and dress was casual.  Lots of gins and whiskeys in the bar.  Everyone was very friendly and helpful.  A thoroughly enjoyable stay.",4,2018,01,10
229,"Charming, cozy and so unique","Besides being charming, cozy and interesting with its many curious nooks and crannies, this classic and inviting Georgian hotel is full of character.  We were welcomed by owner Fionn and enjoyed chatting with him. Our supreme room was lovely and we were surprised to discover that it was the same room we had occupied on our last trip to Dublin two years ago. The traditional décor, the attention to detail and the many stairways and corridors are interesting to explore. The spacious lobby is an inviting gathering space with ample seating spaces for meeting people to chat or wait for a cab. The desk staff are always professional, friendly, efficient and helpful.

Breakfast in the Music Room is a treat with a variety of fresh continental and traditional hot Irish breakfast offerings.  This room is always bustling in the mornings, with dozens of people enjoying their meal at any given time.  The service is excellent, with courteous and attentive waiters seating guests and accommodating their requests. We have also dined a number of times in The Vault and always enjoyed our dinners there.  Later in the evening the Irish music in the pub is great entertainment. 

The location of this friendly hotel, on the north side of the River Liffey, is ideal and it's an easy walk to the centre of Dublin.  It is conveniently located close to a Hop-On Hop-Off bus stop, as well as the very interesting Dublin Writers’ Museum.  The Castle Hotel is excellent value in an interesting part of Dublin and the promotional rates are great if they fit your schedule. We highly recommend it for a comfortable stay and we look forward to returning on our next trip it Dublin.",5,2018,01,10
229,Should be called Closet Hotel,"Wow. We reserved a ""family room for 3 people"". What we got was a ridiculously cramped room which literally felt like a closet. It should have been a one person room. It was so cramped you couldn't even fully open the bathroom door against the bed. Room was really run down and gross. Freezing cold. Bathroom had zero insulation or window seal. Felt like walking into the outdoors at night to use the bathroom. And I'm not one to need much heat. The pictures online are frauds. They were taken of different much nicer rooms than the ones you actually get. Walls are thin. I heard the man next door snoring and using the toilet. We complained and were treated rudely by the front desk staff. After much complaining, we were moved to a better room the next night. But then I realized even more so that we had been scammed and taken advantage of the first night. There are plenty of nicer places to stay for the same rates all over Dublin, trust me and book somewhere else! We still jokingly refer to this hotel as the Closet Hotel or the Coffin Hotel. It was so claustrophobic and cramped. I have pictures of the room I will be posting with the review. ",1,2018,01,09
229,Cute & comfortable boutique hotel,"This is a small boutique hotel conveniently located to the city center. The staff is friendly and helpful, and they go out of their way to be accommodating. The breakfast is included and absolutely delicious, and there is a nice restaurant as well as a sunny cafe inside. The rooms are small and a bit old, but not out of the ordinary for a boutique European hotel. Just be aware, if you come around the December holidays, they are closed for Christmas and will not reopen until noon on December 27th!",4,2018,01,06
229,Beautiful hotel,I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin for the first time. It’s not fair from centre of the city. It you can walk most places in the Dublin. The rooms are beautiful and comfortable for the price. The free WiFi for travellers is great on a budget. The staff are very polite and are very knowledgeable about their city. ,5,2018,01,04
229,Great Experience,"Location was conveniently close to the shops and restaurants.  Staff were very helpful and could provide great advice.  Met the owner who was a very nice man with great enthusiasm for the hotel and the city.  
Would highly recommend staying in Castle Hotel for a stress free trip to Dublin.",5,2018,01,03
229,new year break,"just back from 5 nights in the castle hotel with my wife,found are room and bathroom a little small but very clean and comfortable.the staff where very friendly and helpful, also the hotel had a nice bar and café the breakfast was decent though a little busy probably because of time of year ,we where in a room next to lift and creaky stairs so heard everyone coming in at all hours which wasn't great but I wouldn't like to put anyone off staying in the castle but doubt we will go back maybe better just for short stay",3,2018,01,03
229,Central Location with Great Evening Staff,"A unique hotel spliced together out of Georgian townhouses it occupies a strategic position, only a block from Parnell Square.You can browse O'Connell street and be back in minutes.It is convienent to the GPO, O'Connell Bridge, Conolly Station,Tourist offices and Airport busses. My room was a good size and a bargin at under $100US per night. This included a hot full Irish restaurant breakfast. The lobby was particullary beautiful as it was made up of former Georgian drawing rooms. My one complaint was that the former townhouse court yards are being used for smokers to step out. They talk loudly on cell phones and the soud echoes off the brick walls. Posting a ""Quiet Sign"" could easily remedy this situation. I dealt mostly with evening staff who were friendlyand helpful, especially Claudis who even helped me with my airline reservations. I siue hope mgt appreciates what great employees they have.",5,2018,01,01
229,Perfect hotel for a short visit to Dublin,"The hotel was great value and location for our short visit to Dublin. The hotel was clean, well equipped and the breakfast was great. All the staff were very friendly and i would definitely return if visiting the city centre again. The only downfall was that the walls/ceilings are very thin and the noise from adjoining rooms did wake us during the night. ",4,2018,01,01
229,Very nice and cosy hotel - but thin walls,"Castle Hotel is a nice hotel and very cosy in the winter times around the holidays. My boyfriend and I stayed for two nights at this hotel on a citytrip to Dublin. The hotel has a lot of character and is very clean! 

The breakfast was average. A lot of Irish breakfast choices, but that's not really our taste, so we went for the little breads with honey or jam or some cereals and fruit. Overall it was certainly okay, the coffee was great by the way!! 

Only disadvantage in our eyes was the super thin walls. We had a room at the 3rd floor facing the main street where a lot of busses pass until somewhere in the night time. There was a lot of noise from the street, we couldn't sleep because of it and luckily had some ear plugs with us, which tempered the noise. 
We think it's only the same in some of the rooms, because we read the reviews and not all people had a room with noise. So, I think we just got a little unlucky with the room choice.

Overall a nice hotel, friendly staff and very clean, which we think is very important! Nice shower, good and big bed!",4,2017,12,27
229,I LOVED this place,"I cannot believe what a great hotel this is. A real bargain. I can't say enough good things about this hotel: breakfast is eggs, meat, pastries, cereal, tomato, and coffee/tea. WiFi was great. Beds, linens, pillows, towels, bathroom (stall shower only), room size, were all above average. Old building that's been renovated and modernized (ie: elevator added). Location was excellent. Staff was incredibly helpful. I am a very critical guest. Read my other reviews. I would definitely stay here again. Why are you still reading this? Book the room already!",5,2017,12,26
229,"Good location and service and above all ""The Vault!","What I remember most of all is the pub ""The vault""! The room was quite OK. Not that we spent a lot of time there as we went almost every night in the pub ""The Vault"" (I hope that i remeber the name correctly), located in the basement of the hotel. Very nice local and other music and nothing wrong with the food and drink. The closest I come to a complaint is that the breakfast meant some queing. I will consider it seriously if we go to Dublin again.",4,2017,12,25
229,A beautiful and comfortable stay,"I spend a week in Castle Hotel. This was my first time in Dublin and I already know that this is the hotel I will return to next time I visit Dublin.

I had a small room but it was very clean and tidy. The hotel has a lot of nice places to sit down so the size of my room did not matter at all. Breakfast is great, just as diner. 

The best thing about the hotel is it’s staff. From the cleaning lady to it’s actual boss, all were very nice to me and made my stay more then excellent.

If you want a hotel where you can relax, feel at home and don’t want to worry about your day to day problems, this is the place to be!",5,2017,12,24
229,Sounds much better than it is,"I read the reviews on this hotel and booked for 2 nights. The location is ok, walking to most tourist stuff. The room I got had very old beds, minimal sleets and blankets (if you roll over you lose the covers), and no heat/AC controls. My room felt in heated. My room smelled of mold and the bathroom was harsh, no tub (just a curtain and hand held sprayer),  very bare. Car park is tiny and hard to maneuver anything larger than a motorcycle. 

Staff were ok, they refunded my 2nd night without a hassle. ",2,2017,12,23
229,Charming Centrally Located Hotel,"Awesome place to stay in Dublin. Charming architecture and decor with narrow winding hallways and tons of lovely sitting rooms. The hotel was apparently built in 1809, so it’s got that old-World charm that someone from California (me), where nothing is more than 100 years old, really appreciates. 

The clean and comfortable rooms were more spacious than expected. Staff was very kind and helpful. Breakfast was delicious and hearty every morning.

15 minute walk from Temple Bar and all the shops and restaurants along O’Connell Street are a few steps out the door. I would definitely stay again! ",5,2017,12,20
229,Excellent ,"What a lovely hotel lovely staff lovely clean and comfortable,very good WiFi,met Finn the owner what a wonderful man he was,I cannot fault our stay here! The beds were really comfortable,also live music in the vaults bar every night great craic!",5,2017,12,13
229,Excellent!,"We stayed at the Castle Hotel for 4 nights. The staff were very friendly, the hotel was clean, the bed was comfortable and breakfast was excellent! The Christmas decorations transformed the core of the hotel into a cozy and colourful interior. Many thanks and keep up the good work! :)",5,2017,12,11
229,Christmas Shopping Trip,"Went with some friends for a few nights away.  Hotel is excellent, very comfortable, staff very helpful and friendly.  Breakfast was excellent, plenty of choice, fresh fruit, hot english breakfast and also continental choices. Food in the evening was also very good and was also accompanied by live Irish Music.  Five minute walk to the Hop on/off Bus and only ten minutes to get to the lively Temple Bar Area.  The new National Gallery which is free entry is also well worth visiting and while there enjoy a delicious cake and cup of tea in their Cafe",5,2017,12,10
229,"Lovely Quaint Hotel,close to everything!","I stayed here for only 2 days but it is a beautiful Hotel and the staff could not have been more friendly or knowledgeable. Always willing to answer a question with a smile! I had mentioned in passing that this trip was celebrating my birthday and was so surprised to come back from a day of sightseeing,to find my door decorated and balloons/card on my bed from all the staff wishing me a Happy Birthday!!! I would recommend this Hotel to anyone travelling to Dublin and would stay here if/when I return!",5,2017,12,09
229,Little gem,"Found this little gem on trip advisor......great location.....extremely comfortable and clean rooms.....good food.....great staff and service throughout.......the one problem was I didn’t book for long enough! Super location for a super city.
Thankyou Dublin and the Castle Hotel I will be back for more of the Irish welcome 
",5,2017,12,08
229,second stay here,"this was my second stay at the Castle Hotel and once again cant fault anything with the hotel. Location was really good 10 minute walk to the main temple bar area so easy accessibility but quiet enough away from the hustle and bustle. Rooms very big and clean, Breakfast was lovely in their music restaurant full English breakfast and Continental so wide choice. Hotel staff very friendly and helpful. Would not hesitate to recommend the hotel.",5,2017,12,07
229,Nice hotel in good location,"We spent here 4 nights on our city holiday. Clean and nice hotel, perfect location (walking distance to downtown + bus stops next to hotel). Good service and breakfast. Don't forget the bar in downstairs!",5,2017,12,07
229,Good location and nice hotel + don't miss Ray Cox in the pub!,"We spent three nights at Castle Hotel. While our room was a bit small and quaint (radiator heat), it was comfortable. Breakfast was serviceable, but nothing to get excited about. And supper, at the connected Music Inn, was OK. Note: because we had booked directly with the hotel, on check in they gave us a coupon for 15 Euros at the Inn.

The hotel is a 15 minute walk north of the O'Connell St. bridge, a nice location with lots of buses and a tram nearby. If you book a Mary Gibbons Newgrange tour, the pickup is 5 mins walk.

One night there was a party going on in the courtyard behind the hotel and everyone on our side of the building could hear it well past midnight. However, a call to the front desk resulted in the party moving inside.

The highlight of our stay was Saturday evening with singer, multi-instrumentalist and storyteller Ray Cox in The Vault, the Castle Hotel's pub. Ray was very entertaining, even tho he had a sore throat. Ray also is a regular at another pub in town--check out his traditional Irish ballad show if you have a chance.",4,2017,12,06
229,Lovely hotel with friendly service - shame about the plumbing!,"Stayed 2 nights over the weekend and found the hotel very welcoming. Bedrooms were fine but the towel rail did not heat up and shaving light did not work. Despite reporting twice nothing was done. Windows were old style sash and let in the draft. Staff were great, breakfast was excellent and the cellar bar provided excellent entertainment. Room prices I thought very expensive but I gather all decent hotels in Dublin have this issue.",4,2017,12,04
229,Lovely introduction to Ireland,"I had a surprise long weekend treat to Ireland and my partner selected this hotel, I'm very glad he did. The room and bed were very clean and comfortable. The hotel has plenty to offer from the great breakfast, the food is delicious and the staff work well under pressure and very helpful. The cellar bar is well stocked and the menu that lovely we ate there all 3 nights. We ate in the restaurant Saturday night, beautiful surroundings. Cocktail and dinner a delight. I sat in one of the many lounges on rainy Saturday afternoon with my cake and coffee bought in the old music shop, while reading my book, bliss. Live Irish entertainment every night, we never went anywhere else. Very lovely trip, memorable.",5,2017,12,03
229,"Good, but not great","We wanted to stay in Dublin City Center on our last night in Ireland, so we hopped online to find a deal on a hotel.  Unfortunately, we couldn't find anything under $200 USD per night and ended up choosing the Castle Hotel because it was the cheapest rate with the highest customer rating we could find. The front desk staff were friendly and attentive, and the hotel was clean, but it was like a maze trying to find our room. And in typical European style, there were stairs everywhere, which is extremely inconvenient when you're carrying heavy luggage (there was a lift to take you to the main floor, but still small sets of stairs in the hallways). We registered for a double room, and the first room they gave us had four single beds.  They happily changed our room, which was nice. We found the mattresses to be mostly firm and uncomfortable.  If going to Dublin again, I would choose another hotel",3,2017,11,28
229,Warmest welcome ,"On arrival to the castle hotel we were given the warmest welcome very friendly staff we arrived earlier then the booking in time so stored and cases in a baggage room and had a walk down to       o connell street which is a short 5 min walk to the main shopping area.

The hotel is very clean and well presented with lots of charm and character.

The bedroom was a nice size with a small bathroom with a walk in shower which worked well.

Would recommend this hotel central but not close to the noisey areas the road outside is busy so front bedroom can be noise if alite sleeper.

",4,2017,11,27
229,Charming Ireland experience,"We loved this hotel! Perfect place to start and end our daily jaunts around the country! Breakfast was just right and filling. Very kind and helpful people at the front desk. They will help to steer you in the direction you want to go, make reservations for you, find an available bus tour or reserve a spot in the pub crawl. The Vault for dinner and drinks after a day of exploring. Excellent food, people and music! The feel is quaint, charming and fun with all the doors, stairways, levels, design, furniture and pictures. Comfortable and cute. Easy walking distance to anywhere.",5,2017,11,26
229,Short Visit,"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights and it was great. Only a short walk to the main areas of interest but still quiet and tucked away to avoid the noice of a city centre. We had a room to the front of the building which did get noisy, however, once the windows were closed the noise was left outside and we were cozy in a clean and airy room which was excellent for us as we didn’t plan on spending much time in there. 

The staff throughout our stay were brilliant and very helpful. The bar (Vaults Bar) had a great atmosphere with live music and tasty food with all types of beers, but for me it was Guinness every time. 

My only, little moan would be during breakfast. Sometimes we were crammed in like sardines and although the food was lovely I felt that only 2 - 3 inches between tables was not enough. (Moan over)Go early and beat the rush. 

Overall this is a great hotel with super staff and in an excellent place. Highly recommended.  

",4,2017,11,23
229,Not  one for the walking impaired,This was our first visit to this hotel and to be honest it will be our last. The hotel itself is fine as long as you don't have difficulty with steps and stairs as it is spread across 3 town houses with various floor levels. It is not readily accessible for anyone in a wheelchair although there are some ramped areas at the rear  of the ground floor.  Access to the lift would be difficult for a wheelchair user.   The room we had was at best alright   it was a bit tucked away at the front of the hotel in a tight  little ante room off the main landing. Again up two steps  and down three steps  due to the many different levels previously mentioned.The room doors are standard front doors with yale type key locks which to be honest looked like they had been forced open at some point. There was no means of locking the door from the inside  as the deadlock  button had been removed and there was no chain lock in place and nowhere on the outside to hang the  DO NOT DISTURB notice.  That's no big deal you might think but when the lavatory door is directly opposite the room access  and the house keeping let themselves in whilst you are in the bathroom....as happened to us  then it IS a big deal The room was clean  tidy and reasonable in size but quite narrow the bathroom was COMPACT and really tight   definitely not for sharing.  Obviously with the townhouse design the rooms are fitted to the available layout and to be fair they are fine  just not that spacious.  At  the reception area the hotel staff whilst polite and professional were a little stand offish and didn't really interact with us a guests. That may suit some folk however I found it quite off putting. Breakfast was included in our package but it was never a relaxed affair as the cramped breakfast room was quite busy and cluttered. The buffet  style meant  there were a lot of people moving around and privacy was not possible. One thing that really got me was the on site parking at the hotel.  It was extremely tight  being located up a narrow alleyway and into a 90 degree turn through a gate into a tight courtyard  full of cars. Add to that the cost of 15 Euro a day to park there and you can see how it soured a stay somewhat. I  do realise that  parking is at a premium in  Dublin but I have never actually had to pay for a car parking in any  other hotel I have ever stayed at.,3,2017,11,18
229,Comfortable Stay,"The Castle Hotel offers comfortable accommodations, a full Irish breakfast at a very competitive rate. The hotel is in a less touristy part of town on the north side near O'Connell, but still near a few interesting attractions like the James Joyce house, Irish Writers Museum, etc. It is still close enough to the main tour bus routes (i.e., green, red, blue) to be within walking distance of one or more of their stops. The room we had was small, but clean and comfortable. As an older hotel, our room did not have A/C which wasn't a problem since it was November, but I could see it being an issue in the summer months. The breakfast in the main floor restaurant was great and gets quite crowded towards 9am so best to get there early.",4,2017,11,17
229,Gem,"Arrived on an early morning flight at 10am and our room was ready which was an unexpected surprise as check in wasnt until 230 so were able to unpack , have a coffee and head out .The staff were so friendly .The rooms were clean and comfy beds and pillows too . We had a full cooked breakfast every morning ,delicious . Didn't have dinner in the hotel but we did have late night drinks in the Vaults bar which had live entertainment.A quirky hotel which I loved and would highly recommend",5,2017,11,17
229,Awful view,"I went  to the Castle hotel last July with a friend, I thought it would be nice to return with my husband. The room we were given was on the first floor, there was no view which made the room dark. The bathroom had a walk in shower which after a shower made the floor really wet, this did not dry out until the morning. I thought as a returning customer We would get a better room than this. The food for breakfast was not as good as last year. On our last night there was a large group of British people who spoilt the evening as they did not want to split the bill but wanted individual bills, the manager kept his cool and the party sorted their bills out between them right down to the last cents. How people with money can act like this shows them up. Not all British are like this",3,2017,11,16
229,So so stay,"The castle hotel was an interesting building that definitely would have been very cool in its day. Our stay was fine, the beds we're comfortable and really that's what matters. However our room was on the top floor and just a bit too crowded with un-needed furniture...we couldn't open the bathroom door the entire way because it hit the bed. It was also a little noisy as the walls into the hallway seemed paper thin. However, not a deal breaker. The staff we encountered in the restaurant was very helpful and very kind so that was very nice, but if you would change up the breakfast regularly that would be nice. The only thing that really annoyed me was that the reception staff were just not very friendly. I literally stood at the desk for a minute before someone even acknowledged me when I said hello. I just feel as though they should have been more polite and friendly.",4,2017,11,13
229,Best staff and very happy.,Went with my boyfriend to meet family that now live in this great city and our stay was just perfect and the wonderful staff of Castle hotel looked after us and treated us so well. Rooms are beautiful but not new or modern but still lovely. Our preferred hotel when we go back to Dublin.,5,2017,11,13
229,Perfect Place for a Short Stay in Dublin,"Booked for a 3 night stay in Dublin, took the deal offered,inc.full Irish breakfast at the right price and was very pleased. Superior rooms ok(although not quite superior),but overall stay excellent.Staff all helpful ,attentive and friendly,breakfast good value and good quality,served on an assisted buffet counter,but plentiful and non restrictive. Used Cellar Bar for 2 evenings,drinks/dinner/more drinks/Irish ballad singer, a very pleasant atmosphere,nice food,pleasant staff,fair prices(for Dublin).
Overall a super location in a quirky,converted old Georgian row of buildings,some allowance needs to be made for the restrictions of the old building, but it really just adds to the ""Craic"" !
Sited just above the start of O'Connell St. in north Dublin,it it perfect for exploring all Dublin has to offer. Would visit again without hesitation.",5,2017,11,11
229,"Classic, charming hotel","Stayed at this hotel while having a few days in Dublin and found it to be perfect for a solo traveller. Slightly pricey but it is in an ideal location - within walking distance to the city centre. Bed was comfortable and I had a good night's sleep each night. The room was tidy, not too big nor small, and the shower was excellent. The hotel could probably do with some re-decoration, but at the same time, it is quirky and characterful.",4,2017,11,10
229,Nice change from the chain hotels ,"Trip for business and I’m usually booked in one of the big chains. A lovely change quirky hotel based in Georgian buildings very friendly staff, very easy check in. Clean rooms with tea/ coffee facilities. 
Perfectly situated to roam in spare time. Great cooked breakfast would definitely use again.
They also have restaurant in vaulted cellar with music if you don’t want to venture out.",5,2017,11,09
229,Needs improving,"I booked this hotel based on the pictures on the internet of their superior double rooms.  When we arrived it was clear our room was nothing like the pictures therefore I approached reception and asked to be moved as I hadn't been given a room I was expecting.  I was then moved to room 151 which was much brighter and spacious as I had expected however this still came with issues.  The television didn't work and the sink didn't drain which was most unpleasant.  
Breakfast was OK however the tables are very close together which meant it was hard to have any sort of private conversation.
The hotel staff were lovely and friendly and I am sure this hotel could be lovely however the rooms need updating and the little details checking.  Great location to explore the delights of Dublin though",3,2017,11,09
229,50th birthday trip ,"Lovely cosy hotel to stay in, I stayed for 3 nights with my friends. My room was a single room it was very clean and tidy, and breakfast was great. The music at night in the castle vault was fantastic too. The location was not to far. Good walking exercise.
I will rebook this hotel if I came back to Dublin ",5,2017,11,09
229,Excellent ,"Had a excellent stay hotel lovely staff all lovely very cheerful ,helpful and would def stay here again and recommend to others also very central to all attractions and pubs breakfast a lovely surprise too x",5,2017,11,07
229,A perfect Dublin retreat,"We needed a place to end our two weeks of driving all over Ireland before flying home, and this property fit the bill. The location was good, at one end of Connell Street, but away from the crowds. And they have parking (Not the easiest thing to find in the city), breakfast and a restaurant with live music every night. The rooms are just big enough, with modern bathrooms, and windows that open! The public rooms are huge and furnished with antiques, and there is a lovely garden in the back where you can escape the city.  Breakfast was a huge buffet, and personnel were friendly and helpful. We had intended to spend a night in the Temple Bar area to hear some more good music, but both nights we spent in Dublin, we had dinner in the hotel restaurant then stayed to hear the music, which was actually some of the best we heard in all of Ireland! All reasonably priced, too!",5,2017,11,02
229,4 day stay ,"We chose this hotel as a base for touring out of Dublin,and we weren't disappointed. Lovely and clean , fresh towels and toiletries every day . Dinner is served downstairs in the vaults where live music is played ( a guy playing acoustic guitar and singing a range of songs was playing when we visited - he was very good)  the meals they served were excellent but alas a bit pricey ( expect to pay about €22 for a pizza   and  a pint ! ) breakfast is served up some stairs in "" the old music room""  again lovely and clean and staff very helpful. We booked an early breakfast (5.30)  which is self service and continental . They serve a cooked ""english"" breakfast from 7am onwards . Everyone was very helpful ,booking taxis etc. Will definitely stay here again",5,2017,11,02
229,lovely old time dublin hotel,"As I was a solo traveller, with 3 nights in Dublin I didnt was to spend EUR300  a night and chose the Castle Hotel, as it appeared cute and well located.  I was right, it was honestly lovely, Room was smallish, but i didnt care about that.  Location was spot on, quick walk down to O'Connell Street.  The Castle 'Vault"" was a terrific little restaurant in the basement, with an Irish singer every night at 9pm.  Food was excellent and singer was great.  Would definitely stay again",4,2017,11,02
229,Very clean and good service,"We arrived the morning of Hurricane Ophelia and Dublin was in lock down but the hotel staff were brilliant, very safety conscious.  The hotel room was very clean and there was entertainment every night.  the evening meal was very good.  The breakfast was a bit of a hit and miss affair though with bread rolls not available 2 of the 4 days we were there but the service was fast and efficient.",5,2017,10,31
229,"What I expected for the price point. A very old, charming hotel.","My daughter picked this hotel for us due to it's proximity to the center of Dublin, and she definitely scored on that one. It was easy walking distance to literally everything, yet up a couple blocks from the center of Dublin so you didn't get the traffic and pedestrian noise. The hotel is very old and charming, with some of the period features still intact (like separate faucets in the sink for hot and cold water - that one took some getting used to!) and while it didn't have a lot of modern amenities, it did provide free wi-fi. We were really only there to sleep, and the bed was comfortable and I had no problems sleeping like I usually do when I'm travelling away from home. Our room had a double bed and a single, but no closet or anywhere to put our luggage, so it was good we had the extra bed for storage. The room was clean, the bathroom was clean and had the usual amenities - soap, body/hair wash. What did strike me odd is that the shower head was on the long wall instead of at the front or back of the tub. Also, this hotel did not provide facecloths which I thought was odd but I made do without.

One thing I did not like about the room was that there was no air-conditioning unit, just an old steam heater. It was unseasonably warm when we were there, and being on the 4th floor it was hard to keep the room comfortable. There was only 1 window, and it opened out instead of up, only about 3 - 4 inches so not much air made its way in. I had to leave the window open even at night, because if I closed it the room got way too warm. Thankfully our room did not face the street so we didn't have much of an issue with noise. 

Another thing is that the walls are VERY thin. I could hear the TV from the room next door, and at times could hear them talking even though they seemed to be talking in a normal tone of voice. The TV didn't get that many channels, which was fine for us seeing that we weren't in the room much at all.

We ate in both restaurants. The Cellar Vault did not have a huge menu, but what we did order was good and we enjoyed our meal. The entertainment was enjoyable also. We did take advantage of the free buffet breakfast and is was pretty good also. 

Hotel staff was friendly and accomodating. The hairdryer provided in the room died while we were trying to get ready to leave for a tour, and they had another one in my room within a few minutes despite the fact that it was only 6:30 am. 

This is definitely NOT the place I would go if I had young kids. Maybe the bigger rooms are more set up for families, but given the other characteristics of the hotel it just didn't strike me as a family place. Would I stay her again? Yes, but we spent so much time in the areas closer to the river and Temple Bar that I may pick a place a little closer to that.",3,2017,10,28
229,Worst  breakfast,Good location..Room was clean and tidy Restaurant  with live music every night . Staff in restaurant  were excellent  .Staff on reception were not professional  in fact we were left in lounge awaiting  for our room to be ready.  This was at 2 45. Breakfast was awfull....scrambled eggs were tasteless.and the sausage was even worse and well the bacon wasn't even cooked. Worst  breakfast ever.    We had to ask for tea and coffee the staff were so busy talking about going on holidays  ignoring quests .   Don't think we would stay here again     think there are other hotels in area that would like my custom ,5,2017,10,27
229,Port in a Storm – Fabulous Gem,"We were caught up in Hurricane Ophelia, we had already checked out of our original Hotel in the morning before flights were cancelled later in the day.  As a party of six we were finding it increasingly difficult to find accommodation.  One couple managed to secure a room in our original hotel but there was no more room at the Inn.  After trying a couple of other Hotels in the vicinity we decided to try The Castle, a hotel we walked passed each day without taking much notice.  What a gem, the staff were so helpful and understanding and although the Hotel was full to capacity they managed to squeeze us in.  What a fabulous Hotel so warm and cosy in true Mansion House style, the rooms were spotlessly clean, beds and pillows were really comfortable, everything was provided, toiletries, tea and coffee, chocolate on the pillow, couldn’t ask for more.  The breakfast was great everything you could ask for tea, coffee, eggs, bacon, sausage, black/white pudding etc... nothing was too much trouble.  The Vaults bar in the basement was another little gem serving lovely food.  After such a stressful couple of hours re-arranging flights and hotels this was the perfect place to sit back and relax.  The location of this Hotel at the top of O’Connell Street/Parnell Square was great the hop on hop off bus is just around the corner and everything is very easily accessible, 10/15 minute walk down to the Temple Bar area.

Thank you Castle Hotel for your generous hospitality and thank you again to the reception staff who were amazing that day and went the extra mile.",5,2017,10,27
229,Lovely Cosy Hotel,We stayed for 3 nights and thought the hotel was lovely.  It has a very welcoming feel to it.  There are lots of little nooks and crannies to explore.  There is plenty of seating areas if you just want to sit and chill after a long day of exploring Dublin.  Our room was clean and comfortable.  The shower was a little cranky - either too hot or too cold but we didn't get too fussed by it.  The lovely white and fluffy towels were a huge bonus.  Breakfast is very good - plenty of hot items and pastries and fruit too.  We would definitely stay again.  The location is very good - a short walk to the centre of Dublin and the airport bus was a stones throw from the hotel.  The staff are all very pleasant - especially the lovely staff at breakfast.,4,2017,10,24
229,Green tiles make an Irish hotel,"We stayed at Castle Hotel in Dublin.   lots of history is attached to this building - and there are many corridors and lounge areas for guests to use.  Search and you will also find the castle vaults for whiskey and music.  Our room was on 4th floor - small but there were three lots of windows - double glazed but able to be opened.  Quiet and comfortable.  

The only negative belongs to the green en suite - the tiles were lovely but the water pressure was the other story.  Very low pressure and temperature was variable during each shower - but somehow were coped and emerged well presented.  Overall good value for money - especially because we walked everywhere - and saw heaps!",4,2017,10,23
229,3 Night Break. What's not to like ?,"Travelled with friends for a three night stay. 

Arrived Wednesday afternoon and we were allocated a room on the second floor while our travelling friends were on the first floor. 

Took the lift to the rooms but hardly used this afterwards as the stairs were well located at the entrance to the Restaurant and Bar. 

Room was tidy and overlooked the small car park and courtyard so minimal night time noise.

Only thing that was slightly concerning was the cigarette smell in our corridor until it became apparent that some rooms are smoking bedrooms. !!! Not overpowering but to non smokers it was noticeable.

Breakfast service was efficient, tea, coffee brought to the table and the normal selection available . Cereals , fruit , yogurt etc and the hot food served over a counter with a smile. 

We also dined in the Resturant one night and again the service and food was spot on. 

The downstairs Bar was well served by John in his pleasant busy way and he took the effort to find out our names and welcomed us every time we frequented the bar . 

Front of house staff friendly and professional in everything they did. 

Location of the Hotel is superb in our opinion , and as we caught the local bus from the Airport at he cost of €3.30 per person and the bus passes right past 
As we were rushed for time on our return to the Airport on checking out the reception staff organised a taxi for us at a very reasonable cost of €20 . 

It's a Ten minute walk down to the centre and a quiet location so would have no hesitation staying here again or recommending it to anyone else.",5,2017,10,22
229,Great location,"We chose the Castle Hotel mostly for its proximity to sights we wanted to see in a very short time in the city.  It didn't disappoint.  We also found the front office staff very helpful when arranging for a taxi to take 4 of us + luggage back to the airport.  Breakfast was a very nice spread. Another reviewer described it as ""quirky"", and you can definitely tell there have been additions to the hotel when the hallways bend and change. But we found that a little bit endearing.",4,2017,10,17
229,Not a hotel for anyone with walking issues,"Long narrow hallways and lots of stairs, easy to get lost in. Doors and stairs connect building to make one hotel now.  You may get off the lift on the second floor and have to navigate down three different hallways with doors and stairs to get to your room on the 2nd floor. Very clean and comfortable rooms, so if you can walk fine it's a nice place to stay.",3,2017,10,16
229,An average hotel,"Although the hotel was clean, it was a bit expensive for the room offered. Definitely not the one that was shown on the website, felt that we were second class visitors having booked with a third party site.",3,2017,10,16
229,Terrible customer service,"While the staff in the bar, restaurant, and reception were very nice, when my camera was stolen out of my room last month no one from management contacted me about the incident even after I wrote twice to ask them what was happening on the case. I am working with the Dublin police. It is my understanding several rooms were robbed that day. Anyway, while I realize that the hotel is not responsible for my valuables they are responsible for my security. A simple note of apology would have been so appreciated.",1,2017,10,12
229,Good value and location,"The staff was friendly. The bed was very comfortable. Breakfast at the Old Music Shop had a wide selection. The food was good and they were very fast. The location is a short walk to a major bus stop making it easy to get around the city. Even though there is an elevator, still had to carry our luggage up some stairs to get to the room.",3,2017,10,08
229,"Charming hotel, super friendly staff","I loved staying at this beautiful hotel. Every room is a little different, and full of charm.  My room was on the second floor, on the busier side of the hotel (facing Gardiner Row), and therefore there was some street noise during the day.  It got quieter as it got later in the evening, and I had no problem sleeping.  (You might want to ask for a room facing the courtyard if you are a light sleeper, however). My room had all I needed, and the bed was extremely comfortable.  

Included breakfast was fresh and tasty and the breakfast staff was quick and friendly.  The bar in the downstairs area really comes alive at night with live music, and there are several areas on the main floor to sit back, relax, and read a book.

The Castle Hotel is very close to the hustle and bustle of the city, but just far enough to not be in the midst of it. Dublin Writers Museum, Garden of Remembrance, and The Hugh Lane Gallery (beautiful exhibition!) are right across the street. I walked to Temple Bar in about 15 minutes, which I found really convenient.

All in all, I would definitely stay here again when visiting Dublin!

I would also like to thank the reception staff, Roxy in particular, for making my birthday unforgettable.  You're the best!",5,2017,10,08
229,Please stay here,"Lovely sums up this hotel. The staff are so friendly and helpful, the room was huge, the beds were comfy. Because this hotel is about 15min walk from the main drinking areas it is quiet at night in the rooms with virtually no noise from the street. It has a lovely bistro style restaurant on the ground floor with a very lively bar and full restaurant downstairs in the vaults. The buffet breakfast selection is superb with all you could wish for from fresh fruit, cereals and cooked options The airport shuttle bus stops are extremely close to this hotel which makes getting too and from it so easy.",5,2017,10,07
229,Weekend in Dublin,"Lovely weekend- Castle is a good base and staff were very friendly and helpful. 
Fairly spacious, comfortable room. 
Fun entertainment in restaurant/bar - good singalong to songs my dad used to play when I was little!",4,2017,10,05
229,Patrick Hanway ,Went to Castle Hotel for dinner staff were nice service was ok the steak was only ok my partner had the fish we had the special two corse for €21 we had a main and a dessert my wife had the New York cheese cake terrible won’t be going back again and €7.50 a glass of white wine ,3,2017,10,04
229,The Castle Vaults,"We weren't staying at the hotel but went to the Castle Vaults restaurant having seen great reviews and photos on the Open Table app. What a fabulous bar and restaurant! 

Upon arrival, there appeared to be no confirmation of our reservation, but luckily there were plenty of free tables – and we were given the option of sitting in the lounge area, or in the restaurant. We chose the latter, which really was the vault and such a unique experience. 

Although there's a set menu, we both decided to go a la carte and opted for the 10oz sirloin steak, which came served with chunky chips, peppercorn sauce and a lovely selection of pan-fried vegetables (onion, green beans and mushroom). The steak was cooked perfectly and the sauce was the perfect consistency – I just wish there was more of it, as I like it with my chips as well as meat. The portions were very large so we didn't have room for dessert and instead retired to the lounge area for another drink, which was great as there was a live singer that night. We didn’t stay for his whole set, as I was tiring, but it really was enjoyable. He took requests as well as playing popular folk songs. The lounge had a great atmosphere, definitely made better by the music and the sofas were too comfortable, I didn’t want to get up!

The prices were reasonable and I had a really enjoyable evening. If we were staying at the hotel, I’m sure we would have eaten there anyway. We did have to wait a while originally to order, but overall the experience was positive.",5,2017,10,04
229,Fantastic!,Absolutely beautiful hotel. Furnished gorgeously throughout and the bedroom was fantastic. Lovely four poster bed and high ceilings and fantastic full breakfast included. The staff also Left balloons and a birthday card for my partners birthday too which was a lovely touch. Would definitely go back!,5,2017,10,02
229,First trip to Dublin,"Couldn't have chosen a better place to stay for our first visit to Dublin, from the moment we arrived the staff were excellent. Such a warm welcome despite our delayed flight meaning we reached the hotel at 10 p.m. Their warm greeting was a real lift.  The room was great, the bed so comfortable that in the morning we both felt ready for our sightseeing! 

The cellar bar/ restaurant provided an excellent atmosphere as well as serving delicious food and local ales and spirits to accompany the evening entertainment. 
My only minus was the breakfast.  Not the food or portion size but it could have been hotter. I've never been a fan of canteen style serving. Self service with covered containers always seems to keep the food hotter.  This is only a minor thing and certainly wouldn't stop me staying here again! ",5,2017,10,02
229,I loved this hotel,"This is a great hotel. The front desk staff are amazing, very helpful, very friendly, very professional. A special thank you to Emmett, Cladeau, Gillian and the lady who helped us with our printing! The breakfasts were very good, dinner in the Cellar bar and restaurant was also very good. Paddy Brown the singer on Tuesday and Friday in the cellar is fabulous! We had a great time Paddy! Thank you The rooms were very clean, very comfortable and well appointment. It was a very short walk down O'Connell Street to the Temple Bar area and all the attractions are within an easy walk as well. I would definitely recommend this hotel and I plan on going back next year. Thanks to a great experience!",5,2017,10,01
229,Nice period features and friendly staff,"Upon arrival we were greeted by a friendly and professional person at the desk, but then we were surprised to get a personal welcome from the proprietor. 
The hotel itself is full of period features in keeping with the Georgian terrace that it is in. The stairs creak and the floors have interesting slopes, but that's the point of this place and I liked it.
Breakfast was down in the Old Music Shop which there was an access from inside the hotel and it was run like a military operation. It needed to be, the place was heaving with people. There is a traffic light sign to let you know the busiest to the quietest times for breakfast, but whatever time we went there was a couple of minutes wait for the table.
Food in general was good. The breakfast was your normal hotel breakfast, whereas the food of an evening was much more impressive. My goats cheese and walnut salad starter is something that I will remember.
The staff at the desk kindly organised our taxi to the airport for us and it arrived on time. 
The location is convenient with short walks to get to most of the restaurants and shops. We walked to the National Botanical Gardens (30 minutes), Trinity College (15 minutes) and the high street (20 minutes).",4,2017,09,30
229,Lovely Place!,"I had a wonderful stay at the Castle Hotel.  Such a nice place!  Very comfortable, quiet and close to everything.  Affordable and clean with a wonderful breakfast and free wifi throughout the property.  This place was perfectly located for exploring all of Dublin and beyond!",5,2017,09,29
229,Don't bother,"Booked via booking . Co arranged for a vegetarian breakfast , receptionist confirmed this on my arrival .
 Asked to pay on arrival .... I had arrived before 2:30 check in time ..... So having paid I took a walk around Dublin 
Returned at 2:30 room not ready 3:pm taken to room ..... But not ready ........ Given a cup of tea in reception ( had left key in unready room) receptionist accompanied me to room to unlock door and let me in ..... Wrong key waited outside until she returned with correct key
It seems as though the wait was because they  were finishing the bathroom , trying to alter the height of the shower head the whole pole came off the shower door handle needed tightening I gave up after ten minutes of turning, ...it's still loose. Blobs of plaster on the tiles , I scratched most of the paint off the chrome shower tap , the toilet seat is mobile , the door surround is painted , even over a blob of plaster edge of the tiles  exposed ... No plaster filling
One small towel rail  only place to hand dry & wet towels in fact staff just pile them 'attractively' on top
Oh joy o bliss vegetarian breakfast .... 1st morning asked what the substitute for bacon & sausage was ... For vegetarian  ... Nothing . Handed my toast by server , I did not take it instead I produced a plate for her to put it on Made a fuss at reception and vegetarian sausage would be available the following morning .breakfast listed as being served from 7am... No cooked breakfast evident ..... Joined the que at 7:15 for cooked breakfast  asked for vegetarian sausage ..... Server had no idea , chose egg mushrooms and beans .... Plate cold ,nearly finished eating 
Vegetarian sausage arrived .... I have yet to be asked room number  and second morning I managed to attract servers eye and asked for tea which she brought , leaving empty cereal bowl , all servers were running around like headless chickens being unproductive, no cohesion at all. Room extremely warm , did get a fan tiny open aperture opening  window. Tried to phone reception ... Phone not working ,room information folder advised fire evacuation and to consult instructions on back of door ....... But no instructions on my room door

229,Historic urban charm,First time visitor to the Castle Hotel. Reception staff were very nice and helpful as were restaurant staff.  It is an old hotel so it has all the related charm such a creaking floorboards. No buff limestone panels or stainless steel!!  The resturant food was a delight.   Good value in the city is hard to find so I was pleased. Street noise does penetrate the rooms a bit.  Rooms are basic but very clean and a nice new bed. Very central which is great.,4,2017,09,28
229,Perfect Location,"I was in the hotel in August 2017 for 5 days and we had a fantastic time all the staff were very friendly and helpful especailly Brendon at the bar, the food was excellent, room was cosy and clean only issue I had was the curtain pole everytime I closed the curtain the pole fell down, I reported it however the maintenance man came in and tightened the brackets, it was actually a knob for the end of the pole that was required it took a few visits before this was sorted correctly, however it became a fun joke with everyone in the hotel.  I would go back to the same hotel again as it was ideal",5,2017,09,28
229,Dinner out,Went to the vault restaurant for an evening meal. Great food and service from the manager Brendan.Singer in the bar afterwards was very good and had a few pints of the black stuff to go with the meal.,4,2017,09,27
229,A cosy base in the heart of Dublin,"This wonderful, cosy hotel is in the heart of Dublin City and within walking distance of so many of Dublin's highlights. It is old fashioned - which we love - and has several areas for relaxing beyond one's bedroom. Our room was comfortable and a good size. For those who love Irish music, The Vaults Bar and Old Music Shop are a must each evening. It is a great place to meet other residents and have a sing song. The members of staff are friendly and helpful and mad us feel at home.
We will certainly return to this hotel to use as our base, the next time we visit Dublin.",5,2017,09,24
229,11 September ,"Stayed at Castle Hotel last week and we were greeted with a warm welcome with very helpful staff.  Our  room was lovely and spacious very clean and well planned out for guest , great variety for breakfast, would definitely recommend people to stay here , good position to catch buses ",5,2017,09,21
229,Bring Your Own Wash Cloth,"Hotel is old as is the furniture. Beds are ok, breakfast was pretty good but the reason I would NEVER STAY AGAIN is they supply bath towels, Face towels BUT NO WASHCLOTHS!
I couldn't believe it when I called down to tell them my bathroom was missing a washcloth and was informed they don't supply them. 
I am 69 Years old and very well travelled and this has never happened, not once. 
There are many hotels in this area, chose a different one or pack a washcloth. ",2,2017,09,20
229,Short trip ,"Fantastic , very clean , food was really good especially the breakfast loads to choose from , Irish folk music in the bar most nights which was very good , great location for bars restaurants,and shopping definitely be back ",5,2017,09,20
229,Perfect combination of Old & New,"It was our first time in Ireland and I wanted a “step back in time” experience so I chose this hotel, founded in 1809 and was one of the first hotels in Dublin.  

It did not disappoint! The wallpaper, chandeliers, grand staircase, vintage furniture, high ceilings, top to bottom curtains, framed paintings and all the antique accessories they put all around the hotel. It felt incredible to see the same things that people from the 19th century saw.  Despite the age of the hotel, it was well maintained.  They also combined the modern conveniences such as elevator, modern bathroom, WIFI and comfortable beds and luxurious bed sheets.  Our room has the view of the Gothic church across the street. It was confusing to get to the room because we had to go through multiple doors & hallways.  They explained later that they used to be two houses but later combined into one. 

We arrived at the hotel late and at that time the pub kitchen was already closed.  We told them we were hungry so the lady at the pub prepared ham & cheese sandwiches for us (that’s what I call going above & beyond to please a customer).  We also totally enjoyed our first Irish traditional live music at the pub downstairs.

Another reason why I chose this hotel is because of its location.  It is steps away from the meeting place for the “Game of Thrones” location tour that goes to Northern Ireland.  The tour leaves at 6:45 am so it helped that we’re so close.  We asked the hotel staff to prepare ""to-go"" breakfast for us for the early tour and they did.  The others in the tour asked us where we got our coffee & breakfast & they got jealous that our hotel prepared it for us.  The Dublin Tours Hop on Hop off bus also has a stop just around the corner.  It’s a walking distance to Murray’s pub that has live irish dancing and also to the Carroll’s souvenir shop where we bought a lot of souvenirs, cookies & chocolates. 

I commend the front desk staff especially Marcks for all the help contacting Viator (for the tours), directions to sites, arranging our early breakfast, taxi to the airport and responding to all our questions.  Special thank you also to the young lady bartender at the pub.  She was always very welcoming and arranged for us to have dinner when we came really late on our first night.

Our group will always remember your staff and our pleasant experience in Dublin.  If given the chance, we will come back. We’ll surely recommend your hotel to our friends.",5,2017,09,19
229,Wifi? What wifi?,"Hotel was clean and the included breakfast was good. WiFi was included but didn't work our entire stay. Staff said maintenance had to work on it, but maintenance wasn't in. The problem was reported every day of our stay and never resolved. Tried to discuss the problem when checking out and was handed an email address for the manager. With the plethora of lodging available in Dublin, I'd choose someplace else next time.",2,2017,09,18
229,"Good place, great location.","2 stops on Airport Shuttle bus, then 500 mtr walk to hotel. Easy walk to Jamesans Distillery, Universitiy, Park, Temple Bar entertainment district.
Expensive: weekend of All Ireland Football Final, rates dropped huge outside this weekend. Good price then
Rambling hotel,3/4 homes joined to make hotel,carpet over timber floors, lots of character. Rooms to read, relax, wifi which was included & good.
European size (small) rooms, good bed,bathroom. Water pressures ok.
Breakfast, restaurant, bar, staff great. Recommended",4,2017,09,17
229,Showcasing Dublin at its Best!,"From Aug 25 until Sept.7, 2017, my husband and I enjoyed a lovely stay at this very charming, historic and well situated hotel. Although we arrived at six o'clock in the morning, they somehow they managed to have our room ready by mid-morning...a good couple of hours earlier than they had to!  They then escorted us with our luggage to our second floor room using the lift to make sure that everything was in order. This was very much appreciated due to the jet lag  issues that we were experiencing!

Our nicely appointed room, although not air-conditioned,  was very comfortable indeed and came with a desk, two USB ports,  a wardrobe, two wing backed chairs, and a dresser with several drawers. The flat screen TV also worked great as did the telephone for  those early morning wake up calls to go on tours. The noise from the street at night time was a bit of an issue for me due to the single glass pane windows; however, for my husband it was not at all. Bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper like myself. 

The bathroom was a bit on the smaller side but nonetheless more than adequate to meet our needs. The showers were hot with lots of pressure and the towels were changed daily. We also enjoyed eating the chocolate that was left on the pillows  of our freshly made bed upon our return almost every evening. Such a lovely gesture!

The included Irish breakfasts were fabulous with lots of different healthy choices to choose from! We found the service to be excellent no matter whether we went at 7 AM or 9:30 AM.  Because I had developed such a sore throat and cold while I was in Ireland, a  young waiter made sure that I had lemon, ginger and honey tea to drink every morning which really went such a long way in helping me feel much better. As well, we had an opportunity to meet  and speak with many interesting people from around the world while we ate our breakfast!

In addition, we ate quite a few delicious evening meals downstairs in the Vault restaurant. The fish and chip dinner was great! We thoroughly enjoyed listening to a different Irish musician / singer on those nights and found it to be lots of fun.

I believe that the biggest thing that sets this hotel apart from others is the very friendly staff and management who go out of their way to make sure that everyone is happy with their stay....from any room concerns, helping you plan day trips, booking museum tickets, recommending great restaurants and pubs, informing you as to where to catch a  particular bus, calling a cab, etc. They even went as far as decorating our room for our wedding anniversary just to make it that much more special for us! We will never forget the kindness that you have shown us and for making us feel like family. Thank you for making our visit to Dublin and Ireland such a memorable one! 

Therefore, we strongly recommend a stay at this very hospitable and unique ""castle"" of a hotel. You will not regret it!",4,2017,09,17
229,Great Location lovely old building,"We stayed here as part of a group of friends and were very pleased with our room and the hotel in general. A large reception area that enabled us to meet up each day and set off on our adventures was comfortable and welcoming. Dining rooms were great for the included in price breakfast and were also part of the cafe that is open to the public , once brekkie is over of course! The cellar bar and restaurant is roomy and comfortable , open late for guests and had a different musician / singer each night. A really good place to go when we returned to hotel at end of our day. The hotel is actually several buildings merged together. It has character and the decor is relevant. Our room was comfy with a good bed and a small but functional ensuite. There are sloping floors as one would expect with such an old building , but this did not affect our room or comfort at all. The Hotel is by Parnell Square on corner of O Connell street which is great for accessing tour buses , range of pubs and restaurants inc Temple Bar over the river. Also great for a short walk to O Connell dart/ train station for rides to Howth for a delicious fish lunch. Can get local bus to Dublin Zoo just around the corner.",4,2017,09,15
229,Old Irish Hotel - coming home,"I stayed in 4 hotels in January to select a Dublin hotel to bring two small groups to the following summer.  I picked the Castle Hotel for its historic buildings, its location, a nice breakfast and its lovely manager Yvonne. I knew I could work with Yvonne. My groups were very happy with my hotel selection. I actually stayed at Castle Hotel  6 times in 6 months and felt like I was coming home after the first few times. The hotel is  a series of 8 or 9 Georgian townhouses that are connected.  Walk thru the main floor and you will get a variety of living rooms, all quaintly decorated.    All of the rooms are different. Its a historic building and not without its quirks. The breakfasts were good in the upstairs restaurant.  I enjoyed music and food in the pub downstairs more than once.  The reception staff were very helpful and knew me. I particularly appreciated being able to put my unneeded luggage in a secure storage room between trips. One night we met the owner of this original hotel in Dublin.  He told some great stories. Castle Hotel is about a 20 minute walk to Trinity College and the start of tourist central.  A bus will get one there faster, but I like to walk. This is a very comfortable, reasonably priced place to stay in Dublin.  Give it a try.",5,2017,09,14
229,Old Irish hotel and loved it ,Came to the hotel early in the morning couldn't enter my room until 2:30 in the afternoon but no worries the staff where very helpful and let me put my luggage in the store room and told me where a good place to eat and get a drink until then. Returned to hotel and went to my room and while I only had a view of the car park it was a nice room for one person. Breakfast at the cafe was nice and free Irish music every night in restaurant was prefect. Location is only a 5 minute walk to the city centre so it good for city breaks.  Next time I'm in Dublin I will stay here.,5,2017,09,13
229,"Excellent location, pleasant staff","Reasonable prices in a very expensive city, breakfast included.  Location - central and convenient for bus stops to/from airport/zoo/lots of places.  The airport bus costs 7 Euros but the no 16 (which stops within metres of the hotel on Parnell Square) only costs 3.30 Euros and serves both terminal 1 and terminal 2.   Quirky but very pleasant decor - lots of nice old pictures and antique furniture. Room was quite small but clean and comfortable, with a good hairdryer.  Noise from street was a bit loud but not overwhelming. Nice modern bathroom with good shower over bath but no mixer tap for the sink. Staff were pleasant and helped us arrange taxis etc.  Breakfast was included and OK but a bit canteen-like. Hot and cold food but not masses of choice.",4,2017,09,11
229,Real Irish hotel,"This hotel is less than a five minute walk to the center of downtown Dublin. Outside the crowded center you can enjoy everything it has to offer. Two restaurants on the property gives visitors great options for a rainy day...or just if you decide to stay in and relax. Irish music at one of the restaurants, The Vault, always from 9pm to 11pm. Roy Cox is one of the performers and he will make you laugh and enjoy your evening. The Italiano pizza and the Goat cheese pizza are the best!",5,2017,09,10
229,Comfortable and central ,"Found a room here at very short notice and quite pleased at the standard. I especially like the very effective curtains- they really keep out the light- and the free chocolates left on the bed. Breakfast was nothing special, though I enjoyed the white pudding. ",4,2017,09,10
229,Reasonable and near city centre,"This was within walking distance (10-30 minutes) of various city centre attractions without being in the noisier heart of the city. The building has character without being too modernized, though it would be nice to upgrade to key cards for security instead of room keys, which need to be left with staff when not in the hotel. I liked the fact that Irish historical figures (Michael Collins and Eamon de Valera) had also stayed there. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. I was able to leave my luggage in a locked room until check-in time since I arrived early. It was convenient to have on-site restaurants for meals if needed along with the included breakfast (although some of the hot foods weren't extremely pleasing, but the staff were excellent). I felt sorry for the inadequate staffing in the Vaults the evening I was there to hear some live music and have some soup. It took a while to get service due to few people working, so hopefully that isn't a consistent issue. As for the room, it was odd that the bathroom towels didn't include a handcloth for washing. Overall, the room was pleasant, and I appreciated the tea/coffee service and the complimentary chocolate left on the bed. The hotel is worth staying at again and close to various bus stops and the Connolly train station for commuter, DART, and Luas services.",5,2017,09,09
229,Value for Money,"We have just completed a 3 night stay here. It is clean,comfortable and the staff are as friendly and accommodating as you will find. The food at breakfast was plentiful and fresh. The hotel was also very convenient for the Gate Theatre and  other city centre venues as well as shopping malls etc. All in all good value for money.",4,2017,09,06
229,"No air-conditioning, but otherwise good","Located near the top end of O’Connell St, about 10 minutes’ walk to Airport bus stops, 10-15 minutes’ walk from LUAS connection from Heuston Station (also from Connolly Station and Busaras, although can walk directly to these by adding 5-10 minutes).  Need to walk one block (5 minutes) for eating options or can use hotel.  Breakfast is excellent with buffet continental and full Irish options, and starts at 7am but can be very busy later.  Room was comfortable but not large, and required carrying baggage via long corridors and a few stairs (it’s an old, creaky building).  No air-conditioning or flow-through ventilation, so need to leave window open.  Disappointed to be allocated noisy room at rear near building site when staying for eight nights.  W-fi performance inconsistent.  Reception staff very helpful.",4,2017,09,03
229,Good hotel,"Nice hotel, ideally situated for the city centre. Plenty of lounge area's to relax in. Nice spacious bedroom and modern shower room. Evening meal and staff in the bar at night are excellent. Only negative comments are regarding breakfast service seems to be enough staff on duty but they need someone to organise them. Bringing up breakfast from the ground floor on an unheated trolley is not satisfactory it was also late and the one chef behind the hot plate was struggling to serve and was expected to use the toast machine as well as the queue got bigger",4,2017,09,01
229,Great hotel,"Spend a couple of nights at the Castle Hotel. Staff was very friendly. Rooms were spacious and clean. Breakfast great, I recommend the full Irish breakfast. Cleaning was done properly and good.

Ps: for Finn, colours and not color",5,2017,08,29
229,Elizabeth Burge,"Really lovely hotel, reception staff are so friendly and accommodating, bar and waiting staff are always cheerful, chatty and helpful.The hotel is fantastic lots of rooms with rooms off rooms and very quirky. Bedrooms very clean. Location is excellent for the City Centre.",4,2017,08,27
229,Weeks visit to Dublin Ireland,"Myself and my partner were on holiday in Dublin for a week and we stayed here at the castle hotel,we were greeted on our arrival with a happy friendly welcome and the staff were very nice and always helpful in any way they could help. A beautiful hotel with great period features and plenty of space to take a seat, perfectly located just off the main road o Connell Street for shopping, transport and for other attractions nearby. We booked through travel agent and did bed and breakfast, the breakfast was very nice and plenty of options to choose from all in a lovely location. We will definitely be coming back here again when we visit next time
",5,2017,08,27
229,"Room ok, bathroom awful, overall dissapointed","When we arrived we were told our room number and pointed in the direction of the room. The hotel is amaze of corridors and stairs and there wasn't one sign with our room number on. I went back to reception because no I couldn't find it and again was just pointed in the direction. No help to find it even though I said we couldn't. The room was ok but I need need of some tlc, the bathroom was terrible and definitely in need of replacing. There wasn't a dangerous sharp small step to the bathroom which was a trio hazard with no warning. One of the duvet covers hadn't a rip in the top, which would have been seen when out on. In the morning I folded the top back so it was visible and I advised reception, I was told it would be changed. It wasn't changed so for the second night running had a cover with a big rio in it, the cleaners hadn't also removed one of our towels and also the shower mat, which on a fill your tiled floor Is needed! There isn't a notice asking you to leave your keys with reception , when we went to pick ours up on the first day we were told they weren't there and asked quite rudely I felt we were sure! They checked their computer and somehow the keys managed to turn up in the cupboard when had just looked in. We then Set off to our room and we're shouted after that our room was at the other side of the hotel. As we hadn't to find our own way around we'd had found an easier way to our room. Some of the staff are very nice and helpful but unfortunately there's more that are not. I emailed before we arrived to ask for a quiet room as I'm a light sleeper and was advised I would be on the 3rd floor a small this was quieter but that there is a certain amount of noise due to the location. Unfortunately the room was right by the door that people had to used to get to the other rooms on that floor so it was noisy with people going through the door. The locations of this hotel I see good but unfortunately we were disapponted with the hotel itself.",2,2017,08,22
229,Character,"Has character by the buckets. Feels like you traveled back in time. Lots of sitting areas with sofas and tables to lounge and have some drinks or play some games.  Unfortunately we got the room next to the stairwell which creaks loudly when walked on and you can hear people talking as they walk both in the hallway and outside in the street as the windows don't seal completely. Rooms are quite large for a downtown hotel. 
Great location a short walk from the main shopping streets and a little further to Temple Bar across the river. Extra charge for parking but good Wifi and breakfast were included.  The price was quite high at this busy tourist time but that is expected due to the location. 
The restaurant breakfast is decent. There is a bar with live music in the Vault room. The front desk staff are professional and courteous. ",4,2017,08,20
229,Good,"Good breakfast although can get busy. 
Amenities basic but lucky we had our own. 
Good location 
Hotel was happy to tell us of good laundry service. 
No safety security box
Good stay 
Bar man Brendan down stairs was very helpful ",4,2017,08,20
229,Friendly hotel with character in a superb location,"Our party of 4 had one double and one twin room.  We were welcomed on arrival and treated well throughout our 4 night stay.  Both rooms were kept very clean, as is the hotel generally, and it is decorated in a fine style true to its origins as two Georgian Houses.

It's in a great location - a short walk from the top of O'Connell Street in the city centre, and very close to Airport bus and tour bus stops.  It is away from most of the noise.

Breakfasts were excellent and so was the evening meal we had in the Old Music Shop restaurant.  The Castle Vaults bar was enjoyable in the evenings.

We liked Dublin very much - a friendly city.  We were looked after in the Castle Hotel in the same manner.  We'd choose to stay here again if we return.",4,2017,08,20
229,Great Location,This is an incredibly lovely hotel in a fantastic location. My room was perfect for my stay and the staff were always very helpful. There is very little noise from the street outside however you might sometimes hear music from the bar downstairs. This hotel is also close to one of the Airlink bus stops so you can get here quite easily from Dublin Airport. I will definitely return to the Castle Hotel when I am next in Dublin.,4,2017,08,19
229,Second stay in this friendly hotel,"I stayed here three years ago and had a wonderful time, and this trip was no different-maybe even better.  The staff are friendly and always helpful, and go out of their way to make your stay  pleasant.  The food in both restaurants was great, too.  The room was comfortable and very clean.  The location of this hotel is perfect for getting around to the city sites.  I intend to stay here again on my next trip to Dublin, for sure.",5,2017,08,19
229,"""Another lovely stay in a super hotel""","The Castle Hotel's homely atmosphere is complemented by its appropriately antique furnished public areas, which set it head and shoulders above the standardized nature of any hotel chain counterpart. The quirky twists & turns, ups & downs of corridors and general public areas, as well as the unusual shape of bedrooms and remaining historical architectural features are a delight. Which all add to the overall aesthetic appeal of the hotel.

More especially, in all our visits we noticed how helpful, efficient and friendly the Castle Hotel staff are - in all areas of the hotel from the reception desk to the breakfast buffet. This does not just happen; it comes from the top and generates the pleasant ethos of the hotel. Well done!

​To borrow some words from the Castle Hotel Bookmark: we always enjoy our stay so much we cannot wait to come back! We are already thinking about when we can next fit in a visit.",5,2017,08,19
229,"Efficiency, Charm and Character……","I booked our accommodation at the Castle Hotel six months ahead, with a follow-up e-mail one month prior to arrival and everything went extremely well.
We stayed at the Castle Hotel in March and could not have asked for more, our stay was just great. From the time we arrived through to our check-out the staff were extremely helpful and efficient, we couldn’t have been looked after better.
The hotel is situated just outside the city centre which suited our needs, but close enough to allow us to walk to several Dublin attractions and old town. It’s also close to bus stops including the Hop-on, Hop-off bus if you find walking a challenge.
In the evening we used the restaurant/bar down stairs. The atmosphere, food and music was really welcoming after a long day wondering the streets and sites of such a wonderful city.
Breakfast can be a little busy, we adjust your timing slightly and it wasn’t a problem. We also had a situation with our hire car where we couldn’t get it started the morning we were leaving. The receptionist helped us with a contact number for the car rental help-line. She again helped us with guidance and a map for the closest rental office to the hotel, after she heard our first phone call didn’t go all that well. Her help enabled us to get our urgent and important situation resolved quicker.",5,2017,08,18
229,A  lovely stay,"We booked 2 single rooms at this hotel for three nights and had a thoroughly nice time.
Our rooms were very clean and roomy.
With the exception of one, the staff were brilliant. Always helpful and smiling.
The breakfasts were the best I have had in a hotel for many a year.
I would highly recommend their soup as a light lunch.
Very much enjoyed wining and dining here.
We came for the Dublin Rock and Roll marathon and was within 2 miles of the start line.
All in all a very pleasant stay.",5,2017,08,17
229,Lovely hotel close to all sites,Loved this place. The staff were so friendly and helpful (as was the owner). The place is well appointed with 2 pleasant restaurants. It's well located just up from the centre of Dublin but in easy walking distance. I was with girlfriends on this visit but intend to return with my husband.,5,2017,08,16
229,"Perfect location, good price","The hotel is located straight in the city centre, prices are fair and the breakfast is definitely great! 
Gotta say that the staff at the reception is not the best you could expect but all the rest is on point, very very nice hotel if you need to stay some days in Dublin.",4,2017,08,14
229,Great hotel & location,"We loved our stay at the Castle Hotel. We booked a twin room and had 1 double and 1 single bed, big sized room and decent bathroom. Beds were very comfy! 
The location is great - 15/20min walk to Temple Bar and lots of bus stops 2mins away. 
If you're a light sleeper you should request a quieter side of the hotel - anywhere you stay this central will get traffic noise. Our room was on the main road side of the hotel but traffic noise doesn't bother us. 
The staff were amazing - incredibly welcoming and helpful. We met the owner, Fionn, one night in the bar and he was a very charming and friendly man. 
Food was delicious - breakfast as well as the couple of dinners we had in the Vaults Restaurant. Loved the live music every night. 
The only recommendation I'd make to the management is to provide fans in the room - the first day we stayed was warm and our room was a bit stuffy. ",5,2017,08,13
229,Brilliant stay!,"Visited the hotel for 5 nights to celebrate my brother and sister in law turning 30 and what an amazing stay! From the minute we walked in until we left the staff couldn't do enough to ensure our stay was one to remember. Every single member of staff were friendly, helpful and always willing to go above and beyond to make sure that all our needs were taken care of. Even when we had an issue with a potential leak from an upstairs room the staff handled it quickly and efficiently. On the morning we were leaving I watched one of the guys from reception help a frail older gentleman to his room with a smile on his face and the willingness to help, it was a lovely sight to see! 
The hotel itself was very nice, welcoming and decorated lovely. We ate at the hotel most nights and the food was lovely especially the pizza.
If there is one recommendation I would give to anyone staying at the hotel, it would be to take a trip downstairs to the Castle Vaults bar, where they have live music every night. This was such a highlight during our stay because It had a lovely atmosphere and each night offered something different and fun. Whilst I am talking about the Castle Vaults I would like to take this opportunity to say a special thank you to Brendan and the staff down there who every night made our stay what it was! You all worked tirelessly to ensure not only our wishes were met, but every single person in the bar were taken care of to a very high standard despite it being very busy. Even though it was busy you always seemed to have time to answer any questions we had or go that extra mile to ensure we were happy. You all made our stay what it was and we will be back for sure! To each and everyone of you thank you and keep going your doing an amazing job! ",5,2017,08,10
229,Okay but not great,"Our family of 4 just stayed here for 3 nights. The hotel is old but overall nice. It has quirky hallways but that is to be expected. The staff was friendly but not overly so. The rooms were spacious and decent but nothing to write home about. Our television had a broken wire and were were told it would be fixed the next day but it never was fixed our entire stay. The downstairs bar was amazing and the live music from 9-11 is a must. 

Overall it was a decent stay but it would not be my first choice again.",3,2017,08,09
229,Charming and Inviting Hotel,"I have sent three nights at this hotel.  In fact, it is lots of Georgian houses turned into a hotel.  This was very well done, and is well complimented by the furniture and decor in the various common rooms downstairs.  The hotel is well served by lifts.  Reception was extremely helpful, and even cared (without being asked to) to book us the tour we would have liked to go, which had to be done on line as it was too late in the day.
Our room was very clean, and spacious, though not large.  Was equipped with TV, safe and tea/coffee facilities.  Breakfast was reasonable, not a grand choice but enough.  Service in the restaurant was good.
Its location is just off a main street, and, though not too central, is very conveniently located, both for shopping and to visit the main tourist sites (around 10 minutes walking distance).
It was a very pleasant stay, in a very pleasant hotel.  I would not hesitate to recommend the hotel.",4,2017,08,09
229,What a wonderful hotel! ,"Firstly - the building is beautiful and quirky and kept spotlessly clean. The staff are friendly and obliging. The food is delicious. The beds are comfortable. The bar provides a lyrical and lively Irish welcome. What more can I say? Come to Dublin and stay here. Even when it rains... and it does, you won't regret it. ",5,2017,08,08
229,Castle Hotel,1st though was to book another hotel when we arrived but we stayed staff all nice especially Hazel she was great in the downstairs bar.  The room was small a bit run down. Bathroom very small indeed especially the shower my husband kepted hitting the sides of it. Breakfast was ok . We eat in hotel 2 times & I must say go for the pizza bloody lovely I had the chicken one. There was music on every night & they was good . The room we had you could here the music until they finished which was not good on our first night as couldnt sleep until he had finished singing so if u want to sleep early dont have room 102 or 103 .,3,2017,08,07
229,"Wow, perfect hotel","From the initial booking, checking that the height of our vehicle would fit in the car park , amendment to booking through to our two night stay for 8 people we could not have been treated better, the staff at this hotel are all so attentive. Nothing was too much trouble. The hotel was spotless and its unusual layout added to the character and experience. Breakfast is without doubt value for money and sets you up for a day sightseeing. Early evening drinks on the terrace followed by excellent food in the vaults is also not to be missed, if your lucky enough to be served by hazel and Brendan you are in for a real treat, especially great if you have children. Thank you for making our short break such a good one!",5,2017,08,07
229,I was treated like a queen at the Castle Hotel Dublin,Love this property.  It is an 8 minute walk to city center and a 5 minute walk tho Croke Park.  Staff was very accommodating and my room was spotlessly cleaned. Good value hotel and close to all attractions. Breakfast was included with my rate but that is an area the hotel needs to work on. I already booked my stay for my next vacation in Ireland,5,2017,08,03
229,"Great location, but needs lots of work","Castle Hotel has definitely character. It is old fashioned, quirky and has interesting artwork.
The bar in the basement was cosy and we had a fantastic time listening to Irish music.
Beds were very comfortable and two pillows are always a plus. 

Well, why is it average?
 
There is one thing I absolutely hate and that's hairs in the shower from people who stayed in the room before we did.
I found several hairs in the tub and to make matters worse as I straightened my bed cover, the duvet cover slipped and exposed the quilt underneath.
The quilt was full of blood. 
They exchanged it after I complaint, that was good, but it shouldn't  have been there in the first place. Housekeeping wasn't the best.
The room needs an update and maintenance.  The fan in the bathroom didn't work, we kept the window open with a water bottle, the bath tub was chipped and one of the sockets looked really unsafe.
WIFI is not great, actually quite useless, didn't work moste of the time.
The doors rattle everytime other guests walk past it or use their own doors. crash, boom, bang.
Breakfast was ok, but it was a bit chaotic, baskets with rolls, croissants etc. were empty and it took the staff a while to fill them back up.
Staff at the reception desk is ok, but we wished a would be a bit more warmer and welcoming.

The Irish live music in the evening helps a lot to overlook a few things and the hotel is close to the city centre which is perfect, but I wished I would have never seen the blood on the quilt.",3,2017,08,03
229,not great!,"Room through a maze of corridors - no offer of help with luggage - reception rather disinterested!
Room has very thin walls - currently listening to guy next door talking
No air-con, windows open as very stuffy - from 3 am has been noise of trollies, skips being loaded and moved - incredibly noisy. Sounds like bin lorries or similar for hours
Room must be over kitchens as smells of breakfast cooking from 6am.
Room ok but not the cleanest - literally an inch of fluff and dust on side lights above the bed -they are filthy. Furniture tatty and marked, general all a bit run down and scruffy, dated and dingy.",1,2017,08,03
229,Excellent ,"Lovely stay at this beautiful hotel. 
5-10 min walk from the city centre
Staff friendly and cant do enough for you. 
Good facilities (ironing  soaps, shoe shine, needle and thread kit) 
Comfortable room, quiet. 
Good food choice with two restaurants on site. ",5,2017,08,02
229,A well appreciated one night stay,"Online booking at 4 am the current day of my arrival. When I arrived at the hotel at 1 pm, check-in and the room were ready. The room 216 is a great room with 2 larges windows on the corner of Parnell Square East and Gardiner Row. Large and very tidy room including an ensuite bathroom. Welcoming mattress. Anyway, the main streets are quite noisy and busy and unfortunately, the windows are only single-glazed pane but it won't disturb me cause i 'm a early riser and a night owl. Continental or full Irish breakfast is available.",4,2017,08,01
229,"Stay elsewhere, you will thank me later","Run down, in need of repairs, no charm except the reception area and overall lackluster experience at best. Roof was leaking from the upstairs shower in a waterfall. Elevator down all day, busted furniture in room, wet paint signs left up for 4 days when dry anyway. Dirty towel reused. It was a horrible stay in an amazing city that brought our overall trip down a notch. There are SO many charming options in Dublin. LOOK ELSEWEHRE. ",1,2017,07,30
229,Very helpful staff in a good location,"This was the cheapest hotel I could find in Dublin given that I didn't want to take the hostel route. The staff went out of their way to be helpful. I had a tour that meant I would miss breakfast which is served from 7am but you can get an earlier continental breakfast if you ask beforehand. Furthermore I needed to print out my boarding pass so sent it to them by email and they printed one copy sent to my room and another at reception. I liked how the breakfast was served by staff but you still had the choice to choose what you wanted. A wide choice and good quality food.

The rooms are a little tired but it is a three star hotel. There is no air conditioning which means it can get a little warm in the Summer. The corridors have a lot of character and you feel obliged to stop and see what is on the walls and to sit in the various reception rooms. 

The location just off O'Connell Street is very helpful just 10-15 minutes walk from Temple Bar etc and close to bus stops for the airport.

Overall I would definitely recommend staying here.",4,2017,07,29
229,Great location!,"My Husband & I stayed here last August for our 10 day vacation. We loved the location & the staff were so accommodating! The uniqueness of this hotel was so nice, from the decor to the layout. It was almost as if it were a maze as it seems to be made up of a bunch of co-joining buildings that have been made into the hotel.

The rooms were clean, not fancy, but comfortable. We weren't looking for luxury on this trip as we were out and about all day long exploring.

The breakfast here was awesome & it was included in our room rate. We especially loved to go to the Vault downstairs for some entertainment or for a pint of Guinness after our day of exploring. 

We fully intend to visit Ireland again and we would definitely stay here at this location!",4,2017,07,28
229,Needs an update,"I stayed in a single room. The bedroom part was tired and really needed an update. The curtains didn't meet and there was no way to make the room totally dark. The noise from the bar downstairs was disturbing; even with the window closed. There was a kettle and a cup that held about 150ml liquid. The bathroom looked as though it had been updated recently but there were no surfaces on which to place toiletries, there was no mirror above the sink and it wasn't possible to reach the towel rail from the shower. The complementary toiletries consisted of a tiny bar of soap and a tiny tube of hair/body wash which smelt like aftershave. 
The breakfast room was nicely decorated. There were cereals, tinned fruits and yogurt, cooked items and baked goods. Hot breakfast items aren't cooked to order and the baked pastries looked a bit battered. 
Staff at the reception desk were unable to advise regarding airport links with any real confidence. 
It's about 15 minutes to the river from here.",3,2017,07,28
229,Fantastic location,"You couldn't ask for a better location.  Not only is the Castle Hotel close to the action, but if you have a rental car, there's a free car park, and the drive to the airport is extremely fast and easy.  The Castle Vault restaurant/bar is fantastic, and the live music was excellent.  The only draw back, and it's a big one, is that the bathroom left much to be desired.  There was no counter space for toiletries, and the shower had miserable water pressure with a fluctuating hot/cold rhythm.  After a day of exploring, and considering that most people who travel for adventure are mostly looking for a bed and a bathroom, the idea of taking forever to get clean while dancing in and out of the stream as it jumps from too hot to too cold isn't very pleasant.",3,2017,07,21
229,A lovely stay in Dublin at the Castle Hotel,"The reception was wonderful, the ladies at the front desk were very helpful and kind, I arrived not feeling well and they offered to go to the pharmacy for me. Was very touched. The restaurant staff was so sweet and very efficient. We enjoyed our stay very much and would return.
And a Shout Out to the Vault in the Castle Hotel! We visited the vault a couple of nights during our time in Dublin and had the best time! The staff is friendly and efficient but the live music is what kept us coming back. It was fantastic and genuine! Thank you for a wonderful time!!!

229,First Stay in Ireland,"This place was the first of 6 different hotels/B&B's that we frequented while in Ireland and it was one of our favorites. The place has a different feel with multiple levels with twists and turns throughout but it just had that ""home"" feel to it. The rooms were comfortable and quiet. The bar within the hotel had good spirits and music and the breakfast was quite good. A short walk to the Hop On/Hop Off bus ride start made our traversing of Dublin all that more enjoyable.  Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a place while in Dublin!",5,2017,07,19
229,Great location and excellent breakfast,"The start of our 10 day Ireland trip. Hotel in very good location, old building with lots of character, castle vaults bar in the cellar has good atmosphere.  The weather was warm, as was the room and pasageways, making sleeping difficult, the curtains would benefit from rods to close them. Problems with curtains and side table light were dealt with. The breakfast was excellent... Old music shop used as breakfast room , as well as restaurant., almost 4 stars for me!",3,2017,07,19
229,Nice Quad Room for Family -- Great Location.,"We stayed at the Castle Hotel for two nights before a week+ trip around Ireland with a bus tour...The Castle Hotel was the best hotel of our entire trip.  The breakfast satisfied the whole family, including my two teenagers.  Our flight arrived early, but they were able to secure our luggage in a facility while we toured Dublin.  It's a short walk down to most of the sights and one of the Hop on and Off Tour Bus stops is right across the street.",5,2017,07,12
229,"Conveniently located, comfortable rooms, Irish breakfast included, music at night","When we decided to make a last minute trip to Ireland we had to decide what sort of room to book.  We checked out a few sites where you can rent a room, house or hotel.  We opted for the Castle Hotel because it was convenient, included a full Irish Breakfast, and had room for 3 (an odd number when traveling).  Our room included a twin and one double, roomy enough for our group.

The breakfast was a great way to start the day.  They do mention that certain hours are particularly busy so we were sure to get up early to beat the crowds.  Breakfast included eggs, bacon, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, beans, assortment of breads, jams and Irish butter.  Fruit, juice and coffee/tea were included.  You could go up for 2nds too.

At night we went to dinner downstairs as it included live music.  We had their pasta the first night which was heaping (2 bowls served the 3 of us) and the 2nd night we had the Irish Stew which was excellent.  The hamburger with frits was also great.  The first night we had regular western, soft rock, but the 2nd night was Irish music (both with one musician).  It was a fun way to end our evening.  The food was excellent and reasonably priced.  And the staff was exceptional, always serving with a smile and very helpful.  

The cost for 3 nights was on the pricey side, but because we booked so last minute our options were limited.  If we had more time and more options we might have booked elsewhere.  But since we know what to expect next time we visit Dublin we would probably go again or at least dine there as the food was really good.

The location is right near the Writer's Museum and that is also next to a DoDublin Hop-On/Hop-Off bus (also Airlink to airport).  So the convenience alone may be worth it for you.  There is no air conditioning but you can open the windows to let in the cool air at night.  There are lots of street noises so bring earplugs if you are sensitive to noise.  The location is sort of on the edge of town so you won't hear as much noise as you would if located in the center of town.

The front desk staff was great.  When they learned we had an early morning tour they arranged for a sack lunch knowing that it would be difficult to get food beforehand.  We had a nice ham and cheese on Irish bread and a piece of fruit, just enough so we weren't starving on our tour.  Also, when we arrived, our room was not ready, but they stored our luggage and we were able to use the restroom before going on the Hop-on/Hop-off bus.

The building itself is pretty old and the rooms a bit musty.  If they were in better shape the price per night would be better justified.  But the staff and food made our stay worth while.

There WAS free WiFi, so if that is important to you, then this hotel has it.  The speed was excellent in our room and I've heard that is not the case in all hotels, nor is it free in all hotels.  We were able to FaceTime my family in the states and we had a great connection.",4,2017,07,11
229,Nice hotel but not worth £200/night,"Quirky hotel, a bit of a maze. The breakfast was good and the food in the vault bar was lovely. The free show/ singer was entertaining. All the staff were friendly and helpful. The location is good, just out of town but just a 5 minute walk to O'Connell street and 15 mins from trinity college area.
Our room was weird though. We couldn't open one door of the wardrobe as the Wall TV was in the way. There was no power point by the dressing table. The shelf for the kettle was narrow and I managed to make the kettle fall off. Generally it looked like no thought had gone into planning the room and it wasn't too difficult to imagine how to rearrange it. I would have rated 3.5 if I coud",3,2017,07,11
229,Charming old hotel,"I really enjoyed my stay here. Nothing super fancy, but it felt very welcoming. It's a charming old hotel that feels like you are staying in someone's house, with several living areas full of comfy vintage furniture downstairs. The restaurant on the ground floor is wonderful - great food, service, and a nicely renovated, bright interior. The cellar restaurant is great too, though I actually preferred the food at the more casual one upstairs. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodated our early arrival and check in the best they could. The only downside would be that our room faced a busy street. When we opened the windows at night for a breeze it was pretty loud and might not work well for light sleepers. It's also a bit out of the way to some of the sites but it's a pretty easy walk/short cab ride into town. It's also across the street from an excellent art gallery that we probably wouldn't have known about had we not stayed here. I would definitely come back.",5,2017,07,10
229,Cosy comfortable hotel in the heart of dublin,Stayed five days good food and accommodation near to shops and excellent for touring Dublin  plus nic staff are helpful and very welcoming breakfast can be very busy but good food  local art galleries nearby and the post office is well worth a visit,4,2017,07,10
229,Family trip,"I made a last minute booking at this hotel and I am so glad I did.  I went with my daughter and 2 grandchildren.  The hotel was easy to find, close to the city centre, the staff are very friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them.  The room was clean and the beds very comfortable.  The food was great, especially the brown bread they made in house.  We all hope we will be back in the not too distant future.",5,2017,07,09
229,Castle Hotel and Vaults bar Dublin,"Clean and quiet rooms. Breakfast service is british/irish only but food is good in both in quality and quantity. Best breakfast coffee I've had anywhere in the British Isles (none of that instant garbage). Hotel staff does a solid 10/10 work allaround. Vaulta bar underneath the hotel is great. Live music every night, great staff (really great) and price range is in line with northern Dublin. Overall a top place to stay and great value for money.",5,2017,07,07
229,Most acceptable,"The hotels I normally stay at in Dublin were full so stayed here not expecting much from the mixed reviews. Room was perfectly adequate but was noisy at the front. The Vaults restaurant/bar was brilliant. and after a long business day met a colleague her at 5pm. Our intention was to have a quick beer and go out...we left at midnight  though after a first class meal great selection of drinks too. The O'Hara (so called craft) IPA on draft was very very good....a few varied bottles of Pale ales would have been welcome though. Singer on a Thursday evening was really good and this from me that prefers quiet pubs with no music at all!!

The Music shop is where breakfast happens. Good coffee and a good selection personally served.

WILL BE BACK!.

Fantastic staff I really felt welcome.",5,2017,07,07
229,Great location!!,Hotel location provides travelers with easy access to all major points of the city and tour pick-up/drop-off points. Hotel staff very friendly and accommodating. The building age maintains the air from the eras past. ,4,2017,07,04
229,What a Great experience! ,"The hotel is clean and the staff are friendly and really helpful. I loved the free breakfast in the morning. Cozy hotel with a lot of character. Built in the Victorian period. Relatively close to main Dublin attractions. 10 to 15 minute walk to Temple Bar and 4 minutes to O'Connell street. Lots of tour companies actually meet for boarding right up the block from the hotel on O'Connell Street which was very convenient especially if you do a day trip to Belfast, Galway, or the Cliffs of Moher. Also, as a female traveling alone, safety was a concern. There is staff at the front desk 24/7 and the neighborhood is nice. There is also a Spar grocery store a couple blocks away if you need snacks for your room. There is no early check-in so if you arrive early make sure you have something planned to do until check-in at 230pm, but they will hold your luggage for you. Overall, staying at this hotel was a great experience and I would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,07,02
229,Friendly helpful staff,"I stayed in Room 210 for four nights in June 2017. My room was clean, nice bathroom with a big shower, and a window facing Gardiner Row. With the window open during the day, it was rather noisy. At night, with the window closed, it was quiet enough for sleep. Closed window could be a problem in hot weather (not all that common in Dublin). Although there is a lift to the second floor, there is still a set of 10 or so steps to get to Room 210. The hotel is a combination of 2 or more hotels, set in Georgian era houses, making for interesting routes. There are a number of comfortable sitting rooms here and there. Full breakfast was inlcuded, and was very good, with a wide selection. Front desk staff were friendly and most helpful with advice on how to get to places of interest. Lots of newspapers in the  main lobby. A good stay in a good location, very close to O'Connell Street. Recommended.",4,2017,07,02
229,Lovely Stay,"My mum and I spent three nights at The Castle Hotel. , We had a lovely stay. 
The rooms were very clean and Tea, Coffee replaced daily. The breakfasts were lovely 
Lots of choice. Very friendly staff. We had dinner the first night in The Music Shop this came to £27.00 for a lovely large pizza, chips and soft drinks. Our last night we spent in the Vaults cellar bar for live music and drinks reasonably priced. Would highly recommend. Hotel just up from O Donnell Street so fairly central.",5,2017,07,01
229,"Horrible, Horrible","Very rude, unhelpful staff, bordering on belligerent. 

We booked this hotel at 12:30 in the evening for the following day, as we were planning to go to Dublin the next day.  There was a big festival going on in Dublin and most hotels were sold out. 

We go on the road and my little one got sick and I knew we were not going to make Dublin. I called less than 10 hours after I made the reservation and they would not cancel it without a $200 cancellation fee. I tried to talk to the manager but was told that she would not be in to the afternoon. I called again in afternoon. I was told no manager yet. Staff was very rude.

Finally called again and manager was there. When I explained situation she said we send an email confirmation that explains there is a cancellation fee if cancelled less than 48 hrs.  Well I booked less than a day ago AND the email is sent AFTER I had booked the hotel. She responded ""Well  why are you only calling me now?""  She was argumentative and unhelpful.  I explained I had called numerous times and her staff was unhelpful.

I also explained that the cancellation policy is hidden in the weeds when using a mobile and does not address a booking made less than 48 hours.  Again unhelpful. I was wracking up phone charges and gave up on the woman as she was uninterested in either being polite or helpful.",1,2017,06,29
229,"Cozy, well situated, outstanding service","This beautiful hotel includes 8 buildings all stitched together--it's like a maze inside! We stayed here twice, and both times were pleasant and fun. There's a cafe and bar inside, and breakfast includes both continental and hot food to order. There's a luggage room, and the staff are extremely helpful and easy to work with. The halls and rooms are clean, and it's easy to walk from Castle to most key Dublin spots. Be aware that the street can be a bit noisy. 
The owner Finn told us the hotel used to provide refuge to revolutionaries (including his own father!), and Finn was responsible for ""modernizing"" the hotel with lights and toilets in every room. :-)",5,2017,06,28
229,"How do you say ""Dump"" in Irish?","Our room on the 1st floor faced the street. The traffic noise made it impossible to sleep with the windows open until very late and the noise starts very early. Too hot to sleep with the windows closed. Hmmmmm. Room was small but clean, bath was recently renovated but toilet seat was already loose and falling off. Headed out our second day and came back to hotel at 6:00 pm or 1800. Housekeeping had made the bed & cleaned. Took shower and realized (too late) there were no towels. Had to call front desk from the phone next to bed dripping wet. The hotel is old with old furniture and carpet. I didn't book it and have to believe there are much nicer options at the same rate elsewhere. Book here as a last resort.....",1,2017,06,28
229,Excellent hotel,"We stayed here for 3 days and it was great.
The room was clean and tidy and had a good supply of hot water.
The breakfast was excellent with a good choice of food with no waiting time.
The hotel is a good location just 5 minutes away from the shopping centre.
Temple bar area is just 15 minutes away but there are plenty of pubs on the way in case you need a Guinness.",4,2017,06,28
229,Spacious rooms,"This is a nice historic hotel. Staff are terrific. Clean bathroom. A few things kept score from being higher. The carpet in room was stained and appeared soiled. Carpet not vacuumed very well. One of the bedskirts was soiled. The location is good enough, but not really in the center of things. ",3,2017,06,27
229,Great location ,This is a quaint little hotel - staff are extremely friendly & helpful especially on reception which is 24 hours!  Rooms nice but they seriously need to sort out the plumbing- the showers are useless and sometimes dangerous! First thing when everyone is clearly showering the thing runs boiling hot to the degree of burning - got me a couple of times & enough to make me yell out in pain! It has the power of a watering can and a minute later will be freezing cold! The walls are paper thin the bloke next doors coughing woke us and even just listening to him talking stopped me being able to sleep! The hotel itself is in a great situation walkable to/from temple bar area but far enough away from the hustle & near a bus stop! 747 bus to/from the airport not the 757 that we were told to get on & then had to drag out cases for 15 minutes! Great little restaurant and the breakfast (included) was delicious! ,4,2017,06,26
229,Quaint hotel with extremely friendly staff,"I echo every positive thing said about the Castle. Wonderful staff!! They went over and above to be helpful, giving us recommendations, directions, and even helping us buy train tickets online at the computer they have available for guests. When we thanked them they were very gracious and explained how much they loved their job and helping people. We happened to be there during a heat wave, so the 3rd floor room was a bit hot (no a/c), but other than that it was a pretty perfect stay!  Thank you!",5,2017,06,23
229,First nights in Ireland,"We really enjoyed our 2 night stay in this quaint hotel, ""the oldest hotel in Dublin"" according to staff. For the age of this hotel, the bathrooms were equipped with modern features and one room even had a USB charging station, which we appreciated. The location was very convenient, an easy walk down O' Donnell street and into the city center. The first night we enjoyed a late dinner in the restaurant complete with drinks and live music. The singer was great about getting the audience involved and singing along. The next morning ""The Music Shoppe"" got our day off to a great start with a full Irish hot and cold breakfast. The staff of the hotel and both restaurants was very friendly and helpful. We would recommend this property and stay there again. ",5,2017,06,22
229,First time in Ireland ,First time in Dublin and this hotel was everything expected. Oldest hotel in Dublin thy claimed and easy to believe old buildings meandering corridors and a comfortable room. If this is the oldest hotel in Dublin it's no surprise it's busy well setup and convenient for Dublins attractions. With the added bonus of a great venue for live music each night.,4,2017,06,21
229,Castle Hotel for Bloomsday Week,"First things first, we got to the hotel before check-in so they stored our bags so we could wander a bit around the city without lugging luggage. Then, my card was being declined! The receptionist said it didn't matter that we could try again later and we were led to our rooms without any issue. It didn't come up again until we checked out. The food was great (free breakfast, woo!) and the Vaults with its nightly music was awesome.

The hotel itself is beautiful, but it really was the staff's positive attitude and friendliness that made this an A+ booking.",5,2017,06,19
229,"Friendly stuff, clean, safe, good location and reasonable price","I have stayed in the Castle hotel for 4 nights from May 12-16, 2017 on a longer stop over between 2 intercontinental flights. I have asked and got a quiet single room with enough space for 2 people. The bathroom was nice with hot towel rack which was very handy to dry some my clothes as I managed to travel with just carry on and a day pack for a 3.5 weeks trip. All staff was extremely nice, with smile on their face and always ready to do an extra step so that you feel welcome and comfortable. The owner, an older very nice gentleman, came by and I chatted with him as well. A receptionist has booked me a day trip to Wicklow and Glendalough, which gave me opportunity to see the mountains and country side. 
Still jet lagged it was nice to just go down to the bar in the basement and listen to live Irish music. The breakfast was very good with lot of choices, from eggs, bacon, mushrooms to fruit salads and everything between. If something was missing (like they ran out of fruit salad – as it was really made very fresh) you just need to ask and you will get it in few minutes at your table. I must tell that I had breakfast earlier in the morning when there were less crowds. One evening I had a nice dinner in the restaurant as well, but haven’t tried food at the bar… 
The location is very good just 2 short blocks from the O’Connell Street, 3 blocks from the airport bus stop and Hop on Hop Off and sightseeing buses (they stop in front of Gresham Hotel) and around 10 minutes’ walk to Liffey river and few more minutes to Trinity College and Temple bar…",5,2017,06,18
229,Birthday Celebration,"Just had a trip to Dublin for my 78th Birthday. Stayed in The Castle Hotel I was greeted by the owner of the hotel Fionn Mac Cumhaill. The staff and owner so friendly and helpful. True Irish welcome. If you read this Fionn cheers for the birthday drink for me and my family, we had a truly enjoyable stay.",5,2017,06,17
229,Convenient location,"The Castle is a three-minute-walk north of O'Connell Street and comprises three charming historic buildings. 
My single room was spacious and well-appointed. A comfortable bed with a side-table, a wardrobe, a chest of drawers, a table, a comfortable armchair. Unfortunately, there was no desk, which comes in handy when you have to do some writing. The bathroom is functional with a sink, tub and WC.
Full Irish breakfast is served in a large dining area. Smokers can take a seat outside for their nicotine intake.
I tried the restaurant in the basement and was a bit disappointed with the food.
The free WiFi was rather unreliable.

Another advantage is that the airport connection of Dublin buses is just a hundred metres from the hotel.",4,2017,06,16
229,Great Hotel,"This is a hotel with character and a wonderful staff. It's in a great location; easy to walk to O'Connell street which in Dublin is one of the main streets for tourists. The room we had was clean and pleasant; bathroom was good sized. But the staff really get the gold stars for making our visit so nice. They were helpful in getting us reservations for afternoon tea at Lord Mayor's Lounge; they helped with storing our extra luggage while we took off on a five day tour of the Irish countryside; and arranging transportation when we needed it. The Old Music Shop cafe was a wonderful place for breakfast each morning. It's off on a side street so it's not impressive from the outside, but what character it has. Great stay!",5,2017,06,14
229,"""Dublin will be written in my heart""","First-time visit to Dublin and it was love at first sight! Castle Hotel greatly contributed to this experience. The genuinely nice staff gives the hotel a family atmosphere and location is perfect for seeing all the sights in the northern parts of the city centre, with shopping and museums within walking distance. Breakfast is good, especially the bowls of fresh fruit. However, on the one morning I was in a hurry to get away early there was nothing to eat - just three small pieces of bread with at least 10 people in the restaurant. After a 20 minute wait I gave up and rushed off and I still don't know why this happened, but I believe it was due to some special circumstances and not something that occurs regularly. It does not affect my experience of the Castle Hotel. All in all, I am very happy with my and would definitely both recommend this hotel and come back next time I visit Dublin.

My one reason for not giving 5 stars to this hotel is that two days before arrival, almost twice the amount for my stay was reserved at my bank account. I had not realized this would happen and thought at first that something was seriously wrong (imagine my relief when it wasn't!). I then payed for my stay at arrival but still, four days later, the initial reserved amount is still not available to me, which means much less spending money than I had anticipated for my vacation.",4,2017,06,13
229,First visit to Dublin,"Nice friendly staff.  Breakfasted in the old music shop every morning.  Granted I got down late ( 945) every morning but was only seated by a member of staff twice, getting a pot of tea was hard some mornings and getting a juice impossible.  It was like they were desperate to clear breakfast for hotel residents away so they could get members of the public in to charge.  Louis in the bar was friendly and made you feel welcome in a nice warm fashion - pitched his approach so well, felt like I was walking into my local pub the second time I went in to the bar!  Hope you're well fella!

Good location and it served purpose well - comfy and clean and friendly.  Will be back - just not through British airways.

",4,2017,06,12
229,One of our favorite hotels ever!,"My family and I stayed in the Castle Hotel almost by accident when we had to extend our stay in Ireland and found the Castle to be one of our favorite parts of the entire trip.  The Castle maintains the charm of the Georgian Mansions that makes up the hotel, all the while being a clean and well maintained lodging experience.  Management has clearly spent quite a bit of capital maintaining the property in all its glory, as well as investing quite a bit in modern bathrooms in each rooms.  We were also thrilled to find rooms that fit 4 and 5 family members.  Very rare in Europe!

We had two separate stays during our trip (we liked it so much we came back to the Castle) and found both rooms to be fantastic.  The included breakfast was very good, but the true gem of the entire experience was the Vault pub and restaurant downstairs, available only to hotel guests.  My children (ages infant - 15 years) loved the Irish music in a chill environment with reasonably priced food and drinks.  I'd HIGHLY recommend it.

We were fortunate to meet the owner of the hotel, who was very kind to my children and told us the story of his family (his father was part of the Irish Revolution) and how he came to own the hotel.  Truly amazing stories!

We'll definitely stay here again on our next trip to Ireland!",5,2017,06,08
229,Great Base To Enjoy The Craic!,"First visit to Dublin, and the hotel was a fantastic base for sightseeing and night life.

A well kept old fashioned building, with plenty of public sitting areas in comfy chairs and surrounded by nostalgia.

Our bedroom was decorated well, clean and with TV and tea making facilities.
The bathroom was suprisingly modern, with a large shower and very clean.

And not to forget the Irish breakfast to set us up for the day.

A 2 minute walk from great bars and restaurants, so you can have the peace and quiet when you want and the tour buses are almost right outside.

Will return again because it was great!",4,2017,06,04
229,Fantastic hotel,We have just returned from Dublin staying at the castle hotel to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. The hotel was excellent very clean and comfortable. The staff very helpful and extremely friendly. We were given a free upgrade after our daughter emailed them to say it was our silver wedding. The food was excellent the entertainment in the vaults bar very good. Would highly recommend a stay in the oldest hotel in Dublin.,5,2017,06,04
229,Experience a classic Irish hotel,"My daughter and I stayed at the Castle Hotel in late May 2017.  Her room was a bit larger than mine, but mine was just as comfortable.  Both were very quiet.  The walls must be quite solid, since I heard no sound from adjoining room.  The hotel is near the ""Hop On - Hop Off"" location on N. Parnell Square.
The property—public areas and rooms—is very well maintained, and we would both recommend it.
There are a couple of elegant parlors on the ground floor and numerous handsomely framed paintings in hallways and parlors.  The hotel has the quaint multi-level arrangement (three steps up/two steps down) of comparable properties in the UK.  There are two lifts and an elegant staircase up to the second floor.
A substantial breakfast is served.  All staff were friendly and efficient.  The selection of TV channels was very small.  Not many restaurants in the area but ""The Vaults"" in the basement (obviously) of the hotel is a good choice.  On the two night we dines there a singer with lots of amplification gear was setting up at about 9 o'clock.  If you would like quiet, there is a separate room at the end opposite the bar.",5,2017,06,03
229,Good Value,"A good location with very nice service. The staff was more than willing to stow baggage before check in and after checkout. Free live music in the evening. Breakfast (free) was my first ever full Irish breakfast and was quite good. Decent wifi and spacious bathroom. Thin walls and creaky floors, but if you're tiring yourself out in Dublin this is not an issue.",4,2017,06,03
229,Beautiful hotel ,"We had a family of 5 and we find it hard to get a room with 4 beds we looked and found this hotel. Check in was 2.30 we got the keys and went to the room and was pleasantly surprised how big the room was the kids loved how much space they had to play we didn't feel cramped at all. The wifi signal was good too the only downfall was you could here everything above us. We would definitely come back to this hotel again. The staff were so lovely, very friendly and helpful even when 2 of our children were ill they were so kind. ",4,2017,06,02
229,Pretty Good for the Location,"Dublin’s Castle Hotel is in a great location about 10 minutes’ walk from the city center. It’s comfortable and typically priced for a European hotel with good sized rooms. The best amenity was the full hot Irish breakfast that was included with the price of the room. The room itself was very basic, but surprisingly there was no air conditioning or ceiling fan and just two windows that opened only a few inches horizontally. Ireland is not known for hot weather, but when the temperatures reach 23C or the high 70sF the rooms can get stuffy. Surprisingly, there were no electric outlets in the bathroom. Free WiFi had a good signal in our room.The Castle Hotel is three Georgian row houses joined together so the hallways can be a maze getting to the room, but the signage kept us from getting lost.  Our room was in the back so the street noise was minimal. The staff was not rude but a bit indifferent; definitely not a concierge staff but you get what you pay for. For those who don’t need extra frills and if the weather is not too warm then the Castle Hotel serves its purpose.",3,2017,05,31
229,Thin walls and noisy,"Hotel is well located in central Dublin and popular (was full when we stayed).

The walls are paper thin and was woken by the bloke next door snoring.  Our friends suffered with someone walking around above them at 03:00 am.  The corridors creaked as people passed and more.  SO not a great sleep.  The rooms were old and OK, but clean.

The breakfast was OK and was served from a glass servery by staff according to your wishes.  But the restaurant is small and gets VERY busy at breakfast.

Staff were all great and very friendly.

In all, I do not know the standard and prices of other (better?) nearby hotels, but this is average.",3,2017,05,26
229,Immaculate hotel,"We were going to the Dublin dance festival and stayed in the Castle Hotel. A wonderful warm inviting place, staff were absolutely excellent, and the bathroom looked like we were the first ones to use it. Will definitely be back. ",5,2017,05,26
229,Big up the Breakfast,"This hotel was in a fantastic central location for a fantastic price, the staff were most helpful and the breakfast was to die for! 
The only thing i would say is that the room was very warm so could have used some air con.",4,2017,05,25
229,A Charming Boutique Hotel,"Staff all friendly and very helpful. Great breakfast service, bar area and entertainment. It may be old and creaky but I throughly enjoyed my stay, it is in a quieter part of the city of Dublin but still close enough to all the sights and pubs.",5,2017,05,23
229,3rd stay,As per my 2 previous visits its been an enjoyable stay. Here to celebrate our honeymoon and the hotel laid on few little gestures that were much appreciated. Nice breakfast every morning and lovely friendly staff. Would recommend to friends and family ,5,2017,05,20
229,Much Character,"I booked this hotel from October 10th to the 17th of 2016 as part of my first solo vacation to the UK. The first thing I will say is the hotel is both hard to locate and then easy to find once you have been there. There was so much construction around the city center of Dublin when I went, so many streets were blocked off. I took an Airlink from the airport and walked the rest of the what would have been a few short blocks (if I had been given updated directions). Most of the city center and some awesome attractions can be accessed within a 10-15 min walk of this hotel and a Hop on and Off stop is located around the corner from the hotel.

The room I received was basic, a double bed, chair with desk and bathroom with a shower. It is easy to get lost around the hotel because there are plenty of twist and turns and doors to navigate often before you reach your room. The walls are rather thin and much can be heard; whether it is the next room or someone walking in the hallway. The bathroom was okay as the water pressure left a bit to be desired. The bed was nice, not as firm as I would prefer but I did get the rest I needed to enjoy my stay.

My room came with the breakfast buffet and I took advantage of it every day. The breakfast is standard: eggs, potatoes, fruit, sausage/bacon, bread and an assortment of cereals. Its a good deal because having your fill of that helps to tackle a long day of sight seeing. I also ate a late lunch at the Music room Cafe and dinner at the Vault. The Guinness stew was absolutely delicious, in my opinion better than the one I actually ate at the Guinness Brewery. The employees were always friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay again when I come back to Dublin.",4,2017,05,18
229,Lived Like a Queen at the Castle,"My sister and I recently stayed at the Castle Hotel in Dublin for four nights. We loved it! Granted, it cost more than other hotels we stayed at, but we felt more at home at the Castle. The staff was excellent, the Irish breakfasts were fabulous and it was close to everything. 

I highly recommend the Castle Hotel.",4,2017,05,17
229,A Lovely Hotel Close to central Dublin,"I was visiting Dublin solo so it was important to find a reasonably priced single room which was close enough to central Dublin to walk to. The room was tiny, but very clean and the maid came in to clean and tidy it daily, although she didn't need to. The hotel itself is charming. It's the oldest in Dublin but has an elevator. The breakfast included had a good variety and was most adequate. The hotel has two restaurants, one providing traditional entertainment at 9 p.m. every night in high season. The only thing that was a little difficult was the distance from the Airlink stop on O'Connell, about a 10 minute walk with suitcases which would be challenging for seniors up a slight incline.",4,2017,05,17
229,Good hotel to visit Dublin,"About 10-15 minute walk to the centre. Hotel was clean and tidy, room was on the back so quiet (apart from fellow guests occasionally slamming doors)....Staff friendly and helpful. Plenty on offer from the buffet style breakfast, but you do need to keep your bacon warmer - it's cool !!....Great place from which to visit the city.",4,2017,05,16
229,Some really good bits but also a couple of horrors,"The room was a nasty little box about half the size of the standard room but they still charge the full rate for it and when I complained the staff just said nothing and avoided eye contact. No offer of another room or a cheaper price. STAY OUT OF ROOM 106!
Also the TV only had a few channels on it (no BBC or Sky Sports) and they didn't offer to fix that while I was there - only after I had checked out!
Good bits - Irish breakfast is excellent with great food and great staff; decor in good condition and room and bathroom very clean. 
Avoid the cellar bar - soulless with indifferent live music and a bar without many of the staple Irish Whiskies - can you imagine no Paddy or Bushmills?",2,2017,05,15
229,"Communion party,vaults bar/restaurant ","Did not stay in the hotel but held a communion party in the vaults bar/restaurant. The bar manager Trevor was exceptional from start to finish could not do enough to accommodate my booking an gave my self , family and friends a wonderful day from fantastic food, beautiful setting in the restaurant to the great live Irish music in the bar to the best pint of Guinness you will get in Dublin, defiantly a must go to if in Dublin from melt in the mouth beef to exceptional customer service from all the staff atmosphere is 5 star rating highly recommend as we all had a superb day at the vaults.",5,2017,05,15
229,Family get-together ,Stayed 2 nights the reception staff was really friendly on check in. Gave details about taxi services etc. Slept well first night but was woken up by the other residents coming out of their rooms and what seemed like the doors were slamming shut. So a little nucience maybe  soft shut doors would be better 😊....the hotel close to the centre as it is only a short walk to get into the thick of things. Bus services and taxis galore. There is a liitle theatre that you may want to take in a show or two. You could walk to Temple bar. The hotel was comfortable and welcoming the breakfast was tasty but be careful of the times or you may have to wait for a table to come free. Room was clean and comfortable plus visited the Gresham and felt the Castle was better by far. Definitely value for money and would stay here again. Thank you  x,5,2017,05,13
229,Great week at the Castle Hotel,"My Daughter and I just arrived home from a week-long visit to Dublin and The Castle Hotel. This hotel was a great stay. Close to O'Connell St which has a lot of tour buses to explore Dublin and points beyond.Excellent group of people working there. The building itself looks to be a collection of former residences which makes the Hotel unique and interesting. With its cleanliness, great staff throughout we would not hesitate in staying at The Castle Hotel.

Dennis & Nicole B.",5,2017,05,09
229,Perfect home from home base to explore Dublin,"This hotel was a present from our son and he couldn't have choosen better. It is a good central base to explore all Dublin attractions but has a personal homely feel not usually found in a city hotel. The room was one of the cleanest we have stayed in, the bed was comfortable and considering it was winter the room was warm and cosy. We ate at the hotel and the food was very good as was the breakfast. The bar in the basement had good local entertainment so was just the place to relax with a chilled bottle of wine after a busy day site seeing. The staff were pleasant, helpful and very knowledgeable about Dublin. Highly recommend this beautiful historic hotel .",5,2017,05,05
229,Decent little hotel.. great for those from colder climates ,"I stayed here for one night .. it was April and it was an odd day weather wise, quite cold outside . This is relevant , bear with me ....

So the check in staff were friendly and efficient 

The food /drink in the downstairs bar ( steak and chips, bottle of red) were very good , and decent value . 

There was a singer/guitarist playing which made for a good atmosphere. 

The hotel has old fashioned character and a bit of personality .. 

It's well situated in the city .

The downside was room was at Baltic temperature. It was seriously cold in the bedroom, and the bathroom was even colder . So I'd think twice about staying again in the cooler months- or at least I'd take something warm to sleep in, such as an overcoat .

During the night the fire alarm went off , ( am sure this was bad luck not a tradition) and at about 6am there were the sounds of trolleys loaded with glasses/ bottles being wheeled across a courtyard backwards and forwards.. ( would imagine this was an everyday occurrence) 
I might have had the unlucky room but if you are thinking of booking I'd advise you to ask for a room that doesn't race the internal yard .

Summary- a decent hotel that ticks most of the boxes for a short stay .. Dublin may not be the 'the city that never sleeps'  but the Castle is doing its bit to change that

",3,2017,05,04
229,Explore,"This is the oldest hotel in Dublin. It a conglomeration of at least 5 different businesses or residences. Lots to explore from different meeting/sitting rooms. Sensitive to your needs. Great managers, front desk personnel and very pleasant rooms. Not just a place to sleep but a place to recharge after a long day of exploring Dublin and the countryside. Quite and not far from city center but far enough to provide quietness. When you go be sure to meet the owner. It is an experience you won't soon forget.",5,2017,05,02
229,Nicest staff ever!,"Nicest staff ever in a quiet neighborhood with close access to fun spots just a few blocks away. Special mention of very kind staff:  Claudiu at the front desk, and to Luis and Shannon in the pub/restaurant downstairs. Recommend it!",5,2017,04,29
229,Comfortable,"I stayed at the Castle Hotel two different times. Yes, this is an old building so expect creaks and sounds. The first room was on floor 2 over the street. View great, but street noise. The room I had unfortunately was near a door that shook the room. Loud guests woke me up a lot. Not the hotels fault. 
The second room is above the car park and more quiet. The bed comfortable and large en suite. This room is more quiet

The bar under the hotel is nice with live music. It is ok to go there solo. 
The breakfast is good. 
I would definitely stay here again 
I like the character of the hotel. 

It is easy to get to from the airport by taking the airport bus. Just exit the terminal and find the busses. Airlink 747. 10 euros is for both to Dublin and the return to the airport. Get off at Parnell square.

The hop on off busses are just Dow the street from the hotel.",4,2017,04,27
229,Staff couldn't be nicer.,"The location is great; just out of the way from everything yet easy to walk everywhere. I was greeted warmly upon arrival and every need was met. The young man at the front desk was very helpful and apologetic when a packed lunch wasn't waiting for me one day. Everything was sorted the next day; however, and all was well.
The lift is a bit slow and there is only one. The stairs are just as easy for those that are able.
This old Georgian property sounds as though the wooden boards are still in place in the floor. The floor is a bit off in places, but this only adds to the charm of the property. I will say though, the only negative I have is that other people are very rude when coming back to their room very late. You can hear the floor above and the slamming of doors is audible throughout. But once quiet, the room was everything I needed.
The windows do not open properly, but was able to get some fresh air into the room. The windows are good at keeping the street noise to a minimum.
The room was always made up very nicely every morning.
I really did enjoy my stay. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. Plenty of room for me, but also would be great for two.",4,2017,04,26
229,Good stay,"Friendly and comfortable at The Castle hotel.  Staff very helpful, room comfortable.  Evening entertainment  not to be missed, good breakfasts and evening meals.  All in all we had a really good visit.  Would return if going back to Dublin.",5,2017,04,24
229,Nice feel ...,"This was not my first visit to this hotel. I first stayed here about 5 years ago but I love the feel it has. It is situated in converted Georgian houses but very well maintained and renovated. The staff are very helpful. We had a good room with lots of storage. The only thing I was slightly disappointed in was the change to the breakfast. It used to be in the downstairs bar/ restaurant but is now in the cafe upstairs. There were very few Irish staff, the place was very busy and the breakfast was good but not quite the same as before. The bar downstairs has a good atmosphere and the food is great. The night we ate there the place was extremely busy but there were only two staff and they were run off their feet but kept smiling.
The Castle is in a great location, central to all the sights and good value for money.",4,2017,04,20
229,"Great Location - Spacious, Friendly and yummy!","Great property. We loved the space of the family room, the breakfast was delicious and the staff were so friendly. They even gave me a pillow to take with me, so I didn't get car sick on our drive to the Ring of Kerry!
The location was so convenient to Temple bar and central shopping.
We would stay here again.",5,2017,04,19
229,Charity Walk,"Had a great few days staying at The Castle Hotel. Great location and good food. Staff were very friendly and helpful and would recommend this Hotel as a very friendly and ideally located hotel for visiting Dublin.

229,2 night city  break,"good location, very friendly efficient staff, clean rooms. originally booked one night but needed two, no bother for the hotel, very accommodating. dinner in the restaurant ok but nothing to write home about.",4,2017,04,16
229,Exceeded all expectations,"Traveling on a bit of a budget, I decided to take a chance on the single room. Usually, that is not wise. In this case, the room had everything needed and though it was small, it did not feel cramped at all. The best part was how comfortable the bed was; I got some of the best sleep I've had in weeks. Breakfast was great, bar downstairs was lively. The hotel is an easy 20-minute walk into the city center or you can catch a bus right outside for 60E. The front desk staff were knowledgeable and friendly and could not do enough for you. All in all, cannot find any fault with this lovely hotel and when in Dublin, I shall certainly stay there again.",5,2017,04,16
229,Still Great,"I stay here every year!  Gets better with each stay!  Great staff!  You will find many have worked there for years, because of the Owner, and management staff!  
Great food in the Music Room, greats music in the Vaults Dining/Pub!  
I love the place!
Dr. James F. Osborne 111",5,2017,04,15
229,Will return,"Although this hotel has creaky floors and signs of aging, I'm giving it 5-stars. A long-time and frequent traveler, I've stayed at 5* establishments, such as Ashford Castle, but I  much prefer this Castle right off O'Connell St. First and foremost, I loved the staff, including but not limited to Claudio (thanks for sending the email to my husband for me) and Niabh at the desk and ""my darlin' Hazel"" and the boys in the bar/restaurant.  Speaking of the bar, I awoke my first night, traveling solo this time, to hear the sound of singing. Mick Dunne was the musician/story teller that night. I got up from bed, went to the bar, had a whiskey on ice, and just enjoyed an hour among a small crowd of friendly German, Spanish, Irish, and American guests. The next night, same experience but this time the musician was the multi-talented Ray Cox whose CD I bought for my husband.
    The common areas have gorgeous paintings and furniture (you can see some on the website), and I enjoyed sitting to read in the comfy elegant chairs. Cleanliness is 5 star at this hotel. My ""single"" room had a double bed above the car park where there is little noise. I used the hotel's computer rather than lugging a laptop on this trip.
     Location, location, location! I bought a LeapVisitor Pass for $19 at the airport and was able to take buses and the DART train everywhere. The Spire is a short walk (2 min?) down O'Connell from the hotel, but some buses stop right around the corner. Diagonally across is the lovely Serenity Garden where I twice enjoyed some contemplative time alone. 
     Although there are lots of other hotels and restaurants around the area, I had most of my dinners at the Castle. They are a little pricey but so delicious. Yummy, beautifully cooked vegetables! I stirred my complimentary chocolate heart into my complimentary Bailey's coffee after one meal with apple crumb ala mode dessert. Went to heaven. The included full breakfast is perfect, I think, but you're able to order ""to-order"" off the menu if you prefer your eggs fried, for example. Breakfast is served in a large dining room next to the Music Room, a cafe within the hotel.  Busy but terrific ambience if  you get to breakfast after 8:30. You wouldn't know, except at breakfast time (7:30 - 10), what a huge number of guests are in the hotel. That's because the hotel is labyrinthine. It's bigger on the inside. (There are carpeted steps everywhere but there are two lifts, so don't worry about climbing.)
     Before checking out, I made a reservation for a return trip to the Castlein September. As an un-retired teacher, I enjoyed myself traveling solo during spring break, but I really am looking forward to sharing the Castle and the Dublin experience with my husband. As an artist and musician, he will so enjoy the art and music (and food) at the Castle. But I'm asking you, please don't go there, dear reader, for I don't want their good rates to rise.
    Thank you, Castle personnel. Elizabeth",5,2017,04,15
229,5 night mini break,"Lovely hotel with very friendly and welcoming staff.  Really close to the centre, just a short walk and you are in the mix of lively bars and excellent cafes. Our room was well fitted out for us, the only downside was that it was at the front of the hotel and the road below was quite busy and noisy.",4,2017,04,14
229,Historic hotel in a fantastic location in Dublin !,"The front staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly ! The hotel itself is three Georgian era houses joined together  to form the hotel. The sitting areas are like parlours of the period and the entire hotel is jammed with antiques. My room was on the top floor, nice decor a, modern bathroom and very clean. Nice to see an elevator. The breakfast is served in a charming little restaurant with a good selection. The bar downstairs is also a nice addition with live music and far enough away from the rooms that you do not hear any noise. Dublin is expensive in finding accommodation and this hotel is a little more than most in my budget but worth it. The location is excellent  across from the Garden of Rememberance and easy to walk to O'Connell Street and the river. Don't confuse their address, which is Gardiner Row, with another street close by which is Gardiner Street !!",4,2017,04,13
229,Beautiful accomodation,"Our room was spacious and very well equipped. Reception staff were very pleasant and courteous and even offered us an umberella as it had started to rain. The hotel was well situated, just off O'Connell Street and was surrounded by green spaces and interesting places to visit.  Just a few minutes walk and you are on the bustling O'Connell Street which offers a wealth of restaurants, shops and bars.",4,2017,04,13
229,4 nights in Dublin,"Me and 8 others were on our annual girls trip away and have already once visited Dublin but decided to try another hotel as the last one wasn't available. 

We arrived at the hotel around 9am on a Thursday and were greeted by the reception staff who stored our luggage in a locked room and sorted our rooms out. There was a slight mix up about having 2 double rooms rather than twin rooms but the staff sorted out the problem promptly and without fuss. 

The hotel boasts two restaurant areas and an 'underground' bar called The Vault. We ate breakfast in the main room which was included in our hotel price and I must say it was AMAZING! The staff were more than accommodating and the food was fresh and hot! Just what we needed! The downstairs bar was lovely! Very well decorated and great prices (for Dublin) with live music every evening. Definitely worth a visit. 

We stayed in a lovely twin room which had an amazing view of the church next door! The decor was a bit outdated and the rooms are not the easiest to find as it is a bit of a maze but on the whole it was perfect for what we needed. The bathroom was beautiful but the shower unit let it down as it was not very powerful at all. 

Overall the staff are amazing, the room was nice, the food is out of this world and the prices are grand!",4,2017,04,12
229,Fantastic location and staff,"We were part a stag party of 11 staying, and to be honest I was a little concerned about the reception we received, but we could not have been made more welcome. From the early arrival, where Niamh patiently split everyone's bills to the fantastic bar staff in the Vault we could not fault the staff. Room was fine - only minor quibble would be the weak shower, but all in all a very enjoyable stay.",5,2017,04,11
229,Gorgeous hotel building and extremely helpful staff,"The gorgeous building was situated just north of all the noisy city center, a very short walk away. We loved our stay and appreciated so much how helpful the staff was in helping us find private tours. (We arrived in Ireland, just as bus and train drivers union went on strike). Highly recommend it!",5,2017,04,10
229,Staff was the best part of the stay.,"We arrived from Toronto EARLY in the morning (tail wind brought us in 30 min early) and the bus ride into the city was also quick, due to the lack of traffic. We were met by the overnight desk staff that had no doubt seen this before and showed us the luggage storage, took our cel phone number and told us they'd do their best to get us in early....with check in being 2:00 PM (eight hours away). 

We took the opportunity to walk into the city, have a coffee, see Temple bar when the party was truly over and waited for the sun to rise. We returned back to the hotel, went to one of the lounges off the main entrance and dozed in and out of sleep. At 10:30 AM a man from the front desk told us there was a room ready -what a relief.

We found the room at the end of a long maze of corridors and went to sleep. Small, simple room that was clean and without a view. A tiny TV on the far wall reminded of the display at my optometrist's but we weren't there for that. 

The hotel's location was a close walk to the center of town and easy to return to, using the Spire and O'Connell monument as landmarks. Other reviews here on TripAdvisor came to mind when they wrote about room with a view of the back alley (check) noise of the morning garbage (check) and the smell of the kitchen (check) but it was not too bad because I'd expected it. 

On to the breakfast - their breakfast room was the busiest place I've seen. Not too organized and self serve was required, just to get things sorted. Food was OK though and the service was quick.

Would I stay again? Probably. 

BTW, not a real castle.",4,2017,04,09
229,Great Hotel with friendly helpful Staff,"The staff here were very helpful and accommodating. The location is perfect- it was very easy to walk to O'Connor St, shopping, restaurants and sites, it was even only a 15 minute walk to our tour bus pickup. The rooms were clean, comfortable and we had room to move and breathe at the end of a long day of sightseeing. We only had one night to eat at the hotel but the staff were great and the food was good. ",4,2017,04,09
229,Nice hotel near Parnell Square,Stayed here for a week recently while visiting Dublin.   The staff was very friendly and even let us check in early since we were tired from our overnight flight.   Ate breakfast each morning at The Old Music Shop which had a nice selection of hot and cold breakfast foods.  I'm not a coffee drinker but a couple people on my party were and said it was very good.  The hotel is made of three row houses and made for a unique building.   The walls were thin but it did not bother us at night.  We ate dinner at the Old Music Shop and the Vaults a few nights.  The food was very tasty and the prices were reasonable.   Live music each night in the Vaults with great bartenders.   The hotel is a few minutes walk from O'Connell street and very close to all kinds of shops and restaurants.   I highly recommend this hotel as a good home base if you're visiting Dublin!,4,2017,04,09
229,Lovely quaint hotel,"We really loved this hotel,loved the little sitting rooms throughout the hotel with lounges and bookcases where you can relax out of your room.The Vault bar and restaurant downstairs make the best pizza I have ever eaten and breakfast in the Little music room was divine with a really good selection.The hotel is in a great location,only a short walk into town and very close to all the bus services including Hop On Hop Off.",4,2017,04,08
229,Mums 60th birthday trip,"Just returned from 3nights at the castle hotel. In the main the hotel was nice with friendly staff. However I was a little disappointed with their twin room offering susposidly a superior room. My mum choose this for herself and my dad but it looked budget ' still I didn't get to see the non superior rooms.  For the money my mother paid I felt disappointed for her. I had a superior family room which was large enough and quite pleasant however the noise from the road was so loud. The windows weren't doubled glazed and we were on the O'connell street side. Plus the noise from badly aged staircase immediately outside our room and creaky floorboards from the room above added to the constant disturbed sleep. Aside from that a good location close to town and the tour buses and airport bus pick up and drop off close by. 

Breakfast was great with lots of choice.We always had to ask for coffee an tea not automatically offered and on the our last morning the waitress quick as a thief stole from beneath our eyes my sons unfinished breakfast and my sister pot of tea.  

The vaults bar underneath the hotel is definitely worth a visit wheather you stay at the hotel or not. Decent priced drinks and good food plus entertainment. 

Will definitely  visit Dublin again but will stay on the south side of the Liffey. 

Would love to add the recording of the noise I took and add it to this review.",3,2017,04,05
229,Castle Hotel Authentic Dublin hospitality ,We stayed her for two nights after flying in from half a world away...very tired. The reception staff were welcoming and efficient and it didn't matter at all to wait in the comfortable foyer for about 10 minutes  while our room was made up...I say that because in these larger hotels my experience is that if you are upset by the wait then the staff really have no options but to give you another room...which almost as likely will NOT be as good as the one you reserved...So in this case it was lovely to see that they'd given us a room on the corner looking out over Parnell Square and down O'Connell into the city...Albeit this is a busy hotel and a busy street the room was very well sound proofed and thankfully access to fresh air through an opening window...if you wanted to cool the room a bit. Facilities all clean and functional. WIFI great most of the time but it was 'down' on our second morning. Great breakfast...plenty of choice...nice pot of tea. Thanks for a lovely stay.,4,2017,04,04
229,Beautiful Traditional Dublin Hotel,"Booked this Hotel for a special Anniversary stay we were not disappointed.We were given a lovely bedroom with a huge four poster bed at no extra cost.What a lovely surprise awaited us banner on the door and greetings card .The Hotel is really beautiful very traditional high decorated ceilings with staircases and lifts
 leading to bedrooms which are all different from on another.Spotless and comfortable .Great well cooked breakfast with lots of options could not be faulted and in with room price not an extra as in most Hotels in Dublin.We ate in the Vaults restaurant at night good choice and delicious.Found all members of staff to be friendly and helpful.Hotel in good position for all that Dublin offers.Easy Airport bus drive with stop only a short walk away.If we are ever in Dublin again would not book anywhere else.Thank you for a wonderful stay.",5,2017,04,03
229,Comfortable small hotel,Hotel is an easy walk or short bus ride to city centre. Staff were helpful and friendly. Rooms small but perfectly adequate for a short stay. Live music in the downstairs bar. Breakfast was a bit disappointing but not too bad. Wifi in all areas but a bit temperamental! Would stay again but maybe skip breakfast!,4,2017,03,30

229,Good choice,"One 14 bus route from airport, and on continuation of O'Connell St. Easy walk to town centre shops, bars restaurants, historical etc. Has its own history as part of the 19th C rebellion. Has own bar- with entertainment. Good breakfast, in pleasant cafe, (opens to public which probably keeps standards higher, than many breakfast rooms) Staff helpful, friendly, efficient. Hotel is well looked  after, and being modernised, though some parts a little shabby, maybe.  Free internet",4,2017,03,27
229,Would reconsider...,"Stayed at the castle hotel for 3 nights. Used TripAdvisor when choosing the hotel (although booked through 3rd party), and had the impression that it would be practical, safe, and comfortable for a short stay (we just needed a bed to sleep in while we toured for the majority of the day). This couldn't have turned out further from the truth. The only good things about this hotel were the free breakfast and the fact that we were able to check in early. The hotel is dated and honestly feels unkept and dirty. Our room had a distinct musty odor (there is no bathroom ventilation). The walls/ceilings are thin and the doors rattle loudly with any movement in the halls/upstairs/downstairs/ use of hot water. There are single window panes that also allow in noise from the streets. The free wifi advertised was shotty at absolute best (for the most part useless), as well as the temperature regulation in both the room and the shower. The hairdryer advertised probably came from the 1960s and we had to call the front desk for a replacement when it didn't work. There was no safe in the room and we were forced to carry many of or things with us at all times as we didn't feel comfortable leaving them. The mattress was old, uncomfortable, dirty-feeling, and there were no clean flat sheets (only a comforter and fitted bed sheet) on the bed daily. The food (although free at breakfast) was mediocre at best. While we had no intention of spending an exorbitant amount of time in the hotel when we initially booked it, we found ourselves actively avoiding it at all costs.  Of all the hotels in a very large city, I would look to this one last when booking my stay. ",1,2017,03,23
229,Quaint hotel in a good location,"This is a decent enough hotel in a good, walkable location. There are tons of sitting areas with comfy couches and chairs on the ground floor, which I definitely took advantage of when I arrived prior to check in time after a very long flight. The staff was kind enough to allow me to check in a little early as they could tell I was pretty tired. Definitely appreciated that! My single room was fairly small, in fact the bed blocked the door a bit and made it difficult to open, but that wasn't really an issue. The en-suite bathroom was nice. I ate at the attached restaurant which had delicious fish and chips and the included breakfast was always delicious. There is a pub downstairs with live music most nights, which I really enjoyed.",4,2017,03,23
229,Cozy and nice hotel in a perfect place,"Stayed at Castle Hotel, Dublin, in Greater Denmark Street, along with a group from Iceland.  We had a great time, the Vault Bar in the cellar was absolutely wonderful, great music and great guys playing both nights.  The room was just fine, I stayed in a single room on 2nd floor and it was cozy and nice, clean and a friendly atmosphere, allright though the house is old and has old house noises that did not bother me at all.  Slept well and had overall a good time.  Breakfast simple but good and staff in breakfast friendly.  Staff in reception very helpful and overall a very good stay.  Will stay again if needed.  Short walk down to Mary´s Street for shopping.  If you want to go to church it is just opposite the hotel.  Thanks a bunch. :)",4,2017,03,22
229,Neat hotel with great staff!,"We arrived at the hotel to find out that we had a problem with our booking for St. Patty's Day weekend.  Rakshya was wonderful and very accommodating!  The hotel was very fair and helpful in making arrangements for us.  We loved the location, the restaurant was good with a traditional Irish Breakfast, the wine vaults with local music are beyond cool, all the antiques and side or sitting rooms make it easy to find a spot to hide away, and the other guests are fun.  We would highly recommend this hotel because it has a lot of character.  The main attractions are pretty much within walking distance and it's a nice walk into town.  The Wifi was good as well.",5,2017,03,22
229,Comfortable and central hotel,"Friendly staff, good breakfasts (even though eggs were generally overcooked!), comfortable and clean rooms and good food in the Vault Restaurant and Bar. The location was ideal, just a short walk to O'Connoll Street and the River Liffey. We wanted food late one night and Hazel in the bar was happy to oblige.",4,2017,03,19
229,Classic Ireland,"Classic Ireland hotel. Thanks to the antique furniture still in use in the lobby and multiple sitting areas. The rooms was modernized with a heated towel rack and all the expected amenities, coffee pot, tv,  wifi, etc. Two excellent restaurants one with a live band weekly. An easy walk to shopping, theater, and transportation stops. The real selling point for me was the staff. Beyond friendly, they were delightful and efficient. 
Even the owner came up to us in the sitting room, he asked us where we were from and my wife complimented him on his books on the shelves. He thanked her and told her to take whatever one she wanted.
This was a once in a lifetime trip for us and the Castle Hotel was well worth it.",5,2017,03,18
229,Touring Ireland,A beautiful historical hotel.  We were relaxing in one of the many sitting rooms toward the entrance of the lobby when the owner came in and introduced himself to us. What a kind and generous man.  His staff was quick to answer questions and to help us.  This hotel offers a couple of places to dine with full menu's.  We appreciated the early morning breakfast buffet.  Our rooms were great with nice bathrooms and comfy beds.,5,2017,03,16
229,"Great location, lovely staff and very tasty breakfast!","I stayed at the Castle hotel for several nights while visiting Dublin and I would definitely stay there again. The room was comfortable (though the hotel is not what I'd call fancy), and the location was perfect, as it was just a 10-minute walk away from Dublin's main attractions in the downtown area, including the Temple Bar area (where all the pubs with live music are). Just as important, the breakfast was very tasty (and so was the coffee, which many hotels these days don't take too seriously) and ALL the staff were very welcoming, helpful and friendly. The food at the bar/restaurant was good too, and the waiters were again very friendly and prompt to bring the food. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone!!!",4,2017,03,16
229,"Nice hotel, nice people","Very gracious and affordable.  I had the unexpected pleasure of being taken on a tour by the hotel's owner.  That was a first!  The hotel is walking distance to Trinity College and many museums.  If you don't want to go out to eat, the food there is very good.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  I would stay there again.",4,2017,03,15
229,Lovely Hotel good location,I would stay at the Castle Hotel again and would recommend it for a short break in Dublin.  The room we had was just right.  Very clean.  Could get a bit noisy at night as it overlooked the little rear courtyard - but this didn't bother us.  The staff were helpful and friendly.  The breakfast was very good.  We ate in the restaurant one evening and the food again was very good - service good.  Nothing seemed to be too much trouble.,4,2017,03,13
229,Ireland 2017,"This was our first stop on our 12 day adventure through Ireland. The hotel was easy to reach from the the airport bus that runs directly into the city center, just a few blocks from the north parnell square bus stop. The hotel is within easy walking location to the city center and St Patricks church, Guinness, Jameson, Trinity college, and other Dublin sites. Breakfast is what you would expect, plenty of choices for all types of dietary needs.",4,2017,03,12
229,"Friendly, welcoming hotel with parking",We booked online for 2 nights but a cancelled flight resulted in us not arriving for 2 days. It was no problem to change our booking to the new date so we did not lose our money. The rooms were clean and comfortable; breakfast room was quite busy at times but had a good range of food. It was only a short walk to the centre of town along O'Connell street and most buses run past the door. Parking was convenient but there is a charge of 15 euros a day but parking in Dublin would cost you this anyway.,4,2017,03,11
229,Second visit,"We recently went back to the Castle Hotel, Dublin and once again loved every minute of it. The hotel staff were fantastic, polite, helpful and nothing was too much trouble, always smiling and the taxi drivers were on hand all the time.  The food was very very good and not over priced and the bar prices were also very reasonable. The rooms were very comfy and warm and had everything you required while on your stay. Beautiful lounges with plenty of sofas or chairs for you to sit in (very comfortable) you could easily fall asleep in them. My friend and I will definatley be going back there again and doubt if I would stay anywhere else in Dublin. Highly recommended.",5,2017,03,10
229,Good value for money,"Pros: good location, clean room, helpful staff, excellent full Irish breakfast, airport bus-stop not far, 

Cons: squeeky stairs, problems with heating (room and water), small room, bad weather outside :)",4,2017,03,09
229,great stay in dublin,"very nice hotel close to all the main attractions in the centre of Dublin, nice rooms ,nice bar ,god evening entertainment & excellent full  breakfast.Excellent choices available  on foods & drinks.Wwould definitely return",4,2017,03,08
229,Ideal situation.,Hotel clean and comfortable.  Staff friendly.Only downsize  was that my room was cold but staff over rode heating  time for me .Near local buses and tour coaches. Ideally situated  to  get around the city.,5,2017,03,06
229,"Cozy, well-located, friendly place to stay!","From the moment we arrived, we felt ""welcome"" in this hotel. It is a charming place that feels like ""home"". There are numerous sitting rooms on the ground floor with a large assortment of mismatched and comfortable sofas. The front office and restaurant staff are extremely helpful and friendly.  In fact, they had arranged for balloons and birthday cards in the room for my daughter and her friend's birthdays. The staff was eager to answer all our questions about places to go and how to get there. The hotel rooms are clean and comfortable, even though the showers need some plumbing updates. The location of the hotel is great and it is an easy walk into the center of the city. The breakfast is delicious. And then there's the restaurant and bar in the ""vault"" (basement). We happened to arrive on a Wednesday evening and had the very good fortune to hear Ray Cox performing. We ordered a Guinness (tastes like velvet) and an Irish stew and sat and were mesmerized by the beauty of the songs and stories and talent of this Irish balladeer. To my great delight, the waiter (Joe) presented me with a CD the next evening as a ""gift"". In summary,  I would definitely return to this hotel and would recommend it to anyone looking for a well-located, cozy, friendly accommodation in Dublin!",4,2017,03,06
229,Guinness. Trip,Well been to prauge and im off to Ireland tosee thr Guinness experience. And also go to the jameson. Experience. Aa well somed doing some sight seeing. Snd of course a lot of Guinness to taste. Haha lol,4,2017,03,01
229,Daughters 16th birthday ,"I would have like to have given 5 stars but unfortunately the hotel doesn't respond to customers feedback after the stay. This hotel is very unique, quirky and clean and there are many seating rooms which were empty so nice and private, a lovely vault bar and more modern restaurant. The first room we were given a room on the forth floor near the lift and it was lovely, split into two separate parts with a shower dividing it in the middle and two single beds each end, it gave our teenage children the privacy whilst still being in one room. The beds were comfortable but all singles and the bathroom modern and decor very grand. However the single pain glass from it being a period property meant the noise from traffic was so bad, it was impossible to sleep-all 4 of us were kept awake! There was also really loud creaking of footsteps from above us. So the next day we asked to move and it seemed that check in had already happened when we returned from a day out (which we didn't go on until 1pm) because of lack of sleep, so had waited around for an answer first anyway no rooms-bizarre as we had put that request in so shouldn't existing customers be priority? After lots of ""can you sit and wait."" Around 8pm We were offered a room downstairs which was huge-it had a double and 3 single beds and a sitting room but had the car park and outside area to its rear and it didn't seem safe with the glass door. Again there was a potential for the noise. We were then offered a small room with 3 single beds and a camp bed, which wasn't very spectacular or what we had paid €248 euros for two nights for but it meant we could sleep as it was at the back so we accepted it. Prior to visiting I checked TripAdvisor for two months and I explained my 16 year old daughter was celebrating her birthday and she had ME and Arthritis and we needed a quiet and accessible room. There are lifts so that was fine-the lack of sleep the first night made her very poorly and we spent the next day letting her rest before we could go out and this impacted on the whole 3 days. Good location and easy walking access to o Connell street, Temple bar etc, we purchased a 3 day hop on bus ticket from the airport for €90 for 4 of us and that included transfers. The Guinness factory is a must! The breakfast was ok, nothing to moan about or to get excited about. At 9:30 when went down, there wasn't a great deal left. I've emailed before posting this 3 times asking for a partial refund for the first night and have had no reply which is a shame because actually everything else was complimentary. No real care for assistance, although they are friendly. The reception lady did do her best with the room change but it should have always been the right room and medical needs aside, every customer is entitled to sleep! We also asked for Early check in and got a email saying yes at 9am all agreed and it was 1pm when we got in the room. Such a shame as we would have returned and did suggest the hotel to 5 friends for summer paid family price for a double room and one night of no sleep!",3,2017,02,28
229,Great Stay,"We loved our two nights here, in historic Georgian houses now a hotel. Beautiful church next door.  Hotel is in a great location to walk to many sights. Short walk to the airlink bus to and from the airport. We walked all over Dublin from here with no need for buses or taxis. Guinness storehouse is an easy 30 minute walk. Close to walk to O'Connell street and temple bar without being in the fray. This hotel almost felt protected from all the tourist traffic, which was pretty dense. The staff were wonderful and they had a secure luggage room to store bags. They were able to give travel recommendations and restaurant recommendations. Breakfast was good, full Irish with some yoghurts and cereals available. The room was nicely outfitted and spacious, we had a king room. Downstairs has many seating rooms and nice decor. This is a historic property so expect the floors to be creaky , this did not keep us up, all others guests during our stay were curtious. There is a fair amount of street traffic noise, our room faced Frederick street which is pretty busy, though the noise dropped off around 8pm, it did begin rather early, if we stayed again we would request a different facing room, but we had awesome views of the church. We would definitely stay here again. ",5,2017,02,26
229,Ok for a short stay ,"We stayed for 3 nights and the first night we barely slept because the bed was small, very creaky and uncomfortable. The single paned windows exacerbated this as the traffic kept us awake too. The hotel as a whole was very cute and suited us, but it was not exactly luxurious. The location of the hotel was very good - just at the top of O'Connell Street - and the breakfast that was included was lovely. My only issue was the bed in the room itself; my partner and I are slight, but if we were any bigger I don't know how we would have both fitted in the bed!! ",3,2017,02,25
229,Lovely decorated but walls are paper thin. ,"The lobbies are beautiful. 
The rooms are small and the walls are paper thin. Not a good sleep. Could hear guest next to me snoring. Advertise sky and bbc chanels on tv but only one person knows how to tune the tv. He was very friendly and did it for me but when I moved rooms became of the noise he was not on duty and no one could help me. Very frustrating when your own information book says you have sky and bbc but the staff argues with you that the hotel does not have it. 
Had a booking for November but cancelled it. ",3,2017,02,25
229,Nice stay and good location,"The castle hotel is nicely decorated with the lobby area exhibiting grand decor and the rooms being decorated in a more modern way. Although check in wasn't until 230pm we were able to check in at 2. Check out is not until 12 so that was quite handy. 

Something to note is that all rooms come with breakfast. When we initially booked the hotel through a third party we decided not to book breakfast as the charge was quite expensive. However, when we got there we were informed that we did have breakfast. Although great for us, it's something to bare in mind if you haven't booked yet. 

Breakfast was a full English / Irish type breakfast with some cereals and fruit too. Overall the breakfast was ok. The tomatoes were undercooked and bacon a bit cold too. If going at busier times the top up of food was a little slow. I had to wait for toast, ketchup and eggs on occasions. Would be nice to be able to do your own toast. Coffee or tea was made and brought to your table. 

The rooms were well decorated and modern. Although on the small side everything you needed was in there. Bathroom was particularly small with toilet between bath and wall in a tight space. If you like your space perhaps ask or book a larger room. We had a lovely view from our room looking out onto a church, although I'm not sure what the views in others rooms are like. The floors and even the bath creaked when you walked across them, although this kind of added to the hotels character. Most nights the room was quiet during the night, apart from one night during a storm. There was a whistling coming through the window and it did keep me up. Probably nothing that the hotel can do but sturdier windows may help. The bed was comfortable and warm. Although the duvet cover had slits in at the top - I assume to help put it over the duvet although I have not seen this before. The duvet also hung out the bottom of the duvet cover which was a bit impractical and was tried to be covered up by tucking under the mattress. 

Location was great, just off O'Connell street. You can walk or get the bus anywhere in the city from just round the corner from the hotel. I would recommend a travel hop card. We got a 72 hour one for €20 which covered all of our travel. We got one from the tourist information place on O'Connell street. 

Overall it was a nice and pleasant stay. I would come again.",4,2017,02,23
229,Superb location & fabulous staff,"Great 3 star hotel in what I think is the best location, close enough to the action (next to writers museum, art gallery and Parnell square) but far enough away to be quiet in the evenings. The hotel itself is a few lovely Georgian houses knocked through on a corner, so very higgility piggilty but oh so charming! Bar & breakfast rooms are lovely, breakfast is very good but does get busier after 8:30am. Live music in the bar downstairs, very chilled and friendly. Staff are AMAZING especially the reception staff, so helpful in every way. Only downside was the heat in our room, we tried to cool it down with the help of the staff but it was next to the elevator so think that may be the cause. Lidl & Tesco nearby if on a budget, if you are being budget conscious and happy with a 3 star this is the place to book ",4,2017,02,22
229,Second time round! ,"This was our 2nd trip to Dublin & the second time we stayed at the Castle Hotel at the beginning of January for 4 days.

This is a brilliant gem of a hotel situated within 5 minute walking distance of the city centre.  The city is split in two by the river; north & south. The hotel is in the north of the city where O'Connell street is, in the south is temple bar area.  

The hotel its self is an old building made up of several old Georgian buildings. It can be a maze to find your room. The rooms are a good size with all the essentials that you want & need for a hotel stay. The only problem we had was with the people upstairs who for two days sounded like they were doing laps constantly around their room at half 6 in the morning, not what you want when you've had a body full of Guinness the night before! 

The restaurant where the breakfast is served is very good; buffet style which also open to the public. The bar downstairs (the Valuts) is also very good which has Irish music playing from Wednesday nights. 

Overall we'll be back when we visit Dublin again! 

",4,2017,02,21
229,Birthday Weekend ,"Couldn't ask for a better location, close to all the major sightseeing places and traditional Irish pubs (cheaper than temple) but not too close to all the noise.
Our room was large just for two people, clean and quite.
Breakfast was lovely two, great value for money and will be coming again.",5,2017,02,18
229,Adventure in North Irleand,Stayed for 1 night and first time visiting Dublin:) the room itself was basic but clean. Very good Irish breakfast :)  Good location walking distance to the city center and easy access to public transport to get around the city. Staff not too courteous! a little rude! they need to remember that they are there to give a service and their guests are coming from all over the world therefore CORDIALITY is a plus.,4,2017,02,18
229,Short Valentine's break ,Stayed here for 3 nights as a birthday/Valentine's day break. We first reserved a twin bed room as no doubles were available however noticed that a double appeared online a few weeks later. Despite the upgrade cost we emailed the hotel to notify them of the trip occasion and our room was upgraded for free! The hotel is very central and is close by to all the bus tours and local shopping areas. Around a 20 minute walk to temple bar area and plenty to do around hotel. The breakfast was lovely and the room itself was basic but clean and nice. The hotel itself had a quaint feel and was much more traditional than a chain hotel. The bar underneath is very well decorated and despite reading about noise was quiet throughout the night. The only downside was the room temperature with constant hot and cold spells. Overall lovely hotel in great location.,5,2017,02,16
229,Excellent hotel for city break ,"Stayed for 3 nights first time visiting Dublin. Was very impressed with the hotel location walking distance to the city centre and easy access to public transport to get around the city. Staff very helpful, clean room and a good Irish breakfast. I would usually stay in a standard chain hotel although preferred Castle Hotel due to its traditional feel. ",5,2017,02,16
229,enjoyable relaxing hotel in good location,"we stayed here for two nights on our first visit to Dublin, good location friendly staff, ate there on the Saturday,for two reasons we had a fair amount of Guinness in the afternoon and it was chucking it down outside,pleasant meal enjoyed it, then a Irish fellow on a guitar after really entertaining playing Irish folk only down side if i stayed again i would ask for a quieter room we got one near the stair well and lift not great,had full Irish breakfast both mornings enjoyed that to on the hole good value for money",4,2017,02,15
229,"Good location, friendly helpful staff","We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in Feb 2017, in 2 twin rooms. The staff on check in were very helpful letting us leave our luggage as we arrived early in the morning. On getting our rooms, one was very cold but quite large. The other was smaller but very warm. Both rooms needed updating as sockets were hanging off the walls, sealant around the showers were black in places and in general a bit grubby. One of the rooms was on the ground floor directly above the 'smokers bench' outside the basement, The Vault, so this was very noisy till 2am in the morning, which kept us awake and made the room smell of smoke. We only ate breakfast in the hotel and this was ok, nothing spectacular, but nothing to complain about.  The location was good, as it was close to all amenities but if we go to Dublin again, we would definitely not stop in this hotel.",2,2017,02,14
229,Quirky Hotel,The Castle Hotel is a hit and miss experience. It is a combination of town houses and has lots of twists and turns. Rooms vary so much in size and quality. Some are so small that cupboard might be a more accurate description. Breakfast is served in the old Waltons music shop section of the hotel and is of a good standard. The bar is in the basement and staff are helpful. Overall the hotel services are very good but the accommodation does not match up.,3,2017,02,13
229,Enjoyable first visit to Dublin,"Excellent location to get to the main touristy areas of Dublin, staff were really friendly and said we could leave our luggage as we arrived before the check in time. We ate down in the vault cellar and the food was delicious alongside the brilliant. I would have liked the live music to have started maybe an hour earlier than it did. 
Unfortunately the bedroom and bathroom were really disappointing. The bathroom was barely big enough to fit one person in. I'm glad I'm not a 'large' person as I would have felt extremely uncomfortable. The bedroom was really stuffy and the noises outside with the building work and traffic was hard to ignore. I don't think the money I paid for this room was appropriate at all. I don't want to focus on the negative as I really did enjoy my stay and I would have said I would stay again but I would not like to worry about getting a room like that one again. ",3,2017,02,12
229,Nice basic hotel in a good location,"Stayed here for a weekend in January the rooms were nice and clean with friendly staff, but this was about it. The bathroom was nice and modern but freezing without any radiators. There aren't enough tables in the breakfast room to cater for guest and breakfast wise we tried it once so need I say more. It is a nice hotel with great staff members but it's not a luxury hotel in any term. Having said this we would stay there again as it is very central but it is just a bed in an ok hotel.",3,2017,02,09
229,a cracking find,"the hotel was pleasant surprise,nicely positioned to explore Dublin,the room was good the bathroom modern.breakfast was excellent the staff were very helpful with case storage on arriving early and checking out late.the cellar bar food and music was better than expected and an good evening was had by all.",4,2017,02,09
229,Hen do ,"Had a great stay at the castle hotel, rooms were big , beds were very comfortable,hairdryer in rooms,food was amazing , staff could not have been more friendly and helpful,I left my bank card and some other cards and they even posted it out to me , would highly recommend for any type of stay , even the taxi drivers were lovely and helpful .central to all amenities, would definitely go back to this hotel without a doubt.",5,2017,02,09
229,It surprised me,"It's a good hotel, friendly staff, good breakfast, amazing wifi, the size of the room are bigger then most hotels, every floor, every room is decorated in the same style, its cosy, you will feel welcome!",4,2017,02,08
229,Central and comfortable.,"Lovely old fashioned surroundings on the ground floor, with comfortable chairs and sofas in a series of discrete rooms.  Comfortable bedrooms. Live music in bar in evenings. Good choice of breakfast, full Irish.  Very helpful staff.  Thoroughly recommended.",5,2017,02,06
229,Couldn't fault this hotel at all!,"A group of 14 ladies just spent 2 nights here for a hen do and we are so pleased with our stay. Hotel staff were very accommodating and friendly. 

Rooms were a decent size, very clean and comfortable. 

We had a reservation in the castle vaults restaurant which exceeded our expectations. We were made extremely welcome and the hospitality received was praised by everyone in our group. Staff were attentive and friendly at all times. The biggest praise has got to go to the chef!! The food was top notch. 

Would definitely stay here again. ",5,2017,02,05
229,"Grubby hotel, tiny rooms, not in the nicest area","I stayed here on business when my usual hotel was fully booked
I was given a tiny single room at the back of the hotel overlooking a dirty courtyard. I was kept awake all night with music from a nearby pub.

Room threadbear and not comfortable. To top it all I didn't feel safe (as a woman travelling alone) in the area at night.",1,2017,02,05
229,Not my recommendation but please read why,"We stayed 3 nights, rooms were really old and worn, and there were no curtains in the window of the bathroom so we kept having to use one of the towels to cover what we could.  The window looked over the back and into someone's condo (?) so I didn't want to give them a show.  The room we had was larger from the pictures of the layout but the bathroom was tiny and  again with a large very high step up to the tub/shower.  It did have the amenities like a coffee maker and hairdryer but neither of us liked it and probably would have tried to change hotels if we were going to spend any time there.  I feel from looking at the pictures from others that not all the rooms are consistent. It was fine during the day but it felt a bit ‘sketchy’ in that neighbourhood after dark.  It was an easy walk to what turned out to be one of our favorite places to eat & drink & enjoy live entertainment Murray’s, it was an easy walk to the main shopping strip and the Post Office and main stops for the sightseeing tours and a tourist office.  Breakfast was nice, no complaints.  Staff were friendly. Also, when we got our bus back to Dublin from Belfast it just happened to stop less than a block from the hotel entrance.",3,2017,02,02
229,Dated Hotel...needed Reces Pieces To Find My Room,"We arrived late, at about 12 midnight. Checked in by a tall elderly man. He had a ""matter-of-fact"", attitude to him. I love the Irish, he just seemed tired. Then we went on the journey to find our room. When we did, the curtains were hanging, beds were twin beds, bathroom was sad and needed up dating. T.V was mounted and small. We enjoyed the tea in the room. There was no view. Well, of an alley. 
Hotel is within walking distance of theatre, movie show, fish and chip place...O'Connell street in general. Hotel is also on bus route, and taxis are all around. Never met a rude taxi driver in all of Dublin. 
Staff was wonderful in this hotel. From the reception, to eating...very nice people. The house keeper kind of kept to herself. I was thinking English wasn't her 1st language.",3,2017,02,02
229,"A quiet jem near everything, secure parking a bonus!","Stayed twice now and love it because of short walk (5 mins) to one end of O'Connell street.  Refectory style breakfast which I like because of informality. Bar in basement good atmosphere. It is also good for driving from N.Ireland as it is easy to get to this side of Dublin, so don't have to negotiate it's one way streets.
Will return again soon.",5,2017,02,01
229,THEFT IN OUR HOTEL ROOM,"Personal objects were stolen from our room: we had left two Marks & Spencer bags in one of the corners of our room (NOT in the bin!), one of them was empty and the second one contained 3 bra boxes with their content in it. One morning we realized the bags had disappeared! We went down to the hotel front desk and honestly, the reaction of the hotel staff was not what we would have expected: they told us we might have put the objects in the wardrobe, that such things had never happened to them before, and that they would talk to the housekeeper, who apparently started working at 9.30 that day. We waited then at the reception and the ‘housekeeper’ was nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, the front desk ladies were talking to a man (we don’t know who he was) and looked askance us. Then, tired of waiting we went again to the ladies, they told us that they had to talk to the manager and asked us for the purchase receipt to make a copy and give us a refund. And so was it, in the evening -but not without asking for it- we received an envelope with the money. On the next day, another lady asked us for our e-mail address so that they could send us an e-mail with an explanation of what had happened. It wasn’t possible to contact the housekeeper until the following Monday and, how surprising, we were supposed to leave on Sunday. Of course, we have not received any e-mail from the hotel so far. They got rid of us paying the purchase amount and that was all. Really disgraceful.
I would also like to add that the rooms weren’t the cleanest, either. The shower curtain looked like it hadn’t been washed for years. The bathroom had no heating and the window did not close properly. You got frozen when getting out the shower!
The breakfast’s variety wasn’t very rich but we reckon the bar staff were friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, we cannot say the same about the front desk staff. The hotel WIFI did not work correctly and we were not able to do ant online booking so we asked them if they could call a Dublin phone number for us to do the booking. They did it, but quite unwillingly and they reminded us we had a phone in our room.
We had never experienced something similar in a hotel before. This is definitely the worst hotel we have ever been to!",1,2017,01,31
229,"great hotel , great breakfast, great underground bar","I really liked this hotel , It is a short walk to the start of all things worth seeing. The breakfast was great and so were the staff. The bar had live music untill late and then a disco , both were fantastic. Nice rooms in a stunning old building.",5,2017,01,28
229,Ideal place to stay,"2nd stay here. Great location close to hop on hop off bus routes and only 15 min stroll from temple bar. Easy to get there from the airport via airlink bus. Reasonable price, clean, comfortable, great staff and lovely breakfast included. Will stay here again ",5,2017,01,27
229,Wonderful hotel ,"Having stayed here a couple of times now I find this is the best value for money hotel by far anyone can stay in whilst in Dublin. 
The staff here are exceptional, their customer service is well beyond any I have seen or come across for some time. 
I hope to come here and stay again with my family in the summer!! 
It's centrally located walk away from the town centre bus services and your buses are also very close. There are so many places to eat, however the breakfast in the castle hotel is exceptional and the service is top👍 
",5,2017,01,24
229,Causy and comfortable,"This hotel is well located in Dublin, you can do everything by walk.  
It's very causy, we feel in a real castle, anciant and classic decoration. 
The room are clean and comfortable. 
The restaurant for dinner is downstairs and looks different, like an Irish pub and it's dark. Good music in live with musicians and the food is simple but tasty. 
The restaurant for breakfast and lunch is better with the view on the streets. There is an English breakfast buffet with lot of choices..",4,2017,01,23
229,our stay at the castle hotel,"well stayed at this wonderful hotel just can not fault anything about it the rooms very good beds very comfy the staff very helpful and very friendly even the owner came up to us at breakfast and chatted to us.it is a very big hotel with plenty of rooms for you to sit in the breakfast was very good food was good.
i would definately come back to this hotel when i come back to dublin it was fabulous",5,2017,01,22
229,"Friendly, Convenient, Comfortable.","Great hotel, with lots of character. Was informed it is the oldest hotel in Dublin. The bar and restaurant are in the vaults, with a really good intimate atmosphere, we had great entertainment on two evenings. Everyone was friendly and helpful.  Quiet location, yet only about 10 mins walk to town centre.",5,2017,01,21
229,A break away,"Castle hotel is fab the rooms are very clean spacious, fantastic breakfast, enjoyed the food at night in the restaurant, the live entertainment was also a plus definitely go again , the staff were very helpful and cheerful think this hotel is more for older people and family's think the price has went up a bit due to the renovations ",5,2017,01,19
229,Very comfortable and convenient stay! ,"I found a single room on TripAdviser for a truly affordable cost (I'm a college student on a budget, but I like a nice, private room). The hotel is located in North Dublin, about a 20-25 minute walk from the major attractions in South Dublin, but it's a straight shot and I enjoyed the walk and taking in the sites. The hotel is also about a 5 min walk from major bus lines - its in a quiet street but a busy neighborhood with many shops and restaurants, near many great theatres etc. 

The hot and cold breakfasts are quite good, the room was clean, the wifi speedy, and the front desk very accommodating. Would highly recommend. ",5,2017,01,19
229,One of the best,"I stay in hotels all the time and this one is one of the best ever. Great value, really attractive building, and very friendly staff.
Best of all was the restaurant which does superb food at only 20 Euros for 2 excellent courses.",5,2017,01,17
229,Good prices good location,"Clean hotel no fuss comfy bed with hairdryer and toiletries, close to bus stops and tour buses and near the theatre.  Good breakfast choice and helpful staff, nice restaurant food although a bit pricey.",4,2017,01,17
229,New Year Break,"Stayed at the Castle Hotel for 2 nights over the New Year period. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend this Hotel for stay in Dublin. Arrived at 1000 but our room was ready and we were checked right away. We had dinner in the Hotel on Hogmany and it was very nice and the staff were all friendly and helpful. The room was large and the bed was comfortable. Breakast was very good. Loved the white pudding. Bar prices in the hotel very reasonable compared to Temple Bar area, so worth spending a few hours in the hotel bar before heading into the Temple Bar. Only about 10/15 minute walk down O,Connell Street to the River. Will stay again when back in Dublin.",4,2017,01,17
229,Very good,"Stayed here for my wife's birthday, prices were very good. Very close to the centre but not too close as to hear all the nightlife. Very clean and all the staff were very nice and accommodating. They let us check in early so we could head off out site seeing, told us all the best pubs and restaurants to use. Very pleasant stay. Enjoyed it that much we will be booking again soon.  ",4,2017,01,17
229,Excellent place to stay,"We have spent an excellent week-end at the Castle Hotel. Situation is very good, close to buses and center (although Dublin is relatively small). The hotel is a charming place where couple of houses are assembled together to offer a very warmth atmosphere despite the high number of rooms. Multiple salons enable you to read in peace or share moments in a comfortable manner. The staff is extremely  kind and welcoming.  The bar is nice and offers proper level of distraction: not too noisy but not too quite. Weaknesses are maybe the breakfast (good choice but medium quality), the shower (rooms including bathrooms are very clean but the shower offers a very tiny waterfall), and the rooms that can be noisy, depending of your ""room-neighbours""... I would recommend this hotel.",4,2017,01,16
229,"Decent hotel, good location, excellent value for money","Stayed here for three nights in January 2017. The room was exactly as described, very comfortable in all respects. The hotel was well located, just a five ten minute walk from Temple Bar area. The staff were extremely friendly, efficient and helpful. (we had an issue with the sink blocking, and they moved us room without any fuss). Breakfast decent. Good value for money, nice quaint hotel. ",4,2017,01,16
229,Noise,We stayed on third floor I don't know how they got that herd of elephants in the room above the Old building could benefit from some soundproofing otherwise and good stay the food and the bar in the basement excellent,3,2017,01,14
229,Excellent Sevice and Value for Money,"A beautiful hotel near to Parnell square and very close to a stop for the airport bus. The food was fantastic and we ended up eating in the hotel for 3 out of the 4 evening meals we had during or trip. On the Wednesday night a singer sang in the bar downstairs and breakfast every day was also enjoyable. There is also a coffee shop on the corner which serves lovely soup, sandwiches, scones and cakes throughout the day. Our room was warm and cosy. The staff in the restaurant were so helpful and we really enjoyed our trip",5,2017,01,12
229,We stayed for 3 nights excellent hotel,"Me and my partner stayed at this hotel for 3 nights breakfirst included, our room was lovely and big enough and clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful, food was very good we had the Irish breakfirst every morning which was good, we also ate at night time on 2 of the evenings and the food was very nice also live music playing on guitar also found the bar reasonably priced and friendly bar staff. Had a great time at this hotel and would deffinalty return in the future ! ",5,2017,01,09
229,5* Staycation,"We stayed in The Castle Hotel last night, 4 adults&1 toddler. The hotel is made up of a number of beautifully restored Georgian buildings. Being from Dublin its seldom you get the opportunity to experience being a tourist in your home city but it was super from start to finish. The staff at the hotel could not do enough for us. The English girl on reception was exceptionally helpful. Great location. Lovely bar in The Vaults with great live music. Roy Cox belted out the classics which suprisingly my toddler slept through in his buggy ;) 
We also had the pleasure of meeting the owner Mr MacCumhaill, a big thank you to him and his Fianna for such an enjoyable stay! ",5,2017,01,08
229,Cozy Hotel on North Side,"Castle Hotel is a small hotel on the north side of Dublin.  We stayed for two nights and liked the cozy atmosphere, and the breakfast included with the room.  It's a little far away from the main tourist area (Temple Bar, Trinity College, etc), which can be good or bad depending on what you want.  The major issue with hotel is that the walls are very thin.  We could hear every word of conversations in the room next to us.",3,2017,01,08
229,Good ,The hotel is good located and it's clean however I found the bed too small for a couple in length and wide.  Also the breakfast has really no taste and the offer is limited to the ingredients of the Irish breakfast ,3,2017,01,07
229,Very nice ,We had a good 2 nights the bed was ok the walls are a bit thin the breakfast fantastic and evening meal was above standard comfortable seating all around the hotel would recommend to everyone would go back just the meals alone ,5,2017,01,04
229,New Year in Dublin ,"A three night stay in a triple room over New Year. 

Room was spacious and beds were great for three girls. Ensuite was small but looked recently renovated so was more than adequate.

Reception staff were always very friendly and helpful as were the staff that served breakfast and those that worked in the vault bar.

Lots of choice at breakfast and staff would bring over toast when it had ran out. Breakfast was served from 7.30am to 20am which gave lots of time to get up!

Great Irish singers in the vault bar of an evening and drinks were reasonably priced for Dublin.

Would stay here again. ",5,2017,01,03
229,N/A,"In a word EXCELLENT!  Our room was big enough to play rugby in.  Excellent breakfast buffet & basement pub.  Excellent staff.  Had a street view.  Right on O'Connell St. (great shopping).  Walking distance from the Famine Memorial & the Jeanie Johnston.  Further away from the Guiness Storehouse, Jameson Distillery, The Ginger Man restaurant & Trinity College.  Hope to return in 2018.",5,2017,01,02
229,Great hotel !!!,"Stayed at this great hotel for 2 nights 7/8 December. Very friendly helpful staff , spotlessly clean and comfortable room. Yes the floorboards creak a bit but didn't disturb us too much. Breakfast is all you can eat buffet both days this was hot fresh and plentiful with lots of choice ,and a continental selection too.Food in the vault is very good, not a big choice of dishes, but what they do they do well ( chicken breast stuffed with black pudding ,can't remember what they call it, but I can remember how tasty it was). Food reasonably priced too and if you are staying at the hotel you are offered a free Irish coffee at the end of your meal.Thankyou castle hotel if we visit Dublin again we will be back.
",5,2017,01,01
229,Great hotel with fabulous staff.,We had a great stay in the Castle Hotel (9-12 december). Nice atmosphere especially in The Castle Vaults Restaurant. Great food and very nice atmosphere with live music. We definitely will visit Dublin again and for sure will use the Catle Hotel Again.,5,2016,12,31
229,Lovely and comfortable,"Great location for a hotel, five minutes walk from O'Connell Street and the heart of Dublin's centre. Really comfortable rooms and a fantastic breakfast. The one downside was that due to the demand on the water, the first day the shower wasn't brilliant and wouldn't go warm.",4,2016,12,27
229,City stopover,"This hotel is very quirky in its layout, stairs and corridors running every which way. The interior of the hotel and rooms are very run down and need a face lift with the exception being the bathroom which was very modern. If you're looking for a quiet room this may not be the place for you, you can hear all movement from the creaky floorboards from the room above, below and in the hall, conversations in surrounding rooms and bathroom noise. Positives are the Staff are very friendly and helpful, close to the CBD and has secure parking. In the end I don't think we got value for money.",3,2016,12,23
229,Nice hotel on Northside of Dublin,"We arrived early snd staff very kindly advised we could check in early which was fantastic and very accommodating of them.  Room was clean and a good size, shower was very good and plenty of hot water.   Breakfast a little basic and hot food warm rather than hot.  Coffee was awful lol.  Overall rho hotel was very good fir rhe budget traveller.  Staff were friendly and helpful.   The hotel was a maze of corridors and staircases that nade for an interesting wander.  Also check out is noon which is also a bonus.  Buses run close by so easy location to access. ",5,2016,12,21
229,Castle Hotel Dublin,"Stayed here for two nights in December, hotel is in a great location for everything in the centre of Dublin. The staff are really friendly and helpful, the room was spotlessly clean and the bed was very comfortable. The tea and coffee in the room was plentiful not just the two of each you get in most hotels. The free Wi-Fi was good and the complimentary  breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice. All in all a great hotel would definitely recommend to anyone",4,2016,12,20
229,Lovely hotel but a bit if TLC required,We stayed at the Castle Hotel Dublin recently on business and must say that overall we really enjoyed the experience. The main reception area is obviously from the grand old days of the hotel with its simply stunning architecture and character whilst many of the hotel rooms seem to date from an entirely different later more modern (80's) era - but old and new co-exist happily side by side. Yes the older part of the hotel creaks in places but that's just the character of the place rather than a fault. The lift could be a bit quicker. The rooms themselves were on the smallish side but generally very comfortable. The double beds were two singles pushed together but that was no big deal - the rooms themselves were very clean and well stocked daily with teas/coffess and toiletries. There was one major faux pax though that the management must be aware of as it was obvious that a number of rooms had the same issue - that was that the bathroom for whatever reason had no curtain or blind on the window to the outside despite there being a rail with hooks on it - switch a light on and you were fully visible to those in the rooms opposite as well as folk in the car park below. It meant that we had to take a shower by the light of the bedroom and not switch on the bathroom light. There was no point in complaining about this - its such a fundamental thing that the management need to get it sorted asap. Food wise the menu was fairly limited but very good value - we ate breakfast in the Old Music shop restaurant (wide and varied choice of both Continental and Full Irish but for those of us on business a bit of a late start at 7.30am) and evening meals in the Castle Vaults below (particularly good were the spicy buffalo wings ; pizzas ; fish and chips and the steak and ale pie) - nothing fancy but just good comfort food very welcome after a long day. The staff were fine - neither over the top nor underwhelming but certainly very helpful. The Hotel is very handy for the lovely street that is O'Connell street and so very handy for the city centre. If you are bringing a car book ahead as parking space is very limited for the size of Hotel.,4,2016,12,18
229,Unique and comfortable hotel with superb staff,"The Castle Hotel sits at the top end of Dublin's main street (O'Connell St) and couldn't possibly be more conveniently located to public transport,  shopping and historic sights-including the GPO,  which is less than a 10 minutes walk. The hotel is made up of a series of linked Georgian Homes and is full of character and an immensely helpful and friendly staff. If you'd rather use public transport than walk,  all main tour buses have stops nearby (less than 60 metres). I will certainly be stopping here again. ",5,2016,12,18
229,A very good affordable option in a great location,"Great location; friendly and efficient staff; decent-sized room with ensuite, wardrobe, TV etc; OK breakfast (lots of choice); pleasant little bar in the basement. 

One negative: my room looked onto the road behind the kitchen, I think, as I often heard people talking or dumping stuff into bins. 

But, for the price, it was overall an excellent deal. ",4,2016,12,14
229,Very good hotel and breakfast,"Spent 5 days at the Castle Hotel in December, celebrating our wedding anniversary and my wife's birthday. The hotel is made up of several old buildings and is a warren of rooms and hallways and is well decorated with nice furniture. Our room was very good and was spotless, the only downside was the bathroom which was a bit tired and the shower was pretty useless, it operated from the taps and the fitting holding the shower head in place was lose and you had to hold the showier in place to wash, the water pressure wasn't great and the shower could really do with updating. The room was cleaned well every day and the breakfast was very good, with plenty of choice and good coffee. The hotel has a good bar, although wasn't open until about 4pm.The hotel is centrally located, about 15 minutes walk from Temple Bar and compared to Dublin prices is excellent value for money. I would definitely recommend the hotel and should I return to Dublin would use again.",4,2016,12,12
229,Shhhh...Don't tell anybody.. a hidden Gem in Dublin!,"We chose this hotel based on the number of excellent traveller ratings in Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed in the least.  The staff are beyond wonderful and the trip to your room is an adventure...at least for the first couple of days...a charming maze that made hubby chuckle every time I took a wrong turn.  Our room was well appointed, exceedingly clean and very quiet.  We faced the Courtyard and parking and the noise wasn't an issue at all.  The Breakfasts in the music room were plentiful and very good, nice variety of things to choose from and staff are lovely.  One day we had a very early departure, and one of the staff made us toast and tea to start us off.  We ate dinner in the Vault a couple of times, and the steak was done perfectly and the Bailies Cheesecake is to die for.  We enjoyed the evening entertainment and found the bar a great place to end our busy days from touring.  We would come back to this hotel in a moment, should the opportunity arise to visit Dublin again.  Best of the Best!!!!",5,2016,12,11
229,"Cozy hotel, good location but some basic shortcomings","Castle has a very nice old time charm as a building, but at the same time the modernization seems to be still on the way. We had neighboring rooms upstairs and the other one was very hot while the other was freezing cold. The water pressure in the shower was very poor indeed and one morning there was no warm water after three minutes of showering. The shopping district on Henry and Mary streets are within 10 minutes walk from the hotel and the Temple Bar area is some 15 minutes away. Good stay, but not great.",3,2016,12,06
229,Great Dublin Break,"Great staff, comfy bed, breakfast was plentiful, food in the evening very good.
A short walk to O'Connell street from Hotel, a great city to walk round, if you need a bus they are plentiful, and bus drivers very helpful.
People are so friendly in the Pubs and shops, we will be back.",5,2016,12,05
229,Just Perfect,"Lovely Staff, comfy beds and a very good location,  short walk into the City also plenty of busses nearby. The breakfast was very good also a bar in the basement with entertainment most nights, loved the seating areas Hotel has lots of character,",5,2016,12,03
229,Very warm and ambient,Lovely old hotel with loads of character great staff  Lovely old fellow don't know if he's manager or owner but takes the time out  to welcome the staff and ask about your trip  'very friendly staff in a great spot with just a short hop down to  o connall street,5,2016,12,01
229,Golden girls on tour,"Lovely hotel in good location particular good service in bar by friendly staff definitely worth a visit. Breakfast plentiful although bit of a wait some mornings worth waiting for. On the outskirts of O,Connell street so nice walk into city",4,2016,11,30
229,Long weekender in Dublin,"Nice mid range hotel in theatre district.
Several Georgian townhouses knocked into one.
Hotel has a homely feel about it.
Lots of little sitting rooms downstairs if your looking for a quiet corner.
Main bar & restaurant in the cellar - reasonably priced menu with free entertainment on most nights.
Friendly efficient staff & all you can eat breakfast included.
Would definitely recommend.",4,2016,11,27
229,Tired,"The staff here are fabulous and the only reason that I don't mark it lower! They are friendly and helpful but oh dear! The building is showing its age! All the floorboards and stairs creek so be prepared to be woken about 0530 - 0600 as people start moving about. The food both at breakfast and in the bar in the evening was excellent and we were fortunate enough to be their when Ray Cox, The Dublin Balladeer, was performing! Brilliant. The windows in our room had secondary double glazing which reduced the street noise significantly but the sash cords on the outer windows were broken so wouldn't stay up and consequently the room was very stuffy and warm. The price however takes into account many of these issues so I would say it was excellent value for a city centre hotel.",4,2016,11,26
229,Lovely stay,"Loved this hotel, had everything.  Even though we looked onto the street it wasn't noisy.  Room was large with comfy bed and bathroom was nice, clean and a large shower.  The hotel is has some lovely sitting rooms decorated brilliantly. The breakfast area was busy but you didn't feel swamped and staff were quick to remake tables as soon as someone finished. We found the staff very friendly and helpful.  The bar has nightly entertainment.  We stayed 3 nights and went into the bar 1 night and the singer was very good.  Temple bar is about 10 min walk, but we walk everywhere and found it wasn't too far to any of the tourist places. Will stay here again next time in Dublin",5,2016,11,21
229,Night away with my two sons ,"Stayed at the castle 15th Nov-16th Nov lovely hotel ,staff fabulous. Let us check in early at 10am .the walk to temple bar area 10 mins away . Irish breakfast was good in the morning and nice  secure luggage storage area after we checked out as we had a later flight on the weds was nice and easy ",5,2016,11,20
229,Great value & Great staff,"Just got back from another trip to Dublin over many years we have stopped in a lot of the Bed&Breakfast's around this part of Dublin - I have an aunt & uncle who live close by. This was our first stay at the Castle Hotel and we will definitely be back, great value  you may find cheaper but it is worth paying a bit more  for this wonderful hotel.                                   We arrived late afternoon and checked in with my parents both rooms where excellent, our room was very nice with very smart bathroom - very warm and comfortable on a cold November day. We had an excellent fresh breakfast served by excellent staff.  The hotel is one of the oldest in Dublin - a real bit of history, wonderful decor. Great situation just minutes away from O'Connell Street with lots of places to eat and drink before you set out on a trip around Dublin.",5,2016,11,18
229,Great,"Just had a lovely stay at this hotel. Staff very friendly, also the owner,  Took time to ask if we were enjoying our stay. We found the room very nice and the bed was very comfortable..Had a good night's sleep.
Breakfast was very good and catered for all from cereal to full cooked breakfast.
I found this hotel to be very clean and warm. I would recommend this place . ",5,2016,11,17
229,BIRTHDAY IN DUBLIN,"Great hotel Good Breakfast Helpful staff Good Location A Short walk into O,Connell Street,Vaults down in basement with live Irish music We had room 329 big room with big shower room.This is our second visit to this hotel and we will return.",5,2016,11,16
229,Only ok,"Room quiet small for 3 adults.Alot of noise early in the morning.No bath just wet room.water went everywhere.Breakfast area busy but food nice. .staff friendly.The saying you get what u pay for is true in this instance.
Location is good,walking distance to city centre.
This is several old Georgian houses knocked into one higgledy-piggledy hotel.
All in all an ok hotel for a night.",3,2016,11,16
229,Excellent hotel,"I highly recommend this hotel. The food is excellent (including the huge free breakfast), everywhere is spotlessly clean, rooms are lovely, bed sooo comfortable, friendly staff. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.
My only two negative points are: the heating was not warm enough in my room but when I mentioned it to reception they immediately put an extra heater in there which solved the problem & the windows could really use some sort of extra sound proofing as the noise from outside was rather loud (it must be said that there were lots of road works going on at the time I stayed but even when they finished for the night the road was noisy)",5,2016,11,15
229,Lovely Hotel,"Room clean - ours was standard size our friends said theres was a bit small rooms were  cleaned daily  staff helpful and friendly 
Food good  great live local music and good price for both drinks and food
Short walk to tourist bus pick ups 
Definitely stay here again",4,2016,11,15
229,No complaints!,"My wife and I stayed here for three nights,  the bedroom was a decent size, staff were friendly and cheerful, breakfast no complaints at all,. Not to far away from attractions,  would stay here again, the hotel was nice and warm to come back to after a chilly night out,",4,2016,11,11
229,Very Good Hotel,"We recently stayed at the Castle Hotel in Dublin for 5 nights while on an extended visit to Ireland. Our room, while relatively small to North American standards was clean and very quiet both inside the hotel and to outside noise. The hotel is situated in the downtown area and is only a couple of minutes walk to restaurants and the main shopping area. The staff was very friendly and went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. While Dublin's hotels tend to be on the expensive side, we found that the rate charged at the Castle, which included a full Irish breakfast, was very good value. Would highly recommend.",4,2016,11,09
229,"Lots of charm, friendly staff, some minor shortcomings","This hotel claims to be the oldest running hotel in Dublin, and certainly has a lot of charm with pleasant communal areas. Our Superior room was OK, but not great (average beds, bathroom with bath barely usable as shower). No noise whatsoever from other guests, which was great. Fresh Irish breakfast; some additional continental options would have been nice. And I'm not sure what kind of oranje juice it was, but I did not like it. Friendly helpful staff.",4,2016,11,08
229,Fantastic hotel,"Stayed at this hotel for a single night the staff are really friendly and the hotel is spotless would definitely recommend , really close to o'connoll street and close enough to walk to temple bar....",5,2016,11,08
229,good location.,"Arrived & checked in with no problems, payment for the room was due on arrival. Our room was on the 3rd floor overlooking O'connell st which at the momment has alot of road work so its noisey early on in the morning.The room was nice & clean, however the bathroom had a large cracked tile & behind the toilet & sink it was unfinished leaving a large hole. the bedroom felt cold around tea-time & the bed was very squeaky as was next doors ;-) we were awakened two mornings by what sounded like a fire alarm. The maid came in everyday to make the beds & left two chocolates which was a nice touch thou she doesn't wait from knocking to entering the room on one occasion caught my husband in his full glory. (embarrassing for both parties) The breakfast was ok, enough choice, the breakfast staff though were very helpful. we went to Dublin for my husbands 40th birthday & the city didn't disappoint, the hotel isn't the cheapest for what you get but its in a great location.",3,2016,11,06
229,Good value choice,"Not the cheapest nor the most expensive hotel in Dublin. You get nice staff, clean and large rooms and a good breakfast. Is also located in a calm area, close to O'Connell street and The garden of remembrance 
",4,2016,11,04
229,Great location for the tourist,"Hotel and staff very friendly, not cheap and cheerful but thats Dublin (as we were told).
This was our first experience but must say defo be back, so much history here very very interesting.  The hotel at the time of our stay was undergoing some small refurb (painting and decorating in the main areas), we were not advised of this.  Could have spoilt out 3/4 day break but it DID NOT.  Rooms can be noisy but warm and well kept. Breakfast was very very nice but does get busy in the breakfast room and is very hot (so remove some layers).  Bar staff and entertainment just brilliant.",4,2016,11,04
229,Not overly wow,"Stayed here for a night on our honeymoon. Hotel itself is in good location, the room was decent size and lovely en suite. May have been side of hotel we were on but it was very noisy with road traffic. Room itself was cold and during night could hear running water in pipes behind wall, woke me up a few times. Fire alarm also went off at stupid o clock in morning but that would be stupid guests rather than hotel. Staff were great and breakfast was fabby x ",3,2016,11,03
229,A charming Hotel,"From top to bottom this place oozes charm. It's a short walk down O'Connell street to the City Centre or you can catch any of the frequent buses from across the road by the Church. I fully recommend taking a visit to bar downstairs where you will get quality, food, drink & live music. The hotel corridors maze from one to the other but this itself, plus the lovely staff, all makes up the charm of this lovely hotel.",5,2016,11,03
229,Centrally located hotel,"We stayed in this hotel on our last night in Ireland, and it was a pleasant way to end the trip.  The hotel is in walking distance of the temple bar area and Trinity College, which was interesting to visit.  Breakfast was self serve for the cold items, and had a single person serving hot items which was quite busy when we were there.",4,2016,11,02
229,Okay for an overnight,"This hotel is just okay for an overnight stay. The food in the restaurant is excellent. Our room was very dated, the furniture and bed looked like they were a hundred years old and the mattress was horrible. Well I could only imagine was probably ancient too. We arrived very early on the Saturday and the floors were dirty and leaving the next morning it was obvious that they hadn't been cleaned in the last 24 hours. Beer stains etc.",2,2016,11,02
229,Well located for Dublin city centre,"This hotel is well located for O'Connell Street and the shops at the centre of Dublin, and about a ten minute walk from the River Liffey.  It is a period building, so quirky layout of rooms and lots of downstairs sitting areas.
The room we had wasn't large, but comfortable enough, though the furniture is to my mind fairly old-fashioned.  There is no safe in the room, or a mini-bar. Bathroom was small but the shower was good. 
Breakfast was included in our room cost, but we were disappointed with it. The second day we were sent to a basement area which had very limited choice of items, hot food was brought by the waitress from the café upstairs, but some of it was cold. Worst of all, the tea we were given was lukewarm.  We were there for three nights, but on the final morning didn't bother to have breakfast after our experience the day before.
However, we ate in the Vaults downstairs one night and the food was excellent and plentiful.  The live music down there was also very entertaining and we had a couple of great evenings listening to it.
We had a great weekend for my husband's birthday. In terms of value for money, Dublin is an expensive city so the hotel's cost was ok.",4,2016,11,01
229,"Great location, great hotel, lots of charm","The Hotel is in a great location.  It's about a short 1 1/2 blocks away from O'Connell St. On O'Connell street, you can get or be dropped off from a lot of different buses. (Airlink transportation, Hop on/off buses, regular buses, and many tour buses)  I did tours with Finn McCool and Paddywagon, and it was less than a 5 min walk to the pick up point. Once we figured out the layout of Dublin with the hop on/off bus, we realized we were close to many things and just walked.  This was nice because we got to see more of the city.
The hotel is charming.  There are hallways and stairs all over the place, and I didn't explore the whole hotel, but once you are oriented, it's easy to get around.  There is a lot of old world charm to it.  If you have mobility issues, you'd want to make sure you had a room that was accessible to an elevator, which most are, but some rooms you might have to walk down a few stairs. My room was 201, which was through a door right by the elevator, no extra stairs.  The room was small, but very comfy and fine for two of us.  The Bathroom was nice.  The room was quiet. The hotel has two restaurants: The Music Shop and The Vault.  The Music Shop is where Breakfast is served from 7 - 10:30, I think,  a hot breakfast is available (scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes, tomatoes, mushrooms, beans) There is also toast, muffins and Danish, juice, coffee, tea, yogurt, cereal, fruit salad.  If you want oatmeal (porridge) you must ask for it.  If you are getting an early start, there is cereal, fruit, yogurt, juice, toast, coffee and tea available. There is music nightly in the Vault, which was great. The food in both restaurants is great. As mentioned,our room was small.  We arrived very early and ended up getting a different room than what had been assigned to us, since the original room wasn't ready sooner.  Since we were extremely tired, we didn't care, but did wonder if the original room would have been larger.  That said, we only slept there, it wasn't a big deal",5,2016,10,30
229,Charming and historic old Dublin,"An assemblage of Georgian townhouses, the hotel was spotlessly clean with period details, while the location made it easy to explore the heart of the city on foot.The desk staff assisted with our every wish- from speeding our late arrival in order to catch a bite before the kitchen closed to arranging a driver (delightful) for a side trip in the city. The breakfast was full Irish (enormous,) and the rooms were complete with tea kettles and hair dryers-mine looked almost identical to the photo here. One afternoon while in a sitting room downstairs we had a pleasant chat with the owner; he was historically interesting (as is all of Dublin) but also he clearly cared about our experience at the hotel.
My only hesitation would be recommending this hotel if you have mobility problems, due to the numerous areas accessible only by stairs as would be expected in buildings of this age.",5,2016,10,28
229,Fantastic stay,"Hotel in great location, 10 minutes walk from river liffey, and easy walking distance to all major attractions. Hotel has lots of old world charm our room was very spacious.
Staff all accommodating and very polite, nothing too much trouble which made for a great stay.",5,2016,10,27
229,"Ok location, shabby property","We stayed at the Castle 2 nights the beginning of October.  We had two rooms, miles apart.  Very small rooms for the price.  Front desk could be more helpful or smile. We asked for the extra room at check in, which they had available but acted like they were doing us a huge favor.  WI-FI not great, breakfast ok, warm ok selection.  We got spoiled in B &B 's in Kinsale and Killarney..  It is a 10 min walk to Temple Bar area.  We wouldn't stay here again.  We got very use to the great Irish charm and warmth and it was on vacation while we were staying here.  If you want an overpriced and old, but clean place, this might work ok.  Keep expectations low.",1,2016,10,24
229,The Castle Hotel is an elegant and Spacious Georgian Hotel located in Dublin city centre,"Perfect location.The Hotel is actually located on Dublin's official Cultural Trail and is within walking distance of the Abbey and Gate Theaters, the Dublin Writers Museum, James Joyce Cultural Centre, Thus maintaining its traditional charm and enhancing its reputation for comfort, with splendid period staircases, original plaster work and beautiful marble fireplaces,it provide all modern conveniences such as, Cable / Satellite TV, Direct Dial telephone and Complimentary WiFi.",4,2016,10,24
229,great location,"Ideal location to visit the city..a short walk to the centre but in a quite side street, so we weren't disturb by people enjoying Dublins great night life.
Friendly helpful staff.
The room was small and on the 3rd floor but very clean and had everything we needed.
The hotel is a bit of a maze being several town houses knocked into one and the friends we were travelling with had a room at the opposite end of the hotel.
Great basement bar with a pleasant atmosphere.
Good breakfast included.
My only criticism was that our room was very hot and the windows didn't open very far.
Would definitely stay here again.",4,2016,10,24
229,Lovely hotel and full of character,The hotel is located 2 blocks from the city centre. The rooms are very clean and bed is comfortable. The staff are all friendly and willing to help if needed. The hotel consist of 2 lounge room where you can relax instead of staying in your room all night. ,5,2016,10,23
229,Visit to Dublin with friends,"

 We booked two triple rooms but were given two family rooms on arrival. Our room was big and had two single beds and a double bed in it.  The bathroom was newly refurbished and was very smart but clearly needed an extraction fan as there was no ventilation. The water pressure to the shower was very ineffective. The double bed I slept in was probably the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever had, it was excellent. There was plenty of wardrobe space and drawers in the room. Tea and coffee facilities were excellent and they even put chocolates on our beds each day. Our first mornings breakfast was a bit chaotic as the restaurant was full and we were sent downstairs to a chilly room to eat, not the best experience but the two following mornings were fine and there was plenty of fresh fruit, yogurt, cereals etc. The cooked breakfasts were fine. We ate in the restaurant or two evenings during our stay and all the food served was excellent. All the staff we encountered were friendly and chatty, even the decorators who were doing up a couple of the public rooms during our stay. On the whole I would recommend this hotel, it was lovely and warm, clean and very welcoming. ",4,2016,10,21
229,Shabby but not chic,"Dreadful hotel. My room smelt of the previous ladies cheap perfume - it needed airing or changing. The bed was comfy, the shower a mere trickle, the food was shocking bad, deep fried white pudding full of grease. 

I visited for the football so didn't stay in my room much - it was a base but nothing more. 

I didn't complain as I was limited time wise. 

The reception staff were lovely so it has its good points as well as a great location but I would never set foot inside the door again. ",1,2016,10,21
229,A BEAUTIFUL TRADITIONAL IRISH HOTEL WITH CLASS AND CHARM,"When we made plans for our tip to Ireland, and knew we wanted to stay for 3 or 4 days near City Centre and do touring and sightseeing on public transit ... we also knew we did not want a 'new, modern' hotel (translation: a hotel that, once you're inside, you can't tell if you're in New York, Boston, Chicago or Dublin).  We wanted some old world charm, a feeling for the city of Dublin, and the sort of hospitality that sometimes gets lost in 'big time' hotels.

We chose Castle Hotel - and we were very glad we did!

From the moment we checked in the hotel staff - and the cafe staff in the Music Box Cafe, their breakfast venue - were absolutely top notch.  Friendly, helpful, caring, attentive - all the things a hotel is supposed to be and do!  The rich carpets, the baroque / rococo decor in the several reading rooms, the comfortable seating, and the always awake and always on duty front desk team were just what we had hoped for.

The rooms are on the smaller side (that's okay, we weren't entertaining in our room, we were sleeping!), but well appointed, immaculate, and with an obviously very recent upgrade to the tub, shower and bathroom fixtures.  And the hotel was situated right where we wanted to be, a quick walk to O'Connell Street and moments away from all that Dublin has to offer!

I would certainly recommend Castle Hotel to anyone interested in a charming, old world hotel experience.",5,2016,10,20
229,Fairly central with friendly staff,"The (single) room was comfortable enough, if a little small. All the usual amenities were available, including free wi-fi.
Breakfast, at he weekend at least, is busy to the point of chaotic. If you're part of a big group, don't expect to be able to sit together.",3,2016,10,20
229,Castle Hotel is a great place to stay in Dublin,"Castle Hotel is located close to the city center which makes it a great location for walking to many areas of Dublin.  Room was very nice, clean and quiet.  Breakfast in the Music Room was great way to start the day. Reception staff was very helpful and friendly.",5,2016,10,20
229,Friendly staff,This hotel is out of the city center proper so it is fairly quiet. The staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms are a nice size but a bit difficult to find. There are stairs that are unavoidable so it makes it a bit difficult to maneuver luggage around. The restaurant served good food but it seemed as if the wait staff was a bit overwhelmed at times.,4,2016,10,18
229,Fantastic hotel,Lovely hotel within walking distance to the heart of the city. The staff were so friendly  and extremely  helpful. Our room was very spacious and comfortable. Good sized bathroom with bath and shower cubicle. The water was bit hit and miss on what I guess is busy times but apart from that excellent.,5,2016,10,16
229,A good place to stay,"the hotel is a lot of georgian houses put together so the rooms are all different shapes and sizes, our first room was too small so we asked to be moved which they did very quickly with no fuss, our next room was great but overlooked the road which is very noisy but we were fine with that, the room was spotless and housekeeping were very good, breakfast was plenty but the area is open to the public which makes it very busy , the underground restaurant with live music is great fun and worth booking to try, overall the hotel is well looked after but its best selling point is its staff who were just excellent and couldnt be praised high enough",5,2016,10,14
229,Short break in Dublin,"Pros: Well situated, close to hop on hop off stops, pleasant staff at breakfast. Overall good value.
Cons: asked at reception for heating, it was chilly when taking shower, but it never came on!  Had to run around the shower to get wet.",4,2016,10,14
229,Friendly Staff - Good location,"The room was over the parking lot so there was noise late into the evening.  Room was large for Europe and clean.  All in all it was a pretty good value.  Included breakfast included lots of mediocre food.  Pub in the basement had good music, but there seemed to be regulars which made seating hard to come by.",3,2016,10,13
229,Great location,This hotel is very cute.It is a great location to walk around Dublin.Public buses are very close. The hotel is very clean and staff were wonderful! They were all very helpful and pleasant. They served warm breakfast too.,5,2016,10,12
229,birthday treat,"Visited 3rd October for four nights.Fabulous building, characterful, ornate and lots to admire if you like old buildings (we do). Good food, particularly enjoyed the vault with live entertainment. Staff were universally pleasant and helpful. Room was good, very comfortable bed. Would happily visit again but would request room on lower floor as I have mobility problems.",5,2016,10,09
229,Castle Hotel,"Nice hotel in a very pricey city. Easy walk down to the main hub of Dublin, and across the Liffey to Temple Bar. Hotel staff were very friendly, room was clean, bed comfy and shower good. Photos on website are not the standard doubles but that's quite normal. Breakfast from 7am serves continental only, hot food from 7.30 which caught us out as we had to leave. All in all a nice place to stay with parking at the rear. ",4,2016,10,07
229,Nice old building but expensive,"When we booked this hotel, we knew it was an old building, and how much it was.
We arrived at reception at around 3PM, only to find a long line at check-in. Finally got to room around 3-30.  Room OK, not huge, but had all expected trimmings.  Thought the 17 Inch TV way to small for the price of the hotel. It's worth noting that this hotel seems to be several buildings knocked into one, so it is a little like a maze if you are at one of the sides.  The old place means that floors creak and are very uneven. Walls are quite thin and you can hear people next door.
Food at the Castle is pretty good. Breakfast was a little dis-organised, but good quality. We eat in the Old Music Shop one evening and found the meals very tasty.  Staff in this hotel are very friendly and help as best they can.
Overall, Euro170 per night was expensive for this type of hotel. However, it was OK",3,2016,10,07
229,Never stay there again,"I have stayed at this hotel more than once and had been fairly pleased but on the last stay about a year and a half ago some of my property was taken, it wasn't all that valuable just my grandaughters blanket but it wasn't theirs to take.  The hotel said it was a mistake and they would see if they could rectify it. As far as I know nothing was ever done and I was not notified again. The room was fine the dining and entertainment was fine but their integrity is not so I will never stay there again. So hold on to your possessions.",3,2016,10,06
229,Fantastic  dining,"We can't recommend the restaurant  here highly enough. We were a large group  that arrived unexpectedly. The service  was top class  as was the food. We dined in a lovely  barrel vaulted restaurant. We had a mixture of steak, pizza, and goats  cheese tartlet.",4,2016,10,06
229,Luxury,Large and spacious room with character features. Had bad experience that day and cheered up over lovely meal in the Old Music Room Eatery. Staff seemed very pleased to be working there. Real buzz about the place with lots of different nationalities. Quiet despite location in centre of town,5,2016,10,05
229,Very dissapointing,"Have read some of the other reviews here and I'm sorry to mention but I found that when staying for 2 nights I was not happy with the rooms. Bit outdated and creeky. Nothing like the photos. Shower room in corner of room , no bath. Also the waiting staff seem a bit unfriendly.
I did ask for managment twice but no one came and I was very tired so I didnt bother going out to reception to complain for a 3rd time. I just  suppose I should of.

Sorry I think the place has talent but right now its just above par.",1,2016,10,03
229,Terrible Hotel,"Overpriced! Very small rooms, every time someone passes through the hall or is near your room it feels as someone is going to storm into your room! You can hear every door in this hotel as if it's being slammed...no rest. Tiny beds... For such price....it's ridiculous!",1,2016,10,03
229,Wouldnt stay again,"Nice comfortable room , but in  my opinion way way over priced for a 3 star hotel, lady on reception not very friendly and made me feel quite awkward, there always seemd to be a queue at reception and a young lad checking people out the next day didnt really seem to know what he was doing, i asked for a taxi to be rang he said he would, put my bags away came back and started to serve someone else without ringing one,  so i just told him to leave it and walked to work instead, hotel interior is nice though, though to be aware its an old building and was quite noisy with doors slamming and people in the hallways.",2,2016,10,03
229,Paying for the location,"Overpriced , disappointing hotel ...multiple steps even to get to the lift , twists and turns everywhere , you would need google maps to grind your room . Food expensive ...47 euro for cod n chips twice with 2 drinks....room was stuffy and hot with no ventilation as the window was sealed shut ! Bathroom was tiny with no flow in the shower ...",2,2016,10,01
229,"Excellent location, friendly staff, noisy room","I stayed at The Castle last week for a 2 night stay and overall had a great stay. 

From arrival to departure I found the staff extremely friendly, polite and helpful - from reception, restaurant and bar to the housekeeping staff. 

The location is excellent and very convenient for all city centre attractions with everywhere in safe and easy walking distance - this was ideal for me as a first time and solo female visitor to the city. 

The hotel seemed quite old and tired and in need of a big refresh though, with lots of creaks around the place. I noticed this particularly in the restaurant when I ate dinner and every time the staff walked behind my table, the floorboards creaked and moved my table massively. 

The only problem I experienced was that my room was very noisy even with my earplugs in I had extremely disturbed sleep as I seemed to be situated above the car park and every time anyone drove through there was a bump and clattering noise and this happened from the early hours of the morning for hours and meant I had terrible sleeps on my two night stay. ",3,2016,10,01
229,Recommended !!! ,"We arrived at the hotel at 9 am knowing that we couldn't check in till 2.30.  The staff are amazing!!! They took us through and let us leave our bags in luggage storage whilst we could start our journey- experience in Dublin 
The hotel is old- creaking- but still lovely all the same very comfy! The rooms are spotless. No fault really! Bathroom was good too. 
The staff make this hotel!!! We met the owner Finn who was great! 
We had breakfast for the time we spent here... Omg. Amazing!!! The music room cafe/restaurant  was totally different to the hotel- modern!! The food was spot on! 
We used the bar in the cellar with the live music... The story's were brilliant!! Again the staff were great.  
The hotel was just so warm and inviting. Don't even look anywhere else! And 2 mins away from all major bus routes on o' Connell street.  
The hotel was full whilst here but quiet as well! Full of yanks- English- Germans- Dutch -   And everyone talked!!! It's how we should live!!! The Irish are amazing!!!! 
Would we go back??? YES!!!!! ",5,2016,10,01
229,"Really, really good place to stay..","We flew home from there today. We've stayed in Dublin 3 times in the last year, and to be honest, this isn't our normal hotel, as Dublin seemed rather booked up this week. We pushed the boat out and stayed here.

I'll start with the downsides, but do please read on to the good bits.

2 nights worked out rather expensive this time around (we're comparing to our normal hotel), and it had one or two quirks which we weren't overly keen on. 

The shower had the power of garden sprinkler, and you might fit perfectly in the shower cubicle if you are bean pole. But if like me you fit in as a Rugby prop, or just large, you might struggle to fit in the cubicle. It might just have been our room, but ...

If you use a wheel chair, or find stairs awkward, this isn't a good choice. As has been mentioned elsewhere, the building is not just old, but seems to be a few buildings knocked through into each other due to their history (which is cool!), but it does mean that it isn't built to cater. Inside there are stairs all over the place ...

Now, the good bits!

I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE INSIDE! If you REALLY want to treat yourself, and make yourself feel like you stayed somewhere grand, this is a super place to be. We had to take photo's of the interior just to show people. I ended up feeling like I was staying at 10 Downing Street ... This had an old fashioned, yet comfortable and homely, feel to it. The fact it is knocked though seems to mean you can find sitting rooms in funny places. I'm amazed we didn't get lost inside.

The bed was very comfortable (even if a little on the small side) and the room both quiet and of comfortable temperature. I slept like a log.

The staff are a total delight and took interest in our reason for our visit to Dublin (the Zoo) and the location made it easy to get to the GPO and the LUAS.... and the Zoo.

If you have a mid afternoon flight out of Dublin (as we did today), then the late check out is very helpful. The breakfast is tasty and satisfying (even if the restaurant feels a bit like it has more people than space).

Stay here at least once. See if it suits you and your budget. If it does, I don't think many other places will come close for you.",4,2016,09,30
229,Second time here,"Clean, mostly quiet hotel. Looks to be a combination of multiple building, so many twists an turn on the way to your room. Hotel is a short 15 minute walk to all the tour pick up points. Good restaurant onsite with entertainment. I would go here again, although may be hot in the summer.",5,2016,09,30
229,Enjoyed the old world hotel ambiance. Friendly and good location.,"I admit I'm a user of name brand hotels normally, but so glad my husband booked us here. It was lovely, older hotel. Had all we needed, friendly staff, great breakfast, the Castle Vault restaurant was great too. 

Located 20 minutes walk from Trinity College where many tours start the day. Perfect location.  It was neat to make our way thru a maze of hallways as this property has grown over time and adjacent buildings added. 

Two improvements would be a fan in bathroom and a larger TV 

I would book here again in a heartbeat.",4,2016,09,29
229,"Castle Hotel, Dublin","I recently stayed in this hotel in Dublin and was absolutely blown away by it. It is the oldest hotel in Dublin dating back to the mid 1700's and is so full of charm. The owner was on site while I was there and what a delightful man.  It is at the top on of Connell street and within walking distance to everything and on the bus line from the airport. 
All of the staff were so accommodating and pleasant.",5,2016,09,29
229,Good hotel for exploring Dublin,"Firstly, the staff at the Castle Hotel could not be more friendly or helpful, which is a good start.  The Castle Hotel has been going since something like 1809, and whilst it shows its age, being a Georgian building with various quirks, it is charming, comfortable and clean.  

We had a twin room on the 3rd floor at the back which was quiet and whilst not as big as some, was anything but cramped, well furnished with good beds and a good modern en suite.  There is a lift, but the hotel, having spread over more than one property over the years has interesting levels and there are a few steps down from the lift landing to get to the room where we were.  

Breakfasts are buffet style served in the Old Music Shop Café (part of the hotel open to the public as well) and are good and varied, and they serve decent breakfast coffee (much to my relief).  We ate here in the evening and the food is excellent.  We had a pizza that is one of the best I've eaten outside Italy and Switzerland.  We also ate in the Castle Vaults Restaurant where they had Irish music on that evening - great fun, and a good gourmet burger.  The Guinness isn't bad either :-) 

The hotel also has various lounge areas which we found very sociable as we met other guests from various parts of the world here.  Also nice to chill out in after walking miles exploring the city.  

The Hotel is about half a kilometre from the Halfpenny Bridge and Grafton Street, so within easy walking distance of the main centre of Dublin.  This makes it great for access without the noise of hotels closer to the centre (the evenings can get somewhat boisterous!).  It's also in easy walking distance of Croke Park, where we caught the Ladies Gaelic Football Final between Dublin and Cork.  An absolute belter of a match - and we should see more of this sport here in the UK.

We would certainly stay here again.  Great place.",5,2016,09,29
229,Good location,"The hotel is located in a good location. Just off O'Connell Street and about 15 minutes walk from temple bar. Breakfast was very good and can't complain at all, plenty to choose from and freshly cooked. Beautiful building and very well decorated in the reception area. We stayed in room 128 and was a twin room with 2 singles. Room was very dated and needs a bit of TLC. Was quite a bit of black mould in the bathroom, fan in the bathroom was weak and room steamed up very quickly. Windows in bedroom let noise in and heat out when closed. Beds need updating as mattress needs replacing. USB ports on plug a great feature and charged phones very quickly. It's ideal for a short break where spending minimum time in hotel and would still recommend this hotel for a short break.",3,2016,09,28
229,My Favorite Dublin Hotel,"Love this hotel!  Already made plans to stay again, in April 2017!
Great staff!  I have also completed transatlantic flights, arriving Dublin @ 0515. After collecting my luggage, and arriving at the hotel!  I only had to wait a couple of hours!  My advice is to let the front desk know, send an email a week before your arrival.  Then spend some time relaxing in the ""Music Room"", have some breakfast, tea, or coffee!  Relax, they are good about getting you in!  I have stayed there every year for the past 3-4 years!
Dr. James F. Osborne 111",5,2016,09,28
229,Centrally located,A great starting off point for any tour of Ireland! The staff made it easy to find anything you might be looking for. The Castle Vaults were always a great way to end the day with traditional Irish music and a great pint of Guinness!,4,2016,09,28
229,Amazing hotel in a great location.,"The room was probably the largest room I have stayed in.  The Reception staff were friendly and helpful.  Also the breakfast was probably the most substantial I have consumed on my trips.  You have a wide choice of breakfast foods etc.  

Another positive aspect of this hotel is its location.  It is located near to a number of the attractions and also within a five minute walk from the bus stops.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in a quiet area of Dublin yet close enough to the attractions and amenities, so that you do not feel isolated.",5,2016,09,28
229,2 Night stay,"If you want a hostel experience at hotel prices this is for you. We paid $550 for a two nights stay. 
We arrived at 8.00am after a transatlantic flight and asked could we have an earlier check-in( departing guests were already leaving. The young lady said check-in was 2.30PM. I then said we had travelled overnight and were tired and she responded ""check-in is at 2.30PM"" because all the departing guests check out at 12.00noon. I told her this must be the only hotel in the world where every guest checks out at 12.00noon and no rooms are available until 2.30PM We finally got a room at 1.35PM.
It was not worth the wait. The reception area is right out of the 19th century- a broken clock teetering on the mantel, another broken clock on an occasional table and shabby sofas all around coupled with 2 receptionists who didn't take the course dealing with accommodating guests. One redeeming factor was the European staff in the dining room. This hotel is a waste of fine Dublin Real Estate.",2,2016,09,27
229,Excellent location,"Some of the reviews on here are less than complimentary but for us it was a great choice for two nights. The hotel was good-looking, made up of several Georgian properties. Comfortable beds, quiet room even though it overlooked the street, lovely staff, good food, and the location excellent for walking round or getting a bus tour. I must also mention the high quality live musician who sang in the bar.",4,2016,09,25
229,Good Location,"The room was small and the walls were a little thin.  The bed was comfortable and the staff was very helpful.  They even fixed us breakfast at 4:30AM before we left for the airport.  It is a convenient location and you can catch the ""hop on hop off"" bus a short distance away.",3,2016,09,25
229,Our Short Stay in Dublin,"We have just arrived back into Manchester after a short stay in Dublin. The hotel that we stayed in was the Castle Hotel and I would like to say a big thank you to the proprietor and staff for a wonderful time. They are very helpful, polite and go out of their way to make sure you have everything you want. Their is such a happy atmosphere in the Castle you can feel it as soon as you walk through the door. The bedrooms were very comfortable and we had everything we could possibly need for our trip. The food was first class so tasty and very well presented, we only booked for the first nights meal as we weren't sure what the food would be like but we ended up staying for all our meals, breakfast was fantastic such a fabulous choice. Taxis were available to you within minutes. We really wished we had booked for a few more days as we enjoyed in so much. The hotel is also within easy reach of all the shops and there are plenty to see. We are already planning to go back again next year and possibly going twice hopefully. So once again thank you to Finn and all his staff for a fantastic stay at the Castle Hotel x",5,2016,09,25
229,Ok for one night,"Room was smaller than on the pictures and was very noisy. 3 times during the night someone came out to the car park and dumped a load of bottles in the bin. And getting to the room was an adventure. 

Restaurant nice but a bit pricey. The breakfast was heaving at 8.30 and a real struggle to find a free table. Food was rAther canteen style. 

Ok for one night, maybe 2, but no way could I have stayed longer. ",3,2016,09,24
229,Worth staying at for a a couple of nights,"I stayed here for 3 nights, and while I wasn't overwhelmed, I'd return in the future.

Pros: The location is excellent, right on O'Connell street, and several bus lines and a Luas rail stop are only a few minutes walk away.  The staff was polite and helpful, and the room was clean.  There was an issue with the lights one morning, but it was quickly resolved.  

Cons: The hotel is a series of connected houses, and it can be an adventure to find your room (4 fire doors, 2 flights of stairs for me).  The hot water was sporadic at times, and because of the height of the tub, it could be hard to get into and out of safely.  I had a room along the street, and even with the window closed could hear what was going on outside, including the rapid beeps when the cross walk signal came on.   The restaurants are a bit pricey compared to some places down the street, and at breakfast, you went to a counter where someone dished out already cooked food.  As and example, whether the yolk for your over easy egg was actually runny depending on how close you got there to when the food came out.  

Bottom line: If I come back to Dublin, this would be a safe option if nothing else stands out.  I would ask for a room away from the street though.",3,2016,09,23
229,Disappointed,"Room was very small, overlooked a parking lot that was over the pub, so we heard pub music and smelled cigarette smoke wafting up through the window until the pub closed. The room was deep into many hallways behind many doors, wondered what would happen during a fire. There was a bed sheet to cover mattress and only a comforter so i requested a second sheet.  The bathroom was industrial looking but a good shower and plenty of room, they had tea/coffee in room...windows could be opened, I just thought it was kind of disappointing since it had a high rating.  I would not return. This is the second time I have booked a room on Booking.com for the rating and both times the hotel was SUB-par.",3,2016,09,23
229,Amazing customer service and great location,"My husband and I stayed here for a weekend at the start of September with our 2 year old daughter, Matilda.  Dublin is generally not oriented for children but the staff at the Castle made us all feel very welcome as a family. A receptionist bought me her hair brush up to our room as I had lost mine.  The Duty Manager had learnt Matilda's name and greeted her whenever he saw us.  Our room was clean, easily accessible and the breakfast has plenty of choices for all tastes.  We were upgraded the second night to a lovely suite, which was beyond the call of duty.  I would highly recommend this hotel and it's great staff team.",5,2016,09,23
229,A realy lovely hotel,"I was pleasntly surprised, the hotel is in a great location, about 15 minute walk from Temple Bar. The rooms were nice and super clean, and the staff was very helpful. The hotel also has a bar with live music and serves a nice breakfast.",4,2016,09,23
229,Good location in Dublin,"Nice hotel; rooms are a lot smaller than we had expected having viewed them on the Internet. Had we known, would've paid another 10 or 20% and stayed in a bigger named place. It's definitely adequate, it's definitely clean; we just feel it's too expensive for what we got.",3,2016,09,20
229,I recommend it!,"It's a comfortable and warm hotel at the center of Dublin city, with clean rooms, very nice underground bar, very good Irish breakfast.                   
   The stuff of the hotel is very friendly and helpful . 
   Rooms have WiFi, television,desk with mirror,a closet and big bathrooms.
    The funny think in this hotel is the corridor to your room if your room is not near the stairs.",5,2016,09,20
229,Disappointed,"On the positive side the hotel was clean and conveniently located. I had a reservation for a single room and asked for a quiet location. I was given a room off the courtyard in the back on the first floor adjacent to smokers outside the bar. It was not quiet. I was advised by the staff that the Hotel was fully subscribed.The room was tiny and I wondered how I would open my suitcase. The bed was poor, lift was broken for part of the week and plumbing had low water pressure. The restaurant was in a stuffy basement and music was a solo guitar player; hardly traditional Irish music. I agree with previous reviews that this hotel is overpriced. I will not stay here on my next trip.",2,2016,09,20
229,"Lovely staff, great restaurant, but the rooms are a bit tired.","I recently stayed at the Castle Hotel & while the staff were very helpful & the restaurant was excellent, I found the room to be a bit tired & a noisy. I hadn't researched the location sufficiently, so found it was a out of the way for Trinity College & Grafton Street shops. ",3,2016,09,19
229,Recent Stay,"The staff were friendly and were able to answer many questions we had promptly. It is a great location to everything. We walked the whole of Dublin over the course of six days. There were a couple of issues...with the shower, you either froze or got burned as the water seemed to change often. Also, the bottom of the shower was so slick, you either had to brace your feet against the side or hold onto the hand rail. The ""superior"" room is nowhere as big as what pictures look like. There were only two of us, but we didn't have much space to move around. Nowhere really to put luggage even after getting clothes out of it, we had to put them on the top of the dressers to be out of the way. The bottom drawer of one of the ""dresser"" was broken and un-usable.
The Castle Vault was wonderful! Sean, Shannon & Joe (we nicknamed Shamos for our stay) were a great group when we visited in the evenings. Recommended a variety of places to visit of the beaten path. It was nice to come here and relax before calling it a night.
As for the restaurant and breakfast...this is where things kind of fell apart. The restaurant opens at 7am. One usually expects the ""whole"" menu to be available at that time. Well, a hot breakfast wasn't available until 730, which is good if you don't have tours to catch. WE had a couple days with early tours, so the front desk stated they were able to arrange for an earlier breakfast. Well the first day, they failed to state it was only a continental breakfast. The second day I specifically asked if it would be a full hot meal, and the front desk said yes. Well disappointed again. They made us ham and cheese sandwiches to take with us. I ended up speaking with the general manager, whom arranged breakfast in our room the next morning, which was nice but not the point. So if you have tours planned and are leaving before 7am, pick up something the night before! 
The hotel is definitely bigger than what it looks like from the outside! Very quaint and cute for European style. It was a challenge the first two days to remember how to find our room, lots of turns and doors. I prefer softer beds, and the one we had was so hard, I did not wake up fully rested and refreshed.
It might just be the American in me, but I expected better quality rooms for the price we paid.",3,2016,09,19
229,Put Room 322 into Room 101  !!,"We had booked four single rooms for a 2 night stay and on arrival were told to pay there and then and that one of the rooms cost 30 euros more than we had expected which the receptionist blamed on Booking.com. -after some discussion we were able to pay the following morning and split the extra cost between us. 
My room -322 - was awful-small ,dark, hot, stuffy, no fresh air, small window that could only open couple of inches at top,TV on the wall was hanging on an angle and very loose,wrong size loo seat that was also loose, uncomfortable lumpy mattress, traffic noise at night (tho couldn't see any from window ) and what sounded like  2 large wheelie bins full of empty bottles; being pushed across courtyard in the early hours of Sat morning ! (I reported the  stuffiness of the room and the ill-fitting toilet seat early Fri evening but had no sleep Friday night.)
Second night I decided to turn mattress over and around to improve situation but was horrified to discover that underneath the mattress in the centre of the bed was a large plastic Fairy Liquid  bottle that had been leaking for some time, a box of washing powder that again was spilt onto the mattress and base, and an empty cardboard toothpaste box!! BIZARRE OR WHAT?.(it explained the lumpy mattress!)
The night 'manager'(his words) was called, he was embarrassed,apologetic and sympathetic but as hotel was fully booked,could only offer an alternative room if a guest didn't arrive by 1.30 AM! so at midnight I am sitting in reception hoping for the best-transpires this guest had already cancelled their booking  but he was unaware of this! I'm eventually offered the room at 1.20am and have to move my belongings and find room by myself! Lovely customer service I don't think!
I spoke to Reception next morning for refund of room as the situation was unacceptable but was met with no apology and asked why I hadn't reported lumpy mattress on the Sat morning!!...-if I knew then what I knew now I certainly would have done!! Reception also told me  that the night 'manager' was ""'only a porter'"" but as his own manager failed to answer his 2 telephone calls on that Saturday night he was the only one trying to manage the situation!
I have asked to speak to the General Manager (Yvonne O'keefe) but of course no response as yet.
The final insult to all this is that on the Sunday morning, Room 322 was remade and fortunately for me the bedroom door had been left open- I lifted up the mattress and the liquid and powder was STILL THERE!! ...disgraceful!",2,2016,09,19
229,Great Stay,"I'm excited to get to review this hotel. We made Dublin and the Castle Hotel our home port for our 14 day visit to Ireland.
Everyone says great location, good accommodations, hearty-good breakfast and we certainly agree. But without a doubt, it was the lovely staff that made our visit so wonderful. We were actually greeted by the owner who took it upon himself to see our room was ready for an early checkin. We met 2 managers who also greeted us warmly. The front desk folks were totally amazing. Always very busy but always friendly and helpful. They also knew everything about everything and  would pick up the phone and make all yur requests happen. I especially thank Gillian (who never goes home) Caira (who answered all my many emails before we even arrived)Niamh and Ian (not sure his title but great) All remarkable!!
The staff in the breakfast room were always efficient and so accommodating.
We travel all over the world and truly this was such a good place to stay. I didn't even miss my bed at home for the first time ever. Theirs was so comfy.
Thanks to all
Everett and Donna",5,2016,09,18
229,Nice comfortable hotel,"We stayed here from Monday to Friday and found it a very comfortable hotel.  Staff were friendly and helpful (including printing off online tickets for us for Kilmainham Gaol. Room service was excellent (in fact, too excellent as they changed the towels daily despite us adhering to the notice to leave them on the rail if not needing changing)!  Food was excellent, very tasty and average price although the veggie breakfast was disappointing (they just removed the bacon and sausage)!  Evening entertainment was good and we enjoyed a good singalong! The only complaint we have is that it was a warm hotel but we couldn't sleep with our window open as we were on the main road and it was very noisy. Apart from this we were very happy.",4,2016,09,18
229,hotel,What a great place to stay. Staff are very friendly and helpful. gave great recommendations of places to go.  Morning breakfast was very good. and The evening entertainment in the Castle Vault was very enjoyable. We would stay there again.,5,2016,09,18
229,Pleasant place to stay ,"Away for a few days my partner booked the Castle, it is well situated to explore Dublin. The rooms are well presented clean and tidy. Two slight niggles the shower thermostat was not working properly so you either froze or were scalded this was reported and was soon rectified, the other being that the toilet roll was located behind the door. 
 
",4,2016,09,18
229,Lovely hotel ,"This is a lovely hotel and staff were nice and helpful to me too. The room was clean and comfortable but the curtains would not close as they were too short. Had to partially hold them together with a chair. A few bulbs in the lamps had gone too. 

I would definitely recommend but i would suggest however that the staff are asked to treat everybody the same, regardless of age. My daughter paid for the trip. The receptionist talked to me rather than to her about the booking, even though it was clear that she had booked as she made the payment on the day. This seemed to be a familiar problem that I witnessed throughout the week. It's shame as this is a really nice hotel and we enjoyed our first visit to Dublin. ",4,2016,09,16
229,Parking instructions please! 🚗,"Nicely situated within walking distance if centre and not difficult to find. Private and secure parking available but not clear on arrival where to go. Found ourselves having to park in centre car park and walk to hotel to find out what the system was! Easy once you know - round the back of hotel next to the  Old Music shop restaurant behind big wooden doors.  As for the hotel very friendly and helpful staff. Cellar bar food and beer good with live music creating a great atmosphere. Optional choice of eating in the Old  Music Shop also good. Breakfast very good although a bit chaotic. Rooms OK, comfortable, not too small, clean with all the usual facilities. Easy to get lost in the attractive maze of stairs and rooms.",4,2016,09,16
229,Little gem,"Stayed here with friends, 8 of us in all for two nights. Room was plenty big enough for us as a couple (room 235) it was clean up to date with a large bathroom that had a bath and a shower. There are tea making facilities and a hairdryer in the room.
The breakfast was good and included in the price. The bar had live music while we were there which was very entertaining and the singer got the crowd involved. The staff were always friendly and helpful and we would stay here again. The location is pretty central, temple bar is about a ten minute walk, tour buses stop just across the road or down the road depending which stop you choose. It was close enough to the hustle and bustle but far enough away not to be noisy. ",4,2016,09,15
229,"Good location, Average hotel","First night in Ireland. Hotel had a great location but appeared older than we expected. It did have a certain charm though.
Our room was just average and didn't have some of the items we might expect in a big city hotel. No A/C or mini safe.
The elevator from the ground floor worked ok but was very small. 
We found the room was quite noisy at night as the walls seemed paper thin. On our third night the weather was warm and we found the room unbearable. We asked for a fan and they provided a small fan that barely moved any air. They offered a second fan but it was so noisy it couldn't be used. The bed was comfy though.
Breakfasts were quite good. They cooked the eggs for you which was enjoyable. We had dinner in the restaurant in the lower floor twice and we enjoyed the live music. The food was average but enjoyable and the price seemed average as well.
We particularly enjoyed the fact that we could walk to all the major areas of Dublin from the hotel.
We booked the hotel as part of our complete vacation package therefor we cannot judge the value compared to other hotels but our budget allowed for medium priced hotels.
We had high tea at a very fancy hotel in central Dublin but we are sure the price to stay there would be much more than the Castle.",3,2016,09,13
229,Castle hotel,Really nice place to stay for short visit to Dublin. Staff are lovely and the food is great. Bit of a trek into centre of Dublin. About 10 to 15 mins but ideal for burning of suc a massive breakfast!  Live music at weekends too just to add to the whole Irish experience,4,2016,09,13
229,Wonderful find!,"I consider the Castle Hotel to be one of my best hotel finds ever!  The hotel is unique, having been three different hotels or homes which were joined together. That makes for some interesting architecture and fun quirks (like our room is supposedly on the second floor, but the fifth floor is lower than ours!)  The inside of the building is amazing-do not miss the barrel vaulted ceilings in the basement.  (The food is delicious too, and there's the bonus of live Irish music nightly in high season.)  
Ask at the front desk about the history of the hotel, and be sure to check out the museum, also in the lower level.
The location is ideal-within walking distance to Trinity College, Temple Bar, and many other sights.  It's an easy bus ride from the airport, with only a short walk.from the bus stop. 
Our room is unique, with a curved wall!  It is of decent size and laid out very well.  We have the window open, and I can hear a bit of noise from the car park in the courtyard, as well as bits of the music from downstairs, but it's certainly not loud.  (There is no air conditioning on our floor, so you may want to consider that if the temperatures are supposed to be high.)  The lobby and reception rooms on the first floor are air conditioned, so perhaps some of the rooms are also.
The best part of the Castle Hotel though, is it's staff!  They are simply amazing. For example, when we mentioned that we had an early morning tour, they asked what time we'd like breakfast, which is normally served beginning at 7 I believe.  No problem to.have something for us at 6-I was most impressed.  The staff has been friendly and knowledgeable.  
We are so impressed with the Castle Hotel that we've decided to extend our stay here.  It's really a gem!",5,2016,09,12
229,Outstanding,"Stayed at the Castle for 6 weeks as a consequence of unforeseen family circumstances.  The generosity, compassion and assistance displayed by all members of the staff during my extended stay was simply wonderful.  The hotel is extremely comfortable with a genuine homely feel. Old world charm at its best. An outstanding venue!",5,2016,09,11
229,"Excellent, lovely hotel","My wife and I stayed at The Castle Hotel for 3 nights prior to a 6 day Tour of Ireland. The Castle is situated in an excellent location, just approximately 5 minutes walk from The Spire, which marks the intersection at O'Connell Street with Talbot Street and Henry Street, and around 15 minutes walk from The Temple Bar. The staff at the reception were friendly; our room was very clean, with tea/coffee making facilities. Comfortable double bed. My wife loved the small rooms just by the reception,  where we could sit and go through the brochures to decide where to visit each day. Breakfast was great too, with a selection of hot sausages, black and white pudding, eggs, bacon, baked beans, tomatoes, etc and also of cereals and fruits, as well as croissants. Conclusion: this would most certainly be the hotel I would choose to stay during my next Dublin visit.",5,2016,09,11
229,"Good location, breakfast, ideal for the traveler","The staff were great and the hotel itself is lovely.  I was in the cellar last year for drinks with friends and I expected the rooms to be a bit nicer.  We stayed in a family room, which was ample in size but felt more like a budget hotel than a nicer facility.  The bathroom looked as if it had been recently updated, which was very nice.  The room was clean and large but many corridors and hallways were off limits due to renovations.  It was a bit challenging with luggage.  However, the staff were extremely accommodating with our left luggage, and helped me print the boarding passes when the on site printer would not do so.",4,2016,09,09
229,Ideal hotel,"If you are going to Dublin and would like a friendly and clean hotel you will not go wrong to stay at The Castle Hotel . The staff are warm and helpful and will do what they can to help you . The hotel is one of the oldest in the city so if you are expecting top spec like a new hotel you won't get it . Their is not a straight wall or floor in the building which adds to the charm and character to this fantastic old building . I would stay there again without hesitation as I enjoyed my stay , yes you can hear the traffic passing but you are on one of the main routes into the city .",5,2016,09,09
229,History and a good night's sleep,This hotel was a gem of history itself. Built several hundreds years ago as 3 different homes for wealthy doctors and business men. Now connected as one grand comfortable hotel.  Offers a free breakfast and a unique floor plan.,4,2016,09,08
229,Take the time to find it,"Hidden away below the Castle Hotel the Vaults underground Restaurant and Bar is worth finding. Decent food in the restaurant, a unique underground experience, live music every night, great Guinness and friendly staff all add up to a great Irish experience. Oh, on match days the big screen appears, but the passers bye haven't yet clocked that this is on the route to Croke Park. Oops!",4,2016,09,07
229,Centrally located!,Wonderful smaller hotel centrally located. Every staff member was friendly & very helpful. Private parking for 15 Euros a nite was well worth it! Excellent full Irish breakfast was included with our room.Tons of construction were present on re-establishing their electric car system in town so it was nice being central to a lot of pubs & shops!,4,2016,09,07
229,Overpriced for the quality,"Yes, the staff are nice and friendly, but the rooms need some updating. The decor is tired, the beds aren't comfortable. All this for €350 for one room one night and 3 people. There's better quality in Dublin for this price. ",3,2016,09,07
229,Nice hotel,"the Castle Hotel ticks a lot of boxes, Central, friendly staff, nice breakfast and rooms are warm and clean. Great place to stay on a visit to Dublin.  Bit dated in parts and the room could do with painting but bed was comfortable and would defo stay again.",4,2016,09,07
229,A nice stay and close to everything!,"We stayed for 3 nights and booked 2 rooms, a twin room for our sons and a double room for us.  We enjoyed our stay and the staff was fantastic! there were lines for a breakfast table if you went down at 9am rush but food was good.  Because of the lay-out (connected buildings) some rooms were a long walk away (our son's room) but our room was on first floor and very convenient since my husband could not do the stairs!  Rooms were a bit warm....Would stay again!!",4,2016,09,06
229,Nice Irish Hotel!,"Myself, my younger brother and my Grandad stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of August, and overall I thought it was a pretty decent hotel. We all had a single room each, and were all very different. The one I had was modern (recently refurbished), extremely clean, it had everything you would need. The room itself was an okay size, however the bathroom was very, very small. The most spacious part was when you're in the shower with the door closed! In order to “have a number two” I had to sit like I was riding a horse backwards which wasn't ideal to say the least. However as I said, the room was clean, tidy and everything you would need for a couple of nights in Dublin. The breakfast was spot on. Typical Full English with help yourself on the more continental stuff. The staff were all very helpful and polite and were happy to assist you with anything you needed such as organising taxis etc. Be warned however, this hotel is further than you think from the Temple Bar area. It is roughly a 15/20 minute walk from the hotel which personally didn't bother me, however for my Grandad this was a bit of a trek once we'd hit day two.
Overall, I would would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice, friendly, few nights in the wonderful Dublin.",4,2016,09,06
229,True Irish Hospitality,"We have just returned from Dublin after spending 5 weeks at The Castle Hotel due to a family illness. I cannot say enough about the wonderful staff and the service we received during what was a difficult time. The rooms are quaint, clean and comfy and well fitted and the chocolates on our bed was always a treat. The food in the Music Shop and Vault were of a high standard and the delicious breakfast with a good variety of choices, always started our day in a good way. We loved the entertainment in the Vault at night with great Irish tunes. There is no doubt The Castle’s greatest asset is their amazing staff who go above and beyond your expectations and are always ready with a smile. I would highly recommend The Castle if your looking for a hotel with a great location, comfy accommodation and the best staff I think I have ever encountered in our many travels. A huge thanks to all that made our extended stay such a wonderful experience at a tough time.",5,2016,09,05
229,Nice stay!,Hotel was clean and had all the usual amenities. It's very close to central Dublin and I was able to walk to almost all the attractions I planned to see. Staff was friendly and helped with any questions that I had. The breakfast had a lot of options and was a good start for the day. I'd recommend to those traveling alone. My room was on the top floor and I didn't have an issue with street noise at night.,4,2016,09,03
229,"Pleasant hotel, but in need of updating","Initial impressions of the hotel were very good, with nice airy public areas. On entering our room (409) again it looked nice and clean with a bit of character. However on closer inspection, it was all looking very tired. The wardrobe doors were extremely creaky and the room was quite cramped. The bathroom was in need of refurbishment, and the shower water pressure was very poor. Disturbingly, the bathroom windows had plain glass and just a net curtain. There were no curtains or blinds to protect out modesty and we were overlooked. I raised this issue at reception, but unfortunately nothing was done, and we ended up draping a cover from the bed over the window. More positively, there was a lovely bar and restaurant in the basement, with live music every evening, and the breakfasts were good with very friendly service. I would stay again if the bathroom issue was resolved.",3,2016,09,02
229,Very friendly staff ,"A friend and I stayed for 2 nights at the weekend, and while we enjoyed our stay we also felt that the hotel was over priced! The rooms while adequate were basic, they were clean but not spotless, in one of the rooms the remote was missing for the TV, a minor detail but why have a TV in a room if it doesn't work!! I honestly didn't feel 100% safe with just an old fashioned yale lock on the bedroom door given the location so close to the city centre! 
On a positive note, the staff are definitely the hotels greatest asset, we encountered a friendly and accommodating team in reception, in the bar and serving breakfast both mornings. Keep up the good work! ",3,2016,08,30
229,Couldn't be better,"Stayed one night on a weekend visit, it would be hard to find a better hotel . It's a charming Georgian house, the room was, big, well furnished and clean. The beds were comfy and the shower was brilliant. 
The breakfast was very good and the hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful.
",5,2016,08,29
229,A top-notch hotel ,"The Castle Hotel offers comfortable rooms in a convenient location. The staff is knowledgable and friendly. The Castle Vaults Bar offers Irish music and dancing Thursday to Sunday in High Season and Friday and Saturday in Low Season. The Vaulted cellars were home to Sir George F. Brooks, Wine Merchant. A tasty full Irish breakfast is offered daily in the Old Music Shop Restaurant. Good wifi is available throughout the hotel. We recommend the Castle Hotel highly.",5,2016,08,27
229,Lovely hotel in a superb location,A great little hotel a stones throw from the city centre which was perfect for my 1st time in Dublin.  The Reception staff were very polite & helpful in advising me the best way to get round the city & giving me directions.  I stayed here for 6 nights & my room was situated at the front of the hotel but the noise outside didn't bother me at all.  The room was very clean & what I thought was really sweet that each day a chocolate was placed on my bed.  The bathroom was also very clean.  The breakfast is superb with a nice selection from cereals to a cooked brekkie.  Definitely set me up for the day!  So if you're planning a trip to Dublin you can't go far wrong than to stay here.,5,2016,08,24
229,Great central hotel with friendly staff,"The Castle hotel is situated right opposite the garden of remembrance and close to many of the 1916 centennial attractions.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  The breakfast menu great and the choice for evening meals very good too.
Rooms were cosy, clean and comfortable.  As an added bonus luggage can be left at the hotel after checking out so you can enjoy your final day.",5,2016,08,23
229,So cosy,"This hotel has a lovely atmosphere. It's in a great location up the top of of o'connell st. 
Cosy bar lovely restaurant pretty seating areas and really lovely friendly staff   The rooms are clean and a good size 

There is parking and an outside seating area.

229,Avery good place to stay,"These days out family stood at this hotel, centrally located, well serviced with all required amenities, cosy, friendly and helpful staff and most of all clean - we have small kids.  We had dinner at the vaults. Good food and well priced. Recommend",4,2016,08,23
229,"Well located, great food. ","Spent two nights at Castle Hotel. Nice clean hotel in a great location for Dublin City Centre. 
Food for evening meal was excellent,  ate there both nights, pleased with my choices but everyone else's meal that came out also looked nice.
Parking at back of Hotel at 15 Euro per night. Free wifi. 
The Hotel is quaint with lots of character but this meant that my room was reasonably small compared to more modern city centre hotels.",3,2016,08,22
229,Can't wait to come back!!,"Everything about this hotel was brilliant, from the clean, comfy rooms to the friendly and helpful staff.  We came over for a long weekend to celebrate my mums birthday, it was our first trip to Ireland and it didn't disappoint.  The location was perfect, walking distance to loads of sites or a short cab ride ( organised by the hotel staff) or the hop on hop off bus tours to the Guinness factory.  
We spent one evening in the hotel and the food, service and entertainment was great a real good craic! 
We can't wait to come back again...",5,2016,08,19
229,Good location,"Stayed here last week for three nights. Lovely room spotlessly clean, comfortable beds Very reliable Wi Fi Clean towels every day Tea and coffee and biscuits, chocolates replenished daily.  Excellent choice for inclusive breakfast. Dining room lovely and clean with friendly helpful staff. Very good location.  Only downside was ""noisy neighbours"" Would stay there again",4,2016,08,18
229,Very welcoming staff in good location for centre of Dublin.,"Stayed for 3 nights at this hotel, room clean and well kept, breakfast excellent, great staff in all areas, especially at breakfast and in the vaults bar. Thank you for looking after us. Food for evening meal really well prepared and presented and very enjoyable. Also the nightly live music helped give the bar an really warm and welcoming atmosphere. First ever trip to Dublin, and really good place to stay. Thank you to the team.",4,2016,08,18
229,Great location to explore,I stayed here for a week. The hotel is a short stroll to O'Connel Street & about a 15minute walk to Temple Bar. Comfy bed & pillows. Staff friendly & helpful. Filled up each morning with the included breakfast. Ate a few dinners at The Vault restaurant - tasty. Overall a nice hotel in a good location.,4,2016,08,16
229,Good base for exploring Dublin,"My partner and I spent three nights here in June.  Room was OK though a bit small, it was warm, no air, but we were able to open a window.  Listened to Irish music one night in one of the bars and it was great.  Restaurant on ground floor was good - food was fine and really good staff.  We left really early on day three and the breakfast area was open and I was able to get breakfast for us, which was really good.  Wi fi was spasmodic, probably the only minor issue. There is a gym as well.   A good place to stay and a short walk to O'Connell St/Parnell Square.",4,2016,08,14
229,Our first trip to Ireland,"My husband and I were on a tour and this was our first hotel stay in the UK. This is an older quirky hotel with loads of charm. The staff was gracious and wants to please. We enjoyed talking with the owner several times. He was caring and thoughtful. The full Irish breakfast was wonderful and the the dinner prepared for our group was very good. Would we go back ""yes"".",5,2016,08,12
229,Great stay,"Room really comfy and bathroom big and spotless. Clean towels every day. Staff were 
lovely and couldn't do enough for us especially at breakfast, they were run off their feet

The hotel itself is very interesting as it has a lot of old features still in situ

Noise of road but knew that before we went",5,2016,08,12
229,Pleasant Stay,"Stayed here for 2 nights at the end of July while visiting family.  Hotel is short walking distance to O'Connell Street. Staff was friendly and helpful.  Room was small but certainly adequate.  Complimentary wifi worked well with a strong signal.  Full breakfast available in the morning with several options.  There was a computer and printer available for airline check-in, catching up on email, etc. Would stay there again.",4,2016,08,11
229,Great Location! Quaint Hotel!,"We stayed here for three nights in July 2016,  It's an old quaint hotel right near O'Connell street, hop on/off buses, restaurants and shopping. We were happily surprised by what a great location. Breakfast was included with our stay and was PHENOMENAL!   Front desk staff was a bit standoffish, kind of like they were too busy to be bothered, but not rude, and when i did finally get there attention(s) they were nice and accommodating. We requested a ""family room""  the room was VERY SMALL for a family of 4, There is NO A/C and the windows do not open enough to get circulation in the room.  All in all it's a cute hotel in a great location with a great breakfast and I would certainly stay here again.",4,2016,08,11
229,Lovely hotel,"I stayed here with a friend in July, the hotel swapped my single room for a double 
Which was next door to my friends. The room was a nice size, with nice touches such as chocolates on your bed, tea and coffee refilled each day with biscuits. The breakfast was really lovely with black  pudding, eggs, bacon, sausages, potatoes this filled us up for the day. We had a dublin pass for three days which took us to all the places we wanted to visit. The hotel had evening entertainment which was really good. Will return with my husband next time, as I thought the hotel was really accommodating",5,2016,08,11
229,Quaint and cosy.,We enjoyed this hotel. It was so close to the centre of Dublin that we were able to walk to most places and we did. The rooms are quaint and cosy. They were comfortable and always clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast which was included offered a variety of good food each morning. The Live music every night was a lovely addition. It was provided at the restaurant in the basement pub which had a good menu and again friendly happy staff. There is parking available for an extra fee each night. We used it for only one night before we left Dublin to see more of the country. Overall the experience of staying at the Castle was a good one. We thoroughly enjoyed our 4 nights at the Castel and the Dublin expiring overall.,4,2016,08,09
229,Quirky hotel!,"This is a busy little hotel, but none the worse for it! I seemed to be wading through hordes whilst checking in but, later, it was quiet and you wouldn't have known that they were there.
It took me 2 or 3 attempts to find my quirky little room - the room numbering is a little different. And the room was quirky because it was on a landing, had a double entrance door and, at first sight, no bathroom! But it was hiding behind the inner of the double doors. A very compact bathroom with a shower that needed some patience to get to the right temperature but perfectly functional.
There are two places to eat - their coffee shop or the bar in the vaults. I chose the latter where I found a good variety of beers on offer and a knowledgeable bar-keep. A good dinner, too!
From 9pm the bar plays host to live music which can be heard throughout the hotel rooms, so don't expect an early night - but it went quiet at 11pm (almost on the dot!).
The hotel has its own, private car park (a boon) but it is tight and there is a €15 charge per night.",4,2016,08,09
229,Enjoyable four day break,"Enjoyed our stay at the Castle Hotel. Delicious breakfast, very comfortable beds and free wifi. The staff are informative, friendly and helpful and attended to guests needs in a very professional way .... nothing was too much bother for them! The building retains its original features and the decor and furnishings in keeping with the surroundings. Would certainly revisit.",5,2016,08,08
229,Family hotel convenient for exploring Dublin,"Family run character hotel just off of the top of O'Connell Street so convenient for exploring Dublin.  Rooms were a good size, some with bath as well as shower.  Staff friendly and helpful.  Good buffet breakfast in The Music Shop and great food, drink and live music in the castle vaults bar.",4,2016,08,08
229,Castle Hotel - good location,"Clean, comfortable and staff very friendly. Arrived early and were able to drop bags off before check in. Breakfast - good choice and very nice. Ideal location - across the road from remembrance garden and five minutes walk to o'connell street. Nice evening meal in the vault, long wait for dessert but it didn't spoil anything. Enjoyed the traditional Irish folk songs sang by Dave. Bar staff great and knew our order when we rocked back to hotel for our whiskey!",4,2016,08,06
229,Pleasant and secure,"Quaint, cute hotel. Decor reminiscent of early 20th century. Old paintings, nice sitting rooms, very pretty restaurant in basement with delicious and reasonably priced food, live traditional Irish music, good hot breakfast included, 24 hour very helpful front desk, comfortable, clean, secure room! Would definitely stay again.",5,2016,08,05
229,Mums hen party ,Had a lovely weekend stay here in April. The rooms were lovely and spacious. Bathroom was spotless and clean. The bed was comfortable and staff were so friendly. The breakfast was fantastic plenty of choice all the time. Rooms are located all over the place which can make it hard to find it's like a rabbit warren and I got lost a few times but it added to the charm of the hotel. Also a great location for exploring the city centre! ,5,2016,08,04
229,Beyonce concert,We had a fab time! The hotel was lovely and the staff were first class! Would definitely go back and recommend this lovely hotel.  It is also within walking distance of The popular Temple bar and the shops.,5,2016,08,02
229,Nice wee hotel ,"We stayed in the Castle Hotel in Dublin for 3 nights at the end of July. After a disaster with our original hotel booking due to the company going bankrupt, we managed to get this hotel for our dates at very short notice. Based just off Parnell Square at the top of O'Connell Street is a perfect base for seeing the city. The hotel itself is an old attractive building but there is a modern restaurant and lovely bar where there is live music every night . Our room, 105, was right off reception so it was noisy at times and the music at night was quite loud. The room was old fashioned but comfortable. The shower room was very small, especially the actual cubicle, it was tiny. 
The room was serviced every day and clean towels. The staff were very friendly and helpful if you needed information about transport or directions. I would return to the hotel but would ask for a different room. ",4,2016,08,01
229,4 night city break,"We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights and arrived very early.  We were able to check in and leave our cases but couldn't access the room.  This suited us as had chance to wander around for a few hours without having to drag cases.  The hotel is in a good location.  Its quite a busy area but no-where near as noisy as Temple Bar.  The centre is just a few minutes stroll away.

The hotel was very clean and our room (151) was spacious and actually had a large double and also a single bed in it. It was  on the corner and had 3 huge windows. The bathroom was also quite large, as was the shower cubicle and it certainly was one of the better showers I used in a hotel.

The breakfast was also superb and the staff were very helpful",5,2016,08,01
229,Lovely hotel,Stayed here in July for the hubby's birthday. Lovely hotel. Hairdryer in the room and the bed was really comfy. Breakfast included which was served to you so was warm. Towels changed everyday. Only slight problem is that our room was next to the lift so we heard everyone getting in and out so was quite hard to sleep if people were coming in late and getting up early. If you get chance visit murrays bar around the corner from the hotel lovely food and the atmosphere is brilliant. The hotel is located about a 25 min walk from temple bar and the shops. We walked it most days but we got a taxi back 1 night and was 12 euros between 4 of us.,5,2016,08,01
229,Great Location,"Stayed for three nights in Jul, friendly welcome, good sized room, good facilities in room inc free wifi and new bathroom with large shower.  Bit of a maze getting to the room with a few steps but no problem. Hotel is old but is clearly looked after, public areas clean and tidy, nice looking restaurant and bar area (didn't use but looked fine).  Great location just off O'Connell St, Fifteen mins stroll to Temple Bar, less for main shopping area, good pubs within easy reach.  Only downside was traffic noise from the busy junction outside, closing the window didn't really reduce the noise but made it bearable, but also made room quite warm.  Breakfast was pretty good , ealrier you go the better if it's busy, but good food served by very attentive staff. Staff offered honest advice regarding local restaurants which was well appreciated. Overall a good stay.",4,2016,07,26
229,"Great hotel, rooms need a little TLC","I stayed here with my mum for 3 nights on a weekend city break in Dublin. I chose this location to be within walking distance of the attractions but away from the hustle and bustle of Temple Bar area and it was perfect location wise, a little out of the way so quiet but close enough to walk to the attractions and catch the city bus tour. 

The hotel is easy to find and has lots of really great communal areas which are lush and nice to sit and relax in. The Vaults Bar is a lovely place to eat and have a drink, there is live music every night and it has a lovely atmosphere. Breakfast is served in the Old Music Shop which is a really nice space; spacious, airy and well decorated. The breakfast offers a vast and scrumptious selection and we also had an evening meal there which was really tasty. The staff in the hotel and both restaurants are friendly and cannot do enough to help.

The room did let the hotel down a little....ours was small and in need of a little TLC. It feels like money has been invested into the communal spaces at the expense of the rooms perhaps. In our room the tap was broke (it worked but spun around so felt like it was going to fall off), the shower was like standing under someone holding a watering can which was a shame and the lock on our door felt a bit weak. We didn't mind the room too much as we didn't spend much time in there, although I do like a nice shower so that was a bit of a pain. 

I tend to choose hotels for their location and spaces to chill in so for me this hotel was perfect, if you put a lot of stock in the comfort and quality of your room The Castle Hotel might not be for you. The price was very reasonable for the location and quality of the communal spaces, food and service. When it comes to the rooms you get what you pay for. 

I whole heartedly recommend The Castle Hotel if you are having a few nights in Dublin and want to be close but not too close to the action. 

Thanks so much for having us all at The Castle Hotel :-)",5,2016,07,22
229,Historic Hotel in a great Location,"My husband and i stayed at the Castle Hotel for 6 nights. The staff was very professional and helpful in this beautiful, Georgian style hotel. There are a lot of stairs and a maze of corridors which would cause difficulty to anyone with physical disabilities but there is an elevator if needed. The breakfast was delicious served in their charming restaurant, The first 3 days we went on day trips with very early pick up times so a small breakfast of yogurt,cereal,fruit and toast was provided at 6am which was very appreciated. The hotel is within a 5 minute walk of the bus to and from Dublin airport , a Tesco grocery store and the pick up locations for many day trips outside Dublin City. All of the tourist attractions are within walking distance of this hotel as well as the abundance of shopping streets and malls. I would recommend this hotel to all those who enjoy a hotel with ambiance in a very convenient location",4,2016,07,20
229,A Wonderful Older Property - Great Location - Great Service,"Fantastic & helpful folks, great location.  Loved the old style building, nooks & crannies.  Made up of 3 former houses.  The bar in the basement was great - with live Irish music most nights.  Music was fun.  The adjoining restaurant has a good menu and the food was good.  Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Recommended to those who want something less modern and part of the history.",4,2016,07,20
229,short stay,"Hoped to be in  refurbished room but upon arrival advised hoped for room no longer available. Little disappointed but checked in easily. Able to leave luggage as arrived early which is a bonus.
Room- very tired. Bedroom OK but furniture old and well beyond use however bathroom not good. Cracked tiles. Scratched bath. So bad we wouldn't use so had showers, very powerful! However seemed clean overall and tea tray provided. No safe. Although you could use hotels downstairs.
Saving grace was breakfast. Good quality and choice.
On check out we were able to keep luggage in safe room.",3,2016,07,20
229,Great hotel in a perfect location for us.,We arrived around 11am.too early for check in but the girls at reception were extremely helpful.i use a cane and was helped with my luggage to a room off a sitting room. My daughter needed to be out early next morning for a tour and although outside breakfast time she was provided with a continental breakfast. The next morning she had a really early flight out and again was provided with breakfast. The staff in the restaurant were super. The girls at reception were so helpful. One male receptionist was my only disappointment. The beds were comfortable. Room was spacious and the shower was most welcome.,5,2016,07,17
229,"5 days in Dublin, Ireland","I highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a hotel in the center of Dublin with an easy 10 minute walk to Temple Bar area. Rooms are modestly sized, but clean and well presented. Room rates include an excellent full cooked breakfast. Live music is played every night in the restaurant which offers a good menu at reasonable prices. Staff are very polite and helpful. Would stay again.",4,2016,07,17
229,Midweek stay,"Stopped at the castle hotel for two nights last week and could not fault the hotel, lovely rooms with shower and spotless with tea and coffee making facilities, plasma television on the wall. Full breakfast  cereals, fruit and then full English which you queue for and pick what you want and the toast is completed for you while choosing all in all could not fault it. Lovely friendly staff and nothing is too much trouble and yes I would go back again",4,2016,07,17
229,Wonderfully located hotel,"A very well located hotel near Connelly Street and within walking distance to the Bridge! Temple Bar is only 15 minutes walk and tours leave just outside the hotel, though located on a side street!

Very clean and large rooms and toilets. Lovely breakfast and a great bar in the basement. Very close to many eating places, as well. Slightly on the expensive side!",5,2016,07,13
229,With NO AIR CONDITIONING Need to install some fans,"The room we were in had absolutely no fans (not even in the bathroom.) Since there is no air conditioning in the room, a fan would have made it tolerable. You can't open the windows since the windows face busy streets.  The staff was friendly and helpful and the breakfast was very good.",3,2016,07,11
229,Well done!,"I enjoyed my stay here. The staff are kind and helpful. The rooms are well appointed and the bath is lovely. The breakfast is ""full Irish"" with lighter options. It is a quick walk to O'Connell St., well located. I liked the sense of ease here....but is it very busy and there are a lot of ""touristy"" types.",4,2016,07,09
229,The Perfect Place,"My wife and I just spent a week in Dublin and we stayed at the castle hotel. It was fabulous. They were very accommodating the rooms were great, the location is excellent and the service was amazing. We had breakfast every morning and it was very good.  We had dinner there three times and always had a very good meal. The bar is fun and the staff are wonderful!  Strongly recommend!!",5,2016,07,04
229,"A Georgian house turned hotel, very large rooms and plenty of beds!","I traveled with a group on a business trip to Ireland and the last night was spent in Dublin. We were booked by our coordinator at this hotel and it was very unusual, which I like. The property at one point was 3 Georgian homes, and were combined into 1 hotel. We left our large suitcases in the luggage room, but still ended up dragging them to our room - which was no small feat. There is an elevator (very small) and once you get off, you maneuver through hallways, and go up and down stairs (maybe 3-4) to get to your room. Our room was hidden, down a narrow hallway, which was fine, but I got lost almost every time! 
Three of us shared a room - there were so many beds - really perfect for a family. I had a twin against a wall, the other 2 beds were twins pushed together, so you have sleeping for 5. The bathroom had been renovated, but the ceiling was low. The shower leaked a bit, and the drain was very slow, but not really a bother as we didn't shower back to back. 
The most interesting was the Castle Vault restaurant/lounge. That was really interesting! After a day spent walking around Dublin, we decided to go in early and just eat at the hotel. The fish and chips were amazing, and we all had dessert. Worth staying in for. 
Breakfast was a buffet style - and what we expected. Enough food and convenient, and tasty.
The hotel was decorated beautifully! This hotel is kind of on the outer edges of Dublin - we noticed a few seedy types as we walked back in the evening, so be careful. The next block over, there was a free museum we went to before departure. Very cool place.",4,2016,07,04
229,Comfy Hotel near O'Connell Street,"We were very comfortable in our room and have no complaints except for the bathroom privacy.The breakfast was good.Fresh fruit ,Cereals and croissants and traditional English/Irish fry up
There was a slight lack of privacy in the bathroom. There was only a net curtain covering the lower half of the window and the bathroom was overlooked by an office block and we felt that there should have been some blinds in the room to give us total privacy.We were in room 111.
 You are spoilt for choice for somewhere to eat and drink in Dublin.Only one hostelry that we visited did not have live music (we visited quite a few).Traditional Irish food was everywhere as was food from around the world and was delicious even McDonalds got in on the act (Yuk) . Food & drink was probably a bit more expensive than UK prices but if you eat in touristy places round the world you pay tourist prices.Temple bar area must be visited,it is so vibrant.Can't fault Dublin and would like to visit again.",4,2016,07,04
229,"outdated rooms, overpriced.","I typically don't bother with poor reviews, but this hotel is over priced.  the rooms are outdated, and a bit moth ball smelling.  We were placed at the end of the hallway - with lots of empty rooms in between, which - wasn't helpful for us.  The fitness center/hot tub is nice, but it takes 10 minutes to get signed in.  The service in the restaurants was sub par.  The manager and staff were overwhelmed by a big hen party for dinner - and we got forgotten.  Maybe its a castle?  But, I recommend searching for other ""castle stays"" - this is nothing like some other castle stay experiences in Ireland. NOTHING.  Bit of false advertising.  Front desk was nice, but one young man told me that an hour arrival before the airport would be plenty of time.  I knew this wasn't right. (I was more worried about ""is leaving at 9 am for a 12:20 flight adequate?""  He told me if I left at 11, I should be fine.)  - but, I worry that he could cause other travelers to miss their flight.  The hotel was not terrible, but not worth the money.  Am sad that it was our last night in Ireland.",2,2016,07,03
229,single room experience,"The room doors have NO handle on the inside !!! VERY inconvenient to open the door
The shower leaves much room for improvement - very uncomfortable:
Shower stall has no place to hold the soap/shampoo. ""blank walls"" 
Also in the shower - no place to put down the toilerties.
Also in the shower - NO handle to hold on to in case of slipping
VERY UNSAFE !!!!",4,2016,07,02
229,Perfect for families,"This was our second stay at Castle Hotel. Very quaint hotel , quiet street. They have rooms with multiple beds which is perfect for families traveling with children or teenagers. There is no air conditioning so be mindful of that during the summer. Good restaurant downstairs with live music at night and a nice cafe next door.",4,2016,07,02
229,We enjoyed the stay but it is a very old building,"Being in a an old building, it does have a lot of charm, but it does mean that the rooms are small and there are many stairs (there are lifts but you still need to take your bags up some steps). One of our bag wheels actually broke on the steps. 

The room and bathroom was quiet pokey.

The breakfast room was very busy so you feel a bit rushed to get out. 

The highlight was the traditional Irish music in the vault rooms downstairs.  The bar is very ordinary down there though but the music was enjoyable. The restaurant was quite good and had the best atmosphere in a quiet but cosy underground old wine cellars. 

I thought it was quite pricey for the size and age of the rooms.  

It is also not right in town, but the Big Bus has a stop just across the road which was really convenient.  It was a $25 Euro trip from the airport.  

My biggest complaint would be the incredibly painful slowness of the guest computer.  Management - please upgrade the computer!",3,2016,06,30
229,an OK hotel,"We stayed at the Castle hotel our last two nights in Dublin. First off, with all the construction going on and numerous one-way streets, it’s not easy to get to this hotel. I realize this is not the fault of the hotel, but they should do a better job of letting their guests know about the situation a head of time. 
Parking at the hotel is also kind of a nightmare. They do not have valet parking, but they at least have an off the street car park…but it’s around the block, and you need to first park and run in at tell the staff you are arriving so they know to open the gate (which we missed the first time due to a poor description by the person at the desk. Perhaps a picture might be more useful). After a long journey to get there, it’s not really an ideal situation to deal with in order to get to your hotel. 
Once we checked it, we had to get to the room, which was like walking through a maze with a series of heavy doors throughout the hallway, that made getting through with our luggage a pain. 
The room itself was clean, but much smaller than the pictures made them look. 
There is also no iron or ironing board in the room, so be sure to allow for a little time if you need that to be brought up. 
 The breakfast was OK, but we definitely had better at the other B&Bs and hotels we stayed at throughout our trip. 
The location was not too far from where you wanted to be, but it’s not really in the heart of the city either. IT’s not bad if you don’t mind about a 15-20 minute walk to the Temple Bar area. 
All in all, we did not hate this hotel, but it’s not one we would ever go back to in the future.",3,2016,06,29
229,Older  hotel but still really liked our stay,"This hotel is in great location.  Very old worldly and traditional Irish style.  Our room was 3 floors up and had great view overlooking the church one side and the other window looked down the main street.  Breakfast was great, staff  very friendly and helpful.",4,2016,06,28
229,Great little hotel,"Loved the uniqueness of it, does have a lot of stairs in it. May be difficult for someone that is limited in going up and down stairs. Rooms may be small but then I just slept and left early everyday to see the city. Loved full breakfast downstairs n their very own Irish Bar in the basement with live Irish music! Location of hotel was perfect for walking or catching the train or bus. Restaurants and bars within walking distance. Front desk staff was exceptional. They arranged a car for me to take to the theatre one evening. Great place.",5,2016,06,27
229,Not competent :(,"Checking in took more than an hour...and there was no line. They just struggled that much with our online booking. They said they would give us a bit nicer of a room for the trouble and that seemed fine. We park, unload and bring our bags up only to find that ""our"" room was actually already occupied by someone. So, we go back down to the desk. We are now at 90 minutes. They make no apology at all and suggest we find a different hotel, but offer no help in doing that. It's now 9 pm and we had hoped to be watching a football match at 8 in a nearby pub. So we tell the manager that we would have taken that offer 90 minutes earlier but now we really just want to end our day of travel and will stay with them. That was a mistake. They give us another room. This one is not ""nicer"" to make up for the original problems. It was dusty and hot with no ability to turn off the heat (and it's June) and the floor of the bathroom was uneven. After an uncomfortable night we gone down to check out.  The person at the desk was ""new"" and had no idea how to provide a receipt. Since we were partially paying in cash (wanting not to do cash exchange at the airport) we then asked for the cash back so we could pay the entire balance via credit card and have the billing reflected on on our credit card statement.  The guy at the desk refused to give us our cash back and then said we were being ""rude"" for even asking him to do so. After much explanation he finally understood that if he couldn't provide a receipt we'd need our credit card statement to reflect the full balance (work trip reimbursment) and he finally handed over the cash. Again, no apologies at all. The result of this nearly 45 minute hassle was that we nearly missed our international flight home; the agent had to walk us through to catch it and our bags had to be sent standby. So in a nutshell: incompetent staffing both in the evening and the morning coupled with a total lack of accepting responsibility and trying to make things right.",2,2016,06,25
229,A bit expensive for what you get,"Recently stayed for 3 nights, room is a bit Small shower a lot small, the bathroom was refurbished and clean though poorly ventilated, bed great, good tv, the hotel is quaint which we like, our main negative is the room was always too warm due to the central heating, you needed the window open however that allowed in lots of courtyard noise from guests and staff, one night up till 1 . 30 which kept us awake. 
 our room overlooked. Staff and breakfast were good.

Yes the hotel has a good location but too many negatives to return at that price.",3,2016,06,23
229,Lovely hotel!,"Very nice hotel, very quaint and elegant rooms.  Friendly helpful staff.  The car parking is a little tight but this was a minor issue.  The breakfast was plentiful although the hot food was not that hot!  Lovely downstairs bar with irish music every evening and kind bar staff.  The hotel is in a great location, easy walks to the pubs on O'Connell street and a 15-12 minute walk to the River and Temple Bar.  Great place!",4,2016,06,23
229,"Stay away, especially via Hotwire or Expedia ","Dirty rooms, clearly used. Overpriced even though I went through Hotwire. You can do better by visiting other nearby hotels in person. Terrible hotel and very bad management.  Also, if u plan to visit in summer prepare for a hot room with no AC. 

Don't waste your money!!
When problems brought to attention of management they were not interested. They clearly do enough volume not to care about a visitors experience. ",1,2016,06,22
229,Wonderful staff and comfy bed,"This hotel is in a great location and a easy walk to the city center without being right in where the pubs were.

The rooms are a little snug, but that is due to the age of the building and not a problem as far as I am concerned. My bed was very comfy! The only downside I found was that the room could get a little warm and opening the window allowed too much of the outside noise to come in.

The staff were friendly and welcoming and always a delight to deal with.

The restaurant in the basement was good food and not too expensive at all. With the added delight of live music from 9pm if you wanted to stay and listen.

Would stay again on a trip",4,2016,06,18
229,It's a give and take,"The room was clean but tiny.  The staff was nice and friendly as the drunks outside my window were loud and ""early"".  The location was really good and is within walking distance from the main city hub. I would highly recommend this place just ask for a room that does not face the road.",4,2016,06,17
229,Ok probably wouldn't recommend due to poor breakfast,"When I am away I dont look for too much in a hotel because I plan to not be in the hotel much (at all) other than sleeping as I like to sightsee and so on. That said, I do like a good breakfast as part of my stay.

The room I was in was fine but on the small side. There was a TV and desk and a table which were good but the walls were waferthin so I had the pleasure of hearing a couple at it and toilets flushing. Moreover, the floor boards creaked badly and the doors SLAMMED shut.

Breakfast was a joke. I am not a fusay eater but the cereal presentation was poor, the yoghurt was in a big bowl and the cooked breakafast was very poor; cold HARD boiled eggs, raw black pudding, cold fried eggs, horrible sausages, nacon that I couldn't cut with a knife or even chew to digest.",3,2016,06,16
229,Great rooms and friendly staff ,"Wonderfull service and the staff was very helpful and friendly. The room itself was great; good lighting, it was comfortable, clean and quite big. The athmosphere was great. When re-visiting Dublin we'll stay at the hotel again.",5,2016,06,10
229,Group Tour stay,Brought a group of 40 to Castle Hotel. Reception was very helpful.  The hotel has elevators to get to the many levels. The group was split up and stayed in various parts of this sprawling hotel.  The room was small and quaint but comfortable. Breakfast was wonderful with very fresh foods from local farms.  I also loved venturing down into the vaults for music and a drink.,4,2016,06,07
229,"Too expensive, too loud","Place in great location but definitely not worth the money we paid for it. Additionaly rooms are too loud as you can hear every step on the corridor as well as every breath of your neighbour. 
There are also good sides of this place: great breakfast which will keep you running the whole day. Location from which it is close to everything. Cosy bar downstairs and clean rooms",3,2016,06,06
229,Dublin trip,"We stayed at the Castle Hotel and can report it's a very good choice. The location is near the centre, the room was comfortable, the breakfast was plentiful, the staff were pleasant and efficient. We even met the owner who was a charming character. If we visit Dublin again we'll head back there.",4,2016,06,04
229,Galway group over 60s,"Stayed here with group of ten friends,the hotel was excellent,great location,lovely rooms,very comfortable beds,great breakfast,wonderful dinner,lovely music in the bar,staff very friendly,we all will definitely be back.",5,2016,06,04
229,3 day stay,"Over for a mini - break.  A lovely and deceptively large hotel just to the north of O'Connell Street. Welcoming staff, nice room. Old fashioned, comfy and friendly.
Had lunch and dinner in the Old Music Shop Cafe both of which were tasty and enjoyable.",5,2016,06,03
229,Great location and decor ,"Visited for a three day, two night stay. Situated on the north side of Dublin and approximately 10 mins walk from O'Connel Street and the start of all the tour buses. It is a load of different buildings put together so you get ups and downs and steps up and down. Decor is victoriana looking but well done with loads of comfy sofas and areas to sit. It is next to a very busy road so expect some noise. Breakfast is served in an adjoining building known as the old music room and it is hectic and items are placed in different places instead of together. On the first morning we were not impressed, squashed on an end table, no orange juice or fruit and the breakfast was cold by the time we got back to our table. The second morning we were down earlier and it was a lot better. So give it a go but beat the rush which starts about 8.30 to 9.30 and things just don't work right. The best part was a night spent in the bar which is set in the seller's and they had live music - Wed to Sat at this time of year. The staff throughout were really pleasant and helpful and made our stay really nice.",4,2016,06,02
229,Long weekend break ,Had a great stay here ideal location to explore the city would definitely be back. The full irish breakfast is excellent to get you set up for the day. Room and bathroom clean and homely rooms serviced every day. Ideal short or long stay hotel.,5,2016,06,02
229,Went out of their way!,"Staff were helpful, friendly, patient, and professional. I'm glad I had the opportunity to temporarily call Castle Hotel home for 2 weeks. The continental breakfast, bar, live music, afternoon and evening meals, and dessert were on point. They were accommodating of my dietary needs. Wheelchair access with an elevator (lift). As you wait for you rooms to be prepared, you can store your luggage in the luggage room and check out the town.",5,2016,06,01
229,Average Stay,"The location is great, cannot fault it. However, the price is way over what I would expect for a property of this quality/Services. Also, the staff were not overly helpful at all.  Felt like we were an inconvenience to them. The girl who brought us rooms service was lovely. Also, the noise was awful. All day long as our room was above where people smoked.",3,2016,06,01
229,"Good hotel , great location ","Had a family room for 4 , room was spacious , clean , bathroom too , clean towels each day and plenty of tea/coffee making facilities.
Nice location , just away from all the hustle And bustle of the city. 
Breakfast was good , not a huge selection , few cereals & a couple of fruit options ( not fresh ) cooked breakfast was lovely , staff all very friendly and happy .
Not ideal for those with walking difficulties , lots of steps , the lift doesn't go to all floors . Would stay here again",4,2016,06,01
229,Nice enough hotel,There is a bar downstairs and a large restaurant/cafe attached. There are a large number of little sitting rooms dotted around the hotel but the hotel was hugely expensive and the room itself was very small.,3,2016,05,31
229,"One night stay, great location, poor service","Stayed for 1 night as we were going to a concert in croke park, this hotel is great location wise for croke park or going into the city centre! Rooms were nice and clean! They could do with making the outside area nicer. Big down side for us was the breakfast, they didn't have enough room in the main breakfast room so sent us to downstairs which was fine but they directed us the wrong way and we along with others ended up in the kitchen! Service was poor no bowls etc and long wait to even take order and when it came the fry was cold and not a great selection! Tea was also cold! ",3,2016,05,30
229,Could do better!,"This is just what it says - a cheap hotel for a stay in Dublin.  The rooms were clean and we were confident that the linen and towels had been laundered, but the stains all over the towels were not impressive, neither was the state of the paintwork in our room
The breakfast was poor - no fresh fruit at all, weak coffee and toast made whilst your cooked breakfast items cooled on your plate!
We visited the bar one evening - the 'genuine Irish music' was an old bloke with a guitar.  Admittedly, he was Irish and he could sing/play.  We all sang Irish Rover etc with him, but there was little atmosphere.  This could probably be put down to the fact that it was very difficult to buy a drink.  At 10,30p.m., they had no red wine (""the delivery is tomorrow and the bar upstairs is locked so I can't get any from there""), they only had Chardonnay and could not make any hot drinks!  A diet Coke, when you wanted a bottle of red and some coffee, is not a good substitute.
The waiting staff were friendly and helpful but the Eastern European reception staff were stony faced and unapproachable.
Our room was on the side of the very busy road and sleep without earplugs was well nigh impossible - make sure you are in the back of the hotel if you must stay here.
We would only recommend if you have a very restricted budget and don't mind being on the wrong side of the tracks.",3,2016,05,27
229,Convenient location,"This is an old Georgian property so if you are not good with stairs it is one to avoid as even though there is a lift, there are stairs along corridors linking the buildings. The rooms and bathrooms are spacious but there is no air conditioning so leaving the window open in warm weather means street/courtyard noise. All that aside, it is a very comfortable hotel with excellent helpful staff, a good breakfast buffet and a restaurant with bar and live music. It is very convenient for the Airlink Express and the Hop On Hop Off tour buses.",4,2016,05,27
229,Average / lovely decor,"A lovely georgian hotel in the heart of Dublin. Reception was very helpful, if slightly reluctant at first. Very nice, cosy drawing rooms to read and take your tea in, but the expensive (200 Eur upwards) rooms were slightly below par: Mostly tidy, but not too well equipped. Small, rusty mirror in the bathroom, spiderwebs... usually okay for me, but not at that price. Our room faced the inner courtyard, just above the bar's exterior terrace-we could hear people drinking and talking until 3 a.m.
Breakfast was a bit disappointing and worse than in a lot of BnBs in the countryside. It was served in a cantina-like atmosphere -no fresh fruit, just canned. Full irish breakfast, boiled eggs, orange juice, cereals, toast and jam available. Again, not bad at all, but we have had that kind of breakfast at 70Euro-a-night-accomodations. No specials, no extras. So, the big plus is the beautiful setting, the location, the building. A nice city hotel, if only a bit overpriced imho. ",3,2016,05,27
229,Enjoyed the OLD Style Charm and Meandering Halls of this old building!!!,Had a great stay at the Castle Hotel and I must admit the time was improved because Scotland and Ireland playing in the Worlds in Soccer. The Entire Tartan Army was in Full force and we had a great time drinking and partying at night with the Army. The Hotel had a quaint bar in the basement with Music Nightly and the room was as odd as the multitude of hallways that wrapped all over the building. I would say if you enjoy a place with a little character and as an American something different this place would be a good stay.,3,2016,05,25
229,Great location for a week in Dublin,"Reception very helpful, rooms comfortable, breakfast excellent, lobby and pub very congenial. We spent one evening listening to a folk singer which was very enjoyable. Hotel is walking distance to main area, near many bus routes and one block from two wonderful museums, Dublin's Writer's Museum and Hugh Lane Gallery as well as near top restaurant, Chapter One and great pub with music, Murray's Bar.",5,2016,05,25
229,two days in Dublin,"Not worth the money, wrong side of town too! Cheap bed linens, room smelled, towel very old, not friendly staff. I paired close to $280.00 per night, and was very disappointed
Totally NOT worth the room rate!!!",3,2016,05,24
229,"Nothing special, did not appreciate the singer...","Hotel is nice, most of the staff were really pleasant, particularly two girls on reception. Breakfast was good and staff were attentive there too. We were basically ignored when we dined at the restaurant.
Major drawback is the live Irish singer in the restaurant, who can be heard in any room in the vicinity until he finishes at 11 and who was unnecessarily rude to my mother and I when we visited to watch, as it seemed we might as well watch it if we were going to have to listen as well.",3,2016,05,24
229,Castle Hotel in Dublin City Centre - Gardiner Row,Very nice hotel in a great location in Dublin.  The hotel staff is friendly and the rooms are clean and tidy.  The restaurant is very good as well and they have a good selection of beer on tap.  It is an older style hotel that fits in with the community and very comfortable for travelers.  Easy walking distance to many attractions.,4,2016,05,23
229,Clearly recommendable,To put it short. Nice centrally located hotel with a reception that assists you when you need it. The bus from the airport to 6 EUR stops 100 meters from the hotel. Lovely breakfast. In the evening there is music in the hotel bar.,5,2016,05,23
229,First stay in Diblin,"This was our first stay in Dublin and first stay at the Castle Hotel. I thought it was conveniently located about 15 minutes walking distance from the Temple Bar area. The center meridian of O'Connell Street Upper is under construction until 2017 to access the Luas, so vehicle and foot traffic is affected. The hotel placed us toward the back of the hotel which helped to make it quieter. The hotel is dated and could use new carpeting and upgrading the rooms, however for the price and location, it was a good choice. The breakfast was sufficient and tasty. We scheduled a stay at the beginning and end of our trip which turned out to be a good plan. The hop on hop off bus starts and ends nearby. The airlink bus stopped nearby . And a taxi to the airport was around 20 euro. All the transportation options were convenient. ",3,2016,05,22
229,Ideal,"We booked a Thursday to Saturday short break. Hotel about 5 minute walk from the river, shopping, pubs. Lovely and clean, comfy bed. Entertainment in the basement every evening. If we visit Dublin again we will definitely stay here",4,2016,05,22
229,First trip to Dublin,"The most attentive, helpful, friendly staff who couldn't do enough for us. The food was great and the pub at the hotel was lively and entertaining. As our first trip to Ireland it was made so special by the staff at the hotel.  We were on a morning flight so arrived before check in time, and we were able to go into our room as it was ready. Just a brilliant hotel, cannot fault it.",5,2016,05,19
229,Husbands birthday ,Stayed here for 4 days. The hotel was lovely. Staff were great. Food lovely. We really enjoyed the music bar downstairs. Very good live music every night. Will definitely return. Thanks for a lovely experience of dublin,5,2016,05,19
229,hotel and restaurant,"Very comfortable family hotel with full english or continental breakfast included in the price. Staff were very helpful. The food in the restaurant was served promptly.Tea, coffee and biscuits is available in the room, very welcome on arrival as we got there at about 1.30am as the plane was late leaving Nice. We only stayed three nights but it was a memorable and enjoyed weekend. I would recommend this hotel for anyone who wish to spend some time in Dublin.Dublin itself offers a full range of tours. The walk along O'Connell street is enjoyable even in the rain.",5,2016,05,18
229,Great hotel,"Went to dublin to celebrate my birthday & 40 years of being a couple. Hotel was absolutely fantastic could not fault it. It's location is great for bars, restaurants, sight seeing. Bus from airport dropped us just down road from hotel. Our room was great with loads of space, food was excellent with lots of choice. All staff very, very friendly. Will definitely again.",5,2016,05,17
229,Girls on tour,"It was weekend away.  6 welsh ladies in  dublin 
We found a Great hotel  in really great  location  at top of main street on line.
We discovered it was Right by the busses which gave access to every part of Dublin fair city
The rooms were Good size and kept  clean and tidy 
The Friendly staff were always there to help  
Good breakfast with everything you could want ",5,2016,05,16
229,Family Trip,"Summer family trip with a few spontaneous nights away in Dublin. This hotel was beautiful, a real old fashioned Georgian type style which I loved- I love a hotel with charm, character, bookshelves and cosy armchairs that you can drift off for hours on. This hotel fits the description! There is plenty of little nooks and crannies in this hotel, a wide choice of little lounge areas which are homely and warm. The family room was spacious and bright, with the same classic decor. Location is perfect, short walk away from the buzz but not central that you would be disrupted by the noise. Food was beautiful, plenty of selection for breakfast and on eating in the vault restaurant as well I have no complaints as everything was lovely and to my liking. The staff were very friendly from arrival to departure also, very attentive and warm. On leaving the hotel, our travel arrangements where for later in the day and so the hotel were kind enough to keep our luggage safe all day for us. This enabled us to enjoy our last day in Dublin and partake in some sight seeing! Very pleasant time at the hotel and it is one I look fondly on as many family memories where made in our few days stay :) definitely will be returning!",5,2016,05,14
229,Perfect hotel to stay.,"My sister and I arrived on the 9th May - our first time in Dublin - and we knew we were over 30 minutes early.  The staff did not bat an eyelid and allowed us to check in and were very helpful and polite.  We were given the key and directions to room 123 which is up on the first floor.  There is a lift, which we used as our bags were a rather heavy.  We found our room quite easily although it is a little bit of a maze, but not complicated.

The room was a lovely size with huge twin beds, huge georgian windows, high ceiling and lovely natural decor.  The bathroom was an adequate size and included towels, shampoo and soap.  

In the room there was plenty of tea and coffee so that was nice.  Also in the room was a hair dryer and a large screen television as well as the usual wardrobe, drawers, AND a lovely comfy sofa!  You don't get sofa's in many other hotels - one chair if you are lucky - so that was nice too!

We had breakfast, which was included in the price, in the music room and the food was lovely!  The waitresses were very attentive and always smiling.  We had some meals in the Vaults (very nice too!) in the evening and stayed to listen to the singers that provided the entertainment.  Alan Dee and Ray Cox were the singers, both singing Irish songs and other songs that people from all around the world would know.  Both of these guys were extremely good and very very talented!  This live entertainment was provided free to the hotel guests and it really made for a fantastic atmosphere!

We met Finn, the owner of the hotel, who likes to sit in reception.  He is a lovely man and has lots to be proud of here.  

The hotel is situated up a slight hill, but O'Connell Street and the River Liffey are not too far away.  There are plenty of buses and taxi's around if you need them.

The only slight drawback about our stay was the noise coming into our room from the street.  I would say that the windows, beautiful as they are, have the original Georgian glass, and I can quite understand why double glazing would not be appropriate as it would spoil the beauty of this old building.  However, the noise did not spoil our visit and we would absoloutely love to stay here again in the near future.  I would totally recommend this lovely hotel - but if you like modern, new hotels, this isn't for you.  This is an old, charming, clean, beautiful hotel but it is not minimalist like Travel lodge or the like.  The hotel offers the personal touch with the staff always being on hand to help you whenever you need them and feels quite homely with lots of comfy chairs and sofas in the sitting rooms, and gorgeous paintings on the walls.",5,2016,05,13
229,Excellent hotel,"This hotel has given us one of the best services we've had, all the staff are friendly and nothing is to much trouble for them, they have booked day trips for us and given us some useful information on what to do for the day. The room we had was quite large and very clean, the breakfast was good and the evening meals at vault was excellent, also most nights there was live entrainment in the vault restaurant. Also you are a 5minute walk from the city center.",5,2016,05,11
229,Perfect for our needs!,"Comfortable room with sitting niche at window.  You get enough air with the windows open!  The staff was uniformly helpful.  Location is good, just off Parnell Square.  They make home-made scones that are the best we've ever eaten!  Restaurant staff truly outstanding.  We are so pleased to be here!  I wasn't feeling well so we have not yet explored much in the area.",5,2016,05,09
229,Clean & friendly hotel,"We stayed here for 2 nights in April 2016. The location is good, far enough away from the Temple Bar area so your sleep isn't disturbed, but still walking distance away.
The rooms were clean and well appointed if a bit old-fashioned, but this adds to the character of the place.
The Irish breakfast was good, and they served decent coffee.
Service was good throughout.
The bar downstairs was really nice for a basement place, and the live Irish music playing was great fun.",4,2016,05,09
229,Nice Hotel ,"Stayed here for three nights, room was clean and bed was comfortable 

Buffet Breakfast was very good, good selection of cooked items and coffee was served on arrival in the restaurant 

Live music in the bar was great, fantastic atmosphere and prices were standard to everywhere else

Good location at the top of o'connell street 10 minute walk to the river and a further 10 minutes to Temple Bar area 

Overall a nice hotel ",4,2016,05,08
229,Exceeded my expectations ,"I wasn't hesitant about booking this hotel because I tend to read the negative reviews first. I am glad I decided to book this hotel for the following reasons.

1. Quiet and clean room with excellent view of the church. My room was 417. Keep in mind that this hotel is one of the oldest hotels which means that some aspects of the hotel cannot be modern, such as the structure of the whole building. I could hear people walking on the hallway but at night it was quiet since people were sleeping. It would be a problem if there were lots of people who liked to drink late and come back to the hotel late. 

2. Great breakfast! The dining hall was very cute, clean and modern! Excellent staff and food!

3. Hot water and great plumbing. I don't know if I got lucky or if it's been renovated but I didn't have any problem with getting hot water instantly and the water drained quickly. 

4. Pretty lobby with many places to sit and relax 

I would definitely stay here again! ",5,2016,05,08
229,"Good hotel, great location","This hotel is very central, near O'Connell St.  Friendly staff, especially in the breakfast room and bar/restaurant staff. Clean, comfortable room, large shower. Towels could have been larger if I'm being picky, but otherwise everything very good. Breakfast - selection of cereals and fruit/yogurts/juice etc. Cooked breakfast excellent.  Could have done with the pastries/croissants and bread selection being set out better.
A good hotel and I would recommend it.  We stayed for three nights.",4,2016,05,06
229,Very pleasant,I've always enjoyed my trip to the Castle.  That is why I returned. I really loved my evenings listening to the music and see my friend Hazel and all the folks there.  What more can I say?  The reception was also very helpful,5,2016,05,04
229,Good location ,"Early arrival on the 25th of April. Staff checked us in and held luggage until room was available after 230pm. We then went out touring the city.
When we returned we were given our room keys and recovered our luggage to take up to our rooms. 
The room we had was nice. Clean. We had a street view. 
Bathroom sink was outdated but quickly acclimated to the two faucets. 
Restaurant was quaint with very good selection of dinner options. Decent wine list.
Pub was lively in the evening with local musicians. Barkeeps (Hazel) very friendly and genuine. 
We also had an Irish breakfast each morning in the very busy dining rooms. When we had to leave early for a day long tour we were provided a Continental breakfast. Thank you.
The staff was very helpful with making  reservations at other restaurants, wakeup calls etc.
I would return with out hesitation.  This property does have a lift.
Thank you Castle Hotel and staff for making our stay memorable. 
",4,2016,05,03
229,Nice hotel and good location,"We arrived early before our room was ready so we we're able to leave our bags in a locked room and come back later.  Once chekced in the room was nice bed really comfy just what we needed as a base for the weekend.  We had dinner in the restaurant that evening and the food was delicious the staff lovely and the atmosphere was good.  The breakfast in the morning was really good ate so much we didn't need to eat again till dinner.  The music in the vault bar was brilliant worth a listen really enjoyed it.  Staff really helpful really helped us find our way a few times and helped us with the tram to the zoo (good day out). All in all good hotel lovely staff, food and drink great just don't get to excited about the showers or the coffee in the room (coffee at breakfast is a lot better) it's not nice ",4,2016,05,03
229,Below average mixed bag,"This is on behalf of partner who stayed.Mixed bag. Cold and could hear people in adjacent rooms , no heating on. Noisy toilet . Never fixed after agreeing to check. Breakfast room was chaotic and overcrowded. Food average. Nice music bar in the evening with live music.
Staff variable in presentation and attitude.",1,2016,05,03
229,Good option.,"The hotel is well located, in Pernell Square in front of the Abbey Presbyterian Church, The hotel is comprised of several buildings of Georgian style, the hotel is comfortable, the interior is elegant and convenient and the staff is very attentive. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, bathroom is also spacious and well made,the breakfast buffet is served in the cafeteria located in the ground floor and of the building and that is public access, there enjoyed a more than acceptable Irish breakfast , there we knew that in the past illustrious Irish men  as Michael Collins and Eamonn de Varela were guests of the hotel, a recommended option.",3,2016,05,02
229,disapointed,"Stayed here for 2 nights 29april. In room 211, you had to squeeze past the fireplace to walk round the bed, very basic room and the TV was in an alcove which wasn't ideal for watching. Went to have a meal, downstairs and the man on duty wasn't forthcoming in offering us a table. We ordered a meal and waited for 40 minutes!!! When we noticed other people being served before us we asked the waitress, and she said she would find out why but then stood at the bar talking. After asking again, we were told that they were waiting on chips, not a good enough excuse. Our meal was then brought to us but we refused it. We were offered from the manager a free meal the night after but we decided to eat elsewhere.",2,2016,05,01
229,Lovely hotel close to the heart of Dublin,"Lovely staff. Very friendly and accommodating. Old style feel yet ver comfortable. Great food in both restaurants. Very charming structure with lots of cozy rooms. The cellar vault bar is fantastic. Good is delicious and the nightly music is loads of fun. 
Only negatives...rooms not sound proof although the area is quiet. Water pressure in shower very low. ",4,2016,05,01
229,"Brother and I vist Dublin for 8 nights in April, 2016","Room 202 looked onto the car park but was quiet, clean and lovely.  My brother's room, 107, overlooked the front and looked like a pix but there was some street traffic noise but 2 huge windows.  The staff in the dining room (breakfast) were friendly and the food was very good!!!. All of the staff at the front desk were welcoming, knowledgeable and the Garden of Remembrance is right across the street as is O'Connell Street. Lots of buses nearby and excellent restaurants including Chapter One right down the street!!! Great location.  Will stay here again.",5,2016,04,29
229,Close to town centre,"We were in Dublin for 5 nights, and chose this hotel for the location.  We had a room at the back of the hotel (ground floor) and had no problems with noise.  The room was clean, and was serviced every day with clean towels.  AND chocolate on the bed each evening when we got back to the room :).  The shower was nice and powerful too. 
We didn't try the restaurant in the evening, as we were trying the local pubs, but we did have the breakfast in the morning.  Full Irish, cereal, viennoiserie, ham and cheese, jams and a selection of breads.  It was very good, and the staff at breakfast were very friendly. So we had a good breakfast, did our sightseeing and then had dinner out in the evening. 
They have a live musician in the bar every evening, but as the bar is in the cellar, we didn't even know he was down there, until we went looking, the sound proofing is very good.  He was very good too.
The hotel is within walking distance of the main town, and there are bus stops very close too, so if you are going on a sightseeing visit to Dublin, this is a very convenient hotel to stay in.
In the hotel there are lots of little lounges, and corners with sofas, and some lovely old furniture, I would love to have done a tour of the whole hotel to see all the little hideaways, but didn't dare! 
I would recommend this hotel.",4,2016,04,28
229,We could not have asked for more,"We found this hotel met all our expectations, the location is ideal for any sight seeing, close to hop on hop off stop but also if arriving by air coach(3rd stop, top of O'Connell st). The reception staff were warm and welcoming, more than happy to give advice, directions along with storing luggage on arrival and departure.
Our room had the most comfy bed we have ever slept in during a holiday, the hotel its self is nicely furnished and has charm and character along with the bedrooms, our room was at the rear of the hotel so no traffic noise noted, 
Breakfast was more than adequate with a selection of fruit, cereals juices, cooked Irish along with toast and pastries.
Unfortunately we did not try the hotel restaurant in the evenings.
We also purchased the Dublin pass which for us worked out very convient though quite expensive.
It was my first trip to Dublin and was so impressed by the kindness of locals after stepping off the air coach just before 9am looking lost and immediately offered directions by a passer by.
I cannot find fault the the Castle hotel and have nothing but praise for its location staff and management and can't wait to return.
Thank you to all for making our stay a great one!",5,2016,04,28
229,CASTLE HOTEL...FIT FOR A PRINCE...,"SOLO TRAVELLER...on arriving at reception AND within 4 minutes I was given my key and off I went...finding my room was easy as the directions were bang on...my room was fit for my purpose.big enough for myself and spotless...the bathroom/ toilet has all you need if you did not bring any toileteries with you...I asked for an iron/board again within 4 mins it was in my room...I went for my dinner down stairs AND I can assure anyone staying here the food is second to none, as was the service...I had the goats cheese starter and it was small BUT,I was glad...as I ordered the steak to which I TRULLY COMPLEMENT THE CHEF,...then I asked for the cheesecake,and to be honest I have had better...the base was all too moist for me...I pint of shandy and the bill was €36.05... I would have paid that alone for the steak...all in all my stay here was enjoyable...breakfast is your typically European minded breakfast BUT, caters for all ......shall I be back,,might even bring my wife...lol.xxWOULD I STAY HERE :EVER AGAIN:......YES I WOULD....... I found the manageress to the plumber extremely helpful in every way possible...Yvonne, runs a very well run hotel...and long may it continue...X",5,2016,04,26
229,Expensive for what i paid,"Staff friendly and helpful 
Good location for walking down main O'Connell street and Henry street for shopping 
Bus stops close by for hop on and hop off( green bus was excellent ) and airport 747 bus good

However was expecting more for my money felt slightly ripped off paying over €500 
Was a birthday present for my mums 50th 
But Very noisy didn't sleep much for the 1st night due to traffic noise we stayed in room
222 so I would suggest asking for a room
Away from the road when booking 

Breakfast ok - had much better 
Not huge choice and Luke warm lots of noise and people walking up and down the breakfast room which was annoying , stools very uncomfortable  but staff friendly and helpful 

Room was clean and good size but mattress wasn't very comfortable 
Bathroom tired but clean 
No safe which I didn't like 
Couldn't get WiFi code to work 

Didn't rate the menus for the restaurants downstairs - ok if you like fish, stew or burger 
I wanted a curry or lasagne something similar but no luck so ate out every night plenty of pubs / eateries to choose from 
 
",3,2016,04,25
229,Short break,"Lovely hotel - great food - comfortable room and good music below stairs. However they could do with more staff in the restaurant and bar at weekends - staff were rushed off their feet and service was really slow. However, we would definitely return as we really enjoyed our stay.",5,2016,04,25
229,"Lovely hotel, helpful staff great location","Stayed here for 2 nights in April, gorgeous hotel. Not quite what we expected from the outside, we drove past it twice not realising that it was ours! Lovely bar downstairs which we spent most evenings in, gorgeous free breakfast in the mornings in the restaurant! Great location about 5 minute walk from the city centre, transport for the airport bus is 6 euro and is literally across the road. Staff was happy to help us even phoning places we wasn't sure was open as our phones wouldn't work! Temple bar is literally a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel, where the lively bars and restaurants are with live street music. Will definitely come back! 

Only complaint is the bathroom, very tiny. Anyone larger than a size 6 will struggle to sit comfortably on the toilet as it's wedged in between a wall and the bath!",4,2016,04,25
229,"lovely hotel, clean, good service","In the center of Dublin, lovely hotel, very clean, good service.
Dont miss the Irish singer at the hotel pub (several times a week). Very good atmosphere.
Around the corner literally from the main street and all the nice shops and attractions.
I will definitely go there next time too.",5,2016,04,25
229,Superb,"I arranged this booking for a night away for my wife,three daughters and my mother-in-law and can only comment on what they thought but I must say my dealings over the phone and through emails was a very positive one.
This hotel is stunning.located within short distance of O'connell street etc.Rooms are fabulous(my wife had large family room)
Breakfast was great.No faults with this hotel,can't wait to stay myself.",5,2016,04,21
229,Lovely hotel,"We  had a problem with the heating the room was way to hot, we told reception and the problem was solved within 5 minutes.  The service at the hotel can't be faulted.  Our room was large and clean. The breakfasts were good and the meal we had on our first night was excellent.  We will definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2016,04,20
229,A positive Dublin experience,"My wife and I had 3 nights stay in the hotel.
I had asked for a quiet room as there seemed to be an issue with noise on the main streets. Sure enough we were given a room at the rear. We found beds comfortable and the rooms had the usual facilities incl. tv and coffee/tea facilities.
The only real issue was the ensuite which was, in effect, a wet room but the floor tended to flood well outside the shower area.
All staff were superb, very helpful and knowlegeable. 
We met with friends and had 3 excellent evenings in the ""Cellar"" with live music and bar. 
Overall for the price it was good value.
Location was excellent for all the buses not only for ""Hop on hop off"" but also for the airport.",4,2016,04,20
229,Too worn too expensive,"Stayed 4 nights at this old hotel and eventhough it is charming this doesn't compensate for how worn the place is. Much too expensive and we even stayed in a room with a freezing cold bathroom (as in no heating at all!!) no pleasure. Breakfast is acceptable, but not for 4 days in a row. Next time around I will definitely find a different hotel.",2,2016,04,20
229,We Stayed 2 Nights,"It was in a good location for visiting Dublin in March. Our breakfasts and dinners were excellent. The people that work there are very nice. The cook is excellent. We had room number 349. It has a horrible view of the dump area and that is it. So do not stay in that room. But when I closed the windows, our room was nice.",4,2016,04,19
229,Excellent Hotel in brilliant location,"So pleased with this hotel as it was within 2 minutes of the bus stop of the Flightlink bus from the airport and also very good location for sightseeing and local pubs, restaurants, theatre and information bureau. The room was very comfortable and the food for breakfast was very plentiful and good. You are free to help yourself with juice, cereal, fruit, yoghurt, rolls, soda bread and a hot buffet is served from the servery by the chef including toast if required. Tea or coffee is served to you at the table. Very good food and good service.",5,2016,04,18
229,"Clean, Comfortable and close to everything","Stayed nine nights in April 2016. Hotel is in an excellent location, close to the airport (taxi will cost about €20) and right at the top of O'Connell street - location is excellent. We walked to the Guiness Storehouse (about 3km), Temple Bar, Trinity College and all of the museums (which are free). Staff at The Castle were so pleasant, they helped us with early check in (we had an overnight flight). They also helped us find bus routes and train routes. Everyone at the hotel was exceptionally pleasant and helpful. Room was clean and comfortable. We were on the top floor. No issues with noise from neighbors. We were able to take the elevator to our room. Were able to take a nice hot shower, just had to turn the water on max hot and let it run for a few minutes before getting in. We didn't have any isdues with the wifi - it was great to have. Hotel staff were kind enough to arrange early breakfast for us (cereals, toast etc) on days we were doing day trips. Ate at both Castle Vaults and Old Music Shop restaurants and they were both excellent! Pizza at the Old Music Shop was especially good. Would definitely stay here again.",4,2016,04,17
229,Still Dublin's Best,"Thanks to all the staff who assisted me this morning!  You went ""way out to help/assist me""!
I was able to obtain some ""badly"" needed rest!   Now, tomorrow, I can complete my endeavors!
I appreciate ""all""!  Thank You!
I always recommend your facility!

229,Georgian charm,"A big, rambling Georgian building of great charm, full of odd angles and changes of level with an eccentric layout including lots of little lounges and ante-rooms (you can easily get yourself lost but will enjoy yourself exploring). Intriguing variety of furniture and paintings. Traditional thick carpets over creaky floors. Big and lively enough to have a buzz about it but with no rowdy guests. Excellent location yards from O'Connell Street.

Our room (no. 221) was attractive - adequately sized; decent bathroom up two steps; comfortable bed and duvet; big sash windows with the original or nicely reproduced frames but double-glazed (proper panels, not secondary glazing). There was a certain amount of noise, both buses in the street and inside: audible footsteps from above and the occasional guest stumbling on the corridor step outside our room despite the large illuminated sign warning of it. Not a problem (as reported by a few reviewers) and no late-night revels, noise was not enough of an issue to stop us getting a good night's sleep. Wi-fi a little erratic but fine most of the time and 4G available when it wobbled. I dare say the rooms are all different but no reason to assume ours was atypical. 

Breakfast was pretty good - limited range but all fine. There is a nice basement bar with a good range of beers and OK bar-food. Unlike the rest of the hotel, a bit disorganised there at times but nice atmosphere. We did not try the dining room or the evening entertainment. Staff were mostly very helpful and the owner charming and solicitous.

If your top priorities are on-trend decor, lots of fast lifts and top modern sound-proofing the Castle will not be your first choice. But great for Dublin Georgian charm and nice atmosphere in a central location.",4,2016,04,14
229,"Quaint, cozy hotel",Stayed in this hotel during our first visit to Ireland.  It's an older hotel with tons of character.  The location was great for sightseeing.  The restaurant was cozy with good food and service.  The vault bar in the base was very fun with life Irish music each night of our visit.  We didn't want to leave.,5,2016,04,12
229,"Friendly, helpful","Very useful location at the far end of O'Connell Street, a ten minute stroll to all the action.  I had hurt my back, and the hotel were extremely efficient at organising a doctor to come within an hour and give me a painkilling injection.  And, because I wasn't moving much, I ordered from room service, and it was always good and timely.  I'm only disappointed I couldn't have enjoyed their live music nights, but definitely a good recommendation.",4,2016,04,12
229,short break in Dublin,"Very good hotel and this is why......
Welcome was good, could access to our room on arrival at 1.30pm.Lift brilliant.
Good evening meal if want it , except watch the prices with 2 course menu, some main meals and a dessert are cheaper to pay separately.We ordered a ceasar salad and a dessert and paid for a 2 course menu this was more expensive than paying for the 2 separately,only discovered this 24 hrs later and had paid already.
Room service and cleaniness of hotel excellent.Breakfast choice great lots to choose from and staff very friendly and approachable.Complimentary use of computer brilliant , helped with prebooking tickets for attractions.Great location,easy to walk into city.Airport link bus stops close by.Storage of luggage on last morning very convenient.Would stay again.Reasonable price.
Found Dublin to be very noisy,busy,lots of road works,lots of homeless people.The Easter rising exhibtions excellent and lots of attractions to visit.",5,2016,04,10
229,Very good hotel where you can breathe the old style Irish atmosphera!,The hotel is located in a key and strategic area of Dublin. As you do the check in you understand that you are in a magic place where you can enjoy the Irish atmosphera. Some rooms are really nice with a canopy bed that bring you in the imperial time! Breakfast is well organised and you can enjoy the real Irish breakfast. Good choice to have spent 4 days in this hotel!,4,2016,04,10
229,Charming Hotel,"I stayed at this hotel for two nights with my mu and my nine year old niece. Everyone loved this beautiful hotel and enjoyed the complimentary tea's and biscuits. The hotel is styled beautifully and each room could tell a story. There are plenty if area's in the hotel to sit upon a comfortable couch and relax. The staff were great and very friendly as they welcomed us to the hotel. The breakfast, which is hosted in the Old Music Shop is plentiful. One morning at breakfast, the owner of the hotel actually took some time to speak to the guests in the hotel and asked if we were enjoying our stay. This was kind and sweet gesture. 
The hotel is also in a great location at the top of O'Connell's street. A bus stop is situated across the road from the hotel. All of the main sight seeing buses stop there. But the hotel is located near many attractions as it was only a 15 min walk from Temple Bar. Also it is only 5 mins away the General Post Office which is a significant feature in the anniversary of the uprising. 
We had dinner in the Vault restaurant on our last night at the hotel. The food was to a high standard and everyone cleared their plates, including starter, main and dessert. I would also say the price for the three courses was very reasonable and worth every penny. 
I would definitely loved to stay in this hotel again.",5,2016,04,10
229,Well located,"6 of us stayed here on our trip to Dublin. The place is well located.  Only a short stroll to the top of O'Connell Street. Very near The Garden of Rememberence. Rooms are a decent size but could do with a bit of updating. The bedroom door rattled when anybody walked along the corridor,which was strange! However, the staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was of the help yourself type.It was very tasty too . Good hotel but rather expensive for 2 nights. I have stayed in much nicer hotels for less money,although not in Dublin. ",4,2016,04,10
229,Recommended,"The Castle hotel is clean comfortable and quiet and ideally located to visit the city sights on foot and near to airport bus and city tour bus stops. The staff are all polite and friendly and we enjoyed the two restaurants in the hotel. Particularly The Old Music Shop where Trevor, Renata and Cian went out of their way to please us!
The wifI was intermittent at times. We enjoyed visiting Dublin and will hopefully again.",4,2016,04,09
229,Hotel,"Clean  hotel,lovely food helpful polite staff . Bedrooms clean and warm comfortable beds typical Irish hotel and hospitality. Helpful with buses and any info you require. You can leave your suitcases in a locked room until your own room is ready. We would visit and stay again. Lovely dublintown, go on red bus tour it's like a 2hr comedy show.",4,2016,04,07
229,Charming and Convenient!,"Stayed here for two nights while in Dublin and actually hated to leave!  This hotel has so much charm and character!  Interesting little hallways, stairways, and comfortable sitting rooms throughout. Not your typical, standard hotel layout.   Very nice, accommodating front desk staff, willing to attend to your needs.  Upon check in, we had a problem with our door not locking.  It was fixed immediately.  Clean, comfortable beds.  Great location, within walking distance to everything.  Sadly, we never got to the bar downstairs.  Heard the nightly entertainment is good.  We liked that the full Irish breakfast is included.  Plentiful and satisfying, no matter what you like for breakfast.  I would definitely return.  One of the nicest places to stay while in Dublin!",5,2016,04,07
229,Quaint hotel with great location,"We stopped here for a few nights over a weekend and found it to be extremely pleasant with friendly and welcoming staff. The room was very comfortable, with a single and double bed and decent sized bathroom. The only downside was there was no fan and the bathroom window could not be opened so it could get steamy. But that was hardly a major issue.

The room itself and the hotel in general were very clean. It has a lot of character to it with plenty of little snug rooms to sit and relax. The bar downstairs is large enough, but it can get quite busy when there is live music, so it pays to get in early if you want a seat. The hotel is a 20-30 minute walk to Temple Bar and surrounding city/tourist areas. If you're doing the Guinness Storehouse or Kilmainham Gaol then you might require a taxi as it's slightly further out.

The food in the hotel is very good, although the two course set menu turned out to be more expensive than the a la carte menu. Keep an eye on that one or at least get clarification before you order. Breakfast was excellent but does get busy if you turn up at 9am. We didn't have to wait long and staff worked hard to get us a table! All the time with a smile on their face :)

Overall we had a great time and thoroughly enjoyed Dublin and what it had to offer. I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Dublin in the future.",4,2016,04,06
229,Lovely,"We had a great room. Very clean with comfortable beds. The bathroom was good [not small and poky like some]. The hotel in general is very squeaky when you walk up the stairs. Staff friendly and helpful. The location is good if you want to use the tour buses, also the airport link has a bus stop in the road opposite. Would revisit.",4,2016,04,04
229,really quite good,"THe hotel is really quite good for a solo traveller, and the bar underneath was a lot of fun with live music. I could sit at the bar and find myself talking to others.
The breakfast was really good though if you had to get on an early coach to go somewhere for the day it wasn't greatly helpful.
Finally the room was comfy, though for me it had the small problem that only was a shower in it, no bath and am not a shower person.
Overall, hotel was really good though.",5,2016,04,03
229,Superb,"From the warm welcome to the final fair well, our stay at the castle hotel was excellent.  Our room was clean, well equipped and stylish.  Breakfast was excellent too, we didn't have any lunches or evening meals here, but what others had looked lovely.  In the evenings from 9 pm we were entertained by singers, singing Irish songs.  Nothing to complain about. It even had complimentary use of computer and printer.",5,2016,04,02
229,1916 centennial visit,My dad and I spend two nights at the Castle Hotel. The staff was phenomenal.Everyone was friendly and super helpful. We got upgraded to a room with a bath for no charge. The hotel has a cafe with full Irish breakfast and delicious lunch and coffee. The bar/restaurant has great food and live music after 9. Highly recommend. What else can I say,5,2016,03,30
229,Charming hotel ,"Lovely hotel, loads of character, great breakfast, staff really friendly and welcoming, owner Fionn is most charming man, good Central location, food very good and good Irish singers in bar. Definitely would stay there again ",4,2016,03,30
229,Lovely hotel near to centre,"We booked this hotel on line and were not disappointed, our room has a lovely four poster bed and a bathroom with plenty of hot water,  the room is cleaned each day and more yummy chocolates left each night,  we arrived during the Easter rising celebrations and due to the excellent location could drop our bags and walk into O'Connell street to join in.

We ate in the restaurant the first night and it was lovely food with the added bonus of live music.

Breakfast is good and hearty 

We will come back here again due to its location and friendly staff",4,2016,03,30
229,Would not return to this hotel,"Had we not pre-paid, we would have left without bothering to check in.  The way we were greeted by the receptionist when we arrived was the opposite of a warm welcome.  We did not feel like valued customers at any time during our stay.  The parking was impossible yet we were charged a nightly fee for it; it was so difficult to get in and out of the gated lot that we didn't want to use our car.  The elevators hardly work and are so slow you resort to the stairs even if you have luggage.  The rooms are not all accessible from each elevator; you can have a room on the second floor but not be able to reach another room on the second floor room because the floors do not all connect--it feels like a maize just trying to find your room.  The walls were being painted during our stay, requiring us to go over the drop clothes along freshly painted walls to find our room.  The noise from the bar downstairs kept us up most of the night but the staff addressed the problem at about 12:30.  On the brighter side:  the breakfast was excellent and bountiful.",1,2016,03,28
229,Great location and friendly staff,"We stayed here for six days after St Patrick's Day and before Easter Sunday. The hotel is well located in north Dublin and provides easy access to some great sights  and locations such as the Botanical Gardens, Glasnevin Cemetery  and the Gate Theatre. 
The staff are friendly, helpful and kind and our rooms were tidied to a high standard, we particularly liked the mini chocolates on the bed, which were a nice touch. The breakfast was great and they accommodated people's requests. We ate in the restaurant twice and really enjoyed it. The quality and service were both very good, nothing was a problem for the staff. My only gripe would be that the television was a bit small for the size of the room!",4,2016,03,27
229,Excellent location but tired hotel in need of TLC,"I was torn between giving this hotel 3 or 4 stars but ultimately felt 3 was most appropriate. 

It's excellently located close to the centre of Dublin and easy reach and walking distance of local attractions and the room was clean. 

I liked the original features of the hotel but the rooms were very tired and in need of much TLC. Our room was set to tropical despite the window being unable to be close, stuffed with tissue to try and bridge the huge gap which did not stop the noise of the busy high street below from disturbing our sleep. Traffic noise is always fun to wake up to. 

The shower provided a dribble for washing and the doors painted that many times they didn't close properly. I was also quite surprised there was no safety deposit box in the room.  We only stayed 2 nights so we just kept our valuables with us, but it wasn't ideal and certainly wouldn't be for those travelling further than we did and for longer. 

Breakfast was nice and the cafe/restaurant it is served in was lovely. 

You have to leave your room key at the front desk when going out and despite being in and 3 hours before check out on our last day, the maid service knocked and came in the room! 

I wouldn't say don't stay here, but expect average rooms and an average stay. ",3,2016,03,26
229,Perfect location for St Patricks Parade and short walk to Temple Bar for the drinkers amongst you!,"Stayed at this hotel for 5 days over my birthday which was St Patricks Day. Parade passes at the end of the road so only a few steps to a great viewing place. Hotel clean and staff friendly. Problem with the rooms TV which was repaired as soon as was humanly possible. Two restaurants, the Music Room, modern light and airy with a real nice ambience which was where breakfast and all day snacks could be purchased and the venue in the cellar, again full of ambience with extremely helpful staff for evening meals. Breakfast whilst lots to choose from was not very hot and a problem with coffee pots and tea pots that appeared to be interchangeable; did not make for a good cup of tea, however, always replaced with another attempt to get it right. Great location to see all the sites in the vicinity and easily accessible from the airport using the local comfortable coach to O 'Connell Street with a short walk back up the road.",4,2016,03,24
229,Great location to City Center,"We stayed for St. Patricks Day weekend.  There is 1 lift available but taking the stairs with their quirky layout due to the age of the hotel is an adventure of its own.  Then finding your room is yet another adventure.  You may have to go through a few doors, up or down stairs to find your room.  The rooms smell of fresh paint but they do come with tea/coffee making units and a hair dryer.  If you leave the window open for fresh air, you won't get much sleep due to the outside noise.  And yes our room was on the street side.  The bathroom is modern but there is little water pressure and little to no hot water for a shower ( we were on the top floor).  The full Irish breakfast is scrumptious.  The bar and music in the basement is a great way to end a full day of exploring.  Staff very friendly.",3,2016,03,21
229,Good location,We stayed st Patrick's day weekend. Walking up the stairs there was the distinct smell of carpet underlay and paint so I assume some decorating has been completed recently. Room was spacious with a modern ensuite. Decore was traditional with a mini chandilier and tasseled lamps but also usb points on some of the sockets to be up to date. Tea/coffee making facilities and hairdryer in the room plus tub chars and table. Lovely breakfast service with full Irish breakfast and continental selection. Also bar and music in the basement. Only 1 lift but never a long wait. Main shops/bars/restaurants a 15 minute stroll away. Bus stops 5 minutes walk which will take you to airport for €6. Only small negative for us was our room faced the main road and the street noises could be heard distinctly because there was no double glazing.,4,2016,03,20
229,Very nice,"I enjoyed my stay at the Castle Hotel. It is literally only 2 minutes from O'Connell street which is a major thoroughfare for tourists with plenty of pubs, restaurants, and souvenir shops. There is even a movie theater in the area. The bus stop that brings you from the airport (747) stops on this street just a few minutes walk from the hotel. The bus stop to catch the 747 bus back to the airport is literally across the street from the hotel. They have a restaurant and bar on the property but I did not try them. The complimentary breakfast served in a different dining room was adequate. My only complaints are the towels are very thin and the walls are also thin. I could hear everything my neighbors had to say.",4,2016,03,19
229,Good location,"Stayed two nights over valentines weekend. Staff were attentive and well informed of the local area. Check in was quick, we arrived at 8am due to an early flight. They stored our cases in a locked room for us, we signed the relevant forms then went off to enjoy our day.
On return our rooms were ready, however mine and my husbands room was on the other side of the hotel away from the rest of our party, realizing this the kind lady on reception moved us so we could be near the rest of our party.
Our room was clean and adequate for what we needed,although each room is different and some more modern than others. Some rooms have just a shower others have a bath so if particular request which you prefer when booking.
Breakfast was basic a mixture of cooked, pastries and cereal the quality didn't seem that great  the cooked breakfast was quite bland.
We all enjoyed our stay in Dublin and the hotel was adequate for what we needed.",3,2016,03,18
229,Lovely stay,"Just returned from a short stay at castle hotel and the only negative was we didn't stay longer. Everyone was lovely and the food was really good. The morning staff serving breakfast were always very friendly and organised. We couldn't of asked for more. 
Thank you.
",5,2016,03,18
229,Comfortable hotel,"Just returned from here, our room was big and comfortable with a big bed which was very comfortable. Big clean and bright in a good location. The only thing that spoils this hotel is the cold breakfast. Even when the food has just come up from the kitchen it is Luke warm. We told them this they thanked us for our comments. What a shame otherwise perfect place to stay. You don't need to use the expensive airport bus get on the local bus no 16 half the price. ",5,2016,03,16
229,Excellent hotel with a very kind and caring staff.,We really enjoyed out visit here. All staff were extremely kind and helpful. Both food and the music in the hotel were excellent. We would highly recommend a visit here to complement an enjoyable stay in Dublin.,5,2016,03,13
229,Smashing hotel in a great location,"Sat at the top end - and just off ~O`Connell `street the Castle provides excellent value for money.  Friendly staff, clean and tidy, good restaurant, neat bar and weekend traditional music.  What more could you want.",4,2016,03,12
229,Pleasant stay in ideal city centre  location,Very nice hotel ideally situated for city centre. Nice rooms although being an old hotel lots of creaks but added to the charm of the place. Lovely helpful staff and hearty breakfasts for a good price. Would recommend it,4,2016,03,10
229,Excellent location,"This is a really nice hotel with a great breakfast included, all the staff were friendly and welcoming. The location is brilliant around a minute walk from O'connell Street. 
The room was clean and quiet. 
The only downside was the cold tap which ran luke warm water rather than cold and the shower sprayed on to the bathroom floor!
Overall good and reasonably priced. I would stay again!  ",4,2016,03,10
229,Fantastic grand hotel,"Stayed for a long weekend with my partner. Perfect service, spotless, the best cooked breakfast I've ever had in a hotel. Shall definately be returning. Please replace the castle hotel light up sign outside, it doesn't reflect what a 5 star hotel you have!!!",5,2016,03,09
229,Cute and convenient place to stay ,Great old hotel (since 1809) and they make you feel like royalty.  Front desk staff very helpful with questions and luggage and getting taxis.  This place is a 2 minute walk from O' Connell street and the tour busses all pick up in that area.  Breakfast is included with the room and it was awesome.  ,5,2016,03,05
229,Lovely stay ,"I'm a travel agent in the UK and sell a lot of Dublin breaks but I had never been there myself. I used to send people to different hotels but now I've discovered this gem I will recommend it to all my customers going to Dublin. 

Firstly, the location is great. 2 minute walk and you're on the top of O'Connell Street. Another couple of minutes more and you're at the bus stop for the airlink or aircoach buses back to the airport. 

I had the Dublin pass which was brilliant as nearly all my attractions were included in the pass as was one way on my airport transfer. It saved me a fortune. I visited the jail, the guiness factory, the whisky distillery and lots more. 

The other good thing with the Castle hotel is you just walk straight down O'Connell street and you're at the Luas which is the tram that takes you around the city. So straightforward getting around. 

The rooms are gorgeous but do what I did and phone the hotel first asking for a room at the back of the hotel where it's quieter. I recommend room 323. Large double bed and a good size. 

The staff are very friendly and the breakfast is really nice. I particularly recommend the white pudding was delicious. Also when the staff ask you for tea or coffee ask for a hot chocolate it's really nice. Takes a short while to come because they make it fresh with hot milk but it's worth the wait. 

Also the hotel will store your luggage for you at the start and end of your stay if you wish. The staff throughout are professional and very helpful. 

All in all I had a great time in Dublin and would certainly stay at the Castle hotel again. Well done Castle hotel! :)",5,2016,03,05
229,spotlesly clean hotel BUT,On arrival was impressed with the hotel & it was spotlessly clean. stayed on top floor room was very cosy and very warn (nice as it was very cold weekend) no water pressure for a good shower & u could here people using the toilet in the adjoining room. reception staff just did what they had to unlike the catering staff who were very helpful. Breakfast was nice but it could be kept warmer .,3,2016,03,01
229,Convenient,"Old hotel building for a relatively convenient stay in Dublin at the North side of the city just above O'Connelstreet. The city center is just a 10 minutes stroll away. Friendly staff. Bathroom is basic and clean, but nothing special. Spacious and high family room and comfortable beds. Regular English breakfast included. Only real complaint is that the hotel is a bit noisy. You can hear guests talk  (if loud) through walls and ceiling. If you have busy neighbors...",3,2016,02,28
229,Friendly welcome and great location,"It's a two minute walk to O'Connell Street with a warm welcome. I've stayed twice and found all the staff: reception, housekeeping, breakfast and bar to be friendly and keen to help. I will stay again!",5,2016,02,28
229,Great location for seeing the sights,"If you need a warm, comfy & friendly base to explore Dublin from then this is the hotel for you. 
Think of Fawlty Towers for the layout but on a much larger scale, with friendly & courteous staff and you have an idea of the charm of this hotel. Breakfast was fantastic and really set you up for a days exploring. The room we had was large & warm with a big comfy bed. I had a problem getting the shower temperature just right so we plumped for baths instead which filled in a couple of mins and was a real treat in itself.

If you don't mind a bit of walking then don't buy ""hop on off"" bus tickets. The roads are being dug up to extend the tram system and we found it much quicker to walk. The only good thing about the bus tours was the information they give but you will find all this in abundance in the museums, galleries & hotel. 

One thing I would recommend is calling at the Tourist Information desk in the airport before you head out into Dublin. The staff are really friendly and very helpful with maps, bus time tables & anything else you need to know.",4,2016,02,28
229,Beautiful hotel,"I stayed here for 5 days as a birthday treat to myself.  The hotel is a 5 minute walk from the start of everything, staff at the hotel were extremely very helpful, polite and nothing was any trouble for them, the hotel itself was warm and welcoming, the decor was my kind of thing ( Georgian hotel, Georgian furniture) but the rooms were excellent, the only drawbacks of the room was, shower cubicle was a bit small, room tended to get hot at night (asked for a fan and staff were happy to help), unable to open window because of the traffic and noise, but overall I would certainly recommend this hotel, oh yes there are flights of stairs everywhere as the hotel is 3 or 4 (I think) houses all knocked through to make it one big hotel, but don't worry there are lifts.  Breakfast was excellent, even though same thing every morning, but I'm not complaining, was looking forward to some good old Irish music on my last day, but sadly that was cancelled, overall lovely hotel, I would return but probably request a room that is not facing the main streets.  Thank you to the staff at castle hotel for making me feel welcomed.",4,2016,02,27
229,Friendly welcome in a historic and traditional Georgian archicture setting.,"We chose this hotel for our 2-day, midweek stay, due to its appearance as what we thought of as traditional Dublin architecture - a Georgian terrace of townhouses. This is exactly what we got, perhaps a bit higgledy-piggledy, composed as it is of a number of connecting 3-storey townhouses, originally occupied by professional families, such as doctors. This is exactly what gave it its charm, with many original interior features. The bedroom was modern, spacious and comfortable. The corridors were a bit confusing, but the pictures on the walls of sheet music of old folk songs kept us amused. The staff were very friendly, warm and natural. Just of O'Connell Street and Parnell Square, we could walk to all the central Dublin attractions in 5-10 minutes. The airport bus stopped within under 5 minutes' walk.",5,2016,02,26
229,"Very friendly staff, well located but somewhat noisy","This is rather charming hotel, in converted Georgian houses, is located 5 min. walk from O´Connell street and less than that from The Gate Theatre, the Hugh Lane gallery and the Dublin Writers museum.  The bus from and to the airport stops are also within 5 min. walk. The staff was very friendly, the breakfast is a served buffet, with full Irish breakfast as an option, as well as continental breakfast items. The only negative I have is that the interior sound isolation is poor. As a result, I could basically understand the telephone conversation the guest in the room next to mine had.  My room, 114, was located overlooking an inner courtyard, so no noise from the street.",4,2016,02,25
229,Great Hotel,"We spent a long weekend at this hotel and would recommend it. We were a party of eight adults and we enjoyed our visit. My room was at the front, facing on to the church. It was a lovely room and with the secondary double glazing had no problem with noise.
Room was lovely and clean and bed was very comfortable. 
Breakfast was lovely. Staff were always very nice and helpful. 
We ate in the bar on Friday evening and had a lovely meal. Bar staff are very pleasant and helpful too. Entertainment good.
Hotel,is in a good location for airport bus and also for getting about town. We were within walking distance of most main attractions.
Would certainly return again.",4,2016,02,24
229,Old World Charm - Good Location,"This hotel is situated on the outskirts of the city; 8 minute walk to the main shopping area and away from the hustle & bustle, if like us that’s what you prefer. It’s a lovely old building with so much history. The Décor is full of old world Irish charm, antique furnishings, ornaments in cabinets and paintings on the walls are displayed throughout the property and a beautiful old staircase leading to the floors above – just charming! There is an unusual bar area down stairs with arched brick cellar walls and two other restaurants for dinning choices.  Our pub meal was good, not outstanding but reasonably priced and the Irish breakfast was pleasing with enough variety – not full buffet, hot foods served individually. The rooms were lovely; ours was spacious with an old fire place and two windows overlooking the backyard. Great to have a bath, a big comfy chair and coffee/tea facilities in the room. The cleanliness was average and the bed was comfortable with good standard of linen. The two friendly young ladies who run Reception were both very helpful and provided us with excellent customer service throughout our stay. We had an issue with a roof leak in our room that was reported early morning but disappointingly they did not come back to us about it - however it was sorted quickly and effectively when brought to their attention again later in the evening. Good value hotel and would recommend specially to those seeking accommodation away from the pubs and crowds but still a convenient city location and ideal for tour meeting points. Highly recommend.",4,2016,02,23
229,"Clean, friendly reasonable for price","Stayed here for 3 nights, found the hotel to be clean and friendly I had a twin room which was on the top floor, due to the hotel being an old building the floors went up and down and felt like I was drunk walking to my room! Lol
Not sure if it was because I was on the top floor but the room got really hot! Esp through out the night, which was good but not so good after I had a drink, the last night I left the window wide open all throughout the night (middle of February) and the room was still warm!
The breakfast was ok,I found the hot breakfast soon went cool whilst you waited for your toast.
The staff were all friendly and nice, and the bar downstairs had a nice atmosphere and feel to it. Would go again for a cheap hotel visit, wouldn't pay more then what I paid for what worked out to be £40 per person per night to stay in the middle of the week on late rooms.
So can't complain really as reasonably priced, clean and friendly. ",3,2016,02,21
229,Short Stay in a family room,"The hotel was convenient for O'Connell Street, a short walk to the buses from the airport and the hop-on-hop off type buses.  

We stayed in a large family room on the ground floor which made a good base for a few days in Dublin.  The room was generally clean and tidy with the beds being made and fresh towels each day.  However, some attention could be paid to the little extension which leads into the bathroom as it seemed a little neglected and shabby.  

The range of breakfasts on offer was good.

The negatives (which were not too bad, but other travellers might want to know!):  the room we stayed in backed on to the carpark and the smokers from the bar were quite loud at times - the old sash windows did let some of the smoke into the room too.  There was also some external noise from what I think must be the boiler system or a fan.  If we had been staying longer I think the noise might have been more of an issue, but it was fine for a few days.

Breakfast service could be a little more cheerful, particularly when it got busier!  We found that eating soon after service started made a huge difference to the attitude of the staff.  There were a plenty of staff but they did seem stressed by the number of guests eating at the later sittings.  Some of the hot food could do with being a little hotter.

And finally, the kettle in our room.  It needed a longer cord or an extension cable - we couldn't put it on the desk or any other hard surface other than the fireplace!

All in all, we had a pleasant stay and I would probably book here again if we were spending a short stay in Dublin.",4,2016,02,21
229,Great place to stay,"Just back from a night in this charming Georgian hotel. Excellent value, superb location and exceptionally helpful front of house staff. Would definitely return to this hotel. Thank you. Breda Duggan,limerick.",4,2016,02,19
229,30th birthday break,"This was our first visit to Dublin and certainly wouldn't be our last ! Location was perfect for getting out and about to visit many of the city's attractions . Many are within walking distance , but if you don't wish to walk the hotel is not far from o'connell street where you can get on a hop on hop off bus which gives you a tour of many of the attractions . Our room was good enough for the time we spent in it . Breakfast was very nice and filling with a good choice . The vault bar was a nice place to chill and enjoy a guiness or two ! All staff were very friendly and helpful . Would recommend to people of all ages .",4,2016,02,19
229,lovely hotel easy walking distance but far enough away as not noisy,I thought this was a really lovely little hotel and great price - breakfast first morning was down stairs due to long queue upstairs and got huge breakfast collected by waiting staff - following two days although states buffet the cooked breakfast is served on a plate to you and was quite small but I could have asked for more?.  Tip go to breakfast before 8.30 if possible to avoid the queues.  Great music really friendly bar downstairs.  Only little complaint was as we were staying over valentines we were not aware that the restaurant was only serving a set menu and by the time we realised was too late to go out and order we had the set meal which I enjoyed but unfortunately my husband does not like fish was not happy with the cost and being tied into a menu.  Staff really friendly and helpful and our room was lovely and warm with plenty of room on the third floor.  Would definitely recommend and stay again if in Dublin,5,2016,02,19
229,Convenient to City,"The hotel was easy to find and the airport bus stops close by. The rooms were  a good size, clean and comfortable. Our room only had a shower which suited us. Breakfast was busy and on one day we were served in a joining room which was actually better as it was waitress service, the main area was buffet which meant we had to queue.  The hotel was within walking distance of the main street.  Staff were friendly  and helpful.",4,2016,02,19
229,well worth a visit,lovely staff. well situated to walk into centre.  quite a little gem of a hotel. lovely sofas everywhere. everyone was so helpful  good breakfasts. the décor is really quite different to the usual hotels.,4,2016,02,19
229,Short break delight,"We found the staff extremely helpful, nothing was too much trouble - The breakfast was amazing - The hotel had lots of lovely seating areas to just enjoy reflecting on our day.  we stayed in a triple room and was delighted to have 3 very roomy bedside tables. A spacious room overlooking the church. Our only negative remark was we could hear next door every time they turned the lights on or the shower. A very good location, easily reached by the airlink bus from the airport. We would highly recommend this hotel and found it great value for the money.",4,2016,02,18
229,A birthday gift for my sister and her pal,"I chose this hotel for both the location and the decor. Both were exactly as expected, very good. On their arrival in late afternoon, the room they were shown to was extremely cold. They duly reported this to reception. Next morning the wet room shower overflowed, soaking the bathroom floor. It was so bad they had to put on boots to go in and brush their teeth. That evening on their return to the hotel, the situation was exactly the same, a freezing room and paddling pool bathroom. It had not even been reported. Luckily a new girl was on reception. She quickly took control of the situation and moved them to another room with heating and minus the paddling pool. A helpful male employee carried their cases. Huge thanks to these two. It's just a shame the first two members of staff were'nt so helpful. As I booked it as a surprise, I was disappointed in their lack of urgency.",3,2016,02,18
229,Georgian hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Such a lovely hotel in the heart of Dublin. Castle Hotel is a Georgian hotel, with its original charm throughout the hotel. Our room was spacious and modern, with a view of the church. There are two restaurants in the hotel, The Old Music Shop and Castle Vaults. The Old Music Shop is where breakfast is served, and there is a full Irish breakfast every morning, which is wholesome and very tasty. The Castle Vaults restaurant served delicious food in what used to be the wine cellar. Staff were friendly and the overall feel of this historic hotel was very nice. We would recommend this hotel to people visiting central Dublin, as it is in the perfect location for seeing all the sights. We would return to this hotel again if we visit Dublin.",5,2016,02,17
229,Sisters trip,"On our 1sr trip to Ireland, we decided to stay in Dublin and do day trips from there.  We chose this hotel, looked good.  It was amazing, the staff were so friendly and very helpful.  A full Irish breakfast  lots of choices.  There is a dining room with very good food.  A pub in the basement was so much fun with entertainment every night..  The rooms are fine, clean but not fancy.  Was a very short walk to anywhere you would want to go.  Loved it",5,2016,02,17
229,"Good hotel, very helpful and friendly staff.","We stayed here for 3 nights and had a wonderful time. Breakfast was lovely and plenty. The staff are very helpful and do go out of their way.
The rooms are clean and house keeping was done every day. The evening entertainment on our first night was a traditional irish singer who was great and a pleasure to listen to. The Valentines meal that we had booked was beautifuland overall we had a lovely stay and will hopefully return. Special thanks to Gillian on reception who was very helpful. ",4,2016,02,16
229,Group Trip to Dublin,This was a girls trip (8 total) to Dublin and we found the Castle Hotel to be great accommodations. Transportation to/from airport was easy and inexpensive. We bought a round trip bus ticket for 10 euros. The Airlink bus from the airport dropped us off a block from the hotel. Getting the bus back to the airport was as easy as getting there. We had two rooms with four single beds. The room was clean and comfortable. The staff at the hotel was extremely nice and informative. Breakfast was included with our room but unfortunately our planned day tours started before breakfast was served. The staff went over and beyond to have coffee and breakfast to go for us. The Castle Hotel was a great central location. We never had to take a cab/bus anywhere. There was free Wi-Fi that worked well. We couldn't have asked for better accommodations!,5,2016,02,16
229,Weekend trip - good & bad,"Stayed 3 nights, found the hotel has good and bad points - good for location, very central and we could walk to the centre in 5 minutes. Also good was the breakfast and the service, it was plentiful, very quick service and tasty. On the downside to our trip was our room, we were in room 311 which was directly over the entrance facing the main road. Every night it felt as though we were sleeping with the windows open ! The noise of the traffic and passers by was very audible, the Windows need replacing with good quality double glazing, we didn't get a decent uninterrupted sleep on any of the 3 nights. Would probably not return. ",3,2016,02,15
229,Very nice hotel with friendly and helpful staff ,"Me and my friend stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in February. It is very central to the city centre of Dublin with plenty to do and see. It is a short walk from the Main Street and also temple bar area. The owner is very friendly and the staff are extremely helpful. We had an issue with our shower so they moved us to a better room very quickly and without a fuss. Breakfast included in the price and a very wide selection of food with tea and coffee on tap. Drinks are a bit expensive downstairs in the bar but not too unreasonable although there are cheaper places to drink. Beds are comfy and rooms are well catered for and clean, quite spacious and well furnished. All in all a very pleasant experience with a bit more investment and building work it could be a 5 star hotel. Would stay here again. ",4,2016,02,12
229,Great trip to Dublin,"I stayed here in August for 5nights with my husband and daughter.
Good location to get out and about.
Nice breakfast, we preferred to be seated downstairs.
Nice bar and entertainment in the evening in the basement.
Room ok.
Staff good.
Met the owner whilst waiting for our taxi, he was a bit of a character which matched my biggest compliment the building has history and character.
Would recommend Murrays bar just down the road. Good food, great entertainment and it is very deceiving because at the back there is a very large smoking area with a very large sports tv.   
Would recommend going to the little dublin museum. Which we had free entry to with our green hop on hop off bus. This is also a good idea. Loved dublin zoo.",4,2016,02,11
229,very nice hotel,"the only reason i did not give it 5 is because the shower in our room was really slow and it took ages to get all the suds out of your hair, reported this to a gentleman on reception who just wrote it in a book, nothing was done to rectify the problem, other than this the hotel was very clean and the reception staff were very helpfull",4,2016,02,09
229,Castle hotel,Excellent location for walking into and around the city. Hotel is clean and breakfast  good.  Complimentary toiletries not so good - guest soap and shampoo only!!!  Take your own shower gel and conditioner!!!!,4,2016,02,08
229,Overall bad experience,"We encountered several issues which I would just not expect from any hotel that charges over 100$ per night.

1. We booked a double room but got a twin.
2. Our initial room had a horrifying rotten egg smell, we were switched but once again was a twin.
3. It was very noisy day and night. We could hear people outside in the smoking area as if they were standing right next to us in the room. Got very little sleep.
4. Beds were uncomfortable 
5. The only day our room was cleaned was the day we left.

The only upsides are a good location and nice staff but I definitely do not recommend staying here.
",2,2016,02,06
229,Very disappointed ,"Stayed here for 3 nights and to be honest it has to be one of the worst hotels I've stayed in. After driving around for an hour to find the hotel we finally arrived only to be hit with a car parking fee of 15 euro a night, which was failed to be mentioned on the hotel's website and instantly annoyed me. Got pointed to our room by reception and to say I was disappointed would be an understatement. I know the hotel is cheap but the room was tiny and I wouldn't have minded as much if the beds were comfy, but they weren't even close. The pillows were like lying on bricks and the duvet was extremely thin. Also, our room was situated right next to the smoking area outside and therefore every night we were kept awake by people in and out of the bar for cigarettes, laughing at the top of their voices. I would never stay here again.",2,2016,02,05
229,Caslte hotel,"25-29 January had a loverly quiet stay at the castle hote,l it was lovely and warm inside throughtout the day and night it had to be it was wet and very windy outside. Our room was very clean well set out.Breakfast was a full Irish or yogurt and rabbit food as i call it. As for other meals cannot comment as we were B&B. Bar was downstairs in the basement very spacious a lot of little hide aways food was excellent down there. And the staff were all  helpful. Would stay there again no worries.",5,2016,02,05
229,Nice hotel,"we enjoyed our stay, overall the hotel is really nice, can be a bit noisy.
Really nice breakfast and the location is very good.
Staff is nice. i will stay there again when i visit dublin again.
its a nice hotel",4,2016,02,04
229,Fantastic stay,"Me and my husband stayed here for 4 nights in December. It was our first visit to the hotel and dublin. We loved the hotel. The staff on reception, in the restaurants/bar were all really friendly and professional. Our room had a 4 poster bed which I think was one of the older rooms but still nice. The bed was a bit hard and the pillows kept falling down the back of the bed!! Other than that it was a good size room bathroom was nice but small. The owner of the hotel Fin introduced himself to us whilst we were having dinner as he was having dinner with his family in the hotel. What a lovely man! We are from York and he was telling us he has family in Harrogate! (Small world) ! Anyway we hope we will be able to stay again and bring our family with us next time! I know they are refurbishing some of the rooms so hopefully we will get one of those rooms next time. Look forward to seeing you again! And Fin what a lovely hotel you have and your staff are fantastic ! ",4,2016,02,03
229,Great hotel,Castle hotel is in a good location just at the top of o'connell st. The hotel was nice enough but our room was really small for wot it cost. It was a present to myself and my husband from my son daughter in law and grandchildren for my big birthday. The size of the room didn't spoil it as we were out most of the weekend. The breakfast was really good with plenty of choice. Yes I would recommend this hotel and would stay there again.,4,2016,02,03
229,4 nights in Dublin - first floor,"Incredibly well kept traditional hotel, great dining experiences in both restaurants. 
Really helpful and welcoming staff, great value and over all excellent stay.
The only thing that let it down to a 4 star for me was that the room we occupied was very noisy from the main street and the water pipes in the morning. 
I'm used to sleeping in a very quiet earlier but after night 2 I got used to it. 
May need ear plugs for light sleepers in this area of the hotel. ",4,2016,02,03
229,ok,"The personel is friendly, when you go in or out they keep quiet and do not look away from their screens, I had I believe the smallest room of the hotel, everything was there, but I believe therefore I've paid too much, the room and bathroom were clean but not spic and span. I was travelling light and found the little tube shampoo/gel not that fantastic and just enough. The lift is very slow. Did'nt had problems with wifi, breakfast was ok, full English breakfast possible, that was nice.  I visited the restaurant, the diner was ok, but not that cosy to sit for eating purposes. For the live music it is nice, and I had a great time with Ray Cox. It is at the North side of the city centre, temple bar area; dublin castle, city hall, grafton street 20 to 30 min easy walk.",3,2016,02,01
229,Friendly hotel,Had a mid week stay here. Staff were friendly and helpful. Our room was large and recently decorated - comfy bed and pillows. Liked the use of traditional furniture which gave it character unlike so many chain hotels. Good value for money. Bathroom was a bit disappointing as it hadn't been upgraded to same standard as the bedroom - shower had poor water pressure and towels were thin and small. Short walk from airport bus was very useful.,4,2016,01,30
229,Fabulous Weekend ,"We arrived at The Castle Hotel at about 8.45pm last Friday night. We were greeted with smiles and check in was good. We were 2 couples with 2 double rooms both of which were lovely. It was my husbands birthday and I had emailed the hotel before we arrived to request a bottle of Prosecco in our room on arrival which was there waiting for us. We went down into the Vaults bar after freshening up and the staff and entertainment were brilliant. The atmosphere was warm and friendly and we had a great first evening.
Breakfast was served the next morning in the old music shop which was lovely.
We ventured out for the day visiting the sites of Dublin which was easy as the hotel is ideally situated to be near enough to wander but far enough to not be disturbed by noise. We jumped on the hop on hop off bus just around the corner and explored Dublin's fair city. The Guinness Storehouse is a must visit but please buy your tickets when you get your hop on hop off tickets as you don't have to queue when you get there (the queues were unbelievably long so take this little bit of advice).  After a long day out we returned to the hotel and back to the Vaults bar as we had enjoyed it so much the night before. Again fabulous service from the friendly staff and excellent entertainment from the brilliant Ray Cox. So much so I bought his CD and it kept me sane on the horrible commute to work Monday morning. Thank you Ray. We checked out on Sunday and the hotel had a locked room to store our bags whilst we ventured out again. 
All in all a great weekend in a lovely hotel (Ok you can get a bit lost but it adds to the charm). I don't think a 3* does it justice and we will be back to visit again sometime. Thank you to everyone for making our weekend so enjoyable.",5,2016,01,29
229,Great location,"This hotel is in a great location for Dublin city centre, it's only a five minute walk into one of the main streets o'conners street.
We booked about a week before so pretty last minute managed to get a great price for 5 nights and the room we were in was a family room which is normally charged a little higher. The room was very spacious and had three floor to ceiling Windows two of which were French door style.
We had a view of the big church opposite and we could see the memorial gardens and part of the city centre.
The bathroom was very very well cleaned and the daily cleaning was of high standard.
The hotel is very old so there were the occasional noises and creeks from floorboards which was fine.
The bed was extremely comfortable And every night I slept all the way through.
The hotel staff were friendly and pleasant.
There is two restaurants the vaults which is reasonably priced and quint and the old music shop where breakfast is served.
Both the food for breakfast and dinner was good.
I have missed 1 star out as the hotel does have a couple of small areas where a little attention is needed - as with any hotel this age.
I am planning on visiting Dublin again and will definitely be staying here, the price is fantastic for what you get and is definitely worth it especially if your not going to be spending a lot of time in the hotel itself.
",4,2016,01,28
229,"Amazing little find, great character hotel in Dublin","I was in a rush when booking my hotel for a business trip and chose the Castle Hotel as it was a reasonable price, it was a lucky choice as it is a great hotel. If you are after modern this is not it, this is a Georgian building with lots of character, original features and quirky bits to it. It is just a great hotel, nice rooms, lots of spacious areas to sit and read/work, a great bar and restaurant with an extensive range of food and drink. The breakfast which is included is the best I have had in a hotel for a long time, cannot fault it in anyway. The hotel has a great ambiance, the staff are very friendly and provide a great customer service. It is ideally situated only 5 minutes from where all the action in Dublin starts, very near to bus, tram and train routes but equally close enough to walk to many attractions, shops, restaurants etc. If you have read this far you won't be surprised that I would highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in Dublin.",5,2016,01,27
229,Castle Hotel Review - Jan 2016,Excellent breakfast - a wide choice to choose from! Excellent staff - friendly and knowledgeable! Excellent bar serving the black stuff and other beers and whatnot! Excellent location - within walking distance of stuff to do! Excellent hotel décor - stylish if a late dated - but it works! Excellent restaurant - seriously good fresh and well prepared food at reasonable enough prices for Dublin! Rooms only average though...... bit battered down...,4,2016,01,26
229,LOCATION VERY GOOD FOR CITY,"Located near Garden of Remembrance, O Connell st, shops, restaurants, bus and tram lines. Can walk to most places of interest from this hotel, quirky interior, breakfast  has good choice, the usual fry and all you'd expect. Quiet hotel, although near main city centre.",4,2016,01,25
229,Dublin Delight.,"The four of us (two couples) arrived mid afternoon after a pleasant flight and taxi ride (only 20 euros) to a warm and friendly welcome and we were promptly booked into our rooms even with the reception being quite busy.
We were both on the first floor and our two double rooms where located in different houses but in reality next door which added to the ""quirkiness"" of this lovely Hogwarts hotel. We travel a lot and have spent many a weekend in Dublin over the years and this hotel is excellent value for money taking into account the location, you can stay cheaper but a lot further out of the city. We ate in the hotel downstairs restaurant on the first night which was a pleasant experience with good food, and live Irish music provided later in the cellar bar which added to the ambience, which we enjoyed and ensured we returned back the next night for more! I must end by complimenting all the staff who are very helpful and smile as if they mean it.
So with very warm! clean and peaceful rooms, free WIFI, toiletries and a tasty full breakfast and a hotel you can get lost in (if you want) go on and give it a try.",5,2016,01,25
229,Weekend Break,"The Castle Hotel is ideally situated for a weekend break within reach of all the main attractions in a quiet area on the Hop On Hop Off bus route. The rooms are clean and pleasant, the breakfast excellent, the staff very friendly and the bar ideal for a night cap and/or to listen to live music.",4,2016,01,24
229,center city gem,"I stayed in Castle Hotel for 4 days in middle of January while in Ireland to attend a surprise party. I just picked it out at random on the internet. It really is a gem.  Good room, good food and perfectly situated for all the highlights of Dublin.  I have already recommended it to friends. My son and his girlfriend and my daughter flew in from Scotland and stayed in the hotel for 1 night.  They said it was a brilliant hotel and hope to return.",5,2016,01,24
229,Fab!,"Me and my husband stayed here for my husbands birthday back in November! This was our first trip since having children so couldn't wait for some peace!! The hotel was in a great location, walking distance to everywhere but far enough out for it to be quiet! Breakfast was great, good selection and not too busy! Rooms where extremely clean to my high ocd standard although could do with some updating. We didn't eat in the hotel for dinner but there seemed to be a good choice. Staff where so helpful giving us directions and recommending places to go whilst in Dublin. Would return tomorrow!! ",5,2016,01,23
229,Good place to stay,We stayed here for 3 nights and have to say it was very nice.Our room was lovely very clean and quite spacious with tea and coffee facilities. Good breakfast and fast service. All in all a very enjoyable stay and would definatly stay here again,4,2016,01,23
229,This is awful....,The rooms are old and poorly renovated. Also the floor squeaks and the beds. The bathrooms have nice but unfinished. Overall a bad experience. and the food at the breakfast is extremely rudimentary. you get a sense of cheapness and unprofessionalism. ,1,2016,01,23
229,Nice hotel,"Very helpful & friendly staff throughout. Free wifi throughout the hotel (though the reception in the downstairs bar is a little flaky - not much of an issue). Had dinner in the hotel on the first night which was nice & well cooked. Breakfast was also good with a reasonable selection and the ability to take out if you are in a rush. The rooms were a good size with comfortable beds. I did find the walls a little thin - I could hear the people in the next room talking & having a shower at 1.30 am on the first night which wasn't great. Didn't have any issues after that however. Great central location and easy to get to from the airport. Overall, would recommend.",5,2016,01,22
229,Great Location ,"Stayed here with a group of friends for a big birthday celebration it's a perfect location to explore Dublin. The reception staff were really helpful. breakfast delicious nice quality products although on a weekend don't leave it until the last minute. The bar in the cellar is great and has live music in the evening. My room was one that had yet to be given the modern decor but was clean, quiet and had everything I needed the bed was very comfortable although only a double so would have been cosy for two. The room was hot but with the window open was fine. Would definitely recommend and will definitely be back. ",5,2016,01,21
229,Old hotel in good central position,"My husband & I stayed at the Castle Hotel for 2 nights last November. We arrived late morning & the reception staff happily put our suitcases in their left luggage room so that we could go out to start exploring Dublin.
The hotel is in a very good position and it doesn't take long to walk down to O'Connell Street - not far either from the airport bus stops.
The hotel consists of several old houses joined together & although there is a lift, we had to carry our suitcases up & down several small flights of steps to get to our room.
We had a room overlooking the road that the hotel's main entrance is on & we found it a bit noisy - however that's to be expected really when you stay in a capital city.
Our bathroom was very small & we had trouble trying to shut the door properly.
We had dinner our first night in the Castle Vaults bar where the food really wasn't great. My salmon was overcooked while my husband said his beef in guinness casserole was bland.
Breakfast was fine but it was extremely busy with long queues to get any food as we were staying over a weekend.
However all the staff were extremely friendly & helpful. I also particularly liked the downstairs of the hotel where there are lots of sofas in different places where you can sit & relax.",3,2016,01,20
229,"AWESOME HOTEL, PEOPLE, AND FOOD!!!",We were made to feel welcome as soon as we entered the door. We had an early morning excursion to the Moher Cliffs and they made it a point to feed us well long before the buffet opened so that could start our day off right. Other reviewers compared the hotel to Hogwarts because of stairs never going to the same place twice. It seemed that way to us also. We had a wonderful week at the Castle Hotel. Great food and entertainment in the Vaults. The whole staff couldn't be more friendly and helpful. The room was awesome as well. Hopefully we'll be able to afford to go back some day. Had the best time ever at the Brazen Head. Everyone at the Castle Hotel worked to make our trip the best possible!!! Thank you all so much!!!!!,5,2016,01,20
229,Fantastic Hotel,"Have just got back from a long weekend in Dublin with friends to celebrate a milestone birthday. I stayed in room 314 which was at just the right temperature for me (other reviewers complain the rooms are too hot). The rooms were serviced everyday - beds made, clean towels, coffee refilled and fresh pillow chocs 😊. Yes, the hotel is a maze, but you only need to know 3 routes - to your room, to the restaurant for breakfast and to the bar. The staff were lovely as was the breakfast every morning (altho I personally could have done with it being hot rather than just about warm), and of high quality. The hotel is perfectly placed for buses and just around the corner from Murrays Bar which is a great place for evening meal. Will definately be returning to Dublin and The Castle Hotel",5,2016,01,19
229,"Big rooms, great breakfast, awesome owner","If you are looking for a place where the owner, Finn, is in the lobby chatting up the guests as you enter, jovial and looking to see how he can make your stay a good one...then you have found the place.  

We were a family of five, returning from a vacation in Italy with a stopover in Dublin to see friends and check out the city.  This was perfect.  The rooms were spacious.  And best of all, having a bunch of growing kids, the breakfast was abundant and delicious.  They feasted!   

For a family, this is an excellent value...you can't go wrong.",4,2016,01,16
229,Great central hotel,"Lovely hotel, met the owner Finn, a charming Irishman proud to fly the green. had a lovely stay and left in the morning to propose to my future wife at bodenstown churchyard in front of Wolfe tones memorial, great stay. Room was comfy, breakfast was excellent , staff were friendly and helpful",5,2016,01,15
229,Missing Maintainence Manager,"Castle hotel IS old.
That gives a certain charm, BUT the maintainess is not done proberly.
IF they have a supervisor of that he should be dismissed at once.
The repairs in the old bathrooms looks ugly.
The service is kind.
The breakfast is so and so and the high radio music awfull.
Rooms are small.
The hotel is at the border of the city center.",3,2016,01,15
229,"Lovely hotel, lovely staff","We stayed here for New Year and must say it's a lovely hotel with lots of charm. It's situated in ideal location with only short distance to bars and shops. There are lots of traditional irish bars with live music close by, most serving delicious irish dishes!
Breakfast was good, plenty of choice for everyone.
The bar staff were brilliant! They were all very friendly, helpful and good fun! So well done Conor, Ashley and Cian (Niall) 😜 You're hard work didn't go unnoticed.
We hope to return later this year and toast the new year in again!

229,Great Hotel & super friendly staff,Good location close to all attractions and start point of the Hop on and Off Bus.  Attractive restaurant and excellent breakfast.  Oldy worldy and bit of a maze to bedrooms - but reall warm welcome awiats you from super friendly staff.  Would definitely stay again!,5,2016,01,12
229,"Good location, good price, good rooms","Young couple, Stopped here 6th of January till the 8th as a Christmas present from family member.

Was only about 20 minutes in a taxi from the airport was €26 from and €22 there so must just depend on the taxi driver.

Found the location was good, 10 minute walk into Temple Bar passing lots of shops/restaurants/cafes.

Lots of buses and stops everywhere, I think if you know what you're doing then they'd be great, we were comfortable walking everywhere anyway.

The room was average, not very big TV, the door on the bathroom didn't lock, not massive but wasn't a major issue as you shouldn't be spending a lot of time in the room other than sleeping anyway. Our window looked onto a car park and had a huge crane in it that was very loud.

Staff were friendly, the hotel itself was very clean and well presented, yes the stairs creaked rather loudly but again nothing major.

Didn't eat for lunch of tea so cannot comment on food then, however myself and my boyfriend were rather disappointed with breakfast.

To start with when entering the restaurant/eating area we were told we could sit anywhere, there actually wasn't want a table laid up, the only ones were large tables for 8, so we sat where we wanted and took clean cutlery and cups from the larger table. We then got offered tea or coffee and told it was self service. For juices there was only orange and cranberry, feel like Apple juice is a standard juice normally on offer but they didn't have it. There was a small area for cereal and that was all you could help yourself too. The hot food, bacon,sausages, egg,beans etc. wasn't really help yourself as you told someone what you wanted and they dished it up, felt a bit like school dinners if I'm honest. I feel like croissants and toast are a standard and toast was only there sometimes. Just didn't feel like there was much choose other than hot food.

Although we weren't impressed with breakfast this wouldn't stop me from stopping here again, We loved Dublin, really enjoyed our short time here, Loved Temple Bar, the Auld Dublin was a great pub and would highly recommend, great singers on both nights we were there. 

Would only pick another B&B as I feel like there's so many out there that I'd rather try new places rather than returning to somewhere we weren't 100% satisfied with. Other than that I do think its a good hotel, friendly staff, clean and good location.",3,2016,01,09
229,Great hotel stay in dublin,"Me and my husband had the pleasure to stay here during the new year holiday. Although our room was a bit small , the hotel is kept in excellent condition. The staff was excellent, and very helpful. The morning breakfast was great, there is also a pub downstairs that has great food and live Irish music. I would recommend this hotel if you like to stay on the quiet side of the busy streets of dublin. Just ask for a one of the bigger rooms If they have any available. Regardless although small I loved our stay at the castle. ",5,2016,01,08
229,Very nice hotel,"The hotel was very clean and some of the hotel staff were great.
When we arrived it was early and the reception staff put our luggage in the store room until we could check in.
The reception staff are not very welcoming and never said good morning until the day we were leaving.They did not tell us where the breakfast room was or about the old music room restaurant where we had excellent food and service.
Breakfast was excellent with a good choice of cereal,toast  and cooked food .We were given a warm welcome every morning in the breakfast room by the helpful staff that were on duty.
The room was clean and tidy but very hot and no control over the heating ,the radiator stayed on all night and stopped us from getting a good sleep.The bed was comfy and clean.
There are no safes in the room so we had to keep our passport and valuables with us all the time.
The WiFi was poor in the room.
But at least we had a good stay in Dublin.",5,2015,12,30
229,Fantastic stay ,"Stopped at this hotel during a Christmas shopping trip from the UK. 
Taxi from the airport was straight forward, €18.
Couldn't check in until 14:30 so utilised the bag drop and wandered into Dublin City centre; it is a 10 minute walk tops until you are slap bang in the centre.
Finally checked in at 14:30, room was nice and spacious, all amenities were in tact and was just a relaxing room, only downfall is that you can't control you're own room heating, however a simple phone call to reception and it was on.
Had a few beers in the bar at night before heading out for food, approx €4 a beer which wasn't too bad, and the football was on the big screen, happy days.

The hot breakfast in the morning was very nice and above the standard I expected. 
Whilst waiting to be collected by the taxi we waited in the bar where the staff went above and beyond for us, we had an excited 3 year old with us and they put on the kids channel on the big screen.

Overall fantastic experience stopping here, price was great, location is perfect and staff were friendly. WILL be stopping here again for the Barlow Dublin trip. 

Cheers

229,Georgian charm and terrific breakfast in a great location off Parnell Square,"My wife and I recently spent a week at the Castle in December 2015.  A really nice hotel that has loads of charm, a very friendly and helpful staff, and a terrific location in central Dublin.  The full Irish breakfast, served in the delightful cafe on the property (""The Music Room"") is hearty and filling and not greasy as is often seen elsewhere.  Rooms are adequate in size, with private bathroom including shower.  We had a third floor room which I would highly recommend as there can be quite a bit of street noise this close to the middle of downtown.  Joyce fans in particular may be attracted here because the hotel is right down the street from where Joyce attended secondary school, with the Dublin Writers Museum, the Joyce Literary Center, and the Gate Theater all only a few minutes walk away.  Virtually all the major sights of Dublin can be reached within 30 minutes walking from here.  The only (minor) downside we found that was that, like many older buildings, the Castle does not have thermostats, so room temperature sometimes has to be regulated by opening the windows.  Very reasonable rates.",4,2015,12,29
229,Great hotel-No control over the heating,"This hotel was really good, great service, comfy beds and cosy room. We got a family room which was good because it was for five people. The breakfast a the hotel was great it had a full English breakfast and cereal. The only problem was at night time the room was way to warm and we had no control over it Even stopped me getting proper nights sleep.",4,2015,12,29
229,"Good hotel, shame about stolen card details","A good hotel with nice breakfast and excellent location. I enjoyed the stay, but back in the UK I discovered my card details were used for purchasing 400 Euro worth of stuff from a Dublin store in an online transaction. I only used the card to pay for the hotel on arrival, and two days later this happened. Please make sure the guests' financial information is safe, as the hotel is great. Really not a place where you would expect something like this to happen.",2,2015,12,22
229,great 3 night break,"Great break at a very good and quirky hotel. An earlier post by shumba93 spot on.The hotel is clean,rooms large and breakfast is good. As this hotel is a mixture of 3 or 4 victorian houses knocked together it does have some great and strange mixes of wierd and wonderful, 

Staff were very friendly and really helpful.
Hotel bar was brilliant  and Guinness  magic,
Location of hotels is great and really  handy  for buses.
Only slight issue is the stairs do creak alot and hotel even in December was really hot, however do not put you off. TThis is a great hotel and good valvue for money.
",4,2015,12,21
229,A Fab Find!,"Considering the location and quality of this hotel I think it's an absolute bargain! Our room was modern, spacious and immaculately clean, breakfast was good and the staff were friendly and helpful. Couple of small niggles; our room was really, really hot... Even for a real cold bod like me... Nothing an opened window didn't sort. The walls are a bit on the thin side so you can hear other adjacent rooms and people in the corridors. Other than that, a real gem of a find, will definitely be back. ",4,2015,12,21
229,Perfect hotel for couples,Beautiful hotel and lovely staff came for our 1st anniversary lovely room with four poster bed comfy bed  breakfast was lush will come back again in a few years to see if out padlock is still on halfpenny bridge.,5,2015,12,16
229,Georgian beauty,"We spent 5 nights here last week.  After reading tons of reviews on Dublin hotels I decided this hotel was the right fit for us.  And it was!!  It is within just a few minutes walk to city centre and the O'Connell Street and bridge.  And just over the bridge is Trinity College and The Temple Bar District.  The staff at The Castle were outstanding in striving to meet their guest needs and wants.  The breakfast is fantastic and so worth the price.  The beautiful Georgian architecture and décor is very homey and a comfortable place to return after a day out walking the city.  We really enjoyed the live music downstairs in the Vault on Friday and Saturday nights. 
 Yes, the stairs do creak and the hallways are narrow and long but our room was right beside the elevator and I am light sleeper.  Hardly heard a thing.  It was quiet and the neighborhood felt safe.    The rooms were very clean, modern bathrooms and comfortable beds.  The high ceilings made the room feel large and with large windows and a lot of natural light.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2015,12,15
229,worth the money,"We received a good deal on line for 3 nights, this included a magnificant breakfast with a chef on site to cook for you.  We were a party of 11 and we all received a free supper in the restaurant where you got the breakfast, however the bill did get mixed up but was corrected...I would recommend eating and paying for the food in the lounge as you have more variety and all our meals were delicious.  The bar has some entertainment which is ok.  This hotel is within walking distance to the shops and bars. We got a cab from the hotel and the hotel booked us one back.   I can not recommend the staff enough, if there was a problem they had it fixed in no time.  Very friendly......this was our first trip to Dublin and we would definately return there again and to this hotel. We enjoyed the Guiness brewery well worth viewing as well as the jail visit was very worthwhile. The hop on hop off bus tour is a must, easy to get on and off and lots of buses. We did not have time to do much shopping and did not see many of them but they are there if you are a shopper, just ask and people are happy to help with directions.  In general we found the Irish very happy and friendly, loved being around them!  keep on smiling!",4,2015,12,15
229,Good in parts,"Spent two nights here in December 2015. Very full with variety of visitors to Dublin.

 Convenient location - just away from the city centre. 

 Reception quick and efficient. Room not bad - clean enough but window fixings not in good order.
 
 Breakfast OK - nothing special and egg, bacon etc had sat too long in heated dishes.
 
 All in all - fair value for location and no serious issues with my stay, but nothing special to remember either!",3,2015,12,15
229,Good for the price,"Hotel is clean, staff friendly, was first offered  bigger smoking room, which was not suitable. The only other room was a small double, which was fine except TV was very small and no drawers for clothes. Breakfast is good. Loud music on Friday and Saturday nights, but didn't bother us. Good location, only 10 min walk to Temple Bar and other restaurants and shops around.",4,2015,12,14
229,A big surprise!,"Spend 3 nights here in December 2015 and was pleased with what I found! Not an expensive hotel by any means, but very convenient from a location point of view.

A lot of old houses knocked together makes it a maze to navigate, but adds to the charm of the place.

The bar downstairs is staffed by some friendly folk, and the food in the hotel was very good.

Topped off by a chat with Fionn the owner, who took the time to introduce himself. What a lovely guy! I will be back. That simple.",5,2015,12,14
229,Good value,"The hotel isn't In the city centre but is walking distance to the center.  The hotel has a good value for the money because you can stay in Dublin in more expensive rooms but you don't need to do it,  this offer a good deal.  The breakfast is a choice of Irish breakfast or English breakfast it isn't a self service. ",3,2015,12,13
229,"Great location! Good breakfast, and cosy rooms!","Stayed two nights here. Close to everything if you like walking Guinness factory about 35min walk away and most other attractions and  sights are no more than 20mins walk from this hotel, temple bar area just down the road and across the river 10 mins at most. Breakfast is a full Irish(sausage, bacon, pudding, eggs, beans, hashbrown, tomato and mushrooms) choice of toast or soda bread croissants, fruit, yoghurt, cheese, gammon and juices and coffee or tea. Our room was a double room it was clean and cosy had a bathroom with a shower, nice view of a church across the road.",5,2015,12,12
229,A good value for money ,"The room that we had was huge, it was really spacious. The position of the hotel is excellent only few minutes walking from everywhere. The breakfast is good if you like meat, eggs and bacon.
There was a small selection of jams and nothing sweet to eat. 
The staff at the reception was mostly friendly. The cleaning staff though is the only problem of this hotel since they don t even bother to throw the empty courtesy kit. The shower was clogged from the first day and the Internet is slow. 
 The best was the taxi driver that the hotel called for us! Generally Dublin is worth visiting more for the people and the atmosphere than the things to see. 
",4,2015,12,11
229,Charming and friendly!,"It's a beautiful Georgian property located within easy walking distance of most places. I booked for a business trip and was pleasantly surprised by the gorgeous building and really friendly staff. My initial room was a bit rough around the edges but in a charming way, but I was upgraded to a nicer room free of charge when the WiFi stopped working in my original room for unknown reasons. The breakfast was fast, friendly and tasty. The only minor issues I had were the WiFi (which was resolved), my original room was slightly cold and I needed a second blanket (provided in the wardrobe), and the noise from the street. Overall, I would highly recommend the hotel!",4,2015,12,11
229,Excellent hotel,"Walking distance to all the attractions,  lovely hotel.   Clean spacious bedroom.   Breakfast very nice,  plenty of choice. Friendly,  helpful staff.   Couldn't fault our stay.  Would definitely recommend it and use again if visiting Dublin.",5,2015,12,10
229,A Gem,"All I can say is thank you Michael O'Leary because if our flight had not been cancelled we would not have found this Gem of a hotel. After arriving stressed because of cancelled flight and not knowing what to expect we checked in, Then it started, the staff friendly and helpful, the room huge, a double and 2 singles for the kids and still loads of space to move about. Off for food, we went to the bar/ restaurant for a meal staff we met on our way were friendly. Vault bar for food and entertainment was great. Went to bed totally relaxed after a stressful day. The hotel is a short walk to shops and museums and the hop-on hop-off tour bus. The hotel itself is a load of Georgian houses that are joined together so loads of little areas to sit down and relax. The breakfast is a great way to start the day and the staff were helpful and friendly. The room we stayed in was very clean and the en-suite looked as it had just been refurbished. We stayed there for 2 days waiting for our flight home. Went home totally relaxed. Thank You Castle Hotel",5,2015,12,09
229,No Hassle in this Castle!,"I had a couple of asks before making my first ever trip to Dublin. A hotel within a good walking distance of the sights and sounds of the great city. A reasonable sized room with a working shower, and a place offering a pleasant welcome and a great breakfast.

Not at any stage did I have the intention to run my hands around the skirting board seeking dust! Nor did I feel the need to quality control the applied sealant around the shower. Nor did I care that perhaps the toilet roll wasn’t ethically sourced or the curtains had been dry cleaned before my visit. Neither did I want to purchase the place and live there for months on end. 

So now you understand what my genuine down to earth practical needs were, you will be wondering if they were met. They were indeed. A lovely warm welcome to the hotel and from a little chap sat in the corner that indicated to me he was the proprietor. 

I had a lovely sized room at the back of the hotel, which can be a maze like experience to find with all the twists and turns on the corridor.  It was clean and yes did have a cracking good powerful shower. My night’s sleep was perfect. In the morning a great breakfast awaited, along with a lovely Irish greeting.

On the whole this hotel is of reasonable quality, yes it can be a little rough around the edges in the rooms, but that should not deter you when you consider the practical side. The price and location was spot on.

If you’re looking for a hotel in Dublin and you’re not too bothered about the minor refinements. You’re seeking a price tag and location that is affordable then I can recommend that you pay this little abode a visit.",4,2015,12,06
229,Great deal close to Dublin City Centre,"Quirky in places, a little tired in others, this hotel is excellent value pretty close to Dublin city centre. Clean and tidy bedroom and bathroom, nice breakfast and super-friendly staff. Close to O'Connell street bus stop for airport. Overall very good value for a charming hotel.",4,2015,12,03
229,"Great hotel, great location.","Stayed here for two nights.  The hotel is at the top of Upper O'Connell Street.  It is close to the shops and not far from pubs and restaurants.  The buildings are Georgian, and decorated in keeping with the period.  We had two rooms, and both of them were very good.  One room was slightly larger than the other one, but they were still a good size.  The breakfast is very good, with a choice of both hot and cold food.   The staff are very efficient and work their socks off.  We went to the bar in the early hours of the morning.  The staff were really nice and welcoming.   I would highly recommend this hotel and I would stay here again.",5,2015,12,03
229,Great Hotel,"Stayed 2 nights, friendly and very helpful staff. Hotel clean and rooms comfortable, ideal location for Dublin city centre. Breakfast very good and plenty of it, sets you up for the day. Will stay here again....",4,2015,12,02
229,"Great location, staff and breakfast","I am currently just sat in my room of this hotel about to check out.  My fiance and I have done many city breaks and stayed in several 3 star hotels.  This I have to say ranks extremely high.  
The reception is well staffed and the staff are welcoming and friendly.  In fact this was the same throughout the hotel.  The decor was typical but felt clean.  The rooms were clean,  spacious and comfortable.  The usual tea coffee and tv.
Breakfast was great.  Really good ingredients and a modern light well decorated dinning area. 
Free wifi in the rooms and a computer and printer available in reception for use which was free also. 
We would definitely stay again and recommend this hotel.

229,Pre Christmas Weekend in Dublin,"Great hotel in an excellent location close to O'Connell Street. Hotel is situated in three Georgian houses , beautifully maintained with an Irish Bar & restaurant in the cellar. Fantastic traditional Irish breakfast with great selection of freshly cooked food to suit all tastes  with delicious soda bread.",5,2015,12,01
229,Very friendly and accommodating,"This hotel is a bit out of the way if you want to be near the city center. However; it's very close to the GPO. The staff was very friendly and super accommodating. When late for breakfast on our first day, they let us make a quick tray to take to our room before closing service. On our last day, we had an early flight. They arranged for our 4 AM cab and provided a small take away snack. ",4,2015,11,30
229,Four day Ireland vacation,"Pros - reasonable cost, close to downtown and tour pick up point. Clean, all the basics. Updated bathrooms

Cons - unresponsive staff to missing TV remote. Some Street  noise due to old single glaze widows.",4,2015,11,23
229,"Very well situated for the city, and an excellent breakfast","The staff were very helpful and welcoming.  The layout of the hotel, which covers a large area and has obviously expanded into a number of other buildings over the years, can make for confusion navigating to the bedrooms.  I saw one young man in reception saying he'd lost his way and couldn't find his room!  

The breakfasts were excellent.  Food in the bar less so.

The weather was mild and we found the heating in our room, particularly the bathroom, a bit too much, but maybe that's because we don't heat our own house to this level.

The location of the hotel is excellent, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone visiting Dublin.

I can't comment on views from the rooms, as ours looked out onto a car park and rubbish skip.",5,2015,11,22
229,Break away with my sister's,Me and my two sisters went to this hotel tuesday 17/115 for a few day s we got a very warm welcome from the staff and met the manager who was very welcoming also.when we got to our rooms they were lovely and they also had free WiFi the hotel is in the centre so we went walk about and it wasn't far from temple bar we had a few drinks later that night we just a drink in the hotel bar and had a great night with the staff .the next day we went to kilmainham jail for the tour which was very interesting and enjoyable later in the hotel there was a singer who was really good so it was another late night at the bar overall had a great time and would definitely go back to this hotel as the staff were so helpfully and friendly loved it 🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀,5,2015,11,21
229,"Good quality, reasonable price","I arrived early in the morning and was able to get my room. If my room had not been ready I would have been able to store my bags (I believe without charge). The staff were friendly and helpful. 
The room was clean, the washroom had been recently updated. 
The hotel itself is located just off a main road. It's about a 15 minute walk to O'Connell bridge, and a 5 minute walk from where the airlink bus drop off from Dublin airport is. 
The walls were a bit thin, there were times I could here people walking/talking in the hallway or by the lift, but it was never really an issue. 
Overall it was a good spot for a good price, and I felt safe staying there. ",4,2015,11,21
229,Great place,"Just got back.  The hotel was in a wonderful location.  Close to buses, Temple Bar, etc.  The staff was awesome.  Very polite and helpful.  The room was small but that was ok.  We didn't go to stay in a room.  It was clean and comfortable.  Breakfast was also good.  When we go back to Dublin we will stay at The Castle Hotel again.",5,2015,11,19
229,Amazing,"Wi-Fi was very good in all the hotel. The breakfast was incredible! Many options, and the traditional irish one was fantastic! The room was very clean and romantic!! The Staff is very very helpful. The localization is very good. Near from the most important tourist hotspots. ",5,2015,11,18
229,"Castle Hotel, Dublin","We arrived at 9am and were able to check in on arrival despite there being a usual check in time of 3pm. So thanks to the hotel for that!

We were given a triple room, although only booked a double. It was clean and tidy although looked a little more tired than the rooms on the hotels website. The bathroom looked like it had been refurbed fairly recently though. We were given a room on the 2nd floor overlooking the main road so it was a little noisy, the windows didn't provide great soundproofing!

The breakfasts were good, food was nice and a reasonable choice. We ate in the basement restaurant on a couple of occasions too and the food was excellent, although a little expensive but I guess that's to be expected.

The hotel was a 5 minute walk from O'Connell street and convenient for the airport bus route so all in all a decent place to stay with friendly and helpful staff.",4,2015,11,17
229,Thirty Three in Dublin!,"I stayed here with my husband and our friends (another two couples) to celebrate my birthday and cannot wait to return.

Everything about the hotel was wonderful- even the alcohol didn't give me a hangover.We ate in the Castle Vaults both evenings and we all thoroughly enjoyed the food- the rib of beef reminded me of my Grandma's sunday dinners and the mash was to die for. 

See you on 27th February 2016 to celebrate another 33rd!!!",5,2015,11,16
229,Great for a short break,"Faded grandeur, in a large Georgian hotel, but well appointed bedrooms & bathrooms. Perfect for our short stay. Nice bar in the basement with live Irish music. Breakfast was buffet style for some items and served  at a counter for hot full Irish. All staff very helpful and courteous. Would definitely go back.",4,2015,11,15
229,Good Hotel,"Recently stayed here for 3 nights and found the staff to be so helpful and welcoming nothing was to much trouble. Breakfast was very good and in a nice setting. Hotel is currently undergoing a bit of a refurbished but it is not too disruptive.  Hotel rooms are small and can be a bit noisy windows are not double glazed but this is an old building it would not put me off returning to this hotel.  However if you are after a very central hotel then this is not for you, to walk to the main shopping area is about 15 min walk.",4,2015,11,15
229,Disappointing,This was my 7th time at the Castle but wont visit again. It was great when I first visited you ordered breakfast and it was brought to your table. Now you have to queue and ask for what you want so people are continually walking around first for cereal and juice then main breakfast. This time there was a smell in the bathroom and found out what it was when I had a shower. The water would not drain away so I lifted the plug and it was full of slimy hairs I had to clean this out as it smelt vile. It cured the smell in the bathroom. So obviously the showers are not cleaned regularly.  Its a shame as the hotel is very central it needs some tlc now I think. There were some other minor faults so we decided we will go somewhere else when we come to Dublin again which we do 4 or 5 times a year,3,2015,11,15
229,Centrally located hotel which is value for money but there is room for improvement.,"Old building with character. Friendly and helpful staff. Gym available as well.Breakfast good. Clean bed and room. Did not try their restaurant as I was mostly out but others said the food was decently priced and good. 
Close to shops and restaurant so a good location.
Unfortunately it can be quite noisy and you can hear others through the walls. The decor is a bit dated and sometimes stale odour in the rooms. And prices may be a bit more than what you expect for this kind of hotel although it is quite centrally located and that may be a reason.
But overall I would rate my experience as good( sadly the rating on tripadvisor only allows average or very good but I would rate it as good)",3,2015,11,15
229,Worst hotel I've stayed at,"This was the worst night I have ever had at a hotel. The walls may as well be made of paper. You can hear everything around you crystal clear. You try to sleep but all you can do is listen to constant talking, taps dripping, floor boards creaking, doors banging. I had a better nights sleep at an 18-30's hotel in Magaluf.
If you are going for a nice break to Dublin I strongly advise that you avoid this awful hotel. You won't relax and you will get woken up throughout the night.",1,2015,11,13
229,Dublin trip,"Just came home from 3 days in dublin . Staying at the Castle  hotel. It was very central just off o connelly  street.  The hotel was very clean. Rooms were very nice .towels changed every day . Chocolates on your pillows every day.All the staff were very  friendly  and very helpful nothing was a bother. The breakfast was absolutely  amazing,it set you up for the day.Didnt have evening meal here so can't comment but I did here a lot of people  saying the meals were very nice. The last day we were there we got talking to the owner of the hotel . What a very true and honest  gentlemen. Would I go back to the castle hotel Dublin.  I certainly  would. All the best to all the staff and keep up the very good work.X☺",4,2015,11,12
229,"What I expected, for better or worse","When we booked a room at a low-priced tourist hotel, we did not except a top-of-the-line experience or swanky digs. We expected a clean room and adequate service, which we received and therefore I consider myself satisfied. The big downside was a group of very loud, very drunk young men staying on our floor, which isn't the hotel's fault (and the desk clerk did attempt to help when I asked) but is the sort of thing that one might expect to encounter when choosing a city hotel at this price point. Upsides include being close to the bustle of the city center while being removed enough to find quiet (apart from inebriated fellow guests, of course) and very generous portions at breakfast.",3,2015,11,10
229,Never again,"When I made the booking I had asked for a quiet room on a high level because I noted on the reviews that several guests had commented 'the walls were thin & there was a lot of street noise'.  However due to the good location and lack of choice booking last minute I risked it.  The room was on 2nd floor and in need of a good re-furb. We were woken mid-night by very loud snoring which continued throughout the night.  Next day we asked if we could be moved, apparently this was not possible, but another guest jumped to his feet and said he would be willing to swop with us because he could sleep through anything. The receptionist didn't like that idea either!  Miraculously an alternative room was now available on the 4th floor. I can confirm that the partition walls in this hotel are paper thin and you can hear every noise.",2,2015,11,09
229,Enjoyable stay,Stayed at the Castle 6 days in October.  All staff members were friendly and helpful.  Room was small but comfortable.  Hotel was accessible to all transportation.  Served a full breakfast daily.  Excellent food.,5,2015,11,08
229,Character hotel in great location,"This is a very quirky hotel in a great location. It is 3 Georgian houses knocked together so is full of twists and turns and character. There are lots of public spaces to sit which are eclectically furnished which add to the charm. The reception staff are very friendly and go out of their way to be helpful. The breakfast is good and there is a nice restaurant with live music. The room we had on the 3rd floor was very nice and there is a lift. It was a good size for a city hotel and was well appointed and clean with TV and tea and coffee making facilities. It was quite warm in the room given that it was November- I imagine the summer would be fairly unbearable. The bathroom had a shower which was fairly small but very effective. The fan wasn't working properly so there was a slight musty smell but it was bearable. We could hear some noise- especially from some inconsiderate rude and drunk females shouting and shrieking in the courtyard at 1.30 in the morning, but to be honest I have yet to stay in any hotel where it's been completely soundproofed to everyone else's comings and goings. I would stay here again without hesitation.",4,2015,11,08
229,Recommended and Good Service,"The Castle Hotel is a well located, picturesque hotel in the centre of town. The rooms are nice, clean and have a touch of an old home. Very much enjoy the long corridors to get to the room. Will definitely return to this great haunt and enjoy more breakfasts.   ",4,2015,11,06
229,Fantastic,The hotel was clean staff were friendly very helpful and welcoming. We were delayed and had checked out of the hotel and had gone to the airport. The airline we used were useless and gave us no assistance in anyway but the hotel were great and very accommodating. The breakfast was very filling with a good choice and we ate at the hotel in the evenings the food was tasty portions big and reasonable price. Would definitely stay here again,5,2015,11,06
229,Beautiful  accommodation in Dublin,"We stayed at The Castle Hotel in October, it is such a special hotel, full of charm and character and just a short walk to the centre of Dublin. 
The team at the hotel were very professional and friendly and looked after our every need and enquiry. 
The breakfast was delicious, and the rooms were kept very clean. There is a restaurant downstairs which serves delicious meals and has live Irish music. It is just across the road from the hop' on hop off bus stop. 
I would highly recommend this hotel for a stay in Dublin.",5,2015,11,05
229,Georgian style hotel full of atmosphere,"Booked and arrived at this hotel within 2 hours. Excellent service at check in and provided with a beautiful room complete with a choice of 3 beds for the 2 of us! Brilliant breakfast each morning and again, served with a smile.  Very friendly hotel.  Note - we booked an extra night and had to be moved to a different room. No problems with that but did notice the difference in the rooms. The second room was tiny compared to the first one.  Still comfy beds though!  This is an old style hotel filled with dark furniture and long carpeted corridors.  It is like a maze and part of it was originally a castle (hence the name). The bar is like a dungeon!  Overall we loved the service, comfortable beds and great breakfast. It was an easy 15 min dander to OcOnnell Bridge.  Great location.  Well worth a stay.",4,2015,11,04
229,Friendly and helpful,"My stay was really good. The breakfast in the morning was great and the restaurant in the cellar had the best atmosphere when great music. 

The staff was always friendly and helpful with all enquiries. Loved my time there. Great location as well",4,2015,11,04
229,Last minute booking,Fantastic one night stay and pleasant evening in Dublin and in the hotels lovely bar area. After flight cancellation we booked this little gem. Lovely family room comfy beds and great welcoming staff. Breakfast was lovely and staff in the bar were very accommodating. Live music was also great and made us stay a little bit longer in the bar even though we were tired after exploring Dublin City.,5,2015,11,03
229,Perfect Location for the Centre of Dublin,"Loved the Hotel. Warm, comfortable and our room was clean and quiet. Staff were friendly and work extremely hard.  Live Irish music played Friday and Saturday night in the cellar which was great.  Atmoshpere brilliant and The Vaults bar was amazing.  English Breakfasts in the morning was delicious, a perfect start to the day to set us up for the sights of Dublin.  This trip was planned to celebrate my husbands 50th Birthday and we loved our 3 nights stay at The Castle.  We have already decided to return next year for my 50th Birthday and we will be staying at The Castle once again.",5,2015,11,03
229,Lovely,"Room was lovely, a lot of character throughout hotel.  Pub/restaurant downstairs had fabulous entertainment and excellent food and drink.  Comfortable and charming.  A bit more removed from the city center than we would have preferred, the staff were friendly and accommodating.  Shower pressure left much to be desired.",4,2015,11,01
229,Perfect base for Dublin,Myself and some friends stayed here for 2 nights in September. The hotel is in a great location - within walking distance from the central areas but far enough away for quieter times. The staff were friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The rooms were clean and comfortableThe breakfast was good and the evening meal we had on our first nughts stay was superb. A very enjoyable stay.,4,2015,10,30
229,Great Base for Dublin,"Full of charm, very clean, really good food, good local music most nights and of course very helpful friendly staff.
All within easy reach of Dublin centre.
Possibly not the cheapest but certanly good value.",4,2015,10,28
229,Weekend Away,"Room was very small. Bed was supposed to be a double but was in fact a queen which for two people was very tight. Hotel had the heating on far too high. We had our radiator off in our room but the heat was still unbearable even with the window opened as wide as it would go. Shower cubicle was very small, couldn't bend over for the shower gel without your backside hitting the side of the cubicle. Shower itself was merely just a trickle. Hairdryer which was provided in the room was useless, you might as well have someone blow your hair dry, it would dry quicker.
Breakfast was good if you wanted a cooked breakfast but there didn't seem to be much choice if you wanted continental or cereals.
Went to the bar one evening, live singer was ok but was a bit depressing so left after 1 drink. Go to Temple Bar which is for all ages if you want to have fun.
I'll return to Dublin but will be staying in a different hotel.

229,Great location.,"Spent a 2 night stay at the Castle Hotel. The location is excellent - only a few minutes walk from all city centre attractions, yet far enough up O'Connell Street to be not too noisy. We had a superior double room & I emailed the hotel to request a quiet room as I'd seen a few complaints on here about night time noise. We were given room 230 at the back of the hotel, overlooking the car park. It was quiet at night so that was good. The hotel is very quirky with lots of little sitting rooms dotted around. Breakfast was very good. It was self service, so you could have as much as you wanted. The quality & selection was excellent. All the staff were extremely friendly & efficient throughout our stay - reception were always happy to answer any queries or questions we had. I would definitely stay here again if we visited Dublin in the future.",5,2015,10,26
229,A Return to the Castle,"We stayed at the Castle Hotel September 2, 3 and 9.  This was a return trip having stayed at the hotel in 2014.  Obviously, we enjoyed our stay the first time to book it again the following year.  This Georgian era hotel has character, friendly staff and the rooms are well-appointed, comfortable and modern.  You may be greeted by Fin(n), the owner of the hotel, when passing through the lobby who is clearly hands-on and keen to know his guests’ impressions.

One of the particular charms is the Castle Vaults Bar and Restaurant situated in the basement.  Guests are treated to nightly entertainment.  Ray Cox, in particular, gives a very entertaining show.  The Vaults is an excellent place to unwind after a day of sight-seeing and to meet fellow travellers over a pint.

The hotel is situated just off O’Connell and within easy walking distance to bus tour departures, pedestrian-only shopping district and not an overly challenging walk to the Liffey and Temple Bar District as it was managed by my 91-year old companion.",4,2015,10,25
229,Fantastic staff,"I have recently returned from a nights stay at this hotel.  We arrived at the hotel about 4 hours before we were able to check in, and I was very poorly.  The staff were so kind to me, and so accommodating.  They found somewhere for me to rest while we waited for our room. The bed in the room was very comfy,mother roomeas clean, the shower was hot, and the breakfast was absolutely amazing.  Would highly recommend. ",5,2015,10,24
229,Not as described. Extreme budget hotel at premium price,"We stayed for 5 nights in October.
We Booked directly with the hotel stating that it was a special trip and requested quiet rooms. 
We paid full price and the Castle hotel did not have to pay commission to another web site such such Hotels.com
On checking in we had to pay the full amount. If that had not been the case we would have moved.
However they ignored our request for quiet rooms and gave us a room on the busy street. So no sleep for us the first night.
We changed rooms. Staff we very accommodating, but manager could not be contacted.
Paint was peeling in our second room
Duvet covers that only fitted 3/4 of the Duvet. Pointed this out to housekeeping, but was totally ignored.
Taps were hard to turn off
Filthy curtain nets and dirty shower curtain
Bathroom fan not working.
Housekeeping staff carrying cleaning equipment and tea, coffee, biscuits in the same container. Never saw freshly dishwashed coffee cups and glasses with housekeeping  so can only assume that they were washed out in the rooms.
Rooms were in no way at all not recently refurbished as described on the web site.
I did not go to Dublin to watch TV, but the minuscule 19 inch tv was ridiculous.
Absolutely not up to 3* level. 
I saw a waitress cleaning up the breakfast things, carrying a half empty large container of orange juice with her hand in the neck of the container to hold it. That was the end of OJ for me at breakfast.
The manageress was never available at any time to discuss these complaint.  
I've never posted a Tripadvisor review, and was very hesitant about doing so with a negative one. But this was simply not acceptable.
They rely on large numbers of visitors coming in on organised trips, staying for 1-2 nights and can very safely ignore complaints.
On the positive side, ignoring the OJ, the breakfast was good. entertainment in the downstairs bar was good.
Saddest part, is that we will probably never be in Dublin with our friends again and the Castle hotel left such sour taste. Our friends had similar experience in their room. The poor quality of a quite expensive stay should never have been the topic of our conversation in Dublin.
I wrote to the manager and she refuted everything. No apology, just stated that we were wrong. As she expected, I can't challenge that because I am now back home.",1,2015,10,23
229,Terrible Experience,"Where do I start? The noisy room, fan not working in the bathroom, dirty net  and shower curtains, short duvet covers that only reached halfway down the cheap and cheesy duvets, the awful pillows, the chipped bathtub, or the indifferent manager? Or perhaps I should tell you about the peeling paint, the leaky taps, or the fact that the in room coffee and tea refills were in the same basket as the windolene spray(the only cleaner i saw used for cleaning ) and cleaning cloths the staff used? Maybe I should also tell you about the fact that the cups and glasses in the rooms were always the same, as i marked one just to test it. The breakfast was good and so was the entertainment in the evenings. Find another hotel that really cares about their visitors.",1,2015,10,23
229,Pkay,"The room we were given did not compare with what we saw on their website. We were in a tiny corner on the top floor that couldn't access the wifi. We had to go out in the staircase to check emails. 3/4 of our devices couldn't pick up the network at all from the room.
The location was great! We were able to get pretty much anywhere after a short walk. The breakfast which was included in the price was a big portion and the staff were great.
The bar and restaurant were really good and again the staff amazing.
I would stay there again but next time ask for a better room.",3,2015,10,23
229,excellent,"stayed here recently, this is a great location just off city center, 2 minutes walk from the spire. it has gated car park off the street, wifi, great price for breakfast included. has a bar with music nightly and a fab resterant. and also a gym.
The staff were so friendly and very helpful. will definitely be staying here again the next trip",5,2015,10,21
229,Ideally situated hotel in Dublin City,"Earlier this month my husband and I spent 4 nights at the Castle Hotel Dublin.  We found the staff very welcoming and helpful - that includes, reception, bar/restaurants, housekeepers - I travel a lot and have never found more helpful staff anywhere.  We had a good breakfast daily and enjoyed a couple of evening meals - whilst also enjoying the 'free' yet excellent entertainment.  I understand the building is over 200 years old and this adds to the charm and layout.  Our room was cleaned daily and to our complete satisfaction.  A useful tip - the hop on hop off tour bus has a stop just across the road and there are plenty of bars and restaurants locally if you choose to eat out.",5,2015,10,21
229,A nice place in an nice city,"A great stay in Dublin, also thanks ""Castle Hotel"". A very nice and charming cityhotel. Well situated near beautiful and busy O´Connell Street, bars and shops.Convenient to reach from airport by Aircoach. Easy walking distance to the Liffey, to all sights, to the DART and to Temple Bar. But our favourite bars: The Parnell, Hill 16 and Madigan´s (Earl Street). All near ""Castle Hotel"". 
Our room was quite quiet, spacious, cosy and always very clean. The staff very friendly, always helpful and competent. We had breakfest in an extraordinary pretty room, very well and tasty. We enjoyed it every day.
We recommend this hotel for a nice trip to Dublin and would visit ""Castle Hotel"" again to.",4,2015,10,20
229,"Charming, old fashioned ""boarding house""","This is a lovely 130 room old property that feels like a boarding house. As an American, I'm not used to accommodations like this, and most of it I found utterly charming.

Some of the highlights include the staff, who were unfailingly polite, not only when I checked in but at breakfast-- I've never been greeted by so many smiles and ""good mornings""!

The room was small but well appointed; it wasn't fancy or especially large, but it fit the look of the establishment, it was clean, and I was cozy. My only complaint is the thin walls… I could hear my neighbors and am glad I packed my earplugs, as always.

All in all, for the price (I paid €98 for night), you absolutely can't beat the value. The location is amazing and after enjoying a very hearty Irish breakfast (included in the room rate!), I strolled around the city college. Highly recommended as a lovely, charming, old-fashioned hotel in a killer location in Dublin city center.",4,2015,10,20
229,Short stay - overpriced!,"Stayed for one night for concert at 3 arena. Pictures on website are not what we got for one night at 230 euro! Room very small and very difficult to find when you came out of lift. This place is like a maze, with steps after we came out of lift. Not good to manoeuvre  heavy case. Eventually found room in poky corner of hotel. Really dont know how we would have got out if there had been a fire, doors and steps everywhere on all floors! Breakfast only average, luke warm,no fresh fruit, not much choice. Corridors grubby could do with a paint in some areas, room really hot and noisy. Reception area was nice and welcoming, staff were very nice but i dont think i would stay here again not great and better places out there for the money that we paid, wouldnt even rate this as a hotel, more like a large bed and breakfast!",3,2015,10,19
229,"Great location at good price, while exceeding expectations","Castle Hotel is a ""3-star"", and a very good one too.  An old and lovingly restored and renovated property off Parnell Square.  Easy walking distance to all sights, pubs, and restaurants in Dublin.
Very friendly staff and good breakfast too.
Windows open, which is quite nice.  Service is visible, and a bar with live music is available nightly.
This was our second visit, and we will stay here again too.",5,2015,10,18
229,"Comfortable hotel, central location, great staff","My friend and I had a three night break in Dublin and we were very happy with the hotel. The location was great, really central. The room was pretty big and clean and not too noisey. The staff were very helpful- they gave us recommendations and directions for bars and when me friend lost her ring they were straight on to housekeeping to get the room checked in case it was there. 
My only gripe was that on our last morning housekeeping knocked on our door four times. Given that we were checking out in a matter of hours, they really could have waited and not disturbed us. 
I would definitely stay here again.",4,2015,10,18
229,Bubblin in Dublin,"The good stuff -

Location - Some cities are bustling. Dublin is a step up. Its exuberance level is at the maximum. The Castle Hotel is perfectly located, just far enough away from the party zone, but within easy walking distance.

Staff - I had interactions with a lot of the Castle's staff during my stay. Everybody really helpful and added to the hotel's good vibe.

Breakfast - included in the price. And generous. A cut above ANY breakfast I've had anywhere in Europe. 

The not-so-good. You need GPS to find your way around the building. And the main stair is creaky. These things are quirk though, and definitely not deal-breakers.

I usually prefer the anonymous, sterile format of modern hotels. But if my Irish lotto numbers come up, I will be back in Dublin like a shot, to stay here forever.",5,2015,10,17
229,"Great Location, Good Price, Met Expectations","We stayed here based on the recommendation of a friend for four days when we stayed in Dublin on our own.  Georgian Mansions were used to make the hotel.  The room was comfortable and had a walk-in shower.  Something I came to appreciate as we traveled through Ireland, and I had to get in and out of deep tubs that could be slippery.
The rooms were clean and well maintained.  Housekeeping was great. The staff was friendly.  We had a hair dryer and tea making equipment.
 An Irish buffet breakfast was included and was very good, especially after having Irish Breakfasts for 21 days and was able to compare with other places.
We were just around the corner from the Hop-on Hop-off pickup points.  We were also close to where the Airlink let us off.  We were very close to O'Connell Street and central Dublin was very walkable.
If price and location are important, I would recommend this hotel.",4,2015,10,17
229,Shabby Chic Hotel -  BUT 'hap hazard' Restaurant Service by waiting Staff and NOISY room!,"My Wife and I have, today, returned from a wonderful 4 night stay in Dublin - My 4th stay in this vibrant city! We stayed at The Castle Hotel in Gardiner Row, Great Denmark Street, Dublin, situated to the top end of O'Connell Street - about a 10-15 minute walk away from the centre of shopping and Temple Bar. We had a double room - spacious and traditionally furnished - HOWEVER, IT WAS AT THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING. VERY NOISY! - TRAFFIC/REVELLERS NOISE UNTIL LATE AT NIGHT/EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING AND FROM 5.OOAM - THE DOUBLE GLAZING TO THE OLD SASH WINDOWS IS USELESS! Book a rear room, NOT at the front! Although they don't look out onto something beautiful, you WILL have a good nights sleep! We also, on our first and last nights, booked a meal in the Bar/Dining Room - In the old vaults of the building. However, although atmospheric, DONT book in the restaurant, as it's off the bar area via a small archway The staff can't see you so you are forgotten - although we pre-booked a table - The waiting staff were serving everyone in the bar area and forgot the diners in the dining room as they couldn't see you - OUT OF SIGHT OUT OF MIND! We waited up to half an hour between courses to be served! When I asked to be served our desserts, the waiter in the bar area said, ' Haven't you received it yet - you must have been forgotten.'  Don't get me wrong, the waiting staff were friendly and lovely , but no-one was managing them! Eat in the bar where you can be seen and the music is emotive and excellent! I suggest The Management open up the formal dining area to the bar area, to ensure EVERYONE IS SEEN! On our last night, we booked a table in the bar area and the food service came without too much delay, although the staff seemed to be in some turmoil when it got busy - Where was their line Manager to oversee things?  Another word of warning, come breakfast, when it gets busy, you are directed into the overflow dining area with waitress/waiter service but, again, there is no system in place or Manager in charge, so  one is served  in an ad hoc way which becomes chaotic! Get up early and eat in the self service restaurant which is super efficient! The reception staff were very helpful and knowledgeable, so I was very impressed with them. Another GREAT NIGHT to book is at The Arlington Hotel - 3 course meal with superb Irish Music and dancing - Service was exceptional! Overall, would I return to The Castle - NO - I would probably book in at Cassidy's in O'Connell Street as this establishment appeared far better!  TO FINISH - BOOK IN AT GOGARTY'S RESTAURANT IN TEMPLE BAR - FINE AND GOOD VALUE DINING WITH ENTHRALLING MUSIC TO MATCH ON THE OTHER FLOORS - DUBLIN I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU AND WILL RETURN - BUT NOT TO THE CASTLE!",3,2015,10,17
229,Oldest Hotel in Dublin,"I Took my partner here for a weekend break, what a fabulous hotel. the staff are amazing and  very personable
 The hotel is central to everything you need to see and they have can order you a cheap cab for you if you want to travel out
Our room was gorgeous and cleaned daily
The bar- restaurant is great affordable and first night due to travelling we stayed in hotel and they had Irish music on which i'd never seen before.  it was fantastic, a man called Ray Cox was a great entertainer and he plays there regularly
The hotel decor is rich with splendor beautiful furniture and accessories
Definately going back to this hotel",5,2015,10,17
229,lovely hotel,"We can to Dublin for a birthday treat the hotel is lovely, room was clean and modern food awsome would visit again, only thing was our room faced the main rd were all the bus stops was and the noise from the rd started about 6am so we got woken up quite early  everything else was great enjoyed our stay.",5,2015,10,17
229,"Shabby, out dated and dirty","Although this hotel is in a good location for walking to the sites of Dublin it is not a good choice.  Lobby areas are shoddy and dirty - wall paper was torn & furniture is in very poor condition and in need of replacement.  Dining room was crowded and very loud at breakfast.  Guest rooms are tiny, poorly laid out, not very clean and unbearably hot although it was 50 degrees outside and we turned off the heat!!   Bedding & towels were very thin.  The duvet cover was too small for the comforter and we had two lumpy thin foam pillows.  The shower was terrible - very small with inconsistent water temperatures - alternately cold & very hot water!
The only good thing about the hotel was the nightly entertainment in the basement pub.  But don't let this draw you in as there are many pubs within walking distance that provide high quality live entertainment.",1,2015,10,16
229,Great stay,"Went hear with the wife and two friends for four days and had a great time the hotel was great the rooms were comfortable And big rooms were cleared every day 
The vault bar was good had a singer on every night singing Irish songs and the bar was own until 0100am the bar staff were great 
Murray's bar just around the corner was great the food was amazing and also had rest a band on every night the Dublin in town and the stone house were great bar
Dublin castle was a great place to look around the ballroom was amazing and the viking boat trip was good next to the park was great and the guide was the funniest thing will go back had a great time",5,2015,10,15
229,"Fabulous, cannot praise it highly enough.","It took us around half an hour by taxi from Dublin Airport to The Castle, the trip 
costing €35 including a tip. We were both exhausted, our journey having taken 10 hours door to door. There are a couple of very easy steps to get in to the sumptuous lobby where we received a very warm welcome. Being Disabled I'd asked for a room with a walk-in shower rather than an overbath arrangement;  we were given Room 105 which is on the ground floor although there are a few steps to get up to it. The room is utterly beautiful. As with the rest of the Hotel which was originally four Georgian houses, with a Music Shop in the middle, the high ceilings have stunning cornice work and mouldings, there are marble fireplaces, beautifully ornate overmantels and genuinely antiquities in furniture and artwork.
A small point, I could have done with being warned that when you open the bathroom door there is a step to get up to it. You do not expect a step right there but I quickly got used to the arrangement. Room 105 is a spacious triple room, the beds as we discovered are extremely comfortable, and the tea making facilities were very welcome. This room overlooks the rear garden which is also a smoking area. The staff use this entrance from very early in the mornings, we did notice the door slamming a few times but it didn't really bother us. We were offered another room because of this issue - without us having said anything about it - but it wasn't affecting us enough to warrant moving.
I shall start to précis as otherwise this review will end up ludicrously long. The Castle is a beautiful, quirky hotel which serves glorious food, both at breakfast and during the day in The Music Shop restaurant and downstairs in the wonderful Vaults bar. The location is tremendously central, essentially it is positioned at the top of O'Connell Street. The area is not trendy, it is not full of fashionable bars and expensive shops therefore it is not full of hen nights or stag parties and the bars and shops are consequently much more reasonably priced. My husband paid on average €5.50 for a pint of beer or lager. He switched from bitter to lager after a few days as he prefers beer served at room temperature and in Ireland everything seemed to only come as super-cold. The hotel is pretty close to Connolly train and bus station and many of the other cal buses can be picked up in O'Connell Street as well as the wonderful city bus tour which I would highly recommend for both their informational and humourous content. 
The Vaults bar downstairs has excellent local musicians every night. On our first night the singer was great but the bar was quiet, by our second night the bar was packed and the music swang, the drink flowed and the craic was mighty!  We met people from Belgium, the States and Canada as well as from other parts of Ireland and the UK. There is a subterranean smoking area which is quite atmospheric and where you seem to meet the most interesting people. That night we are their char-grilled chicken in cream sauce with vegetables and the most perfectly seasoned mashed potato I've ever eaten. Who would think that mash could be heavenly?
The highest point amongst very many has to be the staff. From our first telephone conversations every member of the pretty large team was utterly charming, efficient, helpful and kind. They not only did their jobs with extreme professionalism but were supremely kind and keen to make your stay as great as possible. I'm only sad that I don't know more names to mention as so many were particularly helpful but the only names I remember are Beatrice, one of the waitresses who looked after me so well and so smilingly, the glorious Suzanne on the Reception desk who went above and beyond the call of duty and Patrick, one of the night staff, who was so concerned that I spent nightime hours pacing the rooms and chainsmoking outside rather than sleeping. He was so kind, a Masters student working nights to keep himself through his studies, I wish him and the rest of the team a massive debt of gratitude.
I have gone on way too long. Do not go here if you like modern, soulless boxes and you expect everything to work perfectly! It is simply not that kind of place; the shower made me cry for example. But, we both loved The Castle and would return in a heartbeat and would highly recommend it to you if you like your history dished up with a personal touch.",5,2015,10,15
229,Mmmmmmm........,"This hotel is best suited to the hard of hearing. Thin walls where one can hear everything going on next door and the chatter and phone calls of housekeeping staff whilst having a lie in, made for a poor stay. Duvets were dirty and old, shower tray very slow to empty and general shabbiness of the hotel were disappointing. On the plus side, food was excellent, reception staff helpful and reasonable location. On booking, my daughter requested a ground floor room, we were given one on the 3rd floor. She also mentioned it was my 50th birthday, but no acknowledgement of that from staff. To be fair, it does say room allocation not guaranteed but it's not rocket science to work out if one requests a ground floor room, there is usually good reason! ",2,2015,10,15
229,Get Ready to Not Sleep,"We stayed at this hotel on the last leg of our European vacation and let me say it was without a doubt the worst!! While the room was nothing to write home about, the traffic noise was unbearable, it literally sounded like the cars were in our room. We did not sleep the 3 nights we stayed here.
Would recommend you check room location is not facing the street.",1,2015,10,13
229,Midweek Break.,"We had a 2 night midweek stay. The room was adequate. The staff were very helpful and friendly.  Would recommend the restaurant in the basement.  Breakfast again very good. Location good, 10 minutes from O'Connell St and 20 minutes from the river.
",5,2015,10,13
229,Friendly staff and a great location. ,"Prior to leaving Australia for Ireland I had contact with the Castle Hotel to organise a cab from the airport. They sent the wonderful Michael to collect myself and my parents. Michael was friendly and helpful and was our cab driver when he was available. All the staff at the hotel were friendly and assisted us with all our enquires, nothing was ever too hard. I would not hesitate to stay at the Castle Hotel when I return to Dublin. Great service, clean rooms and delicious breakfast. The Music Shop Cafe attached to the hotel is a lovely place to relax for coffee after a busy day in Dublin. ",5,2015,10,09
229,Overall great return visit ,"I have used this hotel twice now within a matter of months. Both times very good and staff in hotel always ready and willing to go that extra step.  

This visit in more detail. . .

Asked for a room with 3 single beds and a shower. We got both of these requests. We booked via email. We had room number 152. Room clean and up to a 3 star standard. Room wasn't as quite as last time when I stayed as that was on the 4th floor and this one on the 1st. But that said you can easily sleep and do not get woken up. 

WiFi across the whole of the hotel that is free what is great to see in this day and age.

The bar staff are simply great and always ready to serve and have a laugh with you. Connor and cian. 

Would I stay in this hotel again. The simple answer is yes. It's priced where people can afford a decent stay when they visit dublin. It's around 15 minutes from airport on aircoach (12 euro return). ",5,2015,10,09
229,I would return,"I had a single room with a three quarter bed.  The room was quiet and very clean.  The reception staff where very helpful. I liked the ambience of the hotel and it was very convenient for the city centre.  The only criticism I would make is regarding the breakfast experience.  It was very busy and crowded at breakfast and on my first morning I was seated where the staff where clearing the plates.  I felt as though I was in the hotel kitchen and I did not find it a pleasant experience.  When I arrived on the third and fourth morning the cafe area was full and I was invited to go to the dining room downstairs.  This was actually a much better experience although when I arrived in the room there were no staff to guide me to seating.  I appreciated the care and service given once a staff member appeared.  The breakfast was good and very adequate.  The only other issue which I am sure could be addressed was that I could not get decafe coffee in the bar.  However, this would not stop me from using this hotel again.",4,2015,10,07
229,Charming,"This is a charming Georgian house makes a cozy hotel. I stayed there for one week and was truly satisfied with everything they had to offer. The room was very clean with the perfect amount is space, the breakfast tasted good and the staff were very warm and hospitable. Excellent location as well. I would stay here again ",4,2015,10,07
229,A Piece of History,"My dad's family, holidaying from Northern Ireland, have stayed in this hotel for generations. Today we just had a drink in the bar. The barman was in the middle of cleaning, however he stopped and served us (re-opened in effect) and was extremely friendly and helpful. The place itself is much bigger than it looks, with multiple staircases. The pictures on the wall are classic and interesting. There are several lounges and live music every night. There is a strange mix of modern and old-fashioned about this place. If I have the money.... I will certainly choose The Castle as the place to stay if I return to Dublin.",4,2015,10,06
229,Great location and service,"This hotel is right on the edge or the main drag but just far enough to not be too noisy. There was a very filling and good quality free breakfast every morning and the staff was very friendly. One that especially stood out was Nancy at the front desk. She was very friendly, gave great recommendations that led me to places I wouldn't have normally considered. She also seemed genuinely interested in my trip and what I'd experienced.

If you book this early and get a good price like I did, It's the perfect spot for a home base while you explore Dublin and the rest of the area and country.",5,2015,10,06
229,Good location,"We took 5 rooms, for a family vacation.  The hotel is a combination of several older hotels, with lots of hallways and stairways and elevators.  It is right at O'Connell St and Parnell Square.  A brisk walk down O'Connell St will take you to the heart of Dublin.  The included breakfasts were generous and healthy.  We had a nice dinner in the downstairs restaurant.",5,2015,10,06
229,excellent helpfull staff. lovely clean hotel with clean well kept larger rooms. great food and entertainment. beautiful,"I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough for the perfect place to stay in Dublin. Myself and family members stayed here for several nights while we were over in Ireland from Australia for a family reunion. The staff are first class! I have not stayed anywhere else in the world where I left with such fond memories. The food was fantastic, the live music/ entertainment was second to none.
I and my family members / relatives are all very fond of our stay in the castle hotel and we will be back and will be staying here again. I Thank the staff for being somewhat a highlight of my Ireland holiday.",5,2015,10,06
229,Great hotel all round,"Myself and 3 friends stayed at this hotel recently and we were all pleasantly surprised. It was in a great city center location, and only a short walk from the train station. We asked for a large room to accommodate the 4 of us and they provided this without any hassle. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms were spacious and very clean. Beds were comfy and the hotel was quiet which allowed for a great nights sleep. We were all really surprised with the free breakfast in the morning - a hot breakfast cooked fresh to order which was very tasty. Overall - a really great hotel in a handy city center location.",4,2015,10,05
229,Great ,"The rooms are very large for Europe. High ceilings. Clean and well kept.  

Included breakfast very good. Selection of eggs, sausage, potato, beans, bacon, tomatoe, and bread. Lots of food. 

I also liked the location. It's away from the noisy bars and only a 10 min walk from them. Not close enough to hear them. The hotel is in a great location for touring the city.",5,2015,10,04
229,Excellent Hotel,"This is a lovely hotel, staff were very friendly and helpfulour room had a four poster bed and was spotlessly clean. Maid service every day was perfect
Breakfast was good, evening meal was very nice too, and the nighttime entertainment was excellent
Hotel is about 15 minutes walk from Temple Bar and all the bars and attractions of central Dublin
Would certainly recommend and would return to this hotel without any hesitation",4,2015,10,02
229,Average hotel in great location,"Pricey for what it is.  Average hotel, small sized room, bed that was in need of a refurbishment.  However on the plus side there are great staff and great food both at breakfast and from the attached café to the side entrance at lunch time.  The hotel is situated just off O'Connell street, close enough to walk to all the decent attractions.  ",3,2015,10,02
229,Room wasn't great,"This hotel was passable. We stayed here one night. Room was small and a little depressing. Toilet was noisy. Breakfast was fine. Location was okay, 10-15 minute walk to the center of town. Parking was secure but costs an additional 15 euros a night which seemed steep. ",3,2015,10,02
229,A well located  comfortable hotel with great staff,"This is 19 century boutique hotel and  charming We rented one of the least expensive rooms in the hotel so it was small and quite modest. But is was very clean and the beds were very comfortable. The breakfast (included) room was large and cheerful. We went to the hotel restaurant two nights and the food was reasonably good, The entertainment at the bar was superior.  We walked to our activities (took the bus a couple of times)

The highlight of the hotel for me was the staff who were always helpful and knowledgeable. They always exceeded my expectations for service.",4,2015,10,01
229,Very nice,"Nice and clean hotel..15 min walk to Temple Bar and city centre. Spacious rooms with tea and coffee etc and even includes biscuits and chocolates on pillows each day! Friendly staff..good cooked breakfast and unique cellar wine bar with live music!, I would come back!!",5,2015,09,29
229,Very Convenient Location and charming place to stay,"We stayed in this hotel one evening.  We appreciated the family room available which comfortably slept 4 of us.  The staff was helpful and friendly and the hotel was very charming.   We appreciated the location, very close to many attractions in City Center.  We were able to walk almost everywhere we wanted to see.  

The only draw back of this hotel is the walls are very thin, resulting in late arriving neighbors waking us up in the middle of the night and being able to hear the entire phone conversation of the other neighbor at 6 AM.  

That said, we would stay again if the opportunity were to present itself.",4,2015,09,28
229,A central venue for a walk to the local bars and attractions,"Room was neat and clean if a bit tired in furnishings. We were situated over the courtyard, not particularly quiet as one heard doors banging and staff conversations. The breakfast was unappealing. Staff serving tea and coffee did not clear the tables or have any concept of guest anticipation, and the hot breakfast was bland and slopped onto the plate by a bored employee. The turnover was rapid - a bit like a sausage factory. I don't think the accommodation was value for money based on other establishments I stayed in during my trip. Tourists have become more aware of quality and value for their money and I would suggest that the Castle Hotel take a long hard look at improving noise reduction, breakfast quality, staff training on friendliness and hospitality.",3,2015,09,28
229,"Cute old hotel, tiny rooms behind a maze of narrow creaking stairs","Nice service, breakfast, location. 
Watch your credit card, though: A receptionist charged my credit card without me entering the PIN... It's ""easier"" that she reads and keys in the security code herself!?!",3,2015,09,28
229,Great hotel for great price!,"I just want to say I love this hotel. Great hotel, the staff are great. Didn't get off to the best start when we checked but once I mentioned that the one agent wasen't so nice it was fixed and she was a complete sweetheart the rest of the trip. Our room was very clean, very big! Loved the bathroom, huge! I read the reviews on this property before leaving and I wasn't so sure but this place is a hidden gem! Great location, the food is awesome! Try the stew! So good! The only thing I can say I didn't like was the internet in the rooms it wasn't great! But in the common areas it was great. We did call a couple of times about it and it did seem to get better but that's the only thing really I can say negative about it. We arrived early morning requested an early check in but couldn't get in due to a full house. That was annoying but expected. My suggestion would be if your arriving early book the room for the night before. We had to do a full day in Dublin with no sleep. That wasn't so great but lesson learned for next time. I really enjoyed my stay, it was much nicer than the reviews had said. Go here! It's great! Will be returning when I come back to Dublin!",4,2015,09,28
229,Good hotel,I booked this hotel at the very last minute so wasn't sure what to expect. The reception staff were excellent and very welcoming. The room was small but adequate for my needs and considering it was a last minute booking I couldn't really complain. The evening entertainment was good as was the food. They also kept my luggage in a secure room whilst I toured Dublin before going to the airport. Beautiful building   Good experience all round. ,4,2015,09,28
229,Excellant service,"Excellant location, best breakfast and cab service..room was very comfortable and though it was not cold for them, they turned on the heater for us. Will highly recommend this place for anyone who wants to spend time in central Dublin",4,2015,09,27
229,Beautiful people wonderful place,"This was a really nice place to stay, good position close to all attractions , right in the heart of Dublin ( O'Connell Street being the main street ) good food, great staff , live music every night, clean and tidy rooms.  The Owner ""Finn"" was a lovely person with so much charm meeting vistors with such a warm welcome . Truely a great place to stay also good value and the full breakfast is a great way to start the day.",5,2015,09,25
229,Enjoyable 4 night stay.,"Just returned from 4 nights stay,Lovely welcome, luggage was locked away for us,as our room was not ready,went to explore the city in the mean time,came back 2 hours later,shown to our very comfortable,warming room, i will say,few creaky floorboards here&there,but it is a old building!Plenty of choice for breakfast,,had nice meal in the downstairs bar first night,chocolate brownie,Mmmmm!Staff very friendly&helpful.Just 10min walk from the center, As for the review before ours,,we wonder if the people were staying at the same hotel!!we would  stay again!",4,2015,09,25
229,Lovely hotel. Staff are amazing,Had a lovely stay in this Hotel. It's in a great area and easy to walk into town. The staff are brilliant and can't do enough for you. There is a great bar/restaurant downstairs which is good to enjoy all day and night. Room was good and our only complaint was the radiator was off and the windows open when we arrived so it was freezing but after turning radiator on it warmed up in no time. We would stay again. Thanks! ,5,2015,09,25
229,Appalling Service and Worst 4 nights ever in a hotel!,"This is the first negative trip advisor I've made but feel it's necessary to warn others who may be considering booking this hotel. This was our first trip to Ireland and had booked through Thomas Cook for 4 nights. We arrived early and our room was not ready so we left our luggage and went exploring Dublin for the day. We had asked for a very quiet room as we had been travelling for 5 weeks (we are from Australia). When we returned to the hotel later we were exhausted and although we were not happy with the very small and twin bedded room (we had requested a double) we were too tired to complain. However, after a very sleepless night due to loud noises from the music room the dining room, the lifts, people chatting in the courtyard below, we asked to be moved to another room because (a) the noise and (b) our request for a double room. The management categorically refused to even consider our request. We offered to pay extra for an upgrade. This was also refused. We then asked for a refund so we could relocate to another hotel. This was also refused. We had no alternative but to remain at the hotel for another 3 sleepless nights.

Re the food: our booking included breakfast which was of a poor standard and selection.

We made a local call to the airport and was charged 15 Euros!",1,2015,09,23
229,Please clean the floors from dirty underwear...,"At arrival we had to wait for an hour or two, waiting for our room to be cleaned. Very helpful staff, who helped us store our luggage in a room while waiting and giving us directions to a nice restaurant. When we got our room we were a bit dissapointed, it felt clean but I found dirty underwear just by the bed. Not so fresh...
But over all, we loved the stay at Castle Hotel. The restaurant in the basement is very cosy and we ended up eating dinner/having a drink there every night. The breakfast was also magnificant, giving you energy for all the sightseeing and walking all day...",4,2015,09,22
229,Great Price/Location Hotel,"Just returned from a 3 day visit to Dublin, having arrived very early we were allowed to leave our bags securely and book in, we then sampled the Old Music Shop Restaurant which is part of the hotel before setting off around Dublin.  Considering the location and the quality of the food served here I thought this Hotel was excellent value for money.  All staff very friendly and helpful, especially in the restaurant and would definitely recommend to anyone to stay after searching for a better deal I don't think you can go far wrong with this place.",4,2015,09,21
229,Close to city centre!,"The staff at reception were very kind and helpful. It is a nice hotel to stay as it is within walking distance to the city centre! Very close to the bus stop to go to Dublin Airport. The room was cosy and clean. Irish breakfast was included. I would stay again.
Note: check the advise just outside the place where breakfast is served indicating the ""busier"" times as, despite the restaurant is big, we had to wait about 10 min to get a table for breakfast.",4,2015,09,20
229,"Great location, friendly staff, huge room, excellent value! ","My friends and I stayed a few nights, it's just a few minutes walk to O'Connell street.  The Owner Finn, a fabulous flirt, welcomed us and showed us around.  We had booked a triple room, and it was Huge!  2 bedrooms and a bath, we couldn't believe how large it was.  Very clean, historic.  The floorboards creek a bit, just as you'd expect.  The spread for breakfast was pretty good, especially the hot bar.  (Altho the young staff in the dining rooms could be a bit inattentive)  I would highly recommend the Castle Hotel and will stay there again.  ",4,2015,09,20
229,Never again.,"Will never stay here again. Paper thin walls. Have barely slept through being woken up with the people next door (3 separate lots) can hear them talking, their tv, doors slamming. So sleep deprived I can't wait to move on.",1,2015,09,19
229,Great location in Dublin,"Just got back from three days in Dublin staying at The Castle Hotel.Excellent location to centre and 10 minute walk to Temple Bar Area.Hotel staff friendly and helpful.Room 137 at back of hotel quite room,bed comfortable,room spacious, and cleaned daily.Fabulous food in the old music shop restaurant and the Vault Bar with live music.",4,2015,09,19
229,'Could and should be a lot better',"A quirky ex set of Georgian residences greets the new visitor giving a good first feeling upon arrival.We had booked and had requested a room with bath and not shower several months in advance,but unfortunately was given a room with shower only.This is not the first time this has happened to me, but I have stopped complaining now as it does not do my blood pressure any good,particularly at the start of a holiday.The room on the 4th Floor was clean and the shower room appeared to have been recently refurbished.Absolutely no pressure from the shower rendering it 'next to bonny'.What lets this establishment down is its lack of direction with its catering facilities.It does not appear to have a dedicated restaurant.Evening meals are expected to be taken in the bar area with a little space outside of the bar set up with a few tables.It offers both a Table d'hote and A La Carte Menu which for the most part offers identical dishes.I worked out that in some cases it was cheaper to
eat the same dish from the A La Carte than the TD'T ...that's a first ! Menu choices were limited and not very exciting,but perfectly well cooked.There does appear to
be a separate room for breakfast although we were asked to eat in a room located in the cellars as this was full at the time.When breakfast came it was luke warm.Service throughout our two day stay was attentive and polite.",3,2015,09,19
229,4day visit to dublin,"lovely friendly hotel,good food ,lovely room 
staff friendly and efficient,good entertainment

the hotel is situated close to shops and buses,and within easy walking distance for temple bar.I am an older  lady and found it very easy to get around.",5,2015,09,18
229,Not without disappointments.,"Stayed 4 nights mid - Sept. '15. Room OK size and housekeeping good. No noise problems. Staff fine and lobby welcoming. Single elevator works OK. 
The Music Shop Restaurant (lunch/dinner) chaotic and very noisy at peak times. Cafeteria and tray....block out clang and bash. Not pleasurable.
The Vaults...downstairs restaurant. Nightly music starting at 9. Very good irish balladeers. Table service unsatisfactory. Took no time at all for menus, but entrees arrived 75 minutes later. Plates cleared and dessert menus distributed. Never saw server again. Wanted second round of wine and had to go up and shuffle in line at the bar to get it. Bartender hard at work, but also left post now and again to serve at tables, leaving crowd/line - up at bar to wait for his return. Food (when you can get it) fine.",2,2015,09,18
229,Nice hotel at a good price,"Hotel was nice, clean, with good food. It was a bit like a maze & we did lose our way a couple of times but it added to the fun of a weekend away with friends! Between us we had  one triple & one double room - both were nicely decorated, though the triple was a bit noisy & the double very hot. I would suggest also that the double would also benefit from a et curtain as once you opened the curtains you looked straight into an office building across the street. On waking on the first morning there was no hot water in either room, but once it was reported it was quickly fixed. The hotel is fairly central though we hired taxis quite a bit as we thought it safer for 5 women. Overall nice for a couple of days, with helpful, friendly staff, for a reasonable price.",4,2015,09,17
229,Great Hotel but a trip for any visitors,"Firstly I will start with the negative but will finish on the positives. We have just returned from a 4 day trip. 
Moving onto the good points ......
Staff - super friendly and very helpful
Breakfast - Delicious, help yourself to all food and top it off with a lovely cooked hot full breakfast, bacon was superb
Bar - great live music every night
Comfort - beds really comfortable
We would recommend a visit to the Zoo, Jameson Whiskey Tour, Guinness Tour & the Lephrecaun Museum was really good fun.",4,2015,09,17
229,Mrs,"We visited this hotel on a very wet weekend but had a fantastic time here. Loved the hotel on arrival staff was excellent, so friendly and welcoming. The hotel isn't to far from centre the open top bus stop is outside so right on the doorstep. The rooms were nice and clean, the hotel had character with a lovely bar that had live entertainment and gorgeous food.",4,2015,09,15
229,"Great location, service lacking a but","We generally stay at the Castle when in Dublin, mainly because of the good sized family rooms and its proximity to the centre of Dublin and its sights. We were impressed by the breakfasts, but found reception dismissive and the room was not serviced while we were there (two nights). On check out I asked for a taxi to be called for us - 20 minutes later another cabbie called one for us outside the hotel. Very annoying given that about 20 taxis had driven past at that point.",2,2015,09,15
229,Friendly and helpful staff,"We stayed at the Castle Hotel for 3 nights.  The moment I walked into the lobby, I loved the place.  The décor is old but I like ""old"".  The front desk workers made us feel welcomed.  They suggested sights to see and which days they are open.   The morning we checked out, they made our cab arrangements to the airport.  Our room was updated and somewhat small but very clean.  We didn't have a car, but were able to walk to public transportation.  The breakfast was okay, but they did accommodate us when we had to leave before breakfast is served.",5,2015,09,15
229,Sporting weekend,"Directions from Dublin Airport.  Take the 16 bus from airport. Alight at Parnell Square.East, opposite the Garden of Remembrance ( approx 45 mins ). Turn left when you leave the bus and retrace your steps for approx 100m. Turn right into Gardiner Row and the Castle Hotel is on opposite sight of road - about 3 mins from bus stop.  The 16 bus returns to the airport from O'Connell Street.
The Castle Hotel is typical of city centre lodgings.  The single room was very clean and comfortable.  No room view.  Quite expensive for b/b but Dublin accomodation is very dear. Tea making facilities provided.  Good wifi.  Friendly and helpful staff.  Breakfast was very good. The reason I gave it 4/5 was because the bar was open late and the live music provided a good athmosphere after a busy day. Would stay here again.",4,2015,09,15
229,Good venue well priced and good location,"Stayed here for two nights and was impressed with welcoming staff.  Great breakfast on offer and a good bar, with well priced drinks.  Rooms were reasonably sized and a comfortable bed.  Staff were good at offering local information and suggestions for places to visit and eat out.",4,2015,09,14
229,Very nice,"We stayed at the Castle Hotel for two nights after coming off a week tour of  Ireland.   Our room was on the second floor.  It was comfortable enough but too warm.  Not  sure why a heavy duvet for bedding is needed this time of year.  We faced New Denmark Street and it was a bit noisy with the window open.  Hotel and room were spotless and the reception staff were very friendly and  helpful.   The staff at  the Vault restaurant were very quick and very interested in friendly conversation.  The guiness stew was the best I had in Ireland.  The overall impression I got was the staff at the hotel take great pride in working there.  I read in a blog somewhere that this is the oldest running hotel in Dublin.  It is very cozy and homey with  lovely furniture and antiques.  Location is pretty good if you  don't  mind a 1/2 hour walk to the attractions and it's  about a 10 min walk to O'Connell St.  I would definitely recommend this hotel, and if you have the money, splurge on an executive room facing out back where it is less noisy. ",4,2015,09,14
229,The staff were amazing and always friendly .,"We stayed at the hotel for 6 days very clean rooms and clean towels everyday . We had a room overlooking the Church and it was very noisy . The food was delicious . The staff were always friendly ,a big shout out to Hazel who worked in the bar very attentive and so friendly . It would have been nice if there was air conditioning in the rooms because our room was really hot .",4,2015,09,13
229,Good hotel,Spent a lovely couple of days for our Anniversary staff efficient and courteous our room 318 was on the road side of hotel but when windows shut blocked out noise room was lovely my only small niggle was said supplied toiletries but that was only shampoo and shower gel would have been nice to have conditioner and body lotion maybe say just shower gel provided and i would have brought my own food in both restaurants very good breakfast was excellant really enjoyed stay ,5,2015,09,12
229,Great Location - Great Live Music,This hotel is a great location to walk down to all the sights of Dublin yet far enough way that it is not too busy with people and traffic.  They had great live music at this hotel so after a long day you can have a drink and listen to some great tunes.  It didn't go too late into the night so as to keep everyone awake until all hours.  The front desk people were helpful.  Breakfast was okay - nothing blew me out of the water but it was good all of the same.  We were able to accommodate five people to our room very nicely.  I would highly recommend this hotel.  Message me if you have questions.,4,2015,09,11
229,Comfort!,"We stayed here for 2 nights this week on a short break. 
The room was spacious and bright and, whilst the room/view was overlooking the courtyard, it was very peaceful at night. Comfy bed, and loved the hot shower!!

Had a decent pint in the bar, and enjoyed listening the local musician playing in their too. Breakfast was good and the staff were helpful and friendly. The front of house girls were great.  

Great base to explore the city from. Hop on/off buses stop 30 seconds walk away from the door, although we walked to the Guinness factory in about 30/40 mins from the hotel.",5,2015,09,09
229,The Castle Vaults Restaurant,"Did not stay at the hotel, but spent an evening in the restaurant and bar area.

Food was great and the bar was brilliant.  A good Irish singer and the ground was brilliant. the atmosphere was fun and everyone sang along.  Perfect 1st night find in Ireland.",5,2015,09,07
229,Mr R . Duncan,"Myself and my girlfriend stayed on the 3rd to the 6th of September. Our 2nd visit, and have just returned to Bristol.  The hotel is an amazing place to stay, very homely, welcoming and with character.  The staff work hard, but are ready with a smile and a chat when you talk to them.  A special thanks to Trevor and Hazel.  The staff on reception, are helpful and take the time to research any enquiries.  Breakfast,in the canteen style is a big improvement, and sets you up for the day with good food and plenty of choice.  Our room was excellent and serviced to a high level and very clean. No fridge,  but who would want one? You are visiting a city full of history, not moving house! The decor? Its an old hotel, and has character and lovely antiques. If you want modern ,and plastic and staff like clones, go elsewhere until you develop taste! The person from Hampshire who slated the hotel should get a hobby.  Or stay at home. The entertainment was excellent, a fact which hasn't escaped some of the locals who turn up.  Good evening Christie!   So thanks to the staff and hotel.  Definitely coming back for a 3rd visit.  It does feel like home. And we are missing it already. Thanks to Ray Cox who sang and played on our last night. The cd is excellent, and your music amazing.  Thanks to all of you for making our visit to Dublin complete.   Rob and Helen.  ",5,2015,09,06
229,Castle Hotel Dublin,"The hotel was well situated, not too far from the city centre and temple bar area but far enough to be quiet at bed time.The staff were friendly and helpful, good Irish breakfast and live music in the downstairs bar every night till about 11 o'clock. The room was a good size, only problem it was very warm, no air con.I would still recommend this hotel and I would use it again.",4,2015,09,04
229,Totally Excellent,"The tourist office in Dublin's airport booked this hotel for us when we landed after a long, overnight flight and we couldn't have been more delighted.  The hotel is filled with antiques, the room comfortable, and breakfast (included) was outstanding. The location is excellent and we took advantage of the Airlink Express bus from the airport that dropped us 3 blocks from the hotel.

Even better, we dined downstairs at their restaurant/bar and food was excellent, especially the fish chowder.  But the best was the singer, Ray Cox, who sang and entertained us for 2 hours. It was a terrific Irish experience.",5,2015,09,03
229,Beware of room 207,"This hotel is a beautiful hotel made up from 9 mansions so has alot of stairs and walkways, we meet the owner he was vry nice, we stayed in room 207 which was an extremly small room, bathroom door would not close and if you are tall you would hit your head on the door way walking into bathroom.
Bar also ran out of sav blanc wine,drinks were expensive",4,2015,09,03
229,great place to stay at in Dublin,"We arrived at 7:30 am because of our flight and were pleased to find our Georgian decorated rooms ready.  They were on the main floor at the back.  There was live music every night, so we found the room too noisy and asked for a change. I had requested a quiet room. ""Leave your bags packed and we will move you during the day."" was the reply.  We returned from our day's touring and were given another room (albeit very modern) upstairs.  
We always found the reception helpful and friendly. The breakfast was fine and the location was perfect.  We used the local transit to get to and from the airport- excellent directions from the Hotel staff.  The hop off and on bus was nearby and we often walked downtown.  Would certainly go back again. It was reasonably priced.",4,2015,09,02
229,I am still there in spirit.,"Where do I start? Here goes:-
Location: very good as quite central.  Appearance and cleanliness: very good. Interior decoration- we can only rate on our expectations and findings-very, very tasteful and all in keeping. All areas comfortable, ample leisure places to sit in comfort.  Bar, dining rooms again very good.It is the quirkiness of the place that gets me though.9 Georgian properties added to at different times.  Staircases to different rooms on different floors- simply wonderful in it's uniqueness.I have left a part of myself still wandering about those corridors. meeting other people wandering, equally lost but all smiling.  The staff make the place.. gems, utter gems all of them.  It was my first visit to Ireland and the friendliness of the people (especially at the hotel) has made me want to go back.  I will catch up with that spirit of mine which is still in that unusual hotel and wonderful city, in fact wonderful Ireland, again in the not too distant future.  Thanks.",5,2015,09,02
229,Nice hotel but quite disappointed on a whole,"When we booked we spoke to a receptionist who was very helpful and told us they had made a note that we would be staying for our honeymoon and would do what they could to make our stay extra special, starting with that they would put it under my married name even though the payments etc were all in my maiden name. 
However, when we arrived it was all in my maiden name and the only reason they knew we were on honeymoon was because I'd mentioned the change of name: to which we got a very half-hearted congratulations and that was it. We weren't expecting an upgraded room necessarily but my husband used to work for a low budget hotel chain and even they would get a card for someone celebrating something special. Yet there was no welcome sign, note, card, free room service or anything. 
We were at the very end of a corridor, looking onto the road, with an extra bed. The extra bed made this small double room even smaller, and the windows were so thin that the first few nights I barely slept due to loads of traffic and noise from outside being heard easily. 
The reception staff were so miserable throughout our whole stay, with the except of 1 lady at the end of the week no one said hello or goodbye when we came in/left despite having to walk past their desk to get to the door. 
The breakfast is included but warning if you want cooked breakfast you only get 1 sausage, 1 piece of bacon unless you ask for a specific amount. As a fussy eater I asked for sausages, beans and hash brown expecting that as I was having less than 1/2 the options I would be given a few of each. This was not the case. (Room service is 10 euros)
Just to confuse too, the information they give you at check-in and the information book in the room do not match up. There's also information about vending machines and a gym that don't appear to exist any more.

Positives: Good location with many local shops, bars and bus routes close by (but you do pay to be so close to the centre of Dublin). The staff that worked in everywhere other than the hotel reception were lovely and the bar/restaurant down in the basement is great. The Old Music Shop restaurant food is gorgeous too and we really enjoyed both lunch and dinner in there during our stay. Despite not needed housekeeping everyday, when leaving the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door, the staff would leave us fresh towels etc outside our door.",3,2015,09,01
229,Amazing breakfast and perfect location,"The best thing about this hotel is the breakfast. The location is brilliant too, it's so easy to walk to everything but it's so quiet once you are in the hotel. 

The bar in the basement has a very cool atmosphere and the food looks great and reasonably priced although we didn't actually have any. 

The staff are so helpful and friendly. We had trouble closing our bathroom window but within an hour a member of the maintanence team has been to fix it. ",5,2015,09,01
229,Very Impressed,"I've just returned from a 2 night stay at this hotel and must say I was very impressed. From the outside the hotel blends in and aside from the sign isn't very noticeable. However once you step inside it's extremely deceiving! The decor is beautiful and the receptionists were very friendly on our arrival (I was with my cousin). We headed to our room and were surprised to see many hidden rooms containing gorgeous plush furniture and beautiful paintings, including a grandfather clock which I thought was beautiful. We were on the top floor in a twin room and it was very homely for a hotel room! As we were on a main road we were concerned about noise however once we closed the windows we couldn't hear a thing! The bar was beautifully decorated and the staff were very friendly and chatty. Breakfast was absolutely amazing; a lot of choices though I stuck with the traditional cooked breakfast with was delicious! We didn't feel rushed to leave the dining area either which was a bonus. All in all I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here and would definitely return and recommended! Thank you. ",5,2015,09,01
229,So interesting!,"I believe this hotel is 9 Georgian mansions all put together in one amazing place. We enjoyed the friendly staff and our visit with the owner!  The staircases are  interesting as it seems you never take the same way to your room. Be sure to go to the bar in the basement, it's charming! ",4,2015,09,01
229,Great visit,"Myself and my partner stayed at The Castle from 28th August - 31st August. The hotel was easy to find and the location was perfect. The staff at  the hotel were friendly and extremely helpful. When we arrived, we found an information pack in the hotel room which advised on top attractions and restaurants to visit in Dublin, the hotel staff were so helpful and booked our chosen restaurants and excursions for us. Our room  was lovely, a nice comfortable double bed, lovely bathroom and spacious too. The Saturday and Sunday morning we had a full irish breakfast which was delicious and as we had an early flight on the last morning the hotel opened up the restaurant for us to have a continental breakfast at 4:30am which was also great and very accommodating. This hotel exceeded our expectations and we'll definitely return. Thank you to all of the staff at The Castle for making our trip to Dublin one to  remember for all of the right reasons, we'll be returning very soon!",4,2015,09,01

Staff members: Identified Shortfalls from Management.
(1) Atrocious Customer Service – Old Music Shop Restaurant Manager indifference.
Manager services on preparations for hot meals during breakfast.  Reluctant to acknowledge guests.  Cold, unwelcoming, distant and abrupt to guests. Yet, friendly and communicative to staff members.

When not taking breakfast orders, he can be heard chatting colloquially with staff and can be heard using profanity with other staff members. Not professional nor suitable within the presence of guests.

Orders for breakfast are given to him in the breakfast room and he neglected to provide the meal requested, after having stated that he would have the meal delivered to the table.  On one such instance he left the area without informing a fellow staff member of an awaiting breakfast order.  By which time the staff had cleared the hot meals from the serving stations.

As the manager for Old Music Shop restaurant in the evening. A meal for two had a number of issues and when requested the bill, the manager approached the table begrudgingly stating that he had authorised for the items to be taken off the service.  
The instances included a starter soup having human hair in it and two Irish coffees of substandard quality and taste.  

Staff members: Identified Shortfalls from Front of House (FoH) – receptionists.
(1) Atrocious Customer Service – Lack of acknowledgement of guests passing the small manned reception area.
Mid-afternoon arrival of guests. Room not prepared. No offer of a complimentary pot of tea/coffee after long journey with luggage and having to wait further for allocated room.

Female and male FoH showing selective behaviour in hospitality with guests whom they are interactive with. Most FoH staff members have their heads down below the reception counter. Some guests are ignored when they walk by the front desk. With a fully manned FoH, a basic acknowledgement could be a smile or a simple greeting as the default gesture.  

An observation of a young, male, blond, trainee in black uniform. He had used a public toilet and having used the room directly after him, a fellow guest found that their were water drips on the seat and around the base of the toilet. The toilet role was empty and not replaced with a new one that was stacked at one corner of the room. The room was a little untidy.

Staff members: Identified Shortfalls from Old Music Shop Breakfast room staff.
(1) Indifferent Customer Service.
Arrival at breakfast table with dirty tea cup facing down on saucer. Knife on clean napkin is greasy. Busy breakfast room and a guest has to walk up to a member of staff to be noticed. Explanation that a clean replacement knife would be appreciated. Staff member offered to bring a replacement knife. Replacement knife arrived. Replacement knife found to be dirty with food remnants. Guest walks from breakfast table to location where supposed clean knives are kept. ALL were filthy with grease or food remnants attached to the utensils. Abrupt, foreign, female, staff member ordered to know what was 'going on' as guest looked through selection of knives for a clean one with which to eat with. Explanation provided to staff member and she duly stated that she would deliver a clean knife. Knife arrived only to find that the manager had left his post at the hot breakfast station. So, guest with no cooked breakfast and no use of a clean knife.

Staff members: Identified Shortfalls from Old Music Shop Restaurant staff.
(1) Indifferent Customer Service.
With two female waiting staff, it was evident which one was prepared to show good hospitality (tall female with long dark hair) and which one wanted to be elsewhere (short female with two long plaits).  The display of discontent at the Music Room restaurant from one of the waiting staff was cold and distant. Sometimes abrupt and rude.

A number of the items on the menu were not available or had been changed.  Instances such as not having all the drinks listed on the drinks list. An offer was given from one waiting staff to check with the cellar bar for the drink. This was not relayed to the other female waiting staff and a guest had to choose only what was on offer from the list. A couple of the desserts had been withdrawn from the menu and what remained was not appealing.

A lack of communication between the waiting staff, bar staff and kitchen staff.

Follow through: 
Castle Hotel Group needs to address the following:
Staff personality, attitude and desire, in relation to the hospitality of Castle hotel, bar and restaurant's team and organisation ethos, must be factored and visibly seen within Castle hotel customer service aspects at root, apprenticeship/traineeship and management levels.

Importance to recruit individuals (local or foreign) with the personality and attitude to complement the Castle hotel, bar and restaurant's values and culture.  This must run in parallel with incremental changes to understanding foreign guest cultures, needs and expectations whilst staying at the Castle hotel.

Judging and benchmarking whether personnel meet and understand relevant anti-discrimination legislation, and their responsibility in stated job specifications and requirements.

Taking into account equality and diversity issues, including legislation and any relevant codes of practice to improve guest and client liaison relationships.

General overview of hotel.
Assault on senses with chintz, antiques and clashing colours. At first glance, entrance, reception area, public seating areas, ground, first and second floor open areas and toilets, drinking and dining areas, observed as reasonably clean and tidy. Security measures could be reviewed.

Instances:
Blind points.
Small and slight carpeted and stone steps not made attentive to possible falls/trips from guests.
Breakfast room cutlery and crockery greasy, stained and remnants of food on items.
Breakfast table, seating and surrounding floor area laden with breakfast remnants of previous guests.  A cordless, handheld vacuum cleaner would have helped to keep table areas clean.
Lack of vegetarian choices. 
Standard room with badly mounted fixtures and fittings and general dirty interior. Not 'elegantly decorated in warm tones to offer comfort and style' as the hotel marketing literature states.
Old Music Shop Restaurant not offering a 'restaurant that serves a pre theatre and an a la carte menu daily and the Bar stocks a wide variety of craft beers, wines and spirits to please the most discerning of taste.'  

Note:
Many ill serviced guests or customers rarely have the time or mindset to make a complaint.  Those that do make a complaint receive short shrift for bringing to light areas of concern, feeling that their complaints are subsequently dismissed.  Ill serviced guests or customers often follow this on in actions by taking their money elsewhere to other better serviced places and locations. Better serviced places and locations that can securing repeat visits, as well as benefit from recommendations to friends, family and business acquaintances.

Good Customer Service: 
Young, male, porter, on arrival of guests transferring luggage to storage cupboard.  
Surprising introduction to the owner of the hotel, Mr Fionn MacCumhaill.  A sharp, warm and amiable gentleman with a varied life experience, who can be seen on occasions actively supporting staff and welcoming guests.
Surprising introduction to the General Manager who is most polite, warm, informative and welcoming.
Both management gentlemen portrayed a good level of welcoming, warm and interactive gestures bringing explanatory and observatory aspects of the hotel, its history and their working experiences.  Exemplary guest relationship skills.  If only a substantial number of other staff members could show a similar dedication to their customer service skills to aid in the furtherance of the Castle hotel, then the stay for guests would be markedly more enjoyable.

Two, foreign, male, Front of House staff members were most helpful.  One was new from Europe and being trained upon my arrival at the hotel.  He took the initiative to step forward from behind the reception area, approach myself and another guest to help with our first day in Dublin.  This staff member was most helpful in producing a map for sightseeing and ascertaining directions.",1,2015,08,31
229,Good location but keep your expectations in check,"Great location - lots of rooms but not all of them are of the same standard.  So ask for a different room if you get one of the grotty ones, as we did. (Old Chipped bath and with shower and room decor was tired and dated - moved to a room with a 4 poster bed much better). I was uneasy charging drinks to the room after catching the bar staff charging extra drinks to my account.  Keep all your receipts and ask for a receipt if they don't give you one.  Old scam.  
Be very careful of your valuables when walking about in Dublin as our German friends were targeted by professional pick pockets and lost money, cards and passport.  Very inconvenient.  The Garda station was full of similar victims.  Be guarded and watch out for each other.",3,2015,08,29
229,Very good hotel does what it says on the Tin,"Very well run hotel with helpful and friendly staff. Owner was in reception and welcomed us to the hotel which was a nice touch. Room was as expected from any hotel, clean and fit for purpose. Good welcome book stuffed with local information and great selection of local restaurants and contact details. Breakfast was included and was to a very good standard. Only qualm was the fact that the breakfast room was also open to the public and so became full and felt cramped. Also felt as if we were expected to eat fast and leave fast so others could sit and eat. Otherwise a very good establishment. ",4,2015,08,29
229,Easy Traveling,"I just got back from a three night stay here. I got a ""single"" room that was a very nice size. I loved the very helpful front desk and staff. I got in after a long journey in the rain from the airport with lots of luggage, and they very kindly brought my bags up to the room. The location is perfect, I walked to every attraction I wanted to go to in 20-30 minutes. I was also able to bus to and from the airport. There were nice touches like chocolates on the pillow and the kettle for tea or coffee in the room too. The free breakfast included in the room rate was wonderful. It was a hot breakfast and the service was outstanding. The restaurant in the basement was also wonderful. One night I felt like staying in and the dinner there was delicious and I enjoyed the live music. 

One note, if you want wash clothes bring you're own. They're not provided and this seems to be the norm for Dublin hotels.",5,2015,08,26
229,Good 3 star,Good three star hotel on the north edge of what I'd call the centre. Airport bus stop and many others just a few mins away. Full hot breakfast included and a bar and restaurants too. I particularly welcomed the kettle with plenty of tea and coffee rather than the usual rations.,4,2015,08,26
229,"Great location, okay hotel","The hotel was easily found, location is central. Staff was nice. The room was okay but I'm not fan of carpeted floors or insufficient heating. The walls and windows need soundproofing as I heard snoring from the next room and the noise of the traffic outside. Breakfast wasn't very various.",3,2015,08,26
229,Not bad,"Great central location and a beautiful period property ...loved opening my wardrobe door to see some original georgian plasterwork.
I was due to stay in Hotel St George round the corner but was moved to here due to a leak.
As i was originally booked in a single the spacious twin was a plus. Clean,quiet and I slept well.
Lack of a shower and a so-so breakfast were the only negatives.

",3,2015,08,24
229,A great over night stay,"We booked to stay here as last minute decision to extend a planned day trip to Dublin. What a gem of a hotel. I'm not sure that the people who rated this hotel as anything lower than very good actually stayed in the same place as us!!!
Fantastic location,great family room,luv'ly breakfast and no hassle parking.
If you are looking for a quirky place to stay instead of the usual sterile modern hotel set up this is the place to stay. Excellent place.",5,2015,08,24
229,Last independant Hotel in Dublin?,"Stayed in this hotle as the last night on our mini tour. Wanted a hotel in the city center that was bike freindly and had parking. Its an old building so it has stair cases that will leave you breathless if you are on the top floor. Room was well equipped clean and quiet. TV was attached to a wall so that you couldnt see it if laying on the beds, a bit odd bur as we didnt it wasnt an issue. What it is, is a great base for exploring the city center. family run and staff are courteous and helpful as you'd expect. Food in the 'old music shop' was good but not exceptional at this price. Would I stay here again? Undoubtedly yes.",5,2015,08,22
229,Fantastic short break!,Lovely clean hotel. Was made to feel very welcome by all the staff. Food and drink here was delicious. Hotel was in easy reach of all the local attractions. Would certainly visit again and would definitely recommend this hotel to others.,5,2015,08,22
229,Looks Good but....,Charming historical hotel close to all amenities. Stayed as a solo traveller for a change for 2 nights. Staff were mixed . Sam was lovely however other staff on check in watched me lugg my suitcase a large one plus hand luggage to the lift with no real offers to help.single room small with little room for luggage.I also expected  after a long international flight to be able to purchase a snack at least at. 10 pm. Instead was pointed to the local chippy a block away. Being a middle aged woman didn't think this was quite a safe piece of advice as not a great part of Dublin. Breakfast was ok chef didn't answer to my cheery  good morning . Plus very cramped and busy with the rest of the staff trying their best. Bar food reasonable and entertainment fantastic.,3,2015,08,22
229,LITTLE GEM OF HOTEL IN DUBLIN,Lovely place with amazingly friendly staff.  Excellent breakfast included and nightly entertainment.  Rooms small but clean and great location for city exploring and close to airport bus. Would not hesitate to stay there again.,5,2015,08,20
229,Great location and good service,"The hotel has a great location, pretty close to O'Connell Street. It offers a traditional Irish breakfast. The staff was nice and helpful. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. Wi-Fi was very good. Good value for money.",5,2015,08,19
229,A good value stay,"We had 2 single rooms for a long weekend. The rooms were clean and tidy, in good condition and the beds were comfortable. The only minus was the location of the rooms were facing the street, so they were a bit noisy during hard traffic times. But we were not that bothered By it.
The hotel in itself is absolutely lovely, and we loved the fact that the owner was there greeting the customers.
 The Fry up in this hotel is great, good breakfast all in all. Friendly and active service at all times. 
The location is really good; the hotel is easy to find and it is close to everything a tourist could want and need. 
I will recommend this hotel, and I will try to book it for my next visit too. Do book well in advance, during high season the prices got really high close to the departure date. The price we paid was fair, and we felt it was well worth the money.",4,2015,08,18
229,Lovely  Clontarf,"Have stayed here many a time...the best beds ever....great food. ...comfortable  stay...a home from home. The staff are helpful and the rooms very comfortable. 
The bus takes you straight into the city centre. We return year after year. The breakfast is great .",5,2015,08,18
229,Lovely Friendly and value for  money,"Stayed here one night on a business trip,  and found a gem of a hotel for a long weekend in Dublin 
The owner takes pride in his hotel and made a point of speaking to each and every guest in the dining room or bar .  
It is very close to everything that Dublin has to offer.
The hotel is actually several building, which have been combined into one, and that adds to its charm,  but be warned the corridors and elevators are not so easy  to navigate .  I think they are like Hogwarts staircases and take you to whichever part of the hotel they feel like at the time. 

Woudl recommend anyone to try hthe castle",4,2015,08,16
229,Good Hotel for a short stay,"Had a single room which was on the top floor.  People had warned that the street could get noisy, but I didn’t hear a thing.  Could be because I was on the top floor.  The room is small, but had everything I needed.  I only spent 3 nights there.  Reception was very helpful.  Hotel decor historic.  Walking distance to Airlink for the airport and also the HoHo bus. Full Irish breakfast was very good in a very nice breakfast room.  Ate at the Vault Pub in the hotel one night, that included entertainment.  Food was so-so.",3,2015,08,14
229,You get what you pay for,"Unfortunately Thomas Cook (TC) booked this motel for us as a twin room. TC advised us that a twin room was the same as a double!!! Well no it wasn't and we were unable to change rooms. The room itself whilst adequate was to be found at the end of a maze of stairs, ramps, doors and winding hallways. 

The room fronted onto a main road so there was considerable noise with windows open as there is no air conditioning and many buses passing by. 

The reception staff were very professional and there was great local music each night in the basement. Breakfast was included in our package and was ok if only better organised. 

The hotel is close to the city centre so quite close to attractions. The air coach stops near the Castle from Dublin Airport and is convenient. 

Don't look for the entrance on the main road - check the side street. ",3,2015,08,13
229,Friendly,I stayed at castle as a solo traveller. Very central hotel and I loved it. The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was great and I truly enjoyed each day. I loved the little cafe next door too.,5,2015,08,12
229,First stop in Ireland,"We stayed here for the first few days of our first trip to Ireland. It's ideally located for walking around Dublin with easy access to bus tours and great pubs. Parking was very tight, but I'd stay there again. Breakfast was phenomenal every morning. ",5,2015,08,12
229,Hotel in a great location.,"Just returned from a 3 night stay (5 ladies). Everything was great, Bedrooms clean and adequate, breakfast excellent, staff friendly and helpful. Entertainment nightly in the bar below the hotel. Great location, approx 15 mins walk from Temple Bar Area. We took the Air Coach from the Airport (which someone else recommended on tripadvisor) and it stops on O'connell St. approx 10 mins walk from the Hotel. ",5,2015,08,10
229,Very nice and friendly hotel!,"I stayed three nights in this charming hotel! It is a perfect location for sightseeing and shopping and the staff is very helpful and friendly! 
The building is very interesting, and very big!
Perfect is, that there are two restaurants, one is a sort of a take away open the whole day with quality food and drinks and the other is for  nice dinners with live music in the evening! Very nice food! 
I didn't like the carpets in the bedrooms, not great if someone is allergic! But very clean bathroom!",4,2015,08,10
229,All we needed while visiting Dublin,"Room was very clean and spacious, although it was a bit dated and the bathroom looked like it needed refurbishing, everything was lovely in the room. Beds were comfy, rooms were cleaned daily and fresh towels were left too. Tea and coffee facilities are also in the room. 
Some of the hotel is very modern, in particular the breakfast room which looked newly refurbished. The hotel has an old feel about it which is nice, it felt very cosy, and was nice and warm. All staff were very pleasant and helpful, the hotel manager personally thanked us for choosing to stay at his hotel which we really appreciated, even more as he told us how he came to own the hotel and how much he values his customers. He even got us a cheap taxi to the airport. 
Breakfast was lovely, enjoyed all of the food on offer. However, the only negative is that the speediness in the restaurant is very slow. For example, one morning we were kept waiting outside the breakfast room for about 10 minutes as no tables were available for us. When we were seated we noticed that there many tables around us that were piled full of plates. This needs to be highlighted because if the tables were cleared quicker, the wait for tables would be minimised.

Hotel is just off O'Connell street, at the top which means its much quieter than Temple Bar where all the pubs and bars are, where there are great shops and its a short walk to the River Liffey and Temple Bar which gave us so much fun. Would definitely recommend this hotel and would definitely return if I'm ever in Dublin again! 
Thanks for a great stay!!!!",4,2015,08,09
229,Family staying one week at The Castle Hotel in Dublin,"The location of this hotel was excellent, very near to O'Connell Street, easy to walk to the city centre, many bus-stops near and Airlink bus to the airport also goes nearby the hotel. The hotel staff is friendly and always there for you. The hotel room was big enough for our family (2 adults + 2 children), there were equipments for making tea etc. The breakfast was one of the best we've ever had - you could choose the full irish one or just porridge or toasts etc. There were always room for eaters in the mornings.

The only thing that disturbed us, was the lack of sound isolation between the hotel rooms and corridors - you could hear everything from everywhere! Even the seagulls outside the hotel were very loudy! ",4,2015,08,08
229,A pleasant stay,"We stayed at the Castle Hotel for a long weekend.  We had booked a double room and were surprised to be allocated a twin room, a long way from the reception, and one with a dreary view overlooking the back of the hotel.  The staff responded quickly and we were re-allocated a double room, this time much closer to the centre of the hotel, with a view overlooking the car park which was okay.  The room was comfortable, airy and with an excellent bathroom. We ate at the hotel on one evening with family - food was good, service attentive. 
 The hotel is large and they could not cope with the numbers all arriving for breakfast at the same time.  On the first morning we were sent to an 'overflow' breakfast room downstairs - the second morning we had to wait for 10 minutes for a table (anywhere) to become free.  The third morning we got wise and went down much later, when we reckoned the main rush would have gone.  Overall a successful stay, aided by the very friendly and helpful staff.",4,2015,08,05
229,"Great Location , nothing to complain about","Very good hotel, pretty close to city center ( 15 minutes walk to river and Temple Bar area ) . Our room was very large and fit all 5 of us.(Many thanks for the chocolate in the bed). The Wifi in the room was good and the breakfasts was alright, enough to get your started day.",4,2015,08,03
229,Great location in Dublin,"We were able to get in to our room at 8:30 am which was great as we had just travelled for about 20 hours. Room was plain but spacious and on the quieter (in)side. No real view. Shower had a drainage problem, had to be quick or it would have spilled over the lip. Breakfast was alright, nothing special but enough to get you started for the day. Location within walking distance of temple Bar and many museums, sights, restaurants and pubs. Just above O'Connell St, many bus tours leave from this area. Much quieter on this side of the River Liffey. WiFi spotty.",3,2015,08,02
229,On the whole good,"Read reviews on here before booking, which were mixed, so did not really know what to expect. Overall we enjoyed our stay but it did have some niggles.
Good points are: Excellent Location, friendly staff, good room cleaning, good breakfasts. Also looking at comments re pricing we got a good deal as we booked on line so excellent value.
Bad Points: Unfortunately our room backed onto the external smoking area and was noisy at night. I suppose you could say its not Hotels fault having noisy customers but on a couple of nights you could hear people talking at 1.00am and you could not get to sleep. As mentioned by other reviewers the breakfasts can be chaotic. On one morning we were directed downstairs due to dining room being full only to find there were no tables free down there. No complaints about quality of breakfasts and plenty of choice. The hotel could do with some sprucing up I feel as there are no extractor fans in shower and water takes some time to get hot.
The Music bar was ok with Irish singers and reasonable bar prices and good atmosphere.
Overall we were happy with stay and I would recommend this Hotel and would stay there again if I could secure the same price as this trip.",4,2015,08,01
229,Mediocre Hotel,"The best way to describe this hotel is ""meh."" Everything was kind of rundown, staff didn't really seem to like working there, the restaurant was mediocre (service was sub-par and the breakfast was pretty terrible), and the layout was utterly bizarre (it seriously felt like you were in a maze trying to find your room). The Castle Hotel served its purpose, though, as our home base for two separate stopover nights during our country-wide tour of Ireland. It was an easy walk to most of the major sights in Dublin and the Airport Express so I'll give it points for convenience. But after our first night there, we weren't exactly looking forward to coming back for that second night a week later. Definitely would not stay there again.",2,2015,07,31
229,First time Dublin short break,"My partner and I stayed here for 4 nights for our first trip to Dublin. 15/20 minute drive from Dublin airport - would definitely recommend using the 'aircoach' service to O'Connell Street.  The hotel is a 10 minute walk from the coach stop. The location of this hotel is fantastic - most tourist attractions are a short walk away. 

Overall, the actual hotel is well maintained and must be applauded on how well the Georgian features have been kept, adding to the atmosphere of such a historic building. All front of house staff extremely friendly and helpful. Free wi-fi throughout!!! No complaints about the room, the bed was extremely comfy with both of us having a perfect nights sleep. Both room and bathroom spotlessly clean - the only gripe with the bathroom being the lack of hot water in the shower, for most of our stay it was luke-warm at best. Good selection of tea and coffee in the room, of which were topped up daily. 

On our first morning we were seated in the 'old music shop' restaurant - beautifully modern, a complete contrast to the rest of the hotel.  The tables are a little too close for comfort, no-one likes touching elbows with a stranger before their first coffee of the day! But understandably with large volumes of guests this cannot be helped.  Breakfast was self service, wonderful full Irish breakfast. The second morning was somewhat chaotic, we were seated in the lower restaurant room with no indication of where to sit or where to get hot food from. There were only two members of staff working in this room and seemed somewhat struggling to take out food, take orders from tables, clear tables and keep the continental breakfast tables topped up all at the same time. This is by no means a complaint aimed at them - they were doing their job as perfectly and as quickly as possible but more staff were definitely needed. Once ordered, the full Irish breakfast arrived on cold plates (hot plates = hot food guys!!) which meant breakfast was pretty much cold when it came to eating. I decided to go for the continental option after this, before finding no plates/dishes on the self service table to be able to have anything which resulted in us promptly leaving.

The Castle vaults bar was fantastic, live music every night with a decent range of drinks. Good atmosphere, friendly staff and all round good entertainment.

Overall, a brilliant hotel in a fantastic location. We would both definitely visit again if ever in the area.",3,2015,07,31
229,Adequate,Good location. A bit tired. Internet ok but can be a bit flakey. Desk staff helpful. Breakfast ok. Perhaps pancakes or something for those who don't eat a fry. Don't bother with restaurant downstairs. Overpriced and not that wonderful. Upstairs restaurant ok fir dinner but not a lot of choice.,3,2015,07,31
229,Great location,"This hotel is in a great location, a short walk to both the city centre and Croke Park. Room was clean but in need of decorating. The wallpaper was torn and the carpet was lifting in a few places but as it was clean this didn't bother me. Breakfast was great, there was plenty on offer and catered for all of our party. Parking was an issue as the car park is small and was full. The spaces were small and it was difficult to park. The lady at reception wanted me to leave our keys so that they could move the car if they needed. However, we refused to do this as we were in a designated spot. Had we not been I would have chosen to move the car rather than hand over the keys. Perhaps this is something that the hotel could look into. If you chose to stay here do not rely on parking your car here. Other than that it was a very pleasant experience and I would stay here again.",4,2015,07,31
229,One night family stay,"Comfortable, spacious room in traditional style hotel. Nice neutral decor. Good breakfast which we were able to arrange for earlier than the usual start time as we had to leave early for the airport. Lovely restaurant attached, the Old Music Shop. Really convenient, fabulous decor, nice pizza! Staff were all helpful and friendly. We'd go back again.",4,2015,07,30
229,Location was great but not much else to offer,"Arrived at the hotel and was greeted by a very pleasant lady who was checking us in. I asked about parking because when booking it said parking was available. She said it is and it would be 15 Euro per night (we were only staying the one). She took the 15 Euro but did say that if there wasn't space to park in front of another car and leave your keys at reception so we can move your car if necessary. I did not like the sound of that. That's got all sorts of implications for insurance. 

Anyhow, we proceeded to the car park and it was awful. It's a small alley where people have abandoned cars and the actual ""car park"" is through a very small entrance to the right. Trying to manouvere my car (A6) was difficult enough. Never mind the fact the car park was more than full!! 

I had to leave and park in a city centre car park which cost 25 Euro from 4pm to 9.30am!!! I had to proceed to reception and ask for the 15 Euro I had paid back. Money I feel they should have taken once the car was parked. The car parking setup is far from satisfactory so don't rely on it!! 

The hotel is dated. Clean enough but very dated. The stairs creak and our room was quite a distance from the lift/stairs. It was fine for us because we had little luggage. 

The room was quite small. The doorway for the bathroom was extremely small. Quite strange. The room was clean but basic. The floor, as strange as it sounds, was very uneven. 

One thing I will say is that a few days before our stayed, I had contacted the hotel basically because I had booked a twin room to ask for a double. I explained we just got engaged also but they didn't even acknowledge that. They did say they would give us a double if available at time of check in. We got a room with two single beds together so not a double. 

The only positive really was location. It was perfect for Croke Park. That was the main positive. The breakfast wasn't too bad either! The restaurant actually is very nicely decorated and quite different to the main hotel.

We paid 249 euro for one night so it was definitely overpriced, but it was a concert so we had little choice. We booked 5 months in advance but that didn't help the cost!",2,2015,07,29
229,"Clean, central & a great breakfast","We stayed here going to a concert, staff were helpful & friendly. The room was clean, spacious and had everything we needed. The breakfast was delicious and there was plenty of options. However there is insufficient parking space and we were asked to leave car keys at reception as it may needed to be moved. We did not as we were in a designated space but getting the space proved difficult.",4,2015,07,27
229,Dissapointing Stay,"We arrived at the hotel and were checked promptly by very friendly staff at the reception and that's the only positive thing we have to say. 

The room was clean but very small. The shower room did not have any extractor fan so it very uncomfortable in there. The shower itself burnt me twice and in between went ice cold. It was as if the room next door turned on a tap and it effected it. While in the shower  it would fill up fast as the drain wasn't great. This was the same for another couple who we were traveling with. 

We went down to the bar if you could call it that. Bottles of bulmers were served warm of the shelf and they only had a couple of bottles of Heineken in stock which they ran out of. They were out of stock of other drinks such as red bull also.  The staff were friendly though. 

We went down for breakfast at 9am and were sent down to another room as the main breakfast area must of been full. When we got down there was no one at the door or no sign to say if we should wait or sit down, so we just sat down.  We were then left waiting for a little while then asked what would we like but weren't given any options. We ordered a full Irish. When this came out to the table it was something like you would get for a coupe of euro in a small cafe. It was very small and cold. 

Overall very disappointed considering how much the room cost. Would of been a 1 star rating only for most of the staff were very friendly.",2,2015,07,26
229,Awful night at the Castle,"Stayed here for a concert and paid silly money (249 euro for 2 people 1 night b&b). Room was very outdated, awfully warm and you could hear all the noise from outside even with the windows closed. Walls are paper thin so you literally hear every thing from the rooms on either side and above. Pillows were rock solid, forget about a good nights sleep. For breakfast we didn't even get to eat in the main dining room, instead we were stuck downstairs in some overflow room. Couldn't wait to check out and definitely wont be back. Even for 3 stars this was poor.",2,2015,07,26
229,Friendly and relaxed atmosphere,"Stayed for 3 nights and really enjoyed the stay. Nicely decorated Georgian hotel with really friendly staff. Food is very good, especially the steak. the atmosphere in the cellar bar is lovely and if you time it right you can enjoy Ray Cox, a great balladeer.

Looking forward to a return visit",4,2015,07,23
229,Handy for central Dublin,Booked here for an 'overnighter' en route to elsewhere. The hotel is a large rambling affair made by knocking several terraced houses into one. It was clean and within comfortable walking distance ( approx. 15 minutes ) of the Temple Bar area of Dublin. Access to the parking is difficult and is around the back of the hotel in a very tight little courtyard with restricted space. There is an added charge for the privilege. Breakfast was totally chaotic since we were directed to an overflow dining area where the staff had absolutely no idea about how to serve their customers. They took orders in a random fashion ( if at all ) and several customers got annoyed. However when it eventually arrived it was good. I believe the service in the main dining area was a much better experience.  There is a small basement bar which was nothing to write home about. All in all adequate for our purpose but no more.,3,2015,07,22
229,"A hotel with character, a room with a view","At the end of our trip, we stayed only one night in the Dublin Castle hotel, but I would have loved to have stayed many days longer.  Part of the Castle Collection hotels group (we stayed in Stauntons on the Green last year), the castle hotel is in a Georgian building.  Upkeep is very good and room was clean (less sure about the cleanliness of the carpet, but that's true in any hotel).  

We booked a family room for 2 adults and 2 children, and it was big enough to sleep six people: a queen bed plus four twins and a small couch.  The L-shaped room wrapped around a corner of the building (one bed was in a separate area around the corner, made my son feel he had his own space), had many windows and good natural light.  View was urban, a jumble of roofs and walls of other buildings across the lot, pigeons, etc. Many of the interior walls and hallways were not at right angles, which was fun, funky and somehow comforting.  I love this about the hotel: it has character, it isn't perfect, and this feels good.

Of course, character alone does not make a good stay, and the staff were excellent, very helpful and patient in answering my questions about the area and such. Leading up to the trip, staff were very responsive to my emails about logistics.  Once there, we were able to use the guest computer to print our boarding passes, which made our long trip home that much easier.

We ate in the hotel restaurant, in the cellar--great ambience--where live Irish music played starting around 9pm.  From our room upstairs, the music could be heard faintly, really pleasant.

The bed must have been comfortable, because I don't remember it; I must have had a restful sleep!

We had to depart early to catch our flight, and I was concerned that we would miss the included buffet breakfast, but the front desk staff informed me that in summer, breakfast begins at 7:00 instead of 8:00, so we could partake after all.  We got to the dining room right about 7, and things were slow to start, as not all of the food was out. Coffee, tea and a few cereals and juices were available, but not much else.  In reality, things didn't really get rolling until about 7:30 when the hot food was ready.  The selection of lighter fare was limited, but you could get yourself a big hot meal of meats, eggs and toast, no problem.

All in all, our stay was very good and I would love to return to the Castle Hotel for a longer visit.",4,2015,07,22
229,"My Home is my Castle, when in Dublin Castle is my Home!","Stayed there on several occations, both as single and with groups I have brought to Dublin. They were as satisfied as me and say they will book at Castle if they come back again to Dublin. A house with a history and soul, quiet but conviniently located a stones throw from upper end of  O`Connell St.",4,2015,07,20
229,warm,"Lovely old hotel, bit of a trek back after a long day. Great food, lovely staff, my room was very warm but the staff were very accommodating and managed to get me a fan. Brilliant. I was a solo traveller and I was upgraded to a superior single (double bed)!",4,2015,07,16
229,"Massive room, great for a family","Traveled to Dublin with my three young kids and the room was massive.  It is an old school hotel, not a modern boutique.  The included breakfast had terrific selection and was good.  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  We had the biggest room in the hotel (used to be the bar).  The carpet had an slight odour of the days when smoking was allowed, but didn't bother us.  Overall good experience.",4,2015,07,14
229,Castle Hotel,"Pros: The hotel is very easy to find. From the airport take the Aircoach (12 euro round trip) which drops you off on O'Connell street - then it is a five minute walk. The staff was very helpful and quite nice. There is nightly music in the downstairs bar. The price was right and the bed was comfortable.

Cons: The furniture is very dated, the carpet needs replacing, it seemed dirty to me, but it could have just been the age of the decor. The shower is very small. The location was not ideal, although if you are considering a tour the buses all park in front of the Gresham Hotel, a five minute walk. I would have preferred being on the other side of the river near the historic sites, Temple Bar, Grafton Street. If you need your window open, the street noise is quite loud. The breakfast was horrible, although my husband ate it daily. 

I have very mixed feelings about the Castle. The people were quite nice, which made staying there comfortable. If the staff would have been below par, I would have rated this hotel very poorly.",3,2015,07,12
229,Cheap stay ,"Stayed here Monday to Thursday. Location is good for price we payed about 35 sterling pp pn including breakfast. Opposite Parnell square handy for tour bus just have to cross road. 

Too be fair can only fault a couple of things. Shower was tiny cubicle , not very powerful,  and quite difficult to gauge temperature  but we managed ok. And pillows were very thin.  Breakfast was to a good standard. 

Although we didn't use it car park at rear was €15 a night.

Where I can really really praise this hotel was the food in the vaults, excellent! For €20 I had 3 course meal .... nothing exceptional or fancy just really good food cooked to perfection! There were 6 in our party and no complaints or empty plates. Steak was 5 euro supplement but my Partner said it was worth it. Couldn't fault any of the staff either. 

I would stay again but would want better shower. But in the whole great little hotel for price.",3,2015,07,10
229,excellent accommodation,"It is near the center, but in peaceful place. The cuisine is simple but excellent. The rooms are a little small, but comfortable. The staff is very friendly. I enjoy to stay there.  Absolutely recommendable.",4,2015,07,10
229,Basic Hotel in Good Location,"This hotel on the northside of the Liffey, very close to the Gate Theater and other attractions, is nothing fancy (although the double rooms are a bit more luxurious than my single was) but it's clean, provides the basic amenities and everything works. I got a good price so felt it was a good value. Noise late at night/early morning was a bit of a problem.",3,2015,07,09
229,VERY PLEASANT HOTEL,"Stayed for 5 days, well located near principle shopping district. Plenty of pubs and restaurants within walking distance but also there is a pub in the basement which is very comfortable with good food and Guinness and there is traditional Irish live music most nights. Very professional staff. Only negative point was the Wi-Fi which was very unstable.",4,2015,07,09
229,Perfect,Recently  we attended  a concert and stayed at the Castle. In fact this was r 3rd stay. From the minute we arrived the staff were very helpful  with info on getting to and from concert. The room was very comfortable and I thought  the  bottled water left in room was a nice touch. Breakfast was hot with a good variety yo eat. Will b back.,5,2015,07,09
229,Moving on,"Returned in June for a 2nd stay at the Castle and was disappointed with my stay. I specifically requested a room at the back of the hotel, so we wouldn't hear the street noise and I was disappointed to get a room above the main street (O'Connell). I made the request months prior to our arrival. Also, the staff at the front desk couldn't be bothered with greeting us or wishing us a good day on our way out-so much for Irish hospitality.
On the plus side, there was a change in the breakfast location since my last visit a few years ago. There is now a bright, modern restaurant to dine in. The location is great for venturing out; lots to do nearby!",3,2015,07,08
229,Interesting historic labyrinth hotel,"The staff was professional, friendly, and helpful. One of the reception clerks told me a little about the history of the hotel - how it had been 2 hotels, and before that I think 8 different large homes. Staff also directed me to a local laundry that provided next day wash/dry/fold service at a great price. Dropped off a full bag!

The hotel is close to O'Connell Street and a nearby On-Off Bus Stop. About €20 to taxi to airport. There is also a play park (Mountjoy) nearby that the kids enjoyed.

The hotel is impressive and sprawling.There are staircases everywhere you look and room numbers give little indication as to where in the building you might actually be - until you figure out their system. I believe there are at least 2 lifts (one in each section that used to be 2 different hotels) - but they generally are not the quickest way to get to your room as there are many winding` halls and fire doors to adventure through en route to your room. 

There are several sitting rooms sprinkled around the hotel - 2 near reception, 1 in front of room 153, and I'm sure there were more I didn't locate!

Our family room (double with 2 singles) was room 217. Our room was on the 3rd or 4th floor and looked out at the Abbey Presbyterian Church and a fairly busy road. 

Good sized bathroom, but no ledge or shelf of any kind to put soap or shampoo in the shower. Very little shelf/ledge space near the sink either - as typical in European bathrooms. Beds were clean and comfortable with a nice chocolate each night, but the duvets seemed frayed at the end that tucks under.

While a pretty view, we had a LOT of road noise in the this room. Because there is no temperature control in the room, we left the one window open for air flow (it was June and the room was warm). Even with the thin single-pane window closed it could not block out the noise. This room is near a crosswalk and you could hear the beeping each time it was clear to walk, and each night a small group of people would gather on the street late in the evening (1am??) and make general noise that was disruptive to our sleep. I would recommend asking for a room overlooking the car park or a quieter road. 

Breakfast was great - with a wide variety available, including full Irish breakfast. Very busy if you go after 8:30, as they warn in the lift, but always managed to get a seat. 

We went down in the Vaults (converted wine cellar - now bar/restaurant) for live music Sunday night (9-11pm). It was a small crowd, but the artist, Daoiri Farrell, did a fantastic job! He had a beautiful voice and sang original and traditional music with storytelling. Great experience to introduce our son to a pub sing.

Overall enjoyed the stay and thought the history and charm of the hotel made up for some of the wear and tear that is evident in many areas.",4,2015,07,07
229,Very pleasant stay,"Part of a ""Stag weekend"" party, found this delightful hotel and excellent base for the weekend, very expensive but so is Dublin generally, excellent breakfast,  no complaints, would definitely stay here again,",4,2015,07,07
229,Nice Hotel,"This was my 5th time at hotel. Its very convenient for O Connell street.  The food in the bar is very good and the music nights are great. This time I noticed there was no complimentary water in my room as has been on other occasions, that's when I managed to get my room.  I arrived at 1.30pm and was told my room would not be ready till 2.30pm, okay that's fair enough I was so tired I waited. At 2.10pm the girl on reception haven't suddenly noticed I was still there sent another girl to check if the room was ready.  She came back at 2.20pm and never said a word so Im guessing its still not ready.  Other people were arriving and getting their rooms straightaway. At 2.35pm I stood up as I thought this is beyond a joke now. The girl on reception noticed me again and asked the other girl ""was the room ready"" ""Oh yes"" she said, so the girl on reception reached behind her and got my key. So it was ready all the while. I wish the reception staff would be more aware of customers booking in rather than having their eyes glued to the computer.",4,2015,07,05
229,Convenient with good restaurant,"Hotel is housed in a very old building. Our room was very clean, well appointed and quiet. Our bathroom was en suite and had a large tub.  However, we did have one issue.  The floor was so slanted that our headboard was below the foot of our bed.  Made for uncomfortable sleeping!
Breakfast was included with our room and while it was hearty, it was only fair.  Dinner in the restaurant was much better and we enjoyed two suppers there during our three night stay.
The hotel is very convenient to all the attractions, especially when traveling by bus.  I highly recommend using the hop on, hop off bus passes.",3,2015,07,03
229,Perfectly Adequate,"We stayed three nights in Dublin, and this hotel met our needs well.  Rooms ok, food ok, and decent location right on the bus line about a mile north of the river.  We enjoyed our stay, and probably would stay again if we return to Dublin.",3,2015,07,03
229,Fine for a 3 star hotel,"The decor of the hotel was the best part about our stay.  Be prepared to walk through a maze of halls and doorways. Unfortunately, our room was on the 4th floor during muggy times so sleep was difficult even with windows open.  The included Irish breakfast was plentiful but the food was just okay.  However, dinner at the Vault was quite good.  The 4th bed in our ""family"" room was a fold away cot. Our daughter, who can sleep anywhere, could not get comfortable due to the uneven surface.  In retrospect, we should have paid more for a better quality room to help us recover from our jet lag.",3,2015,07,01
229,"Castle Hotel, ok","Castle Hotel is located on Gardiner Row, Dublin 1, near e.g. Garden of Remembrance and not very far from O'Connell street. Staff was nice and rooms clean. Even though we were wondering the timing of cleaning the rooms. We were away till 2 o'clock in the afternoon and the room wasn't cleaned by then. Usually cleaning happened around 3 in the afternoon. And one thing that bothered me one day, was that we had Do not disturb -sign on our door and still cleaner had went in and taken the sign off the door.

We had booked a room for two, but our room had a twin bed and a single bed. The twin bed wasn't very wide and had only one blanket, so it was actually great that we could take a second blanket from the single bed.

Our window was to inner court, so the view wasn't so great and we had to keep the curtains closed. Gladly there wasn't much commotion in the inner court. One night someone had puked on the hotel's hallway on the carpeting, so the smell was horrible quite long. Of course that wasn't hotel's fault.

For breakfast there was of course full irish breakfast (with beans, black&white pudding, sausages and so on) with some cereals, toast and juices. I just wish there would have been something to put on the toast apart from butter and jelly, like some fresh cucumber or something.

Hotel also has it's own restaurant and there's music nights also. We had bought a voucher for a 3-course meal for the restaurant, but we were a bit disappointed that we could only choose from the early bird menu which hasn't got that much choices. Food was ok though.

So, all in all, locationwise hotel is nice and there's not much partying going on, so your sleep won't be disturbed. Rooms are clean and staff is helpful. I'm not sure if I'd go there again, but the hotel is ok.",3,2015,06,30
229,1st to Dublin,"Wonderful, friendly staff. The food was amazing, will definitely be going back.
Spent a few days there at the start of our trip around Ireland and a week at the end. Great location, only issue would be the on-site parking.",4,2015,06,30
229,Not the perfect place!,"I have read the reviews on this hotel and can only agree with the poor/terrible ones. The pros are that its close to everything to do in Dublin. The cons are the hotel needs to be updated, when we left the hotel they said we had to leave our room keys at the desk which we did not do. Our room was above the bar so we could hear everything thru the paper thin walls. The room seemed dirty, the bathroom was small, I am 6' 1"" and did not fit in the shower due to the low ceiling. The staff was ok, the breakfast was ok but there was nothing that exceeded my expectations for the cost of the room. We stayed in four different hotel on our trip and this one by far was the worst.",2,2015,06,28
229,Good Hotel. ,"Stayed for 3 nights last week. 

Hotel is up the street from O'connell Street, so head right if dropped off by the 747 airport bus. 

Hotel was pleasant with very good front of house staff, breakfast is included and very filling but get down early to avoid the rush! 

There is a safe locked room to leave your luggage if you have an early flight in or a late flight home. 

Music in the downstairs bar is from 9pm.

Some people have said there's a lot of street noise but it was quiet for a city centre in my opinion. 

A good place to stay. ",5,2015,06,28
229,Great Hotel to Stay,"I stayed 5 nights at the Castle Hotel in a Family Room.  The staff made ready and let us in early to the room after an all night flight from the US.  The room was large, clean and quiet.  The breakfast was good, and we ate all of our dinners there.  The staff was friendly, helpful, courteous.  Couldn't ask for more.",5,2015,06,27
229,A perfect location!,"Once we found it, Castle Hotel was a perfect location for our grand whirlwind tour of this beautiful city. It was a close walk to Murray's Pub and the hop in hop off bus we used to tour. Temple Bar was a nice walk to dinner and back.

The included breakfast was a great way to start each day. 

There was nighttime street noise that got kinda loud and one night there was a fight on the sidewalk around 11:00 that got ugly...and bloody. 

The Castle Hotel was our first stay in Dublin. We were here for 3 nights and we'd stay here again. 

Warning: car park is REALLY tight.",4,2015,06,25
229,Perfect stay,"Cute quaint hotel sprawling though old building, We stayed here 2 nights in a twin share room. Lovely comfortable room with great space. Very clean. Tea and coffee making facilities. Bathroom great. Fabulous location, easy to walk to the tour busses and into the city. Breakfast fresh and plentiful.",5,2015,06,25
229,Dublin weekend,"Lovely hotel, friendly staff and great location very near the centre. Breakfast was very nice and they organised breakfast for our early checkout, you just need to ask at reception. Rooms are very comfortable and include hairdryer, toiletries and tea and coffee making facilities. I would definitely book this hotel again.",5,2015,06,24
229,Very welcoming hotel,"My family of 3 and I stayed at this hotel during a short visit to Dublin on 16-17 June.  We loved the character of the historic building. The complimentary Irish breakfast was very good. We had a 3 course dinner at the hotel and it exceeded our expectations (included a free Irish coffee, too). The nightly music was great! The location of the hotel is good, though you will do some walking to sites (or take the bus, which is right outside hotel). Dublin is a very busy city so we thought it would be better to be near the sites, but slightly off the direct path. The customer service at the hotel was excellent.  Our first night we were placed in a spacious and beautiful room with floor to ceiling Georgian style windows overlooking the street and adjacent cathedral (room 151).  Although it was a nice room, the street noise (buses, revelers) kept me up all night.  Without hesitation, the hotel staff moved us to a room at the back of the hotel and I had a much better sleep the following night (room 332).  ",4,2015,06,21
229,Dublin for a day,"My family of four with two teens came in on a very early flight from the states.  Took a cab to the Castle Hotel.  Staff was friendly at that early time and helped us store our luggage.  Had breakfast at the hotel and was very good. Full Irish with other options.  Room was satisfactory.  Basically four single beds, with two pushed together.  Traffic noise very loud until 11 PM, then quiet rest of night.  Overall, an older hotel, well taken care of, but due for an update.  Great staff, very helpful.",4,2015,06,19
229,Irish Hospitality,"My girlfriend paid for a birthday weekend in dublin of course weekend of Scots game but no worries. A couple of things of note. The breakfast did not live up to the friendly reception. The great food and music in the bar. That harmonic playing sublime or the friendliness of the bar staff especially a blonde haired girl who looked after our food order.  The best was we were leaving
 I think herself had all of carrolls stores in the suitcases and they were loaded. Some gentleman in a beard offered to help me with the bags and out they went. I dont know if he worked there, was just passing or touting for business, he had a 1916 Rising Tour t shirt on him. Maybe it was our lucky day but it was just this simple act of kindness that made the trip so enjoyable. Kudos friend",5,2015,06,17
229,Business,"Conveniently located for central Dublin, the hotel is  on a busy main road junction . As such the room, a family room  on the second floor was very noisy until very late at night and from the early hours. The windows are typical Georgian sash and offer little sound insulation particular as they are in general poor repair. The room was also in need of a general update with ill fitted carpet and pealing wallpaper.

Breakfast was reasonable although was very busy and difficult to find a seat at times with the Irish breakfast being served  from one point which leads to queue 's",3,2015,06,16
229,Great stay,"Stayed at the Castle for three nights and enjoyed every minute. First floor South facing rooms were a bit warm and a bit noisy but more than made up for by the good food and friendly service. 5 minutes from O'Connell Street and 15 minutes to Temple Bar. Highlight for us was the evening entertainment in the Cellar bar at the Castle,  especially Alan Dee...  Great voice and excellent guitar playing,  wonderful! ",5,2015,06,11
229,"Good hotel,  within walking distance of main attractions! Nice rooms, excellent breakfast!","This hotel is within a 10minute walk of main attractions including temple bar, trinity college, grafton street, and dublin castle. Also a stones throw away from a number of literary museums. 
Rooms are nice, decor is clean and well maintained. Lovely bathroom will all necessities included. Rooms on a higher floor are better, as live music on certain nights may be loud on ground floors. All rooms can be accessed by stairs or lift, and they will help you with your luggage if you ask.
The breakfast was fantastic, full irish breakfast along with cereal, fruit,yoghurt, pastries etc. 
The aircoach bus from the airport, stops a 5 min walk from the hotel on O'Connell street, probably the easiest way to get from the airport to the hotel. Buses for all attractions further out of the city stop on this street as well, guinness storehouse bus no.123 takes you straight to the attraction from here. Staff are very helpful with all the info for this as well. But bear in mind you don't need to get the hop on hop off bus to the Guinness storehouse if you don't want to, there is a regular public bus for a couple of euro which will take you there.",4,2015,06,08
229,Extremely friendly and accommodating staff lovely hotel ,"We thought our street facing room too noisy and asked another room. 
They immediately took care of us and found us a bigger quieter room at same price. No problem 
Dinner and Irish music entertainment was excellent and authentic. Breakfast was a bit chaotic with large numbers of guests but handled well and with a smile. Parking inside internal courtyard requires a lot of skill and patience unless you are driving a mini car. It's tight. 
Price was reasonable and included a great breakfast. The wheaten bread is almost best ever 
Highly recommend ",4,2015,06,05
229,Amazing hotel,"From the moment we walked through the door we were absolutely amazed. Stunning hotel and absolutely perfect room. Booked into a twin room and we were amazed at the space and we even had a bath! Breakfast was self service and fills you up for the majority of the day. Reception staff are as friendly as could be and no task is too much. Even had the chance to meet the owner, lovely irish man who we both loved. Over all, best hotel I've stayed in.",5,2015,06,04
229,Good Location - Sensibly Priced,"On a first visit to Dublin stayed a couple of nights in  this atmospheric and very pleasant hotel. No more than a few minutes from O'Connell Street, the room was excellent as were the staff.
Breakfast set you up for the day and the Bar in the cellar served food and had live music.
For value this has to be a very good choice.
Note as it is quite an old building, there are nooks and crannies and small amounts of stairs linking parts of the same floor - where it could become a little difficult for less mobile visitors.",4,2015,06,04
229,Overpriced and run-down,"Day one– leak on bathroom floor, broken tiles, light over sink was out, inadequate heat. Next morning- The breakfast certainly was ample, though the fruit was canned, but the crowding of large numbers of people made it feel a bit like a zoo.
Day two - moved to another room, to find that the curtains did not close (they were off their hooks) and though now we had heat, the walls in the new room were particularly thin – we hear the man next door snoring all night.  In the morning the shower door does not close properly. All of this would be tolerable for 50 or 60 euro, but at 140 and 160 euro this is a joke. Though everyone is very nice, it seems no one (certainly not the owner) really cares enough to keep the property running well.  We won’t be back.",2,2015,06,04
229,Lovely hotel,"Stayed 2 nights in this lovely hotel just a 2 minute walk from O'Connell Street.  Staff were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble.  Room with en suite was clean and comfy - slept like a log both nights.  Cooked breakfast set us up for a day's sightseeing. We ate in the hotel once during our stay - food was lovely but did lack a choice of veggie options.  Entertainment on the first night was not great but Ray Cox certainly made up for it the following evening, entertaining everyone will Irish folk songs.  Would definitely stay here again",5,2015,06,03
229,A piece of past,"The Castle Hotel is a small piece past from the medivial age. It is a cozy and comfortable place very close to the central part of Dublin. You can get anywhere easily by walking, there are no big distances for the top sights. It is a perfect hotel to have a good dinner and rest after an all day long walk. A lot of pubs and shops surround it. The crew is really kind and nice, you feel yourself as a princess in a real castle.",4,2015,06,02
229,"Stunning hotel, great location, great staff","Just spent 4 wonderful days at this beautiful hotel. The attentive staff were brilliant, full of local knowledge. Whether it's buses, restaurants, pubs or places to see, they had the answers and a smile. 
The hotel is full of character and has a lovely feel to it. It was immaculately clean too, and after lots of walking we were glad we had comfy beds to rest our weary legs. ",5,2015,05,31
229,great hotel,"Clean and comfortable hotel close to city centre, great nightly entertainment in cellar
 bar, breakfast was spoilt by cold plates and hard wooden seats. Reception and breakfast room staff are first class.",4,2015,05,28
229,"Great hotel, charming home from home.",Great stay in this hotel. Really charming inside with Georgian décor and touches throughout. Excellent location too. Staff very friendly. Met the owner who is a typical Irish character - larger than life. We would definitely stay again. very clean too and good breakfast and lovely restaurant food.,5,2015,05,26
229,Gem in the heart of Dublin,"Look no further than the Castle hotel for the perfect place bed down and discover Dublin. Situated just off O'Connell Street it is within walking distance to hop on/hop off buses. the shopping areas and a host of other dublin sights. An original georgian house that the owner added on to, it boasts excellent food in the vaults restaraunt with music most nights. A warm welcome awaits you by the friendly staff",5,2015,05,24
229,Run while you can!,"We spent 2 weeks in Europe, just having returned yesterday This was by far the worst hotel we stayed in by a landslide. First, the receptionist had absolutely no personality whatsoever.  Our room was just up three steps from the lobby, with large windows that faced the outside smoking area.  it was loud and stinky. the room itself was small, beds very uncomfortable with very thin mattresses and what appeared to be cardboard boxes instead of boxsprings. the bathroom was an after thought, clearly added to the room. One would think this to be a benefit. the bathroom was tiny, with a half circle shower that had little space to move in. the bathroom ceilings had black mold in every corner and around the edges.  the breakfast was ample but disgusting.  the servers wore vinyl gloves to serve the cold food (scrambled eggs, hash browns,bacon) instead of using utensils.  there was a broken window in the front door of the hotel where breakfast was served. Never again will we stay at this hotel.  Run while you can!  FYI: we stayed at another hotel, for less money and with much more to offer including comfort, cleanliness and great food/service.",1,2015,05,22
229,Castle hotel Denmark street,"The castle hotel reviewed is the one on Denmark street off Connelly street dublin so apologies.  My review came up for a different castle hotel in dublin
It is a beautiful Georgian hotel as described in my review where all the staff are friendly, helpful and professional.  
We are planning our return trip for later this year",4,2015,05,21
229,Live music most nights,"After a day of walking all over Dublin, it was nice to return to the hotel to refresh and then just go downstairs for dinner and stick around for live Irish pub music. Ray Cox was the musician playing several times during the week we stayed there and he put on a very enjoyable show. The beds were comfortable. Although the bathroom was small, it was modern and clean. The desk staff were very helpful in providing information about tours, etc.",5,2015,05,19
229,One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in!,"I booked a single room for six nights on my own, primarily for price and location.  Based on the price, I wasn't expecting too much, so my first impression when I entered reception completely blew my expectations out of the water, and it only got better from there.

Although I booked a single room, the room was very spacious and had a double bed and ensuite bathroom including a bath and shower (maybe this is an advantage of booking ten months in advance?)  The room also included a flat screen TV, kettle, hairdryer, desk, chairs and wardrobe.  The beds were made neatly every day and chocolates were left on the pillows.  I never used the TV or kettle, so I can't say anything about those.  The toilet flush was very slightly broken; the mechanism would hit the lid of the tank when pressed hard, but didn't really cause a problem.

Since I'm a light sleeper, I requested preference for a quieter room and had a window overlooking a car park at the back of the hotel, so I wasn't disturbed by outside noise from the main street at the front.   Sleep was fine; the hotel was always very quiet at night.  In the morning beyond 07:30, I could often hear ambient noise from other rooms as other guests were getting up, but I was always awake by then anyway, so this wasn't a problem for me, but it's worth considering if you're a late sleeper.

The breakfast every morning was fantastic!  There's a whole lot to choose from, but the full Irish Breakfast is especially worth mentioning as a great way to start a day of visiting Dublin's many tourist attractions.  This was one of the best hotel breakfasts I've ever had and was filling enough to let me skip lunch on some days.

The hotel has a bar and restaurant downstairs called the Castle Vault, which I visited a few times during my stay.  I had dinner at the Castle Vault twice; the food was decent and filling and there's a good choice on the menu.  On Saturday night, I also decided to make a short visit to the Castle Vault just for the live entertainment, during which there was a guy singing and playing guitar and harmonica, doing a mix of different kinds of music, including covers of popular songs, as well as some very funny comical songs and some to sing along to.  The night was very entertaining and more fun than some of the pubs I've seen recommended in the city center.

One morning as I was leaving the hotel, I also met the owner at reception.  He's a great guy and clearly takes pride in the hotel; a very articulate and charismatic man; he even gave me a small personal tour of the hotel, showing me some of the less obvious rooms, like the large quiet lounge where guests can sit and relax.  Later, I also went to explore the hotel on my own, which could be a tourist attraction in it's own right - I literally spent 30 minutes wandering the dozens of corridors, corners, staircases and doors; there's all kinds of little hidden features to find.  For example, in one obscure corner near the top of the hotel was an old antique Zenith radio just standing there, seemingly for no other purpose than to be found by explorers like me!

The hotel is located north of the city center; you'll need to walk for around ten minutes and cross the river to get to the main center where most of the tourist attractions, shops and bars are located, although there is also a shopping street north of the river that's a little closer to the hotel.  There were (much more expensive looking) hotels closer to the center, but I was very happy with the location.

Overall, I just can't really fault the Castle Hotel.  In recent years, I've stayed in Hotels in Amsterdam, London, Rome, Den Haag and a few others, all of which were more expensive than the Castle Hotel and yet, the Castle Hotel beats all of them hands down.  I absolutely wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if I visit Dublin.

One last thing to note:  I noticed some reviews mention leaving room keys at reception when you leave the hotel.  No-one at the hotel ever told me about this policy and I was never asked to leave my keys when leaving the hotel, so I always took my keys with me.  So I don't know if maybe the hotel no longer operates this policy?

Anyway, I would definitely recommend the Castle Hotel.",5,2015,05,19
229,Nice and quiet hotel,"The hotel is located close to city centre so location is a big plus. Room was spacious and very clean with tv, kettle etc and big bathroom. We came just for 2days to visit Dublin and it was definitely worth it as the the price of the room(incl breakfast) was very low compare to other hotels. Would recommend it to couples.",4,2015,05,19
229,Very good stay,Very nice hotel staff very helpful .Room nice food good i would certainly recommend this hotel  for a visit to Dublin The lady's on days on the front desk are very helpful with trip and thing to do we would go back if we go to Dublin again,5,2015,05,18
229,A poor night's sleep,"Had two terrible nights in this hotel.  Our room was on the top floor and overlooked a busy road.  The room was very hot at night but the noise from the road was too loud with the windows shut so could not open them to get any air.  The floorboards were unbelievably squeaky.  Throughout the night we heard everyone as they walked passed our room and also a fire door was banged shut by each passer by.  Normally I sleep well but not in this hotel.  The decor was outdated and the toilet didn't flush properly.  Breakfast was fine, and location was good except for being on the noisy main road.",2,2015,05,18
229,A lovely central hotel,"The hotel looks so tiny from the outside but its so big on the inside!  The rooms have so much space, especially the wet room our room had, it meant you didn't have to squeeze into a tiny space like in some hotels! 

I would recommend trying the restaurant, the food is so lovely and there is live music, definitely look up Alan Dale, he takes requests and is really really good.

The breakfast in the morning is sometimes a bit busy and they offer you a seat downstairs, it sounds like a bad thing but its far better than the main dining room, you get hot food to your table and there is less competition for the other food types (of which there are many!)",5,2015,05,18
229,"Good hotel, Central for Dublin","Arrived early morning, was able to leave luggage and go and look round this remarkably friendly city. Got to room at 6.30pm, very comfortable. Next morning breakfast was available early, 7.20am when we got in. Breakfast was a good choice of items all nice and warm / hot, if you wanted you could fill up on this and get through most of day, but personally too much and I feel tired and slow so not been greedy before a 2 hour + bike ride around Phoenix park.",5,2015,05,17
229,Lovely hotel perfectly located,"If you like super modern impersonal hotels this is not for you.  It is made up of numerous georgean houses and the reception lobby is furnished appropriately.  Bedrooms are fine perhaps a little dated but very clean and with comfortable beds.  Our room was on the first floor overlooking a busy road so a little noise but we both slept well, also being an old building there is a little noise from other rooms, not
 too bad but somebody decided to have a bath at 5am and that woke
 us both.  We ate in the restaurant and the food was nice and the 
breakfast is excellent and seved in a lovely bright room, sparkling 
clean as is all the hotel.   Staff are very friendly and helpful.  Only thing I could see being a problem is that the rooms are very warm and, at least in our room, there was no opening window.  As it turned out it was chilly for May so not a problem for us however it could be in July or August.  We would go back there without hesitation.",4,2015,05,16
229,Recommended,"I revisited Dublin after 10 years,  I can certainly recommend The Castle Hotel for its location cleanliness and food. The room was perfectly functional and the bathroom spotlessly clean. Just a couple of things that needed slight attention which was an unsecured plug socket and a dodgy wall light but that didn't spoil anything. Breakfasts will satisfy any diets and was plentyfull. Staff are very approachable and nothing is too much trouble, I would definatly stop there again",5,2015,05,15
229,Nice Hotel,"Booked this hotel for a ""Gentlemen's weekend"" so triple single beds good value for central Dublin. (Would not say it is suitable for a boisterous stag do by the way) Nice hotel with lots of character and individual feel. Not too corporate. Staff helpful and friendly. Room nice and big with comfy beds. Good breakfast.
Great location, walking distance to Temple Bar. We actually walked to the Guinness Brewery although that was a bit of a trek.
Only criticism is that traffic quite noisy, but that's what you get in a 200+ year old single glazed building in Central Dublin! Might want to ask for a room at the back if you're a light sleeper.",4,2015,05,12
229,Fabulous time at the Castle Hotel,"We spent 4 days/3 nights at this lovely Georgian hotel just 2 minutes walk from the city centre. The bedroom and bathroom were clean and spacious, the food was of a very high standard and the staff were so polite and helpful all the time including booking taxis for us and also a traditional Irish night at a local pub. I would highly recommend The Castle Hotel to anyone and would stay there again in a heartbeat. It was lovely to be treated so well by everyone.",5,2015,05,09
229,Wonderful,"I stayed here with my friend and it was so lovely. So close to town and a gorgeous hotel. Check in and out was incredibly easy and everyone was so friendly. My only fault I could find of the whole hotel was that the bed was a little firm! Such a lovely place with so much to look at, even in the hotel! And there's a gorgeous rememberance garden right outside. 
Perfect hotel with a lovely price!",4,2015,05,07
229,Everything you need,A lovely clean hotel in a good location for exploring Dublin. The food was good and good value.  The staff could not be more helpful and friendly. The rooms were a good size and nicely decorated. Parts of the hotel were quirky and the decor of the rooms fitted them well. It was nice to have music in the evenings but it was abit disappointing.,5,2015,05,06
229,Traditional Irish Hotel + Great LOcation,"Stayed here with my girlfriend over the bank holiday weekend and the staff were very nice to me from the moment we walked into the hotel. They greeted us well and helped us out whenever necessary, whilst also booking taxi's for us wherever we wanted to go too. Breakfast was lovely on both days and the staff made sure we were seated within 2-3 minutes of arriving at the kitchen area. High recommended for the location as well, 2 minute walk from the top of the high street of Dublin area with lots of shops and entertainment very close together. Top trip, made better by the hotel",5,2015,05,05
229,Beautiful old world hotel,"I am from Dublin, now living in Canada. I have stayed in the Castle for two years running, I will be returning every year, from now on, if they keep up the level of service I received. The staff is awesome. The breakfast is very well done (My cardiologist might not agree) Nice little pub in the basement. with live music most nights. There is also a restaurant in the basement. The food is on a par with anything, I have ever experienced before. The prices are very good. 25.00 Euro for a three course meal, with an Irish coffee or a Baileys shot included! The WIFI in the rooms is very strong. Being in the city center, means no car rental needed.

Get yourself a leapfrog card which is good for the bus, the Lewis and the Dart. If you’re looking for real character in a place to stay, this is it.",5,2015,04,28
229,Charming place in a good location,"This hotel was situated near O'Connell street, which meant quite a few restaurants and shops are just a walking distance away, as well as the meeting point for many tour buses.

It had a certain charm to it, which is probably due to the fact it hasn't been completely modernised and is something a little different. The staff were friendly and helpful, even letting me rent an adapter since I forgot to pack one suitable for Ireland. Breakfast was rather decent, although not necessarily noteworthy either. 

The room was a decent size (solo traveller) and had everything I needed. The bed was big and comfortable. Only thing is that the floors tend to creak, so if you're a light sleeper that could become irritating. Also, the street below can be rather noisy at times, but normally it wasn't too bad after a certain time, especially with a closed window. 

Overall, this hotel wasn't bad at all. If you're someone who's looking to be closer to the action, it may not be completely suitable- Temple Bar is a bit of a further walk away, and I noticed there's quite a few hotels/hostels in Temple Bar itself which looked pretty good for my next trip!",3,2015,04,28
229,Well worth considering ,"So long as you know what to expect this hotel should be recommended. It's Georgian. It's a number of properties joined together. The original features remain. 

It's not a modern build with identical rooms. Instead it's a interesting maze of stairs and corridors. Some floorboards creak, as do some doors. The walls are not perfectly soundproofed, so you can hear a little from the next room and you can hear plumbing when other rooms are using it.

The room I was in only had one socket. A bit tight if you have things to charge. 

My room was at the front of the hotel. I was kept awake by the sound of the pedestrian crossing on the first night so had to close the window.
On the positive side the location is excellent. The staff are excellent and knowledgable. The breakfast was excellent and we also had a very good lunch there..
Also,so nice that the owner took time to chat to people in the restaurant. 

I'd certainly go back. But don't go if you just want a modern, hermetically sealed room. The hotel had character and charm. Very clean, comfortable and welcoming. 
",4,2015,04,27
229,Very warm Irish welcome,"My daughter and I have just spent two nights at this hotel. All the staff were exceptionally helpful. Very close to O'Connell Street and tour buses, but just as easy to walk twenty minutes over the Liffey to Temple Bar, Trinity College etc. Breakfast was very good. Would definitely stay here again.",4,2015,04,25
229,Great location and lovely restaurant.,We stayed in a family room whilst on a short break in Dublin.  The room was amazing with a double bed and 3 single beds in the room and a separate lounge area.  The hotel staff were very helpful and the food in the restaurant was excellent.  Very close to O'Connell street and within walking distance to the Temple Bar area.,5,2015,04,25
229,Great 3-star hotel,"Breakfast = Amazing! Couldn't fault it in any way. Very delicious food and always hot. The Irish definitely know how to fill you up.

Room = Plenty of character. Shower was awesome to wake you up in the morning. Some of the plugs didn't have switches and therefore didn't work too good. When we mentioned that the radiator wouldn't turn off someone from maintenance sorted it out straight away.

Staff = Seemed pleasant enough although they didn't always greet you as you entered and left the building. A simple good morning, etc. would have definitely brightened up our day. They did always appear to be busy though so I can't fault them for their hard work.

On the whole this was a great hotel just outside of the main Dublin-hub and we would definitely stay here again. Well done Castle Hotel! Keep up the great work.",4,2015,04,20
229,simply perfect,"The castle is perfectly situated for all the Dublin attractions , the reception staff were very helpful and advised us on several of our trips, the food was exceptional especially the evening meals,the breakfast area is fine but can get busy but, there are signs around the hotel making you aware of the busier times which we found great , got a table every morning with no fuss or standing in line.I have to make a special mention about Paul down in the vaults bar!!...cracking lad and very easy to get on with made our stay even more perfect....live entertainment great aswell....will be back before the year is out.",5,2015,04,19
229,nice place to stay in Dublin - ein tolles Hotel,"To me and to my boyfriend, a hotel with good quality in every way and sense. Very comfortable and close to everything in town (o`connell street, pubs, museums, shoppings...). The staff were helpful and atenttive all the time. I have no complaints at all.

Tolles Hotel, super Lage und ausgezeichneter Service.",5,2015,04,18
229,Great experience,First time visiting Ireland and stayed at the Castle Hotel.Hotel was clean and convenient to town.Staff was great but Andrew and Pat were exceptional!They were so helpful and professional.They are both great representatives for the hotel.I would recommend this hotel.,5,2015,04,16
229,Weekend in Dublin,"After staying at the Wicklow Mountains with some friends we spent the final night of our trip at the Castle Hotel in Dublin. The hotel is located only a short walk from most of the main great spots of Dublin. If you hire a car be advised that the car park entrance is to the side and not immediately obvious. It was by far the smallest hotel car park I have ever seen and the path way into the car park is very narrow, so be careful!!!!

The hotel lobby is nice enough and there was always a member of staff on duty to help us with any enquiries, although I don't think I saw any of them smile once. 

The hotel room is small but more than adequate, and the shower room was fairly cold (which my friends also complained about).

We spent the evening in the downstairs bar/restaurant, which was lovely with some lovely food and live music. Breakfast was included in the price and have to say that this was of a very good quality. 

Overall, I would recommend this hotel and would consider staying here again when next in Dublin.",4,2015,04,16
229,Pleasant Georgian hotel very close to the city centre,"We really could not fault this hotel for location or character.  We stayed for two nights following a walking holiday in the SW of Ireland before flying back to the UK.  The hotel has a quaint bar facility in the basement, on the first night live Irish music was well received and the drinks were reasonable priced too.  The room was a little smaller than desirable but very clean and comfy.  The breakfast was tasty and plentiful but I have to say the organisation in the breakfast room could be improved.   We would certainly stay again - thank you.",5,2015,04,13
229,Great Hotel!,"My stay at The Castle Hotel was extremmely pleasant.  Denise, Susan, and Genevieve or Genny (I hope that's her name) were very helpful and professional.  The hotel is in an excellent location---transportation to and from the airport, attractions, restaurants, etc.  My bed was super comfortable and everything was clean, tidy, and nicely decorated.  Will stay at this hotel again for sure when in Dublin.  Oh, and the breakfast was nice, too.  The dining area was so nicely decorated that it made breakfast even more perfect.",5,2015,04,12
229,"Great location, excellent room, friendly staff and breakfasts to set you up for the day","Stayed here for 2 nights at the end of Easter weekend.  We are a family of 4 and were given room 220.  This is 2 good sized rooms with a door opening between the two and a jack and jill style shower room in the middle.  The room was excellent.  Comfy beds, plenty of space, chocolates on the pillows when we arrived  and flat screen TVs if you like them!  The room is adjacent to the stairs which it has to be said were rather creaky but it is an older building so this is to be expected.  Likewise there was some traffic noise but again this is to be expected in a city centre location.  The room format gave us all some space and privacy.  There are several seating areas around the hotel should you prefer to sit and read at times - I must admit we were out and about a fair bit in the city so didn't take advantage of them.  There's plenty of useful info regarding trips and things to see and the staff are friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was great - served in a modern café style breakfast room even when it was busy we never waited more than a minute or so.  There was plenty of choice - juice, cereal, yogurt, and the full cooked option.  One point for improvement would be for  the chef serving the cooked food to use different tongs for meat and non meat products. This quite rightly is important to the vegetarian in our family. I asked about this one morning and the chef happily rectified the issue but it was back to normal after that again!",5,2015,04,12
229,"Good hotel, great location ","Really enjoyed our visit to Dublin and stay in this hotel.  Location of hotel, helpfulness of staff,  rooms, breakfast and cafe next door all great. Really accessible and lots to do in the area.   Only about 15 mins in taxi to the airport.  ",4,2015,04,09
229,Good all round hotel,"Stayed here for 6 nights this Easter (2015). 
Good news- the breakfast is very good; it is self service cereals, bread cheese, toast etc. Then a very good quality cooked Irish breakfast, tea and coffee brought to table.
The breakfast room itself is really nice and not at all like the 'chain hotels'. Please note that if you arrive at peak time of breakfast, you may have to go downstairs to another room to eat. It's ok, but we really didn't want eat in there more than once, its just not as nice and you have to wait to get served by very busy staff.
Another good point is the location - just at the far end of O'Connell Street is perfect for everything in Dublin. A few seconds away from bus stops, main street, and good restaurants. But far enough away from traffic to be quiet and peaceful.
Good atmosphere in the hotel and reception staff are totally professional and helpful.
The room we had was a reasonable size with a good solid bed (double as opposed to king though) and was always clean and tidy. Bathroom was fine and water for the bath fills up really quickly (I hate it when a bath takes hours to fill). Word of warning....do not let a child do it themselves as the hot water really is scalding hot. (a plus point in my opinion but I wouldn't let a toddler wander in the bathroom with the hot tap running)
So, what are the less than good points about the hotel?
Well, as it is Georgian, you get a few uneven creaky corridor floors, some very creaky stairs and a few plumbing noises. There's a plug socket broken in dining room and ceiling cables here and there.
You can hear people speaking in adjoining rooms and occasional noise from car park but overall it is good for light sleepers.
It feels a little crowded in the dinning and breakfast rooms and the tables are a bit close together.
The bar is good, with music most nights. The food in the downstairs restaurant is ok but I would recommend far better places to eat in town before this one.
So, overall, if the price is right and you are not super fussy then this is great value and it has a great feel to it.",4,2015,04,06
229,Can't beat the location,"I spent five nights here at the end of March/beginning of April. Usually I go for cheaper establishments, but the combination of a special rate and the hotel’s proximity to the city center prompted me to spring for this, and I’m very glad I did. 

If you consult Google Maps, you’ll see that the hotel is about a five minute walk from upper O’Connell Street. To me, it’s the ideal location: you’re within an easy walk of key tourist attractions (here I’m defining easy as 30 minutes or less), but the area itself is quiet so you can escape the noise and crowds. Or at least that was true when I visited. It’s also near a city bus stop and the Hop On, Hop Off stop. Hotel staff can arrange a cab but it’s simple enough to do yourself by phone or online if you don’t feel like walking down to the taxi queue in O’Connell Street (only about 5 – 10 minutes away, but if you’re lumping a lot of luggage, you may prefer to arrange one).

The building itself is charming, though like all structures of this period it has certain quirks. For instance, as noted in some other reviews, boards creak when people talk through or close doors, and the water in the pipes was quite loud when the person next door to me showered. There’s just no getting around that in a building of this age. However, I found my fellow travelers to be generally considerate and not noisy after hours. I’m not so light a sleeper that that sort of thing bothers me. Also, when booking, I requested a quiet room, and I found it to be so. There was very little noise from the alley below.

Another thing to consider with a building of this age is accessibility. If you have mobility concerns, you’ll want to confer with the hotel before committing to a booking. For instance, there are a few steps from the street into the main door of the house, but there may be another easier way in. There is a lift inside, but you may have to cope with interior steps. To get to my room (226) from the lift, I had to go up two broad steps then down seven steps – no problem for me, but some may find that an extra challenge. That said, I noticed that there were three or four rooms on that floor that would not have required negotiating these steps; also, other floors may be structured differently. My room itself was a bit tight, not manageable in a wheelchair but perhaps possible for someone using a cane. The bathroom had a shower only with a door that folded inwards – not sure one could squeeze a bath stool in there, but at least it had a small rail. 

As for the bathroom, the pressure in the pipes was fine. Having stayed in buildings of a similar period both in Ireland and mainland Europe, I’d rate it better than average though obviously not near what you’d get in a modern structure. Plenty of hot water, though. Towels were fine. Amenities included bar soap and a combo bath gel/shampoo. The latter did the job, but I found it a bit drying for my hair after a few days. It had a masculine scent that I quite liked but didn’t stick.

I live in a warm climate and am quite sensitive to cold, but the room was wonderfully warm at night thanks both to the thick duvet and heater. But you’ll want to bring some lotion to counteract the effects of the dry air on your skin.

The bed was quite comfortable and the work area that served as a desk was fine. Some of the outlets are inconveniently placed, but those at the desk were okay, which was the most important thing to me. A hair dryer is provided as is a flat screen TV.

The room came with a large electric kettle and packets of tea, instant coffee, sugar, and milk which were restocked each day. Coffee was a combination of regular and decaf. Got a small chocolate every day and biscuits twice, once on arrival and again on day four.

WiFi was reliable but sluggish. No problems with it cutting out but some websites were very slow to load. I never bothered with anything like streaming video or Skype, but I imagine the experience would be similarly slow. For my needs -- catching up on email and consulting websites to find out about local attractions -- the service was adequate.

No safe in the room but there is a safe deposit box downstairs, and staff were quite happy to have me drop off then pick up my tablet every day. However, there is a time restriction on when you can retrieve your items. I can’t recall the hours but they’ll tell you when you drop it off. 

Breakfast may or may not be included so check your booking carefully. I ate there three of the five mornings I was there, and it was good. The coffee, to my pleasant surprise, was great.

Staff, by the way, were lovely, very helpful and happy to chat on those rare occasions when they had a minute to spare. Generally, they’re quite busy. I also had the good fortune to bump into the proprietor one afternoon. He’s a delight to talk to and embodies all your lovely stereotypes of the Irish – charming, clever, and possessed of an ability to make you feel like he’s thrilled to talk to you. Any hotelier should hold such qualities, but they’re all the better when expressed in an Irish accent.

My only compliant – and it is a very small one – stems from the last day of my stay when I was in the room and someone came by just to check that everything was all right. The small problem was that she knocked then opened the door without waiting for an answer. Fortunately, I was about to leave and thus dressed, so she was spared seeing me in my underwear as I normally would’ve been at the time. However, that was a very small thing indeed and she was apologetic. If that's the worst one can say about a place, things are in good shape indeed.

All in all, I had a great time and will definitely consider staying there again on my next trip to Dublin.",5,2015,04,04
229,Traditional hotel with a lot of personality,"I have stayed in many different hotels in Dublin before, and the Castle Hotel has the most ""personality"" of them all. It is an old hotel with squeeqy floors and stairs, the romms are old-fashioned but very good and the whole athmosphere in the hotel made me feel very welcome and relaxed. We was 10 colleagues staying here for business, and we all really enjoyed it. The staff was very polite and helpful to all our requests. Would love to stay here again.",4,2015,04,02
229,Awesome Location!,"Stayed here as part of a packaged deal through British Airways, it's location is absolutely perfect, it is very Central, just a short walk to O'Connell Street, the rooms are a decent size, and staff are friendly. Couldn't fault it :)",4,2015,04,01
229,First visit to Dublin,"My first visit to Dublin, even Ireland, and stayed at the Castle hotel. Not a luxury hotel as it's bit older and dated but the rooms are quite nice and the hotel itself is perfectly located a bit further up from the always busy and central O'Connell St. An easy walk into the heart of the city including Temple Bar. Right across the road is a hop on hop off bus stop so perfect for first time visitors wanting to explore the city. The staff are very friendly and has a great bar downstairs with traditional Irish music. Only issue I would say is the noise coming from other rooms is quite noticeable.",4,2015,04,01
229,Home Away From Home...,"This was my second stay at the Castle. Once again, I was very pleased with my stay. The location is ideal, and every morning I would be in the heart of the city center in just minutes. The breakfast has something for everyone. From a full Irish one, cereal, yogurt, and fresh fruit if you ask. The wait staff is very friendly and accommodating. The days that I would need to leave for a tour before breakfast is served, I would get coffee and fresh fruit to go. They will even make a sandwich for you if you would like. 
I stayed in the same room, a single, #309. I was able to open my window an let fresh air in while sleeping. If you don't mind the city noise and seagulls waking you up, which I don't;) There is instant coffee and tea provided in the room, and plenty of drawers for your belongings. No doubt I will be back. I have grown accustom to the great staff and location.",5,2015,03,30
229,Dublin,"We have enjoyed our stay here. Price vs quality was not in line with eachother. When you lay down in your bed and some one is passing by in the hallway the floor goes up and down. It is quiet noisy to, but the staff was great and very helpfull. Greetings from Holland.",4,2015,03,28
229,Simply Relaxing,"Myself and my partner stayed at The Castle Hotel as I was delivering a seminar the following day (Thurs 25th), Check in Wed was seemless and painless, the room ( a little walk away) was spotless and on a coldish day was lovely and warm. We ate in the bar/restaurant that night, the food was excellent, the young lady serving was very attentive and the bartender filled us with so many excellent stories about Dublin and suggestions where to visit. The smiles on the happy workers at reception as we checked out wished we weren't. Kudos to all the staff, we will be back",5,2015,03,27
229,Great hotel full of character,"Just returned from a short break to Dublin staying in the castle hotel. The location is perfect, just a 5 minute walk off the busy O'Connell Street, and a 10 to 15 minute walk to the Temple Bar area. The hotel is clean, full of charm and character, the staff were friendly and the breakfast was a great extra for the price! The room was bigger than expected and had a lovely four poster bed and high ceilings. Definitely got more than we were were expecting when paying for a normal double room. Overall a very enjoyable stay! ",4,2015,03,27
229,Birthday-Trip,My little girl Melanie had the wish to celebrate her 30 in Dublin. My wife found this nice hotel. Old but clean. Great and helpful staff - so all was perfect. They even organized a cake for the birthday girl - thanks a lot,4,2015,03,26
229,Great location,"Stayed in The Castle Hotel in January 2015 ,room was very spacious and warm which is what you need in January,staff very friendly,had dinner in the Restaurant have to say it was first class, would stay again just a few minutes from Dublin city centre",5,2015,03,26
229,OK Hotel,"I like old hotels, they have personality. This was an OLD hotel, but with modern upgrades. The location of the hotel was close to shopping, buses, and tour buses. The only bad thing was I went there in Dec and it was cold in my room. They have heaters in the halls, but not in the rooms. The desk people were all nice, minus one but I only saw her once.",3,2015,03,24
229,Atmospheric and Historic - Loved the Whole Place,"This is no ordinary hotel ! Made of seven converted townhouses, to say it's rambling is the understatement of the century. It's the oldest hotel in Dublin, and has the pedigree to go with it. Gorgeous antique furnishings, creaky wooden floors, hidden staircases, narrow dead-end corridors, thick carpets, chandeliers and rooms tucked here and there in no apparent logical order. This hotel takes dedication but is well worth it ! It takes a bit to initially find - and then get back to - your room, but everything is beautifully renovated and the whole place oozes atmosphere. We loved exploring - finding hidden sitting rooms, furnished with sofas and old gramophones, real books on the bookshelves, up and down staircases which materialised behind hidden doors. It was better than Hogwarts. I swear we never used the same stair case twice ! The room itself was cheerful and nicely decorated, bathroom clean and modern, lots of light and spacious feeling. The bed was comfy and big. Tea and coffee making facilities with a free chocolate and little biscuits and plenty of milks (I hate running out of milk !) , but no fridge or safe in the room.  WIFI was fast and reliable. Breakfast was in the modern restaurant downstairs and although there were loads of people eating, they managed the service quickly and the hot and cold food selection was good. We were suprised to see so many people eating breakfast, as we never saw another soul walking around the corridors ! The bar down in the basement is cosy and nice for a drink, a meal and to listen to the live Irish music. All excellent. We ate dinner twice in the restaurant and both times it was very good. The pizza was excellent and because one of our meals took a little longer, they gave us a free glass of wine immediately, which was great service. We hadn't complained, so it was very nice to offer out of the blue. There seems to be a garden area which would be great in the warmer weather. We were happy tucked away in the cosy bar ! All in all, a lovely, quirky hotel. Thank you !",5,2015,03,23
229,Lovely hotel,"We have just come back from 4 days in this hotel. We had 2 rooms (1double and 1twin) on the 3rd floor. The rooms are very pretty and the bed was very comfortable. Every day there's a little chocolat on the pillow. You can male tea and coffee too. Everything was very clean. The only thing missing was a little frig but we could get ice from the bar or restaurant. If I  had to find a fault the only problem os you can hear everything in your neighbour's room but we were so tired it wasn't a problem.
The pub downstairs was nice. Only problem was the smell of smoke. The food was excellent and reasonably priced. The personnel were very friendly. The breakfast was excellent. 
We really loved this hotel and will definitely stay there again. I shall also recommend it to friends.
Thank you Castle Hotel for helping our stay in Dublin be an excellent one.",4,2015,03,23
229,Six Nations Stay,We were a group of 7 English rugby fans. This hotel provided very comfortable bistro style accommodation within easy walking distance of Central Dublin. Very helpful and friendly staff. Good breakfast and dinner menu. Would definitely stay again when visiting Dublin. The live music was an option if desired in the cellar bar and restaurant area.,5,2015,03,23
229,Mrs,"Stayed for a long weekend with my daughter for my mothers day gift but we wAs fortunate that out stay was over St Patrick's day so and we had a fantastic time  , the rooms are clean and spacious, staff was lovely and food was nice .
Had such a great time that we have booked again .",5,2015,03,22
229,Spent St. Paddy's week at Castle,"Amazing place to stay Clean place. Older hotel but unbelievably charming and great place for the price  Wonderful and friendly staff from front desk, restaurant, pub and housekeeping. Owner welcomed us at breakfast one morning I will refer to friends and will stay there again! Great food and music too! Warm room but open the window thanks staff for your hospitality.  Much appreciated!",5,2015,03,21
229,BRUTALLY HONEST,"6 of us stayed here from 16-18th March. Its a little bit further out than where I've stayed before but still only a 10/15 minute walk to temple bar. The hotel itself was clean & spacious & the staff were all polite & helpful. Its old fashioned decor &  has a grand, georgian feel but this just adds to the character of the place. The breakfast which was included was good & did the trick! The only critisism of our stay is that even though we booked together our rooms were miles apart, other than that it did the job for us. A clean, comfy place to stay whilst enjoying st.patricks day! ",4,2015,03,19
229,Great hotel,"this hotel is fantastic very central ,staff and manager very helpful, the food is excellent .will return  felt very at home.a big thank you to all the staffxxxWe were made so welcome we will return to this hotel Nxt year for St Patrick's day .",5,2015,03,18
229,The hotel is a little bit noisy but a great stay,"We were staying in Dublin for a long weekend and got very lucky with this hotel! It's a quirky layout as it is several old houses combined, but that just adds to the character of the place.

The pro's

- It's a great location, only a 2 minute walk to O'Connell street, where the shops and pubs begin, and is close to the hop on bus stops to start any tours. And temple bar is only a 10-15 min walk away
- the rooms are a decent size as they are in old Georgian houses, with the rooms varying in decor (we were in a more traditionally decorated room, whereas friends were in a more modern room)
- the beds are very comfortable and rooms were all very clean, with newly updated bathrooms
- the staff were a massive positive! Everyone we spoke to was very friendly and willing to help with any request
- the full breakfast was one of the best I've had in any hotel

Cons

- the hotel is a little noisy, as with old buildings there are creaking floorboards and you can hear the water in the pipes. Also we had a room at the front over the entrance and with the old single glazed windows you could here people walking past or standing outside for a smoke (that said it was St Patrick's weekend so the hotel was very busy with late night revellers coming back in the early hours that were making the noise)

There really isn't anything else negative to say about the hotel, if there's one other comment it was that we had dinner one night in the restaurant and the food was nice but not as good as other places we'd eaten at.

If we do go back to Dublin we'll be trying to book here again! The only reason I've not given 5 stars is because of the noise.",4,2015,03,17
229,Great hotel excellent location,"Stayed here March 2015 for my partners 30th birthday, and what a brilliant weekend we had. We arrived at the hotel at approx. 10:00 (after a 20min trip on the airlink 747 bus direct from the airport for 6euro one way per person) expecting to have to leave our bags at reception as check in was not until the afternoon but we were told that we could immediately check in as our room was ready which was just perfect for us. The room itself was basic but everything you required was available. Very clean and tidy with clean towels every single day (a bonus in our eyes). The staff at the hotel were very friendly, always had a smile and couldn't do enough to help. The girls on reception were always helpful and even booked a taxi on our behalf. We had a very early plane to catch on the way out (we were checking out at 04.00) but the staff still arranged for us to have a breakfast on the morning we left. Every other morning we had a large choice of items for breakfast including a full Irish, cereal, toast, fruit, ham and cheese. The hotel itself is very charming with a lot of original features, great WIFI signal and ideally located just 5 minutes walk from the main street, O'Connell street. We ate in the onsite restaurant 'the vaults' twice which was brilliant, great value for money (25euro for a 3 course meal) and tasted amazing. Each night we were there we were also lucky enough to experience the live traditional music the hotel laid on - just brilliant. Relaxing but enjoyable at the same time - not too loud or overpowering so that we were able to enjoy the entertainment but also still have our own conversations. 

There are a lot of things to do in Dublin but I would highly recommend taking full advantage of the hop on hop off bus - the red one. We paid 22 euro per person and for this we got a 2 day ticket around Dublin and a return to the airport on any day of our choosing, The bus itself is great value for money and takes you around all 28 tourist stops with many discounts and freebies along the way. We stopped at many of the stops but the ZOO and the Guinness Storehouse deserve a special mention as both were amazing and well worth a visit. You literally jump on the bus at the main stop on O'Connell Street (5 mins walk from the hotel) and jump off wherever you want. The bus runs every 15-20 mins and you just hop back on wherever and whenever you want. Each bus also has great live commentary and had both my partner and I in fits of giggles on many occasions, but also provides great historical information for each stop. 

One last thing to mention would be Murray's bar and Grill which is at the top of O'Connell street - all that I need to say about this is WOW - Great tasting food, amazing value for money, great live music and amazing live Irish dancing. A must visit if your in the area! 

I would highly recommend this hotel if your looking for a nice charming hotel close to all the action but also in a nice quiet area so that your not disturbed by late night revellers. Ideally placed for the airport and overall great vale for money.",5,2015,03,16
229,Loved my stay!,"This hotel is in one of the oldest buildings in Dublin, and there are noises such as running water but I loved my four nights at this property.  It is only about a 10 minute walk to the Temple Bar area and some great shopping.  Trinity College is perhaps 5 minutes further away.  Breakfast is excellent and I had dinner in the restaurant one night and the salmon was delicious.  The hotel staff is courteous and helpful and my room was clean and serviced daily.  I will stay here again when in Dublin.  For a room away from street noise, ask for an interior room.  The view is of a parking lot and courtyard but that didn't bother me.  Free wifi!",5,2015,03,16
229,Fab Hotel,"stayed here beginning of March. Found the hotel delightful with very friendly and helpful staff. Nice rooms, bar and lounges tucked away. We managed to get a lounge to ourselves, which after a busy day was great to relax in. The staff even supplied us with breakfast at 4am on our departure. We will return thank you.",5,2015,03,15
229,Fab team,We stayed at the castle hotel for a 2 night break it was the best few days we have had away in ages. We were treated like kings by everyone we came across the room was amazing and the staff could not be more helpfull. We went for a special birthday treat and that is exactly what we had .thanks Ireland x,5,2015,03,14
229,40th birthday 22 girls fantastic hotel,we book for my sisters 40th birthday in total 22 girls from the minute we arrived hotel staff couldn't do enough rooms were brill staff were amazing. So welcoming Trevor and Anthony on the bar brilliant guys pat the guy on night time reception was lovely and the reception staff in general were brilliant. Had the best weekend ever on the Friday in the bar woth the live singer and on the Saturday decorated the room for my sisters birthday. Best hotel in Dublin we have stayed in breakfast was amazing too all 22 of us want to come back and stay at the castle. I would recommend this 100% catered for all my family young and old well done guys brilliant hotel. See you soon ,5,2015,03,13
229,Enjoyable stay,"Stayed here in a twin room, our room was clean, we were given clean towels every day, but the radiator did not come on in the morning only in  the evening, housekeeping had a habit of opening the windows which made the room cold to retutn to.I asked if they had a bath safety mat as the shower was over the bath, had a note put under the door saying there was a mat to stand on when you get out of the bath, but I meant one to stop me slipping whilst in the bath having a shower. There was plenty of selection for breakfast, but food was not very hot. The food in the evening in the restaurant ws really nice and was hot. Staff were really nice at all times. Could hear a lot of noise even though it was doubled glazed. On the whole a good city break, would stay here again.",3,2015,03,13
229,One night in Dublin at the Castle Hotel,"Big surprise  I thought I had booked a buget Hotel , but the Castle is certainley not   in that category Great location 5 minutes from the centre , a short  stroll to The nightlife .  Very comfortable and well  appointed room,  1st class restaurant and an excellant Cellar Bar.   All the staff are friendly and helpful  and Fionn  the owner  goes out of his way to make everyone feel personaly welcome.
I am only here for1 night this time,  but I will be back to see Dublin again , and the Castle  will be my first choice",5,2015,03,11
229,Good value in Dublin,"The hotel is made up of some large Georgian houses knocked into one: hence the layout is a bit quirky, but the decor and contents in the public areas are interesting. The hotel seems clean and has a pleasant and friendly ambience.  One of the most noticeable things to us was the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff.
Our twin room was OK.  Big enough, but not huge.  Bathroom and shower OK and clean.
There is a bar in the basement with live music.  Seemed always busy and friendly.
Breakfast was good.  Not a huge choice: but all good. Clean and bright breakfast room with (again) friendly staff and atmosphere.
Best thing about the hotel is the location. Near enough to city centre to walk , and far enough from the madness and high prices.  the room was a bit noisy from traffic: but this was somewhat to be expected.  Guinness can help sleep patterns I think.
All in all - good value for a good location.",4,2015,03,10
229,Enjoyable Stay.,"We stayed 6th to 9th March. Two couples. Nice quiet, clean, well equipped rooms. We liked the 'traditional' style with period lounges and furniture. Eat two nights in the restaurant where the food was 7/10. Breakfast excellent in a very nice room. Staff very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the live music in the bar. Good value all round. All four of us agreed that we would definitely use again.",4,2015,03,10
229,Good value for Dublin,This hotel is fairly centrally situated and an easy walk to O'Connell Street. The staff were all pleasant and accommodating.  The accommodation was a bit dated but clean and very functional. The bathroom was modern. The price was pretty good for Dublin too! The breakfast was again ok but not outstanding. There is parking at 15 euros per night through the hotel or on street parking outside the hotel at 3 euros per hour from 7am to 7pm.,4,2015,03,09
229,So Disappointed and would not stay again,"My husband and I and my daughter stayed March 4th to the 8th 2015...Our first time to Dublin.

We checked in on the 4th late evening as we traveled from outside Ireland.  We entered our room 425 and it was like a freezer, windows open and no WiFi.   We complained, went to dinner and when we returned we got a new room, 235, and it was like a Sauna, the TV didn't work and the toilette seat was broken.  We complained the next day about the toilette seat and a new one was there later in the day.  (How the house keepers left it that way in beginning or for how long...and after we had to move to another room you would think they would make sure things were in order)

The walls of the rooms are very thin!(The whole area is noisy)  I could hear the other quests in the next room talking, their alarms woke me up and every movement.....very uncomfortable and very poor sleep.  We wanted to check out and find a new Hotel then but only had a short time in Dublin and together so I chose not to...

The most upsetting was Friday night.  We went to the restaurant for dinner(the only night we had dinner there) at 8 and we were told, ""Well, we have a birthday party going on in the restaurant so theres no room for you but you can just eat in this bar area"". We sat an ordered and waited at least 30-40 min for our meal, my Fish and Chips were so horrible, burnt that I sent them back.  The waiter could care less and never returned to our table....I had to go to the Bar, wait in line like I was getting a drink, just to get my check.  Clearly they were busy, the staff was running around chaotically and clearly couldn't handle the amount of people in the place.

Based on this experience, I would not stay here again if I was to return to Dublin. The area  is nice but I saw a number of places in the same area to stay.",2,2015,03,08
229,"Cozy, quiet and great location","For this vacation my wife and I needed:
- Rather cheap
- Central
- Breakfast included.
We got all three and we also got:
- A quiet room
- Regular live Irish folk music in the bar at night
- A hotel large enough, so you don't feel like you have too close to the host (a good thing)
- A clean hotel and room
- Cozy old fashioned furniture's (which gave nice atmosphere)
So we were quite satisfied and would recommend it to anyone not expecting too much.

But chances are you could get disappointed too:
- Some rooms looked were small - at 3rd floor, where we stayed.
- Our bed was were very short - and that is being said by me, a short male. Ask for a room with a larger bed, if you need that.
- No large impressing reception - just a large room.
- Access to the rooms were through narrow isles paving their way side-to-side and up and down.
- Staircase was quirking
- Lift was slow and small
- The choice at the breakfast was somewhat limited, but also expanded to having cooked egg, ham and sausages.

The Hotel was in some of the old townhouses, so I assume the rooms on 1st and 2nd floor were with bigger - at least taller, but that is only a guess. 
So you might get a very nice room by upgrading.

The location was good enough for staying there the 6 nights we were there.
We might choose it again.",5,2015,03,08
229,"Great Hotel, Dreadful Breakfast","I stayed in this hotel recently as it was close to where I needed to be for work. Otherwise, this is not a part of the city that I would choose to be in. Given the 'down at heel' feel of the surrounding area I was pleasantly surprised by the warm, homely atmosphere when I walked in the door. The public spaces  really are charming, with overstuffed couches, bookcases etc scattered around encouraging guests to sit a while and linger. The cellar bar also had a nice atmosphere also with live music on one of the nights of my stay. My single room was perfectly appointed. The bathroom, although 'bijoux', was spotlessly clean (however a bin here would have been SO handy, rather strange not to have one actually!) I slept like a log in my VERY comfortable bed and went down to breakfast to the airiest, brightest breakfast room imaginable. Usually breakfasts are served in out-of-the way back rooms but this dining room was large with big windows flooding the place with sunshine. My happiness was short-lived though. The selection really was awful, so very disappointing in what was, up to then, a real surprise find of a hotel. The choice of cereals was ok, four types, two flavours of juice but after that it went rapidly downhill. I do not like a cooked breakfast so the alternatives were grim to say the least. The fruit selection was a choice of tinned grapefruit or tinned mandarin oranges all floating around in juice. The Castle Hotel is a couple of streets away from Moore Street, Dublin's most famous fruit-market, and yet they couldn't be bothered to buy some fresh fruit for their guests. How hard would it be to chop a few melons??? There were NO pastries, croissants, scones or homemade breads either only shop bought sliced white and brown. Very, very disappointing. In fact I would almost go so far as to say the worst I have come across in all my travels. Would this stop me from staying here again? Of course not, it's a really nice place. It just ruined what would have been an otherwise perfect stay. Pull your socks up Castle Hotel, it could be so easily fixed!!",4,2015,03,07
229,Business and fun - and even couples,"I can say that this hotel is really nice. When I saw all the stairs, I felt like Harry Potter :D
Very comfortable beds!!! I have always problem that I'm tired from the hotels because of their beds. I didn't wake up not even once! So really thank You.
Plus, there were amaying breakfasts every morning.
I can really recommend this hotel. We stayed there for business meeting with Google and we simply took bus No.1 nearby and got to Barrow St. few steps from the enter to Google building.
It would be even nice place for couples. Just a little walk from Temple Bar etc.",5,2015,03,06
229,A wonderful week,"From start to finish we had a wonderful week in Dublin all due to the staff at the Castle Hotel, warm, friendly and always helpful.  The hotel was warm and clean and the food was superb, hope to return one day  :)",5,2015,03,06
229,Smashing Hotel in a great location,My wife and I spent 4 nights at the Castle Hotel late February 15.  It's location at the top end of O'Connell Street was perfect as a base to visit most attractions and ideal for walking to (and staggering back from) Temple Bar. It was approximately a 20 euro taxi ride to and from Dublin Airport and for those who want to catch the airport bus it is approx 5 minutes walk from the Gresham Hotel on O'Connell Street (the bus drop & pick up point)  Our room was a bit on the small side and the bed could be described as being akin to sleeping on a house brick but I like a firm mattress so no complaints from me....  The hotel was clean and tidy and clearly well maintained.  Housekeeping was excellent and the only complaint I could make was there was a bit of noise first thing in the morning when the laundry wagon turned up.  We were in Room 324 and this did wake us up.  Breakfast was exceptionally good and given this was included in the room rate a real bonus that set us up for the day.  The restaurant was very good with a dinner menu offering good Irish fare at reasonable prices -  we used it 3 of the 4 nights we stayed and we were not disappointed.  Staff were helpful and attentive and provided assistance with good humour when asked..... All in all I was impressed with the degree of comfort and value for money this hotel offered and I would fully recommend it to other travellers.  I will certainly use it next time I'm in Dublin.,4,2015,03,04
229,Weekend break,"Me & my partner recently stayed at this hotel for a 3 night break. I booked it because it was excellent value for money and seemed close to the Centre. On arrival (10am) we were told our room won't be ready until 2.30pm which was understanding because i knew the hotel was full. So we left our luggage and strolled into the centre and got something to eat. The hotel was closer than i thought to the centre - bonus! It is situated at the top of O'Connell street which is the main street. Our room was simple but enough, big comfy bed, standard sized bathroom just what you need for a 3 night stay. Unfortunately we did not have enough sleep each night. The first morning the room above us had a bath and you can hear everything!! The water running, emptying the bath and the person singing at 8.30am - was not impressed!! The 2nd night there was singing and shouting and running up and down the corridor at 3am. I understand there's nothing we could of done but these people could of had some respect!!
Apart from all the noise i would recommend this hotel for it's location, lovely old decor, the breakfast in the morning is fab and the Vault's restaurant underneath the hotel is excellent with live music on the weekends.",4,2015,03,03
229,"Cracking old charm hotel, central location a very pleasant stay","I stayed for five days in February in this three star old georgian hotel which maintained many of it's original features and occupied a corner plot of two roads. In general it was very pleasantly decorated, clean and tidy and in keeping to the style and age of the building. The hotel had a lift although I did not use it. If you wish for modern, glass, starkness and minimalism this is not the hotel for you. The location was great for being right in the city centre with many of the attractions and sights within walking distance or ride on the buses which stopped outside of the hotel. After reading several reviews for this hotel and different hotels I came to the conclusion that most of the city hotels suffered with traffic and/or guest noise due to their locations and being old buildings. There was some general noise from vehicles outside the hotel first thing in the morning and during the evening. There was an awareness of other guests from above, through the walls and in the corridor, but nothing that stopped me from sleeping and nothing outrageous, simply guests using the hotel. I stayed in room 318 which overlooked the church. The room was a double, very warm, pleasantly decorated, spacious and very clean and tidy. There were two minor defects such as a cracked floor tile in the shower room/toilet and the dial to the shower was missing. The staff from the receptionists to the waiters/waitresses and chefs were smart in appearance, very professional, attentive and polite without being over zealous. I only ate breakfast at the hotel and the food was very good, hot and filling with variety. The staff were only to happy to serve you and met your dietary requests. The ambience and atmosphere of the breakfast restaurant was bright and complimented the features of the hotel. At times when it was very busy and full of guests I found that the tables and chairs were fairly close together. I wished that I had eaten at the hotel's Vaults restaurant in the evening and experienced the live music...may be next time. Overall I enjoyed my stay at the Castle Hotel. I would recommend it to others and I would definately stay here again. In all I found that nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff and they worked as a team. I was left with the impression that they all valued and enjoyed their job and they genuinely wanted you to enjoy your stay at their hotel.",4,2015,03,01
229,Good value for money,"stayed here for one night during a business trip in Feb 2015.
rate for room was very favourable, the free upgrade before checking in was appreciated. the room itself was claen and tidy, breakfast was warm and acceptable, as the title suggests good value, would probably stay there again.",3,2015,02,27
229,Excellent hotel and great position,"I have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Castle Hotel.  What can I say it was fantastic.  The staff are friendly and more than willing to help you. I would like to mention a special thank you to Denise, she was great. Wh
en we arrived we were given a room on the 4th floor, unfortuantely one of my friends does not use the lift.  This was no problem within 5 mins a new room on the first floor was found for us.  Breakfast was good, all the normal food you would expect.  On our first night we ate in the hotels bar and restaurant and the food was excellent.
The position of the hotel is exellent, you are a short 10 minute walk from O'Connell Street, where you can pick up the Hop On Hop off buses.

I even met the owner while I was staying.  Would definately recommend this hotel and I would come back !!!!!",5,2015,02,25
229,Excellent Location - Wonderful Staff,"This hotel is good value for money, and the location is unreal. You are a 2 minute walk from the centre of Dublin. All of the buses to and from the airport are less then a 5 minute walk away and the staff are only too happy to guide you to the best locations in the city.
It is a Georgian House hotel, so you have the stunning architecture but with all the modern conveniences. I had a Double Room for a week and I have to say, it was beautiful. The room was warm all the time, if a little snug, the bed was great and most importantly the staff greet you with a smile on their face and will fall over themselves trying to help you.
Breakfast is included, and served in the Old Music Shop in the mornings. It is crisp, tasty and fresh and if you are coeliac like me, they will usually try and provide bread or offer an alternative (e.g. an extra Rasher in place of a sausage). The warm breakfast is a serving of eggs, sausage, rasher, puddings, beans and tomatoes. There is also a cold option of hams, cheeses and juices. If you ask ahead of time for specifics they will try their best to cater for you.",5,2015,02,24
229,I would stay here again!,My wife and I stayed here the weekend of 20th-23rd Feb and had a really nice stay and would stay here again. The staff were all very friendly and helpful and the hotel is well situated for sightseeing in Dublin. We arrived late Friday evening and found that food was still being served in the Vaults restaurant where good Irish fare is served at reasonable prices by very friendly staff. There was good music in the Vaults from 9pm on the Friday and Saturday which was a good way to relax and have a nightcap at the end of the day. The breakfast was adequate plentiful and fresh with friendly and attentive staff. The room was not large but adequate for the time we spent in it and the wi-fi signal was very good. We kept the window open to maintain a cool room and had to make sure we closed the bathroom door as this was very warm. The shower was just about acceptable. There was noise from adjoining rooms due to a group of high spirited women but no traffic noise as we were facing the courtyard car park. There was a bit of noise from the floor above. The voice in the lift was a bit grating but added to the quirkiness/character of the hotel. My wife and I both agreed that if we were to visit Dublin in the future this hotel would definitely be up the list.,4,2015,02,24
229,"Rooms small, facilities tired and inadequate","The location of this hotel in central Dublin is excellent and the staff are as helpful and friendly as one could expect. The rooms are small but possibly adequate for a short term stay and the breakfast is fresh and crisp however that's where the positive ends. The facilities are tired at best and often non functional, the noise pollution and migration form adjoining rooms is significant and the facilities within the rooms are very poor if indeed functional at all. Also please note that this hotels parking  charges add significantly to the room costs. I personally emailed this establishment as requested in the quest pack and didn't even receive the courtesy of a reply. To much competition with similar geographical and budget criteria for this to be acceptable for the costs.",2,2015,02,23
229,Great value for money ,This hotel was good value for money. The room was small and cosy (the radiator didn't seem to turn off) but was adequate for our weekend. The breakfast was excellent and made up for the alright hotel room. Staff were all friendly and helpful and the room and public areas were clean and tidy. Shower was more of a dribble! ,3,2015,02,22
229,Great Location,"I stayed with my husband and my father-3 days at the Castle.. The single room was ok, but our double room I did not like. It was very small and I had wished for a bathtub. On demand we were told we checked in quite late, but the next day we could get another room and that was ok for us. We got as promised the next day a very nice room with fireplace and Bathtub.The first  evening we spent at the hotel. The food in the restaurant was tasty. Not too expensive, fresh ingredients and a wine recommendation Superior as the very nice waitress. The subsequent visit to the pub with live Irish music was especially nice. Great atmosphere, nice Talks with international and domestic clients.The breakfast was very good, typically British eggs with different varieties, bacon, sausage, beans. But thats a question of taste.Who expects whole meal bread, cheese, cold meats and fresh fruit should eat breakfast away. A tip for coffee lovers :coffee order at an additional cost. For 2 euros should let a real coffee from the ""real"" coffeemachine "" The included instant coffee is nothing for people who really loves coffee. Gratis WLAN  with printer works perfectly. The location of the hotel is very good. Courtyard rooms very quiet . If I want a quiet location and beautiful views, I make no city break, for that ""thumbs up"". The Interiour is truly Gregorian, not luxurious and not modern, but very clean with an Irish flair.Exactly what we wanted. Again, congratulations to the ServiceTeam When my husband and I still wanted to have a bottle of wine late an hour, all shops and bar were closed, the nice reception staff made it possible to organize our ""favorite wine"" Even on departure was all super organized. Luggage storage and taxi service to the airport ... THANK YOU Dear Castle Team ..... WE HAD THE IRISH FEELING and will come back ! Greetings from Switzerland.",4,2015,02,22
229,"Great value, central location.",The staff go beyond expectations to provide for your comfort and  satisfaction.  The building wanders on what seems like forever.  It's very old and decorated in character.  The full English breakfast are great. I have absolutely no complaints and will gladly return any day.,4,2015,02,21
229,A wonderful stay leading up to our wedding day,"We apologise that our review is delayed, but we wanted to write to thank the Castle Hotel for a wonderful stay in late summer of 2014, in the lead up to our wedding day. We have stayed in this hotel on several occasions over the past couple years, and we have always enjoyed our stay in a hotel which has individuality, charm and attentive staff. All of our wedding guests travelled over from the UK, and on our recommendation, most of them chose to stay in this hotel, and thoroughly enjoyed it.

We had some minor difficulties with communication during the booking stages, but on our arrival, Gillian and the reception team addressed our queries quickly and check-ins were completed efficiently. The hotel is a little difficult to negotiate for those with limited mobility, and our grandparents requested to swap from their first room due to bathroom access, however they were soon re-allocated a room of their choice, and the staff could not have been more attentive and understanding during this time.

During the weekend, Michael and the restaurant staff organised a meal in their Old Music Shop restaurant for our wedding party of around 60 guests, with a menu personalised to us, for which we were very grateful and it was enjoyed by all. Throughout our stay, we also enjoyed live music and a meal in the Castle Vaults.

We love this hotel, and are so thankful to all of the staff who were involved in making us, our families and friends feel welcome and comfortable during our stay. It's also a pleasure to see Finn the owner of the hotel, who is always friendly and welcoming. Overall, we wouldn't hesitate in recommending the Castle hotel and we look forward to visiting again soon.",5,2015,02,21
229,Pleasant suprise,"After reading all the negative comments on here re this hotel. Can't believe we were at the place.
Hubby and I have just stayed Friday 13th Feb until Monday 16th Feb. from walking into reception to us leaving Monday afternoon we had a great time. The staff Each And EVERYOne of them were happy, smiley, and gave fabulous customer service. Our room was lovely, a wee bit noises from traffic at night, but no big deal. Food was wonderful too. Can't wait to go back

229,Great stay in Dublin,A great place to stay in Dublin.  As a regular visitor to Dublin I always stay here. The staff and owner are very welcoming.  Nothing is too much trouble.  Ideal location for visiting the key sites of the city.  Superb value for money.  Looking forward to my next visit.,5,2015,02,17
229,Exceptional service,"We stayed in this hotel while our daughter was in Temple St. Children's hospital. Its location was ideal from this perspective - 2 minute walk to the hospital.  The level of service we received by every member of staff was really really exceptional. Whether it was the chef preparing food for my wife out of hours, when she arrived back at the hotel late, or folks on reception finding us a room at the last minute, on the Saturday night of a rugby weekend, when our daughter was kept in for a little longer, or preparing ""take away"" meals for us to bring up to the hospital. Everyone was so incredibly nice, professional and kind. I would highly recommend this hotel, whether it is for a trip like ours, or for any other reason.",5,2015,02,16
229,"Relaxing Stay at Castle Hotel, Dublin","This old Georgian hotel is a comfortable and relaxing place to spend a few days in Dublin.  The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful, and took the time to talk to their guests.   The food is good, and portions are generous.   The hotel charges are very reasonable, and include full cooked or continental style breakfast.  The Vaults restaurant provides lunch and evening meals , including early service from 5.00pm for those going out later to a show.  The Castle also provides good Irish evening entertainment on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings.
My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at the Castle, it is very convenient for O'Connell Street and tour bus services, and we would use this character hotel again if we return to Dublin.",4,2015,02,10
229,Lovely Old Hotel,"Great location, very friendly staff. Good choice breakfast and food served in The Vault. Refurbished room very nice, great walk in shower. Only down side is that the walls are thin so anyone talking in the hallways can be heard.  Would highly recommend this hotel when visiting Dublin, will definitely use again",5,2015,02,08
229,Nasty place,"Room was far too hot, the radiator valve was missing, no bath, small TV. My friend's room was fine - Big TV, shower & bath, working radiator! Odd thing was, the rooms were next to each other. Avoid.
Breakfast is only served until 10am, even at weekends, and was very busy (they had to use an overflow breakfast room!).",2,2015,02,05
229,Nice Old Hotel,"Beautiful hotel. Great location. Very Friendly staff. Simple but good breakfast with nice strong coffee. The Vault had good food and entertainment. Only negative thing to say is because it's an old building, it's walls are thin. So if you are a light sleeper like me, bring ear plugs. And I would recommend to the hotel that you consider investing in new towels. Ours were frayed with holes in them. Nothing though that would stop me from staying here again. ",4,2015,02,03
229,Poor value,"the room was very small and we were unlucky that we had one of ones that were not refurbished
Bedclothes were worn and torn in places..door stuck when closed really hard to open even for a man....receptionist wasn't too interested when we told her on departure
Very disappointed as we had booked early and seemed to have paid top price for less",3,2015,02,01
229,Boys Weekend,"This is the third time we have used the Castle Hotel for a boys weekend.
The reason we use this hotel is for the following reasons.
1. The close proximity to the city centre.
2. The staff are very friendly and the lads in the bar can't do enough for you.
3. For a lads weekend it's ideal somewhere to get some sleep after a good day/evening out.

Also there is always something on in the Vault bar.

So if you are looking for somewhere as a base  for a good weekend then this is the place.",4,2015,02,01
229,Decent enough,"Stayed here with my girlfriend for a weekend in Dublin.  The hotel had a charm to it - I would say it had a bit of history to it.  We met the owner on check in and he was certainly very charming.  I wouldn't say overall the other staff made as many overtures to us but that was fine.  The hotel was just off McConnell street so it was fairly easy to get around.  The hotel didn't have too many extra facilities but given the purpose of our trip we were not concerned.  One issue we had though was that our room was very cold.  The hotel did have a nice adjoining cafe that we frequented, however.",3,2015,02,01
229,Charming,I stayed with a friend for a short getaway first trip to Dublin. Charming hotel with small but clean rooms in and old building but well located. Close to public transportation and walking distance to most attractions of the area. The full breakfast every morning was a great start every day. My room overlook the back alley so it was quiet. I will stay there again.,4,2015,01,29
229,Quirky place,"Lovely quirky hotel lots of little nukes and crannies, beautiful breakfast a lot to choose from,friendly staff,good location..had a corner front room lovely and big,just traffic noise,but I had a choice of rooms but took this one..,",4,2015,01,27
229,Excellent choice,"Nice cosy clean rooms if a bit on the small side but only in room for a few hours of sleep so not a stopper! Very helpful friendly staff who advised us on restaurants locally as we wanted to go out (there is a restaurant in hotel as well as live Irish music etc.), they booked us taxis, stored our bags before checking in for our rooms as we were early. This allowed us to start visiting Dublin without delay. Also after check out all free of charge. Breakfast was lovely, self service buffet, choice of coffee and tea at your table. Great evening entertainment and you can't hear it as it is in the underground bar with vaulted ceiling. Will stay again!",5,2015,01,26
229,Not what it says on the tin! Possibly the worst place I have stayed in. Sorry but its the truth.,"I don't ever write reviews.
Or complain.
I work in customer service and I know the customer isn't always right but I was defo right on what I witnessed.
I am probably the most easy to please customer I gave the travel lodge I stayed in last week 5 stars!
But....Unfortunately I was staying at The Castle Hotel with my elderly disabled parents and I did not like seeing how badly they were treated and how disappointed they were. Personally I can sleep anywhere , anytime through a hurricane so you get my drift...

Lets cut to the chase...
1) The place was a tip, the car park was full of building materials as they were working off season (ok this isnt unusual off season) and one of the bays that I paid 15 euros a day for the right to park in had a few building materials lying in it. I had 2 disabled people with me and although the disabled bays were full I asked a young strapping lad who was a member of staff if he would mind moving the bits so we could park there. Can I add there were no other spaces as would of happily parked elsewhere. He had the personality of Ebeneezer Scrooge and said that there was no one available? As he stood in front of me I did explain that I had 2 disabled people to aid from car park to hotel - one being blind and frail and other being frail with severe emphysema and i'd happily help him move the few bits but obviously didn't want to move property that wasn't mine. He refused point blank and went in to the restaurant to continue leaning on the counter in the cafe chatting to the other female staff members.

2) We booked a room for 3 people. A triple room. I have stayed in bigger double rooms. It was small and cramped. Dirty and full of dust in certain places. It was on the ground floor next to the reception and the cafe and the rear exit. Was noisy with people coming in / out past the window into the cafe out of cafe into car park, staff and guests smoking outside the window and the doors banged every time someone used the emergency exit to get out by our window. The beds were comfy enough but the room was drab.

3) The only staff member who was customer orientated was the waitress and the head chef at dinner. The head chef was over accommodating as the food was excellent and Alex(i think that was her name) - our romanian waitress was the nicest most lovely girl. she couldn't do enough for us so we tipped her heavily but the rest of the staff poor as I will explain.

4) The bathroom ( which was a corner of the room fitted with plaster boards and a make shift shower to define it as ""en-suite lol ) had a step up to it! I was with 2 disabled people. 0 out of 10 for disabled access lol. We asked for the manager  on 3 occasions but he/ she never came. The room came with no info about amenities, wifi access, times etc BUT it did come with a note hoping that we enjoyed our stay and to highlight to management if something was not to our liking or satisfaction. Which we did but no one bothered to get back to us.

5) Had emailed the hotel 7 days beforehand to ask if there were any disabled parking spots for a registered disabled vehicle and that could we have a disabled access room prior to arrival - stil no reply.

6) When talking to the staff in the smoking area outside of the bar (which is where you would find them sitting moaning about their jobs and the hotel management) I asked them if they were busy. They all stated it was very quiet and they didnt have many bookings. Confusing me as to why the car park was full but they explained it was mostly staff cars and that there was a cherry picker blocking off the entrance to a second car park that they use. Which I was upset about learning as I had to double park behind an audi and a SUV and keep checking out the window for 2 hours untill someone left till i got a spot. Not forgetting I paid 15 euros for the privilege of an actual parking spot per day!

It gets better.....

7) I had explained to the receptionist that my mother was going to be in hospital for one day and would be recovering for 2 of our 3 nights in the hotel and would be blind and suffering the after effects of a general anisthetic and would be bed ridden so could I arrange breakfast room service for her on 2 days. I Would of been happy to pay extra SURCHARGE FOR ROOM SERVICE but she said it was not possible for them to bring a pre ordered tray of breakfast but I could come down and make up a breakfast a bring it up to her. As it was for my elderly 70 year old mother of course I would do that especially as she was ill and guessed they were on reduced staff this time of year so didnt make a fuss but didnt think it was very accomodating for a city hotel.

8) I skipped along to the cafeteria where breakfast is served and explained to the young waiter who we will call Mr Scrooge (yes the same young lad from car parking incident!!) that I was in room *** and my mother would be taking her breakfast, which we were charge 10 euros a day for all paid for up front in her room and i was here to take it up to her. He looked at me like I had just asked for the world! So to reassure the little treacle's anxiety explained the receptionist with the dark hair said this was authorised. So he replied ""okaaaaaaay"" sheepishly and proceded to turn around and continue chatting quietly to the other waitress. Must admit was a bit gobsmacked at the attitude but my mission was to get my breakfast for my poor old mum so  I waited untill he had finished his conversation and politely interrupted him to order. (how dare I! lol) I asked him for a cup of tea and a sausage sandwich.

it definately gets even better...

9) He replied that he couldnt do me a sausage sandwich!!!!! (call urself an irish hotel!)
I nearly died with laughter instead of anger as I genuinely thought this kid was having me on!
I stood there looking at his cafeteria with the hot breakfast selections of bacon, sausages, eggs, hash browns and black pudding a beans etc laid out for the guests to ask for and looked at the toast and bread station on the other side of him and asked him why not we had paid for full irish breakfast with hotel reservation. He replied because he could only make toast and not sandwiches. I asked him if he had bread, butter and sausages (all of which I could see in front of me) and he said yes but he can only serve me toast at breakfast ?? WORDS FAIL ME!!!. So I took her up cornflakes and tea instead and the dark haired waiter continued to talk to now 3 waitresses. my poor little mammy was looking forward to a good old sausage sandwich after having surgery the night before and the hotel could not accomodate us. Well shame on you guys even if you had charged me an extra £10 for her I would of paid it but seems unfair as she wasnt even going to avail of the full menu :( 

10) after i had sorted out my poorly mother and took her her sausage sandwich minus the sausage and the sandwich replaced with cornflakes. I then came down to sit and have breakfast myself. The 3 waitresses and Mr Scrooge the waiter/ deli lad continued to talk over by the coffee station and I waited for 30 mins and no one came over to me to serve me. At this point I was running late to get back to the room to administer my mum's medication and decided after all the stress I would just grab a coffee so I approached the till and asked the waitress for a latte. The waiter (mr scrooge again!) delightfully butted in to advise me that that would be 2 euros. I explained that I had paid 10 euros in full already upfront for a full breakfast and that was all I wanted. He explained it was not included in the breakfast menu simply tea and coffee only.  They brought me over a really nice latte (bit on the small side) but as that was the only interaction i saw from the waiting staff I left the 2 euro on the counter when I left.
The waitress unknown to my order as she was too busy talking to the other waitress by the stairs followed me and asked what room I was in , as I asked why she said so she could charge the latte to my room and i politely explained that I had left the 2 euro with my empty cup. She explained she thought it was a tip! (would like to nominate her for a comedy award I never laughed as hard when I explained I would only tip for good service. She made it clear to me she took offence to that and guess what ....I don't actually care and thats not like me.

11) The shower took 20 mins to heat up before it turned luke warm. The towels were small and i'm only 5''0 and there was no toiletries in the bathroom even though they advertise that there are?

12) They don't serve bottles of Miller. They had no Grey Goose vodka. Poor bar selection but to be honest not the worst thing in the world just had to be honest it's central Dublin.

13) finally on check out asked for the general manager - again- was told she was in a meeting and i explained that i had to comments to feed to her about our stay, it wasnt to get money off we had already paid in full and I wouldn't of wasted my time really couldnt wait to get back on the road but she was in a meeting so told the receptionsist to get her to ring me. still waiting on call .

14) The tv had awful reception was fuzzy trying to watch RTE so we called handy man but even he couldnt do anything. 

I WOULD RATHER STICK PINS IN MY EYES THAN STAY HERE AGAIN. Best part of the stay was the food I have to admit the food was excellent and I did make a point of telling the chef myself. Lovely chap the head chef and the young romainian waitress who did our evening meal but as for the rest of the staff they really didn't care and thats why she got 30 euros tips and they didn't !!! as Julia Roberts in pretty woman quoted to the snooty sales advisers who wouldn't serve her ""BIG MISTAKE, MASSIVE "". 

Written with the best of intentions and without prejudice.",2,2015,01,25
229,"Nice find, north of city center.","I spent 2 nights here in mid-January, and was very pleased.  Good location, clean, very friendly staff.  Had the included breakfast, which was fresh and warm.  When I come back to Dublin will stay here again.",4,2015,01,24
229,Great hotel...,"Myself and boyfriend stayed at the hotel last weekend and had a great time! 
I feel the hotel is a bit dated in the decor however this wouldn't affect your stay in anyway. The breakfast each morning was great and plenty of options and fab service!
We stayed in the hotel bar on Sat evening and had the pleasure of seeing 'Roy Cox' perform which was fantastic! 
Make sure you take lots of spending money as Dublin is very expensive... All in all though we would defiantly return to the Castle Hotel!! 
",5,2015,01,12
229,New Year in Dublin,"This has to be one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in, it was rundown and drab and the only saving grace was that SOME of the staff were extremely helpful.
My 1st room was so bad that I asked to be moved but the 2nd was so bad I wished I hadn't bothered..... the shower tray took 10mins to drain after use and the TV only had two watchable channels!!
Breakfast was plentiful but almost inedible as it was only luke warm and the heat in the breakfast room was unbearable,
Unfortunately I was booked in for four nights but in that time I heard numerous complaints and two separate residents asked for a refund.
I have read other reviews which praise this hotel so I can only give my personal experience and say perhaps I was unlucky with both rooms?",1,2015,01,08
229,Very disappointing experience.," On booking this break for my wife and myself on the occasion of our golden wedding anniversary I was delighted that the hotel give us an upgrade in our accommodation . Well if the room we were allocated was an 'upgrade' I would have liked to seen the lower grade. The 'superior' room was small with a very hard mattress and no bath. The next morning after a sleepless night I emailed reception at 7.30 am with my complaints and the receptionist kindly arranged an alternative room which was an improvement in size and had a bath. The noise from outside during the next night and the creaky stair sounds left us with another rather sleepless night. On two of the mornings the buffet full breakfasts were cold and served on cold plates. All in all a big let down on a weekend away we wanted to remember and one we will remember for all the wrong reasons.",2,2015,01,07
229,Castle Hotel,"This hotel was a chance discovery on a travel website. The Castle hotel is perfectly located at the heart of Dublin with all major attractions at walking distance  including the temple bar district. It has a quaint old world charm to it. The family room was huge and a decent sitting area outside the room. 
The vault restaurant is an interesting concept with the dim lighting and stone walls adding to the  ambience. Food is great and the excellent service adds to the  overall experience.",5,2015,01,06
229,A surprise trip,"We very much enjoyed our 4 night stay at the Castle. Extremely convenient for the airport shuttle, tour buses and Dublin. The staff, rooms and restaurants were all great.  A wonderful relaxed atmosphere with plenty of choice. Will come again for sure.",4,2015,01,02
229,Improves each time.,"3rd stay on this Hotel. First attracted by car parking & location which remain ideal for Dublin Stay. Easy to find by car. Parking at Hotel. 3 minutes walk to O'Connell Street. 8 minutes to Temple Bar. Rooms and restaurant much improved on first visit when a little shabby. Will use again. 
",4,2014,12,31
229,Excellent hotel ,"Stayed here for three nights in between Christmas and Newyear. This hotel is everything you need. We got the airlink bus to the city from the airport which is 6 euro each and around 30 minute. The hotel is five minute walk from
The bus stop. Check in was quick and staff are lovely, Geraldine is so helpful. We had a room on the first floor which was perfect, really warm which is great after a day walking around the City. Breakfast is fab! Lots of staff and never kept waiting. Food in the bar downstairs is also brilliant excellent price too : 3 courses for 25.00 with a complimentary baileys or Irish coffee. Bar staff again are lovely. The bar has a good atmosphere.

We took the hop on and off bus for 18.00 euros each , ticket is for 24 hours which is good and the tours are worth it. Take the green one as I was told this is the better one. The drivers are good fun too with the live commentary. There are lots if shops here, Arnotts is a bit like house of Fraser on a bigger scale, worth a visit if you like shopping , has a nice coffee shop in there too. The museums are closed on a Monday so if you are planning to visit these then plan any day except Monday :) 

Temple bar is a good night out , plenty of places to eat and certainly drink :) not cheap but this is Dublin and the atmosphere is brilliant. 

We will be returning the Castle. ",5,2014,12,29
229,perfect choice,"Flying by the seat of our pants on a three day jaunt with NO RESERVATIONS! We were ready for an adventure and simply stopped at the Dublin tourism office in the airport. They checked rates and even compared with other booking sites. Very reasonable less than 500 USD and included breakfast. I recommend a taxi as it probably is close to the bus rate. Either one is fine and takes you from the airport to city center. With assistance GPS took us two blocks to the property. Small as expected but lovely public areas. Lots of stairs and one creaky small elevator. Nice bathroom. Breakfast was always crowded, but any thing from hot breakfast to cereal yogurt cold cuts. We dropped our bags the first morning bought the hop on hop off bus ticket and by early afternoon we napping so we could enjoy the pub at the corner. Great value with a good location.",4,2014,12,19
229,"Good value, good location, good food",Castle Hotel lived up to all our expectations. Whilst the rooms were basic they were clean and well appointed. Supper in the basement bar/restaurant was fine and the live folk music on Friday and Saturday night was a bonus. Quirky layout of the hotel meant much up and down stairs and through a maze of corridors even if they do have a lift.,4,2014,12,16
229,"Lovely old world hotel, good value, great location.","Rooms were adequate - quite basic but served the purpose. Unfortunately the first morning we were woken up at 8 with a cleaner playing music in the room next door. Breakfasts were good, mostly a fry up, as other alternatives went quickly. Tv in room didn't work. Great central location.",4,2014,12,14
229,Cranky Traveller,"I came into the hotel around 6am (expecting an early check-in, my fault for not double-checking it was confirmed) without having slept for roughly 76 hours. Again, my fault I had an intentional twelve hour layover in Boston in order to get some exploring in and knew I cannot sleep on planes no matter the quality of my seat. Let's just say hearing my room would not be ready for any additional two hours caused me to breakdown a little. Two hours later, including 30 minute unexpected nap when I finally passed out from exhaustion I went back to the desk to be told my room would not ready until 2pm. Well I gave up that room rather quickly and took whatever one was available. It was a fantastic room! Large, beautifully arranged and with a great bathroom. Once I awoke at noon to meet with my friend who is a Dublin local I immediately apologized to the front desk lady for my gruff demeanor. She could not have been more gracious! 

Now, the location could not be better!! Let me tell you it is literally across the street from the Dublin Writer's museum and O'Connell Street is within view from the corner. Great little cafe next door for simple food but the restaurant and cafe inside was beyond delicious also! You cannot go wrong staying in this history filled, wonderfully kept up Hotel!

Only downside, thin walls and super creaky doors for those guest returning rather late in the evening or early in the morning depending on how you look at it. :)",4,2014,12,14
229,Excellent location,"My partner and I spent the weekend at the Castle Hotel for her birthday.It is a great base to to explore Dublin and would recommend this hotel for a short break.
The staff are very friendly and are most helpful,If you stay there and need a taxi ask for Michael Quinn the man is so helpful and nothing is to much trouble for him,
Thank you Michael for sorting out our problem

229,Great base,"Wife booked this for my 40th and we found ourselves in a room on the second floor. Small but absolutely fine and having a good night sleep was no problem. Bathroom was decent. Only moan is the tv was next to useless for the times we were chilling out before hitting the streets at night. This isnt a boutique hotel but i dont think it needs to be.its old and creaky which is very charming. 
Breakfast was chaos and we waited 40 minutes for what was someone elses order but hey ho.
Brilliant location.great staff and would stay there again. ",4,2014,12,09
229,Excellent location,"Stayed here a weekend in December, the room was really cosy and warm. The breakfast was amazing and the staff were really polite. The only negative I have is the noise. The room above woke us up with the noise of the shower and you could hear their footsteps. All the positives greatly outweigh the negatives. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would definitely go back. ",5,2014,12,09
229,Quaint Hotel close to City centre,"My wife and I spent 2 nights here on a British Airways Flight & Hotel deal. We chose this hotel for 3 reasons: 
1. close to City Centre - it was. Within 5 minutes walk you were in O'Connell Street and Henry Street main shopping areas. 5 more minutes and you were Riverdancing in Temple Bar down by the River Liffey.
2. Breakfast included. We don't like to start the day looking for somewhere to eat. The breakfasts here were served in the modern dining area, or, one morning when we hit the breakfast rush, in the bar/ restaurant in the basement. Delicious 'Full Irish' is recommended. 
3. Live Irish Music. The hotel's website gave the slightly false impression that this was a nightly occurrence, with banjos, fiddles, uilleann pipes, guitars and song. However, not sure whether it's a seasonal thing, but in November, there was just a solo singer on on the Saturday night. That was it. A tad disappointing, but the after-hours singing by the locals went well into the night. Again, this was only experienced on the Saturday. This is not a complaint. We are well-travelled enough to not expect a quiet night on a Saturday in Dublin after a good music session. Sunday was quiet, though.

The hotel is old-fashioned in appearance, but clean, had friendly staff and probably the squeakiest floorboards we've ever come across. Again, this is not a complaint. It actually added to the charm of the place, as did the historical music scores hanging on several walls, to reflect the hotels previous use. Our bedroom was also of old-fashioned decor, but comfortable. The food in the cellar bar restaurant was really good (we ate there both evenings) and would recommend it. We didn't have to reserve a table. A very sumptuous 3 course meal for 2 and bottle of house wine came to just under €60.

We got to the hotel using the 'blue' express airport bus. Advertised on the side of the bus as €6 to the city centre, it was actually €7. It takes just under half an hour. The nearest drop off is 'O'Connell Street' opposite the Gresham Hotel, 200 yards from the Castle Hotel. In hindsight I'd recommend buying a return for €10.

We'd happily use this hotel again if we came back to Dublin.",4,2014,12,06
229,great find,We have just come back from Dublin we stayed at the castle hotel Gardiner row this hotel was great the staff helpful and kind the food was excellent the three nights we stayed there was live music which was very good and great fun the rooms were clean and tidy we had a great time at  this hotel and im hoping to take my daughter therein a few weeks can't wait to return,5,2014,11,30
229,Great City centre hotel,Visited Dublin for three days and stayed at The Castle Hotel. I can honestly say that stay was faultless. A friendly welcome commenced on arrival. This was followed with a impressive room which was clean and equipped with all the essentials. We visited the bar on the first night and this was friendly and welcoming and complimented with some live music. Breakfast on both mornings were first class. I would like to say that all the staff were helpful and welcoming throughout our stay.I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to others looking for a city centre hotel that is excellent value for money. ,5,2014,11,29
229,Great Stay,"We stayed at the Castle Hotel with friends 14-17 November on our trip to Dublin.Everything about the place we found very positive,room(perhaps a little basic,but very comfortable),meals were excellent,evening entertainment very good and staff extremely helpful and friendly.Would certainly recommend the Castle,hopefully returning next year.",5,2014,11,25
229,Very good,Some friends and I stayed here recently for a long weekend. We each had our own room. The rooms were quite small but adequate. The en-suite shower facilities were also good. All in all the rooms were clean and functional. The staff were very friendly and helpful and that contributed in major way to what was a good break. The hotel is well situated and a walk away from the river. We would all stay here again.,4,2014,11,24
229,Basic but friendly ,"My dad and I stayed here on a birthday trip and it was fine for our needs but not great. The girls at reception and all of the restaurant (s) staff were lovely. The food in both was really good but breakfast was chaotic and if you don't eat meat, pretty limited. The walls in our rooms were paper thin and the doors bang very loudly. However they were clean and comfortable even if we were put on different floors?! Overall it's okay but it's shabby and no bath is a bit of a letdown. I would say the staff are bring overshadowed by an interior that needs a vast makeover.",3,2014,11,23
229,"Friendly staff, OK room, average breakfast","The welcome was warm and efficient. The room was fine, fairly basic but the beds were comfortable. The bathroom was clean, but the shower was a fairly miserable dribble. The room was quiet, with a view of offices. The breakfast was OK but their idea of fresh fruit was tinned grapefruit and mandarin oranges. The hot food had been sitting around for some time. Coffee was awful.",3,2014,11,23
229,"Clean, comfortable and good for getting around.","I recently visited Dublin as part of a group of four men. We chose this hotel and managed to get a four bed room.

The room was fairly spacious considering the four beds and was very comfortable. The shower was very good and towells were provided.

We ate in the restaraunt on 2 occasions and could not moan once. Food was good, great portion sizes and good price.

We went into town each day and could reach temple bar in about 10 mins on foot. It is very well located.

Staff were friendly and all in all. i would say this is a good hotel for anybody spending time in Dublin.",4,2014,11,21
229,Decent base. ,"Really quite liked the Castle Hotel. 
Good Irish breakfast, comfy bed and they went out of their way to let us check in at 8:30am and have some sorely needed sleep before our first day in Dublin. 
There are some lovely sitting areas in the communal areas. 
The only slight negative is the hotel bar where the barman was not interested and spent his time on his mobile phone. 
Quiet location a positive. ",4,2014,11,19
229,Fabulous Staff,"We spent 4 nights at The Castle Hotel and found it a really good place to be. We arrived early and were able to check in immediately. My husband had contacted them without my knowledge and arranged for a bottle of champagne and a red rose to be delivered to our room, this wasn't a service they offered but they made it happen, excellent !!! Breakfast was great, a good choice of food and an army of staff on hand for anything you might need. The Music Shop Cafe was great as well for a light lunch and dinner in The Vaults accompanied by live music is to be recommended. The bar staff were always cheerful and the receptionists local knowledge re. transport etc was brilliant. Our room was clean and pleasant. If we ever go to Dublin again we would certainly return to the Castle.",5,2014,11,19
229,Excellent stay,"Celebrated my 50th with dear friends and was not disappointed. Hotel staff were courteous and extremely helpful, food was excellent (value for money), room was of above good standard and more importantly the atmosphere was enjoyable. Not many hotels provide you with breakfast within the costs, well you don't get a breakfast you get a feast!!! You must try their evening meal, because you won't get much better. The owner of the hotel, spends time with the customers which is not often heard of. Castle Hotel is literally three minutes walk away from the town centre. If you can try and book through expedia, we got a great deal. We will certainly be going back.",5,2014,11,18
229,What a find!,"A friendly team met us at the desk when we turned up at 9pm. They even guessed our names from the pre book. Nothing was too much effort! A hotel of real character and charm. This was a business trip, but I would definitely come back as a family vacation. Thank you for a friendly first visit to Ireland :-)",5,2014,11,18
229,Great Dublin location,"Our room for four lacked charm but was a good value for the location and was quiet and clean. The staff was charming and helpful, and the breakfast was delicious. The Castle is a fine recommendation for modest digs in a great location.",5,2014,11,15
229,"""GREAT PLACE/FRIENDLY STAFF""","I was there last April (2014),
I again want to thank the staff, including Pub Staff!  My stay, being a single man traveling by myself, the Castle staff treated me like ""family"".  The front desk staff was quite helpful, the cleaning staff was very good as well!  I would recommend this Hotel to my friends!",5,2014,11,13
229,Brilliant,I just love this hotel. Its the staff that make it. They are fantastic. Especially the bar staff are an absolute credit to the hotel. We always try to stay here on a trip to dublin but it was booked out this weekend so we ended up staying elsewhere but visiting this hotel for a drink as it such a friendly place. We are staying here again in a few weeks for our wedding anniversary and are im really looking forward to it because we have had a lot of great times here over the past 4 years. Top location too & the band that play here at the weekends is just a huge added bonus. Love it.,5,2014,11,08
229,make sure you ask for a room away from the main street,"We stayed here for 3 nights. The first night we were in a  room overlooking O'Connell Street, a very busy street in Dublin. We did not sleep a wink. Next morning we told them about this and they moved us to another room.
The hotel is excellent in terms of location, quality of room(s), breakfast, friendly staff etc.
I would highly recommend the hotel provided you make sure you get a room that does not face onto O'Connell Street.",4,2014,11,08
229,Short break  in Dublin ,"Staff were totally  brilliant,  we had a family  emergency  the day  before  we arrived  and needed  to  stay  an extra  night in Dublin.  This was no problem  for the staff who made sure  everything  ran smoothly.  Breakfast  was massive  and good  quality.  Enjoyed  our visit  will definitely  stay  again. ",5,2014,11,07
229,1st Class,"Lovely hotel, stayed here for 4 nights, Plenty of choice at breakfast time, tables were small, empty cereal bowls could have been taken away to give us more room to eat our cooked breakfast instead of being left until we were ready to leave the table. This hasn't put me off and i would not hesitate to return to this hotel.",5,2014,11,06
229,"Great hotel, great location.","Stayed at this hotel weekend 31st October to 2nd November. A great location, just a short walk up O'Connell street after being dropped off from the airport by airbus.  The room was lovely, room 125 and seemed like a new bathroom.  Very comfortable bed and spacious room, especially for one.  The breakfast was lovely, with plenty of choice of cereals and a fried breakfast as well.  The service was quick from greeting at the breakfast room to pot of coffee being brought to the table.

Although the rooms are a bit of a maze, once you get used to the layout there is no problem.  A lift will carry you up to the upper floors. There is a bar and entertainment in the cellar each night so if you want a sing along this is nice.

i would certainly come back to this hotel. The reception staff were polite and efficient.  A good place to stay for a few days when exploring Dublin. With the main areas of the city just a few minutes walk away you will not go far wrong staying here.",5,2014,11,05
229,Great creaky hotel !,"This is a lovely hotel at the top end of O,Connell St. A very nice cooked breakfast. Stairs and doors creak like mad !!! Just added character to the hotel tho. 
The reception staff are fantastic.. I lost my airport transfer for the return journey, the lady on reception called them up and 5 mins later I had a new copy in my hand, Brilliant !!!!
Room I was in had a paint job, very nice but a fair amount of paint on the door handles was sloppy to say the least.
Would definitely recommend this hotel
Useful tips
Book the Air Coach on line for your transfer only 9 euro return the bus drops you 5 mins from the hotel
Try the hop on hop off Dublin tour bus for only 19 euro each,  get a leaflet from hotel reception, your ticket gives you 2 days travel and discounts for various places of interest like Guiness tour, Jamesons Whiskey tour, Croke Park plus others
For football and sports fans there is a great sports bar on Parnell St only 10 mins walk from hotel called Woolshed Baa and Grill
Temple Bar good for an afternoon beer with good music being played in many busy bars, we went on Monday afternoon and witnessed a great atmosphere, fri n sat nights are manic
Enjoy

229,Disappointing.,"Stayed here from 31st October until 2nd November. The hotel has lovely reception rooms and very friendly helpful staff . The breakfast room was cheerful and bright, the breakfast plentiful and very tasty. There were many staff on hand to help you and make sure you know what you're doing. Went to The Vault bar on the Saturday night and thoroughly enjoyed the entertainment Dino and Catherine. Dino is quite a character and makes you feel welcome.

Sadly there is a 'but' to all this. As mentioned by a previous reviewer the hotel is so hot it is almost unbearable. The weather while we were there was record-breakingly mild and yet the hotel was heated to a stupid degree. Radiators in the corridors and my bedroom were so hot you could hardly touch them without being burnt. I had booked a single room and I have to say that the layout and cleanliness was very good, but it was just so hot. I tried to open the bedroom window but it was jammed shut. Luckily (I thought) the bedroom window was open but I was to find that this was jammed open from the bottom (see photo). As I needed the room to cool down I decided not to contact reception in case they 'fixed' it and that one also jammed shut!! I was able to turn off my radiator and the room gradually cooled down.
The weekend I stayed was Halloween and this is BIG in Dublin. Everyone was out on the streets in costume enjoying themselves and being very noisy and boisterous. My jammed open bathroom window was suddenly not so appealing. If my bed had been out on the street it could not have been any more noisy!
I am sad to have to write a review like this because the hotel is ideally situated for a short visit to Dublin and as I said before the staff were so friendly. Maybe they will sort the windows out and the heat-issue. I think that even in the depths of winter it would have been too hot.",3,2014,11,04
229,Total let down,"We stayed at The Castle Hotel for our 10th wedding anniversary.
The public areas of the hotel were delightful and very in keeping with the Georgian building itself.
However, I cannot say the same for the rest of our experience while we were there.
The hotel room was incredibly hot, and we were unable to completely turn off the radiator. The weather was mild and there was no need to turn the bedroom into a sauna.
The shower was unpredictable and fluctuated between freezing and scalding hot.
The duvet was only fit for the bin, it was well past it's best. Worn and bobbly.
Our 1st morning for breakfast we were seated and coffee brought to our table. We were then left to work out for ourselves that it was self service, which we could not see from where we had been seated.
On checking out of the hotel, there was no ' we hope you enjoyed your stay' they just took our key and that was it.
Being on the main road it was also very noisy, especially as we had to have the windows open to let the heat out.
In summary, the staff lacked any customer service skills.
We would not stay here again,although we plan to return to Dublin, but will find a better hotel than this.
Feel let down as this was a special trip for us",3,2014,11,03
229,A charming period hotel with a warm welcome,"We stayed at this hotel at the end of November and we were very impressed with the very warm welcome we had at reception. We found all the staff including those in the restaurants to be very friendly and accomodating. The hotel is made of of 6 Georgian houses knocked into one and a new extention at the rear. We were given rooms on the very top floor in the old part of the hotel. The rooms were large, very well decorated, warm, and very quiet. The hotel is charming , clean and well presented. It is only a very short walk from the main street so is in an ideal location. 
 Breakfast was very good and plentiful. We ate in the Vault restaurant in the basement and really could not fault what we had. It was around 25 euros for 3 courses with a free baileys or irish coffee. We were all well and truely stuffed as the portions were generous and the food quality was very good.
  The only fault with the hotel is that in some parts of the hotel the management need to keep an eye on some of the maintenance carried out. Some of the maintenance/repairs to dado rails and  the stair bannisters were a bit ""Fawlty Towers"" which I thinks spoils the otherwise excellent overall presentation of this hotel. Also the hot water tap  dispensed some extremely hot water which could easily scald. Having said that would we return to this hotel again. Absolutely. Thanks to all the great staff for giving us a lovely stay.",4,2014,11,03
229,Lovely hotel,Stayed for three nights with my brother. Lovely hotel with a lot of charm. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Only bad things I would say is that my brothers room was boiling hot while my room was cold. Also my shower was a little dodgy. All in all though a very lovely hotel with a great location. ,4,2014,11,02
229,Very friendly,"The hotel is a 5 minute walk from the spire so very convenient for all buses. On arrival all staff very friendly. Room very clean, bed changed daily and towels which although a great touch must cost the hotel lots in laundry bills. Wifi free and good signal. Our only gripe was the creaky floor boards in the room above our room of 321 and our son's room. The first 3 nights sounded like a tribe of elephants were having a rave, started at 10pm and went on for over an hour, the same idiots then woke at 5am and started again from then until 7.30 when they went for breakfast. All staff in breakfast room were very polite. 
Breakfast was good, plenty to choose from, we found it better to sit downstairs as normal breakfast room was very hot and at 9.30 exceptionally busy. Much cooler and lots of room. Bed was comfy and I'm quite fussy about mattresses being firm so was pleased to have a firm mattress. We met the owner on our last day, what a nice man, we had seen him at points during our stay and he was always chatting with guests and he seemed to really appreciate his staff. I would recommend the hotel but if I were to return ask for a top room so no noise from above. I appreciate it's a Georgian building so it's not that easy to stop boards from wearing but if you stay in a room and you know the boards squeak when you walk on them why would you deliberately keep walking on them hour by hour? Our stay was lovely but only spoilt by the inconsiderate morons in the room above.",4,2014,10,31
229,Charming,"We came to Dublin for a short break and The Castle Hotel is a lovely hotel, excellent value for money with exceptional staff, very accommodating. Great breakfast. It is a little walk to the main shopping areas and Temple Bar, but we enjoyed the stroll and it was nice to stay in a quieter place. Great location to visit Croake Park.  Thank you for a lovely stay. ",4,2014,10,31
229,Great Hotel,"I stayed 3 nights in The Castle Hotel and thoroughly enjoyed it. The building is old but if you really look you can see that it is cared for and the furnishings in the public areas add to the charm.  The bed was really comfortable and we had no trouble with noise from the street.  The only complaint I have about the room is the size of the towels - but I survived.

This hotel is clearly popular and at breakfast time they earned extra points for me.  There were plenty of staff keeping tables clear and bringing teas/coffees and the quality of the food was great.

Location was really key for me.  We were close to everything we needed - restaurants, bars, shops and transport.  The weather was kind to us and we were able to freely walk around and explore.

We will return as there is a lot to see in Dublin and will have no hesitation staying in the Castle Hotel again.",4,2014,10,31
229,lovely hotel,"a really lovely hotel, good location near everything, good breakfast in a beautiful room with great decoration, very clean room, great bathroom, staff on reception very helpful would definitely stay again",4,2014,10,30
229,Business visit,"Good location for sight seeing. Room was cold and the street noisy. I had to look back at the on line pictures as it didn't feel like what I was expecting. Yes it looks like the pictures but up close it's ageing.

So not what I thought it would be. At 90 euros a bit overpriced I think. ",3,2014,10,29
229,Fantastic place with super friendly & helpful staff!,"Really enjoyed our 2 night stay at this lovely comfortable gem in the heart of Dublin.

It's in a superb location, maybe 10 minutes walk from Temple Bar but far enough away to allow a quiet restful nights sleep.

On arrival we were greated with friendly smiles & throughout our stay, all the staff were super keen to help you out & make you feel at home.

The room itself was airy & comfortable. Not huge but more than enough space for 2 plus luggage etc. We had a room on top floor & only down side was the dribble of a shower that went from boiling to tepid at the lightest tough (please look at this Management of hotel as this could be big sore point for some in an otherwise perfect stay!). 

Breakfast was delicious - choice of cereal, fruit, pastries & full irish breakfast served in a beautiful airy fresh dining room.

There was also a cellar bar which hosted irish music each night. Though you are  rarely stuck for entertainment in Dublin, it was nice to have a late drink in the bar on the first night when we weren't quite ready for bed but feeling the toll of a busy week at work followed by a day of travelling. 

Overall felt very relaxed & thoroughly enjoyed staying here. Would definitely recommend. ",4,2014,10,27
229,Very good position lovely rooms great place to stay to discover Dublin,"Lovely hotel very nice room , pleasant friendly staff great position from which to explore Dublin . Evening entertainment in bar of Irish music . Would recommend position off Connell street . Nice eating area flexible on early continental breakfast when leaving early and late arrival back car park at rear .",5,2014,10,27
229,Nice hotel in a good location,"walking distance from anywhere you'd want to go, it is a very nice Victorian looking hotel with a nice eating area and a basement bar. 

I can't really think of anything to complain about.

Or anything  else to write in this review.

229,Boutique Hotel In Dublin Makes You Feel Right At Home!,"This hotel has a great location, right off of O'Connell Street, a major thruway, leading to all the destinations you need.
The hotel arranged a taxi to pick us up at the airport and he was a great guy. Try and request his services. His name is WIlliam (Will).
Entering the hotel, you are greeted by very welcoming staff with smiles and warmth.
Our room was comfortable, with a large bed that was also very comfortable. A tea/coffee maker in the room is a nice plus.
Walking around the hotel, you find an old-fashioned parlor with soft, cushiony couches and chairs which invite you to sit and relax. Also in the parlor is a computer and printer for your use (printing future boarding passes and such).
Breakfast was wonderful, basically offering a full ""Irish"" Breakfast with hot and cold selections, from eggs, hash browns, grilled tomatoes, beans, bacon, cereals, yogurt, juices, coffee and tea. Very, very nice start to our day.
Downstairs in the basement is a restaurant/pub featuring LIVE entertainment at least THURS thru SUN....they were great...lots of fun, drinks, singing and laughter.
The hotel manager, Yvonne and her staff including Melissa had been great in advance with email confirmations, answering our questions and assuring us that everything would be set . And it was. Yvonne was incredibly giving of advice as to what to see and where to go.
Our taxi man from the first day, (Will), offers one-day tours as well. We took him up on this and it was the highlight of our visit to Ireland.
Will's price for the entire day was very fair and so much better than a tour-bus tour. He took us to spots that he had gone to on his own or with his wife and kids. Up into the Dublin mountains, pubs, small towns, the seaside for fish and chips (amazing fun). Will was all too willing (no pun)....to take pictures of me and my wife. He truly became a friend in no time at all.
I think I have more pictures of him and my wife or of him and me, then of the two of us!!
After a full day (which included the best scones with jam & cream, I've ever had (due to Will's recommendation), we were delivered safely back to the hotel.
The bus system is right around the corner so we could enjoy Dublin on our own as well.
We also were given simple directions to the ""DART"" train system, which allowed us to travel again on our own, further out of the city.
We would gladly stay at ""The Castle"", next time in Dublin and can only hope that there is a room available, that Yvonne is still running the place and that Will is still doing tours!
Thanks everyone associated with ""The Castle"".

229,last visit to castle hotel,"we have just returned from a visit to beautiful Ireland, we loved going home but unfortunately our stay at the hotel was not good, the room did its job, restaurant staff and meals were excellent now for the negatives, we arrived after a stressful journey to be greeted by a rude receptionist as there was a confusion withhotel the price of our room, this was not handled well, the breakfast was cold and not worth the money I asked for a boiled egg and got a cold boiled egg which had been cooked and left in a basket, there was a strong smell of paint as they were decorating the rooms near us, before you book at this hotel I suggest you read the reviews we wish we had done, sorry castle we will not be returning to stay with you we will find another",3,2014,10,23
229,Lovely hotel in a central location,"Just returned from a four day trip to Dublin.  The Castle Hotel is lovely, spotlessly clean and with helpful staff.  We ate in the restaurant twice and as a previous reviewer has mentioned, were surprised by the quality of the food.  They had Irish singers and musicians each night at the hotel which was very enjoyable.  The hotel is close to O'Connell Street with shops and restaurants and not too far from the Temple Bar area.  The airport bus drop off/collection point is a two minute walk away.",5,2014,10,23
229,"Good Location, Great Staff and Food","Had a great stay at the Castle Hotel in Dublin. Staff was very friendly, food was great and the location was good. The rooms were clean and the hotel was close to downtown and bus stop. I would stay there again.",4,2014,10,23
229,"Wonderful staff, great location, fun pub, fantastic food!","Most of my immediate family was in Dublin for the Penn State vs UCF game on August 30 (Go State!). The hotel staff gave us a lot of attention even though the hotel was sold out with crazy college football fans. We loved the breakfasts in the Old Music Shop, which is a delightful restaurant for the morning - bright and airy. The pub had great drinks and even better music - Ray Cox!! We celebrated my dad's 84th birthday in The Castle Vaults. The food was excellent and our server, Ramona, was so sweet to help us with the cake and the singing.

The location is perfect. We got to know O'Connell Street very well. The walk to Temple Bar was only about 15 minutes.

The only issue we had was with the Wifi (my laptop could never get a strong connection). I was able to talk to their managed service provider who explained what the problem probably was but we were leaving the next day. 

I would definitely stay again. We really enjoyed our stay.

TIP: Take the DART to Howth for the day. It takes only 20 minutes to get there. This small coastal town is beautiful. If you go, visit Alan McCleod at his West Pier Art Studio. He is a wonderful artist.",4,2014,10,22
229,"Good Hotel with Potential, But Right Now a Little Rundown","Hotel is close to a big and busy shopping area in Dublin, which is good, but is also too close for comfort to some of the not that nice areas of the city, which is bad. The hotel is also close to some good restaurants. The room we got was old and kind of crummy, but some friends got a better room so I think it is just luck. The hotel has an interesting set-up, beautiful inside architecture but  it appears to be the product of starting at the corner property and then expanding by buying adjacent properties, which gives it a unique footprint but it is easy to get lost (we had to go through several doors and smalls steps to get in and out of our room, and good luck finding the elevator!)

Where is the potential? Well, we were having a casual supper at the newly renovated casual dinning room (very nice, and excellent food) and the owner of the hotel was kind enough to sit with us and explain his vision and talk about all the money he is putting in and the shortcomings he wants to fix, he basically agreed with our views. If this is achieved, this will be a splendid hotel

But overall is a good value, relatively close to the airport and affordable",3,2014,10,22
229,It certainly does the job,"We booked through Expedia (Never having previously visited Dublin) and this Hotel was excellent value for money. The Breakfasts were excellent, Service was always good and it is conveniently situated close to what Dublin has to offer. Personally I seriously recommend this hotel.",4,2014,10,22
229,A lovely place to stay,"We were only at the hotel for a night - too short. Wonderful helpful staff and in easy reach of the city centre. The only negative is the lack of easy to park off road parking.

229,Not Bad,"This is  a relly charming hotel, the breakfast is good (a full Irish always goes down well) as is the hotel bar and resturant.
The rooms were clean and well maintained, however the bed wasnt comfortable and the walls are paper thin, you can hear everything.
The staff are welcoming though and the hotel has great style in keeping Georgian building.",3,2014,10,18
229,Within walking distance of everything,"Old charming hotel with a lot of character. We had a large room with a fireplace and a skylight.
Various parts of the hotel with elevators and winding staircases.
There is a tavern in the basement with an arched ceiling and nightly music.
There is a secure courtyard for car parking but very limited.
The only negative thing that i can say is that they serve breakfast every morning but its the same items every morning and not very good.
The staff is very friendly and helpful
Very close to Temple Bar, Grafton Street and all major attractions.",4,2014,10,13
229,Great place,"Great old hotel.  A few worn out bits but for the price it is fab. Im fussy and it worked great for me. Comfortable rooms which where cleaned very well.  Good facilities tea, toiletries etc. Breakfast was not the biggest selection but ample and of good quality.  Friend polite and helpful.  We decided to Eat in the restaurant one night.  Exelent quality and portion size.  Very well priced.  Thoroughly enjoyed my stay. ",5,2014,10,09
229,Good location - nice hotel!,"The Castle Hotel is at the to of O'Connell Street so it is not too far to walk to any of the sights. There is a hop on / hop off bus stop literally around the corner, which is good for getting around in a cost effective way. 
The breakfast is of a reasonable standard, but I recommend that you sit downstairs where they take your order and bring it to you. If you are upstairs you have to queue at the buffet. Food in the evening was a bit of a disappointment, we booked a table but there were no tables so we had to sit in the bar next to the live music. It took and hour to get the starters served, which is far too long. There was one female waitress downstairs and she was run ragged. When it did eventually arrive the food was okay, nothing more nothing less.
The bar staff were great. I didn't get his name but one barman in particular was a good laugh and helped our evenings along nicely. The basement bar has a good atmosphere with the usual live Irish music being played.
The rooms are basic but more than adequate for the time we spent in them. There was a bit of noise from the corridor as it is an old building but nothing to worry about. We asked for a quiet room and were located overlooking the car park / courtyard, which protected us from the sounds of traffic, etc that might perhaps come from a room over the main road. 
The reception staff were also pleasant, friendly and helpful.
There is a computer linked to the internet and a printer just behind the foyer area, which was free to use and very useful for booking and printing boarding passes in advance.
If you are going to Croke Park it is ideally placed. 
I would definitely use the Castle Hotel again.",4,2014,10,09
229,A grand experience again,"I stayed at the Castle Hotel in September of this year.  I have stayed there before on different occasions and have never been disappointed.  I love its location because I love to walk and explore.   Many Dublin attractions are within walking distance of the hotel and the staff are only too willing to make suggestions, and no question seemed too much for them.   Very welcoming and friendly both at reception and throughout the hotel.    The full Irish breakfast is huge !   Their newest restaurant, called the Old Music Shop Restaurant (giving a nod to Waltons Music Shop) was formally opened while I was there in the presence of a huge crowd.    Open from breakfast through dinner,  and has a very attentive staff.  Public transport is easily accessible as are the rail stations. All round, no complaints and felt content and relaxed during my stay.",5,2014,10,08
229,Would go back!,"Compact rooms, but clean and pleasant although we found it very warm to sleep at night, even with windows open. A creaky floorboard hotel LOL...but it was built in the 1800's so it had the character you'd expect. A short walk to O'Connell St...so a great location! The reception staff were excellent and showed great customer service, as did the bar and wait staff at the Vault restaurant where we dined every evening for the duration of our 3 day stay. Really lovely meals. The Irish entertainment provided on two of the nights we were there was awesome. If we return to Dublin I would definitely stay at the Castle again.",4,2014,10,07
229,Charming Hotel,"Stayed Oct. 2-6 of this year.  We really enjoyed the location; a nice walk to every place we wanted to go.  The breakfast was great!  I also really liked the charming old furniture and decor.  Only downside was the walls were a little thin and the room next to us was being worked on a couple of the mornings... not great for sleeping past 8:00.  You could also hear the voices of any other guests in the hallways.  All things considered, I would return.",4,2014,10,07
229,Great Location,"The hotel is in a great location for visiting Dublin on foot. It had private parking at extra cost but was necessary for us. The room was adequate though rather dull and the WiFi was erratic. Breakfast buffet was a bit of a bun fight as so many guests turned up at the same time and the quality was not that great but the service was good. The reception staff were friendly.
Recommended for a couple of nights to see Dublin.",3,2014,10,07
229,Would return,Three day trip for folks wedding anniversary.  Great location close to the city centre just off oconnell st and few mins walk from where the bus drops you from the airport. Basic but clean and comfy rooms. Top notch breakfast served. Well worth booking a table in the castle vaults restaurant.  Good food with live entertainment thurs to sun. Free wifi is always a bonus,4,2014,10,05
229,Enjoyable stay,"We stayed at the Castle Hotel for two nights as part of a five night trip to Ireland, which included Cork and Blarney Castle. The hotel is just off the upper part of O'Connell St. and so is quite central. The hotel is lovely. The main entrance is the first of four Georgian houses that has  apparently been acquired by the hotel. (This was according to the tour guide on the hop on hop off bus tour)
The reception rooms are tastefully and sympathetically restored and our bedroom was quite charming. Everything worked and as I had requested a back room our view out of the corner window was of the courtyard car park. It was worth it as we were able to enjoy a quiet nights rest. I believe the front bedrooms can be quite noisy as O'Connell St is very close by and very busy until quite late. The beds are comfortable, our room had a double and a single bed , so there was plenty of room for my sister and myself.
Reception staff are pleasant and personable. Our room was cleaned daily with fresh towels and coffee/tea tray replenished. Breakfast was  included in the price of 163.00 euros for two nights and is served in a room just off the main reception area. Its a buffet style but with lots of  very pleasant staff available  to clear dishes and bring tea/coffee. Breakfast was good and will set you up for a day of sight seeing. 
We took in a night down in the bar with live music and really enjoyed it. Drinks are a bit pricey but then we found that most of Ireland is fairly expensive.
There is a computer available  for free on a first come basis although there is also Wi-Fi available.
We really enjoyed our stay here and would definitely return",4,2014,10,05
229,Very Disappointing way to end our trip,"We finished our trip in Dublin with 3 nights at the Castle Hotel. Their website was very professional for booking, and our reservation was right when we got their. Check in was a very easy process. Parking was surprisingly cheap. It was only 10 Euro a night, and very secure. Great value in a big city like Dublin. The hotel is at the top of O'Connell street, and the heart of Dublin is very walkable from here.

I will preface this with the fact that it takes a lot for me to be disappointed enough to write a bad review. I find most peoples complaints on Tripadvisor to be childish and full of self entitlement. I feel that when you travel, you have to adapt to the are you are visiting.

The disappointment started when we got to our 1st floor room. It was located just above the bar and restaurant. It was very loud, and we barely slept a wink the first night. We asked to be moved, but the hotel was sold out. We were able to move rooms the next day, which required packing everything back up, but well worth it in theory. The front desk even took care of getting our bags moved for us while we were out on the town.

When we came back and got our new keys, we were moved to the top floor. The room smelled like an old smoking room when we walked in. We sat on the bed and my wife noticed a small blood stain on the corner of the sheet. We immediately called the front desk to ask for a few room, and complained about the smoky smell and the blood stain. Again, the hotel was fully booked and we couldn't move rooms. They immediately sent house keeping to change the sheets. 

Another weird thing was that there was never a fitted sheet on the bed.. you slept directly on the mattress cover. That seemed rather odd to us. The shower went in waves of scalding to lukewarm to cold and back around again. There was also hair stuck to the shower walls from previous guests. 

This hotel is badly in need of an update and some modernization. The quality of work housekeeping is doing should also be looked at. It was over 150 Euro a night, and it was far from the best stay we had.",2,2014,10,05
229,Faded Glory,"The Castle Hotel is an odd mish mash of old Georgian buildings, roughly joined together at a variety of levels. Not a place for those of limited mobility, the place is a labyrinth of passageways and creaky stairs. Most clean and comfortable, the decor is of the ""let's give it a coat of paint to freshen it up"" type. Rooms vary greatly in size, shape and facilities. The big problem for me and my family (4 separate rooms) was the room noise - this is a busy, noisy city, and its proximity to a major junction on the main road north, off O'Connell Street means that a night of unbroken sleep was a rare commodity.

Reception staff were friendly and helpful, whilst the plentiful staff at breakfast seemed to wander around without direction, leaving tables uncleared and guests unattended. The food choice was reasonable, but much more attention needs to be paid to presentation - lukewarm bacon, cold toast and wet scrambled egg is never nice.

There is a comfortable and traditional bar downstairs (more creaky stairs) with a good range of drinks and ""proper"" Irish music, which was a bonus. The restaurant appears to be reasonably priced, but the distinctly average breakfast meant we didn't sample it. We chose to either walk to the city (about 15 mins) or catch a bus.

Overall, it's Dublin in a nutshell. Bags of old charm, but needs some serious, directed investment to bring it into the 21st Century.",3,2014,10,05
229,A great 5 night stay,"A clean , very welcoming hotel . Victorian in style in some areas. Staff very good and helpful. 
Good entertainment in The Vaults . Food  simple, good . 
Could have done with more choice , but you don't have to eat in every night . Very central to the bus stops for the City and Tours . Will definitely stay there again .",4,2014,10,04
229,Nothing to complain about,"We were a group of 7 people and we had a wonderful 3-day stay at the hotel.  It´s situated in a good location, 5 mins walk from the  Airlink bus stop, shops, restaurants, cinemas and pubs nearby. We watched a great film Noble at the Savoy which was just a short walk from the hotel. The hotel is also not far from the Temple bar area. Central but away from the loud party area. Personnel are especially friendly and helpful, breakfast was adequate. We had quiet rooms facing the courtyard and parking lot, so we had no problem sleeping, except one of us who had a single room facing the street.  But she managed to change the room the next day without any problem although the hotel was fully booked that weekend.  We booked the early bird dinner on our first night and food and service was wonderful.  The best was the live music at the bar.  Very good singers on both nights, it was great sitting at the bar to listen to the music after a long day of walking and sightseeing, and not having to go far to our rooms after that.",4,2014,10,03
229,Comfortable & Great Location,"We stayed at this hotel after our first day in Ireland. The hotel is well situated for easy walking to good shopping locations, catching Dublin bus tours & travelling on foot down to Temple Bar. The Hotel is nicely furnished, staff warm & welcoming. We were able to get car parking at the rear of the hotel. Our room was clean with very good ensuite facilities including a bath. Our bed was most comfortable. A very good breakfast selection was available in the dining room, including availability of a full Irish breakfast.",5,2014,10,02
229,Pros and Cons,"Another hotel inexplicably canceled our confirmed reservation, and at the last minute our travel agent was able to book two rooms for two nights at Castle Hotel in September, not an easy feat.  We found the hotel to be centrally located (on the outer edge of an upscale area) and priced well, the employees were nice, the restaurant's food was very good, and the entertainment in the pub was excellent.  

That's the good news. Unfortunately, there is bad news too.  Our rooms were a disappointment.  While our bathroom was recently redone and was nice, our shabby bedroom was badly in need of refurbishing also. During our three-week trip, our twin mattresses, which sank in the middle, with their skimpy pillows were the most uncomfortable we slept on.  The room was hot; we could not get a breeze, even with the window open.  In addition, we were on the fourth floor on the front of the building, and the traffic noise made it difficult to get to sleep. Our traveling companions had an inside room, so they didn't encounter the noise problem, but their room had had no remodeling done.  It was not only ""tired and worn,"" it also was dirty.

While the employees were pleasant, there were not enough of them to serve the number of guests at the hotel.  Maintenance was an issue, also.  We came back to the hotel the second night to find that the elevator was broken, and we had to walk four flights up to our room.  Usually, this would not have been a huge concern. but unluckily, I had  developed a case of the flu, and by the time I got to the hotel, I could barely stand up much less climb stairs.  I did do so though, one excrutiating step at a time! Then in the middle of the night, my husband got sick too.  We checked out the next morning, the elevator was still broken, and since we couldn't get help with our bags, we had to get them downstairs ourselves.  By this time the ""cons"" outweighed the ""pros,"" and we were relieved to check out and be on our way. Our flu lasted three days, and we recuperated one night at the Limerick Strand Hotel and two nights at the Pax House in Dingle, excellent accommodations, but those are for other reviews!

A guest's experience at this hotel is determined by whether the room is in a quiet location and has been updated.  There are certainly nice features to this hotel, but unfortunately, we were not able to get rooms at the last minute that would have insured a first-class stay, one I am sure the managment would have liked for us to have had.",3,2014,10,01
229,Wonderful Stay!!,"The Castle Hotel was just perfect for me! The staff were so helpful and friendly. Suzanne, Sarah, and all the front desk staff made me feel like I was home. I traveled alone, and felt very safe there. I had a fantastic room, updated bathroom, and a great view as well. The breakfast had many options, from the traditional Irish, to fruit and cereal. It's also located very close to the city center, so I did most of my sight seeing in the city by foot. Micheal from security, would always ask how I was when I saw him and when it was time for me to leave. He made sure I made it to the airport safely. He also drives a cab and gave me a great, flat rate!. All and all, I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else when I visit Dublin again!",5,2014,09,29
229,Wonderful time,"Just arrived home from staying at this hotel, staff amazing, location absolutely brilliant, lovely clean rooms towels change every day, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here, would really recommend d it to anyone visiting Dublin, thank you.",5,2014,09,25
229,good location,"hotel at a very good location, the room was big and clean
personal at the reception was very frindly
easy check in and check out after prebooking on easytobook
breakfast room is to small for the amount of people",4,2014,09,24
229,Fab Weekend,"Just got back from a great weekend in Dublin, had a wonderful stay at the Castle Hotel the staff were friendly and the owner was a real gent,  would defiantly go back there again and recommend to anyone looking for a relaxing stay in Dublin.",4,2014,09,23
229,Excellent stay,"The hotel is five minutes stroll from O'Connell Street, ten minutes from O'Connell Bridge and Temple Bar.  All this is in a straight line, so you're not likely to get lost.

I emailed the hotel before my arrival to tell them that the trip was to celebrate our wedding anniversary (I wanted a late check out on the day itself) and I'm not sure whether it was because of this that despite paying the lowest rate we were treated to a four-poster bed (room 107).  The room was on the front, so it was a little noisy from the road but it wasn't enough to disturb us during the night.

The breakfast was a served buffet, but it was a bit of a lottery as to whether there were all options available.  They served fried eggs, but I never timed it right to catch them, and hash browns were another thing I missed out on one morning.  Everything was served fresh and tasty, and the staff were really friendly and keen to help.

The entertainment in the bar is not a late-night deal, the last song tended to be around 11pm, but the acts we saw (entertainment is Wednesday to Sunday nights) were excellent.  If you miss them, or don't want to walk back up the hill to see them, then virtually every bar in town has live music so you don't have to miss out.

All in all, an excellent spot to stay and thoroughly recommended.",5,2014,09,19
229,Woeful wifi but good on the whole,I stayed here last night as it was very handy for the part of the city I was in today. For some reason Dublin was 91% occupied last night so this was one of very few hotels available. The room was small but fine for my needs. It was comfortable but the TV was a tiny portable. There was free entertainment in the bar (as there is every Wednesday and Saturday) and Ray the balladeer had the audience in the palm of his hand - he was very good. Breakfast was pleasant but the wifi was simply attrocious - kicking me out continually and very slow when it was working. No wifi would have been better (it was offered free which is good but it's next to useless). Very handy for the city centre and I would guess normally good value though it was a high price last night due to the 91% occupancy. I'll go back again on another Wednesday night in particular to hear Ray's set again.,3,2014,09,18
229,Brilliant location!,"This hotel ticks all the boxes! Brilliant location! Staff are really friendly, great food and the bar is lovely!

Great value for money and perfect for all types of accommodation requirements, whether travelling alone or in couples! 

Big yes from me!!!!!
",4,2014,09,16
229,Lovely hotel in a great area,"We had a fantastic stay.  Arrived early on day one and staff happily stored our luggage until we could check in in the afternoon - same on the last day, so we gained two extra days to look around. Staff were so helpful and so nice.  Our room was lovely and we had no noise (or cooking smells) problems.  It overlooked the courtyard and was very, very quiet and surprisingly large for such an old building.  Our shower worked perfectly (again a change for older hotels) and our bed was very comfortable.  If I had to be nit-picking there was not a lot of storage space and the wifi connection kept drifting on and off but, again, if you stay in an old hotel with character these are things you come to expect and live with quite happily.  Breakfasts were absolutely lovely and you never felt rushed.  On the Wednesday evening we ate in the Vault restaurant of the hotel.  The food was very good and the folk singer entertainer was superb. We especially ate in to see him and we were not disappointed.  Position of hotel for city was excellent and they even provided bright sunshine and warm weather for us!  All in all, a great stay.",5,2014,09,16
229,"Nice older hotel, excellent staff and good location","Just spent a week at the Castle Hotel in Dublin, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a central location that is affordable.  The staff were very friendly and helpful, especially in the pub/restaurant downstairs.  The room was small but very clean.  Furnishings are older but adequate and not too beat up.  If you are used to travel in Europe on a budget, then you will find the Castle just fine.  The location is very good-only about two blocks to the Gresham, where a lot of day tours leave from, and where the Aircoach picks up and drops off from the airport.  The pub downstairs is cozy and when I was there had quite a few locals in attendance on a couple of nights.  They also have live music every night which is nice.  My room was on the first floor and the music was sort of loud but they knock off around 10 or so, so I wasn't disturbed.  Breakfast was lovely-full Irish with a lot of choices.  All in all, a good experience.",4,2014,09,15
229,castle hotel reviewed,"Stayed at the Castle Hotel from 8 Sept 2014 to 14 sept. Our room only had a shower but we were given the choice of 2 others, we chose Rm 123, very nice. Breakfast great as was food in Vaults resturant.  All staff were great. Very happy. good location . would love to go back.  Reception could do with updating. Perhaps desk in front of window on left side would give more room in reception area. Ray Cox provided good entertainment in the vaults pub.  Stair banister loose and needs stabelising. Health and Safety.  All meals taken at hotel were excellent and good value. On bus route to all sight seeing needs. Lots of road works in the city centre though. But not a problem really. Staff need training in how to deal with Germans as our incident in the dining room Friday morning was not good we had to move tables becourse a Germs bloke wanted it for his friends. naughty.",4,2014,09,15
229,Not too bad ,"Just stayed for three nights. First night in room 121, straight above kitchen vents and you end up smelling like roast beef!! Moved into another room the next day , much better but only a few TV channels with sound !! We had left the phone charger in the first room but it took the staff two days to retrieve it? 
Good points , good location, good breakfast, nice and clean. 
Bad points, needs to upgrade the tiny TVs, lifts were a little dodgy, people stuck in them, there was an elderly French guy there that had a problem but the staff on reception could not help as they didn't 'understand'!! 
",3,2014,09,13
229,Can highly reccomend,"Four of us have just come back from a lovely stay at the Castle Hotel, were we had no complaints at all, the rooms we had were clean and comfortable, the hotel just off O`Connell Street was only a few minutes from the temple bar area but in a quiet area. The breakfast was fantastic, freshly cooked, tasty and you could have as much as you want, in all I would highly recommend staying here.",5,2014,09,12
229,Quaint hotel,"We picked this hotel because it was reasonably priced, walking distance to everything, and it had  the 'old world charm' we were looking for on a trip to Ireland. We were not disappointed; it was a lovely little hotel. Yes, it is older, but that's part of the charm. The staff were wonderful. We got a family room on the top floor and we were really amazed at the size of the room. There were 5 beds! Some people said it wasn't a good part of town, but we didn't find any concerns and we were four women traveling together. There is a church on the corner and the remembrance garden on the other corner.  The restaurant in the cellar has nice ambiance and good food and we enjoyed live music the night we were there.",4,2014,09,10
229,"Hotel was nice, but don't get Room 315!","We stayed at the Castle Hotel from 8/28 to 9/2. My sister stayed in 316, and my wife and I stayed in Room 315.  Our room was a decent size and clean, the hotel breakfasts and wait staff were good, the housekeeping service was good and the front desk staff, especially Alison, Melissa and Ruksha, were very good and were very helpful answering email questions before our trip. The reason that I'm not giving the hotel a higher rating is primarily due to 2 problems with our room that we brought to the hotel's attention which were not fixed. 1) After flushing, the toilet took 20 minutes to fill back up. Besides the inconvenience of the other person in the room having to wait 20 minutes to use the toilet, we had to listen to it for 20 minutes whenever we used it during the night. We were told that maintenance looked at the toilet (twice), and since it eventually filled up, the toilet was ok (20 minutes was acceptable). We ran into the hotel's owner and told him about this problem, and he gave us some story about his ongoing troubles with the city's water authority. We doubted this was the problem since the toilet in my sister's room next door worked fine.   2) Our room was supposed to have wi-fi, which it did on the first day of our stay.  When I couldn't get wi-fi on the 2nd day, I told the front desk, who told me that someone had been in to work on the hotel's wi-fi system and made some adjustments. I mentioned my lack of wi-fi each day, and yet nothing was done to fix it.  On our last day at the hotel, the hotel manager saw my wife on the stairs, trying to get a wi-fi signal, and shortly afterwards the front desk admitted that there had been a problem with the wi-fi and that they would fix it immediately. We could still not get wi-fi in Room 315 by the time we left. By the way, my sister had wi-fi in Room 316 the entire time we were there.
Some other issues we had with Room 315 that didn't affect our rating included the fact that the bed was against the thin wall next to the stairwell, which was very creaky and we could hear when anyone went up and down the steps. Also, the TV in Room 315 could only get 2 channels, one of which was a kids channel and the other one was infomercials. The TV in Room 316 could get more channels, specifically news and weather.
I would have liked to be able to recommend this hotel to others, but after 6 days of management deciding that my room problems were not worth fixing, I just can't.  Hope you have better luck. Just make sure you don't get Room 315!",2,2014,09,10
229,Very nice,"We've just stayed for two nights at the Castle Hotel, great location with off road parking at the rear of the hotel. The hotel is very clean and it mixes the old with the modern very well. Room was a bit on the small side but very clean and well presented, great staff too. The bar was good for a drink but I wouldn't eat there as you will find much better for the money elsewhere! Excellent breakfast. 
All in all very good and would stay again if driving!",4,2014,09,09
229,Lacking trust in customers as no keys are handed out,"I was staying at the Castle Hotel from Monday till Friday. There were three incidents, two minor, one major. I'm going to talk about the minor issues first. 

As breakfast is included, you have the choice between several menus. Unfortunately, as it is very busy in the morning you are likely to wait more than 10 minutes for a waiter to come to your table for you to place your order. I handled it by going to the waiters themselves and placing the order there.

Also at breakfast time when I wanted to get some cereals, they ran out of bowls. I asked one of the waitresses whether I could get another bowl. She said that this should happen shortly, so I waited. But she didn't tell anyone, she refilled the cereals as if she had all the time in the world. After some time I left without cereals.

Now to the major issue. On thursday I wanted a long-term female friend to come over. So I asked at the reception whether it's okay to have friends over for a few hours, because I have never had friends over within that time period before. She said, that this should be no problem at all. So far so good. The hotel has a policy that requires guests to hand over the keys when they leave and to get those keys when they arrive again. Apart from the occasional checking-in and checking-out procedures, this is the only task they have to accomplish. Within a few seconds this procedure worked every single time before Thursday. And I really mean every single time. But exactly at the moment when I was there with my female friend for the first time and I told them the room number the same way I did before, they said that they couldn't find it. It took them seemingly more than 15 min. to not find the key. So again, I have never had a visitor before in this hotel and at the very moment that she is with me they have ""trouble"" finding the key, basically the only task these people are being given? My friend became more and more angry and upset, finally she left. And all of a sudden one of the girls behind the desk - after searching for additional 10 minutes - offered me to fetch a replacement key. Which she should have given me immediately after searching for 30 seconds or less. I did not even know that a replacement key existed, it was their responsibility to know and get it immediately once they cannot find the key. To fetch the ""new"" key it again took her about 10 minutes till I finally got it. I cannot say whether it was a replacement key that she got from the cellar or the original key that magically appeared once my friend left. Needless to say my friend didn't want to come to this hotel again. The icing on the cake was that they did not even say sorry for not finding the key. They just didn't care. I want to add that I am white and my friend is black. Now put one and one together.

This incidence is the reason for me to never stay there again. The girls who ""couldn't find the key"" are still working there so you are likely to meet them if you go there.",1,2014,09,09
229,excellent staff,"My wife and I stayed 3 nights at this hotel along with two other couples. We requested a courtyard room and was pleased that we did. The two other rooms were on the main road, across from the church. They indicated that they could not sleep and were happy to leave. The beds in the two rooms were uneven, b with the footboard higher than the headboard. The courtyard side room was comfortable. The staff were very friendly and most helpful with recommendations and ordering cabs for us.  Overall if you stay at this hotel, ask for a courtside room.",4,2014,09,07
229,Fantasic stay,This Hotel is well worth a visit very friendly and very helpful staff bar restaurant excellent food  with a 3 course meal happy hour from 5-7pm price at 20 euros with normal menu available at a very reasonable price entertainment from Wednesday to sunday with good singers and musicians the short walk to the centre is 5mins max and Dublin its self with its attractions was excellent so looking for a good weekend break then pick this hotel well worth its value. By the way is a georgean hotel.,5,2014,09,03
229,first stay at castle hotel,"Stayed at castle hotel for 6 days with my husband which was his first holiday in Dublin,overall our stay was good,the  breakfast was good plenty of choice on the full irish,but very disappointed with the Continental choice only cheese and ham,the location was fine for most bars and restaurants about a good ten minute walk down O'Connell Street to all attractions,the only problem we had our room was on the second floor,and every time we flushed the toilet or turned the handbasin taps on there was quiet a noisy sound from the plumbing which went on for about 20mins,I did report it straight to reception as I was concerned it would disturb other guests,nothing was done so I'm sorry if this disturbed other guests but apart from that a very good stay.",4,2014,09,02
229,"Not a castle, but good enough.","To be honest, the name of this hotel caught my eye more than anything. However, the service is what left me satisfied with my stay. The room was good but nothing special, the lobby was very nice, and the concierge was more than willing to help with all of our touring needs. Would probably stay again for the right price.",4,2014,09,01
229,Great birthday weekend,"Eight family members stayed for a weekend celebrating my daughter's birthday. The rooms varied in size but were all comfortable, clean and practical. Our room was on the top floor with windows on two sides offering a splendid view of Parnell Square and the O'Connell Street Spire, and complete privacy even with the curtains opened.  
We dined in the Vault restaurant on our first evening and the food was excellent as were the staff who were kept on their toes by what was a very demanding group! The music in the bar was lively and the whole atmosphere very relaxed. I met who I initially thought was another customer on the stairs and we talked for twenty minutes or so before I discovered he was the owner!! So nice that he had time to chat to a customer on what was obviously a busy night.
Breakfast was good and hearty, but a fried egg often meant a short wait in the queue. At least you could be sure it was freshly prepared. Could be extremely busy at the peak time.
All in all, our stay was very enjoyable, and the staff helpful and very friendly. Reception could be a bit hectic and a bit more space would be a bonus, but considering the prices for both accommodation and restaurant food, I would highly recommend the Castle as a great, economical, central base from which to explore the city. All in our party will certainly be back.",4,2014,08,31
229,slightly disappointing,"First impression of the hotel was good. The carpark was small but adequate and operates on a first come basis and costs €10 per night. 
Our room was on 2nd floor overlooking the front of the building. We had booked a double room and were given a room with a double bed & a single. The room was clean and bright and airy. The only downside was the TV set......old and with an intermittant signal. Not what we expected to find in a hotel room in 2014. 
The bathroom was nicely appointed although a more powerful shower would be better. 
The hotel bar and restaurant in the cellar are good......staff very friendly and efficient. The breakfast is served in the cafe attached to the hotel. When busy it is rather cramped and if operates on a self service basis. 
In summary I would stay here again but the management should look at updating the TV sets in the rooms and perhaps increasing the size of the reception desk to deal more efficiently with check in and check out when the hotel is busy.",3,2014,08,28
229,"Affordable hotel, great location, good for large family","We stayed at the Castle Hotel recently and much enjoyed our stay. We had a large family room, facing away from the street, very comfortable, great breakfast. The hotel was clean and the staff very friendly.
Would definitively stay here again, all sights are within walking distance.",5,2014,08,28
229,Spot on location great music Ray Cox !,"Hard to find at first drove around for a bit, wish we had known it was off the top RH corner of Parnell Sq. pleasant hotel comfortable room, copious amounts of hot water in a wet room shower. Ample breakfasts, mostly full Irish, not so much continental, although there was cereal yoghurt and a few pastries, cold ham cheese and eggs. Helpful friendly staff. I was cold and didn't realise I could have radiators on just in our room. When I asked for some heat they were turned on immediately by reception. Music in Vaults was a plus especially Ray Cox brilliant. Top of O,Connell street, 15 mins walk from Temple bar. 5 mins from Gate Theatre. And numerous pub style restaurants. One big plus is we hired a car and they have limited parking at an extra cost €10 per night. If I was having a city break there again I wouldn't, bother with a car, easy to get around and 7miles from  the airport. Def stay there again if in Dublin",4,2014,08,25
229,Affordable Charm,"I stayed three nights at the historic. Castle Hotel in Dublin with my Girl Scouts. We stayed in the very simple twin rooms. Very affordable. The full Irish breakfast was included. Delicious and a great start to the day. We were within walking distance of the Guineas Storehouse, Trinity College, Museums and St. Patrick's Cathedral. City Sightseeing tour bus will get you every place else you need to be",5,2014,08,24
229,Charming Hotel,"We loved the Castle Hotel!  The staff was always polite, efficient and friendly.  The hotel was clean and in good condition.  The car park (a bargain at €10 per day) was a bit tight, but not impossible to navigate.   We stayed in a family room that was 2 separate bedrooms with a bathroom between them. Our room was clean and comfortable. Breakfast was filling and we never had any issues getting what we wanted.  People have complained about noise outside and the creaking stairs, honestly it's all part of staying in an old city hotel.  I am very frequent guest of an international luxury brand and would rather stay in a place like the Castle Hotel any day. 

Our first day, we came back early to rest and met Mr. Fionn MacCumhaill the owner of the hotel.  Fionn insisted on taking time from his busy day to give us a tour of the entire hotel.  He told us the history of the buildings and explained how each one was eventually connected to make up the whole hotel. 

Do yourself a favor, skip the cookie cutter brand name hotels and stay at the Castle Hotel.  Remember that creaky stairs, small car parks and lots of stairs are part of the charm of staying in an old hotel.",5,2014,08,23
229,Friendly busy hotel,Thoroughly enjoyed our two night break here. Our room was on the third floor. There was a lift. .Although there were creaking stairs which we liked our room was great and we were not disturbed by the traffic outside. The staff and manager were so helpful and friendly. They were informative and sorted out the taxi for us on departure without any fuss.The prices of the rooms were very reasonable and the breakfast excellent. The restaurant was decorated beautifully and was open for coffee or meals. The location of the hotel was good with just a gentle slope up from the main attractions. There was a late check out at 12 and they were more than willing to store our bags at departure. Also there was a bar downstairs which had live Irish music. A lovely old hotel which i would use again.,5,2014,08,22
229,Noisy & uncomfortable,"The family room we had overlooked the very busy street, so we were woken early by the noisy traffic.  The room also backed on to the creaky, noisy stairway, so we had very little uninterrupted sleep.  The room itself was basic, with quite uncomfortable beds and pillows.

The location is good, with convenient access to O'Connell Street and the main sights.  The breakfast buffet was adequate.  The hotel offers private parking behind the hotel for 10 euros per day.",3,2014,08,21
229,Nice Hotel,"We stayed here for 4 days over  the weekend for a hen do.. Staff on reception were very lovely, asking about our trip and talking to my friend about her wedding.. they stored our bags as we were very early. They did take payment at the time but i don't see what is unusual about that as alot of hotels do that.. in our case it was good as then it meant that no-body accidentally spent the money out in temple bar..!!

Our room, 220 was amazing.. it two parts to it with 2 beds in one half and two in the other, the bathroom was in the middle with a door on either side. TV, kettle, enough towels for 4 people (which doesn't always happen in hotels), we asked for an iron and ironing board.. no problem!
Staff in bar were lovely and gave us directions to different places..as did reception who also told us to have a good time every time we went out.

Breakfast was slightly inconsistent, asked for a full Irish and didn't get a tomato, although the man in front of me did, next day i didn't go down for breakfast but was informed there were fried eggs (there were not on the day i did go down) so then the next day i went down ready for a fried egg and there weren't any.. But the staff were really nice and with the short amount of time they have for breakfast they do a really good job of getting everyone served etc

My only small niggle is something i know the answer too.. the floorboards especially on the stairs are awful.. now i know its is an old building and it does look lovely, but being woke up from constant creaking did start to annoy me after 3 days... i think even if just the stairs were done it would cut the noise down! But i guess it maybe cannot be done..

Our room did face the road and there was alot of noise but it was more the creaking that was annoying!

I would stay here again but maybe ask for a room on the top floor although i'm not sure if that would be any different.",4,2014,08,19
229,Great location and staff,"OK this hotel is not the top of the range - but neither are you paying premium prices. The rooms were fine, but be prepared for creaking stairs and uneven floors. This hotel has got Character! Breakfast was great - will set you up for the day, but it does get busy - a reflection on the high numbers using this hotel.. Being on the edge of the City centre means that the noise level is low and unlikely to disturb you (with the windows closed!).",3,2014,08,19
229,70th birthday weekend,"A disappointing stay at the Castle Hotel. We advised the hotel before our stay that it would be my sisters birthday on the 1st August & that we would like it to be special. The rooms we were given  were so noisey that we had little sleep during our stay. My sister & niece were woken at 3.30am with the staff moving / loading laundry below their room & loud talking which seemed to go on forever! It did quieten down for while & then started up again! The other room we had,a single, overlooked the car park, which again had noise throughout the night. The most disappointing thing about the stay is that although we asked to speak to a manager about our complaint,( who was unavailable at the time,)reception staff took our details & promised we would be contacted, since our return I have emailed the Castle on several occasions but to date have not had the courtesy of a reply or an apology, I think this sums up the attitude to their clients, a very disappointing end to my sisters birthday and not a hotel we would recommend!",3,2014,08,16
229,Dublin Weekend Break,"All good. Friendly, clean, good food, it goes on. Situated at the top of O'Connell St. which is the main thoroughfare, excellent access to all you want to do and see. Rooms at back preferable as the road past front of hotel can get a little noisey. Do get a ticket for Hop on bus which travels to all of the main attractions and places of interest, you can go round as many times as you want in a 48hr period. Do visit the Guiness Storehouse for the tour through the history of the company and a free pint in the glass domed 5th floor bar with a view over the whole of Dublin.",4,2014,08,14
229,"In the city, but away from the noise","We stayed at the Castle Hotel at the start and end of a tour of Ireland with a group of undergraduate students from the States.  It was clean, had free wifi, nice ensuite rooms, helpful staff, good breakfast (though a bit of a factory because of the large number of people they serve), good basement restaurant with wonderful live music.  It is just far away from the city center that it wasn't too noisy, although our courtyard room was definitely quieter than the one we had on our return on the Frederick Street side of the hotel.  It is an easy walk to Trinity University, Temple Bar, and all the little places along the quays.",4,2014,08,14
229,Our stay at the Castle Hotel ,"We had a very pleasant & enjoyable stay at the Castle Hotel in Dublin 
The hotel staff are very friendly & present & nothing was to much trouble for them 
We had meals in the Hotel restaurant & The Musical & the food  was Excellent  as so was the hotel entertainment You don't really need to go out anywhere as it is all in the Hotel 
Thank you for a very enjoyable stay ",5,2014,08,14
229,Great location,"Stayed here for 3 nights from 10th August,  the staff were very helpful and  could not complain about anything.  The breakfasts had a great choice of food and fresh fruit was most welcome.
A great location for  getting buses on O'Connell Street to various destinations. Altogether a great choice.",4,2014,08,13
229,Great hotel with great staff,"My Girlfriend and I stayed in the Castle hotel for 3 nights from the 8th August, we honestly couldn't have picked a better hotel to stay in.
The room we received overlooked the courtyard which was excellent because it was quiet, large bathroom and very comfortable beds.
The hotel is less than a 5 minute walk from O'Connell Street where you can get the jump on / jump off Dublin tour buses.
The Breakfast is served in a large café area, great selection of  cooked or continental breakfasts, cereals, toast etc.
We had pre-booked a meal in the hotel for the Saturday night at  cost of 20euro each, portions were large and well presented.
We had planned to go up to Temple Bar some night, but decided to stay in the hotel bar in the cellar and listen to the local artists who perform there each night, they were great and the bar stall especially Trev & Romana are extremely helpful.
We will definitely be staying here again, and as Belfast is only less than 1 1/2 hours drive away I can see us going down some Saturday night for an evening of fun in the cellar bar.",5,2014,08,12
229,Great Staff,"We stayed over two separate weekends in July 2014, one of them being the weekend of the concert at Croake Park that never happened. Yes, it could be noisy, but that is usually a given in an inner city hotel. 
The staff were charming and extremely helpful. We shall definitely stay there again.",4,2014,08,11
229,Good hotel in good location,"We stayed in this hotel at the end of June for two nights. 
The room was spacious with everything that we needed, although the TV was very small and it was hard to see what was on the screen from far away in our bed (as the room was quite big). 
Good points: 
- It is very close to the O'Connell Street, and getting the airport bus was not that difficult. You have to walk down to where the Best Western Hotel is to catch the bus and it within 10 minutes' walk. 
- The breakfast is served in a large cafe area, and I liked how they served cooked breakfast. The choice of non-cooked breakfast isn't vast, but as breakfast is included in the booking (all bookings in this hotel, I believe), I can't really complain that much. 
- There is one computer and printer in the corner of the lounge, so you can print out your boarding passes and whatnot if you need. 

Negatives:
- Noise from other rooms - the wall seems to be very thin, so you can hear what is going on in the adjacent rooms very well. There was a group of loud people staying next door until very late at night, so  it disturbed our sleep.
- Wifi connection was dodgy.",4,2014,08,09
229,7 Days in Ireland,"The good and bad of the castle hotel in Dublin Ireland.  We were there in July and weather was a little warm so the window had to be open.  Our room  window was looking into parking lot of hotel.  The first late at night a noise woke up my wife to sound of someone that had to many beers. They THROWING UP in the parking lot (UHCH).  The second night was to sound of the bar and the music they were playing which was very nice not to loud. The when walking on stairs they seem not to be safe some times.  Be very careful win walking in halls there steps and carpet mask the steps and you could trip.
Breakfast was average food tasted alright not special

The location is in a good place in downtown Dublin.   Front desk service was excellent and pleasent.  I not would recommend this hotel 

You have to pay for parking and it is very tight moving the car in and around the parking lot.

The location is in  agood location and service at front desk excettent.  I not would recommend this hotel if only there is same price and close to there location

You have to pay for parking and it is very tight moving in and around the parking lot.",2,2014,08,08
229,LOVED this Georgian Era Hotel!,"My husband and I stayed at the Castle Hotel Dublin, Ireland in June of 2014 and had a perfect stay. The only thing precenting 5 stars on my review is the accordian door on the shower but I really did not mind at all. The old world charm was perfect for my taste. Everyone was SO nice at the front desk and in the restaurant. There was singing at night and a general feeling of warmth. The location is central to everything including a central meeting place down the street for many of the day tours so we only had to take a few taxi rides during our stay. Hopefully we will get to stay there again someday!
From Fort Worth, Texas",4,2014,07,27
229,Location is excellent,You pay extra to park your car in their extremely tiny parking spots. They were very helpful when it came to asking for early breakfast due to our early tours we had organised - continental only when before 7.30a.m. Room was okay and at least there is a lift to get you there. Unfortunately on our last morning when we could have the full breakfast it was very busy and we waited 15 minutes to be served and only then because I chased down a waitress. Over priced for what it is - a fairly old hotel within walking distance of the centre of Dublin.,3,2014,07,25
229,Nice little hotel ,Stayed here on a family trip to dublin and was delighted with the spacious family room prices are good and food isn't bad either .. Met the owner on check out he was more than friendly just like the staff and would defo return next time I'm in dublin ,4,2014,07,24
229,A Fan Would Have Been Amazing,Loved the whole theme of the hotel - it was a bit like an old haunted house - lots of creaks and personality - breakfast was lovely - staff great - rooms on the 3rd floor with a skylight that does not open were a bit like ovens - needed to put on sunscreen before I went to bed to deal with the morning sun - the air in the room was dead - would have given my back teeth for a fan :-) a 10 inch fan would have gotten this quaint hotel at least 1 more TA green dot......,3,2014,07,23
229,Need fans in the room!,Great location- close to everything and yet not too close to be noisy. Walls are paper thin- could hear the people in the room next door snoring all night. Room was hot and muggy- staff had no fans to supply. ,3,2014,07,23
229,The staff make this hotel....,"Stayed: Tuesday 15th to Thursday 17th July 2014

The hotel itself is nice enough, a little tired and creaky, but not unpleasant.  It's a bit of a rabbit warren, but it has character.  The room was good, clean and of average size for a twin room. I wasn't disappointed with the room or hotel.  I did find the bed hard and uncomfortable, but my mum thought her's was fine, so I guess it's down to personal preference. 

That said........

What made it go from average to very good, for me, was the staff.  The ladies on the front desk and the gentleman that taxi'd us around (a gentleman that works for the hotel), were all lovely.  Very warm and incredibly helpful.  For that reason alone, I would stay here again.

To the staff at the Castle Hotel 'Thank you for all your kindness and attentiveness, it really makes a difference to your customers.'

Best Regards
Adele J",4,2014,07,20
229,Full of surprises,"I hate surprises. Being asked to pay on arrival, as hotel policy, is always an unpleasant surprise – a bad start. I don’t mind giving a scan of the credit card on arrival or being given the option to pay, but being compelled (with no advance notification) to check out before you get in is bizarre. Why can’t this be made plain on the website or at the time of booking or with the email confirmation of booking?

There’s a charge for the car park – fair enough but again it comes as a surprise. But that’s nothing compared to being asked to surrender your car keys at reception if you leave the premises during the evening – now there’s a surprise. I parked under a sign that advised “the management cannot accept responsibility for loss……of property….in this car park”. So I’m expected to surrender my keys to this management under a sign like that?  I wouldn’t have booked this hotel if I had known this in advance. 

Apart from that it’s run of the mill but one wouldn’t recommend it.",2,2014,07,18
229,Georgian building in a central location,Our first visit to Dublin and the staff at the Castle Hotel could not have been more helpful. We had made a mistake in our online booking and had mistakenly ordered a twin room. On arrival our mistake was quickly rectified and we were offered a triple room with windows on two sides of the hotel overlooking Parnell Square. The room was comfortable and spacious and there was free wifi. Breakfast was plentiful but the only downside was a lack of fresh fruit on offer. We only had one evening meal at the hotel but the food was good and reasonably priced. There are some comfortable lounge areas to relax in and catch up on the newspapers. TV coverage wasn't great but there's lots to see and do in Dublin so you don't need to spend lots of time watching TV .,4,2014,07,16
229,perfect location for sight seeing,"Very friendly staff, nice clean rooms. Really comfortable beds.  Good variety for breakfast.   Good live entertainment in the evening.  Just off O'Connell street and right near the writers museum. Not disturbed by traffic or hustle and bustle of the main street.  Temple Bar about 10-15 min walk.  Good value for money",5,2014,07,15
229,Lovely old hotel,"I loved this vintage hotel. The staff were helpful, the bistro upstairs was airy with nice food (I had fish skewer and sweet potato fries) and good service, the rooms were simple but clean and quaint, and the hotel was beautifully old-fashioned. There was a bit of street noise (was in room 214) but I'd have noticed it more than most because I live in the countryside where it is absolutely silent at night. The location is good and the local area seems very nice. Recommended.",5,2014,07,13
229,Great Hotel,"I stayed in this hotel for 2 days while on business in Dublin.  It has great character which is sadly not present in other hotels so my stay was really enjoyable.  Its a Georgian building with winding corridors and interesting period features.  The staff are very helpful, friendly and well trained.

I had to work from the hotel as i had picked up a bug on my travels, i worked remotely connected to their wireless with perfect service.

I will stay again for sure, its now my ""Dublin Hotel""",5,2014,07,11
229,disappointed,"having stayed here many times before, myself and my elderly dad were in town for a family funeral, very unexpected. Where before we had excellent rooms and service, this time we were in single rooms, which were poor to say the least. Curtains hanging off the rail, old mouldy silicone sealant in the showers. A step up into the bathrooms, which was difficult through the night. My room had no space for opening/closing windows/curtains. 
A new bistro breakfast room, is beautiful, but unhelpful staff serving up the buffet style breakfast has taken away from the homely feel, where you were served your breakfast . It was sub standard with barely cooked sausage, congealed eggs and was just unpleasant.
on a plus side the dinner was lovely, fresh and cooked to order, but expensive for what it was, in comparison to other eateries in town. I It was'nt cheap, and I'm not sure if I would return.  they have just lost that personal touch.",3,2014,07,08
229,sad.,"On arrival reception staff very helpful.
. Bedroom was very disappointing, screws  sticking out of the  wall  no air conditioning  Large stark black open fire place along with three large mirrors all on the one wall. Very old T.V.
To boil  the kettle  it had to be placed on the floor  to reach the plug  Head board thick with dust
 Bathroom very drab. 
Asked for an Ironing board and iron. Both came and both in very poor condition impossible to use the Ironing board due to its condition
. Paid for all meals and room before arriving.
 This did not stop myself  and partner  being charged again for an evening meal. This was refunded when pointed out to very busy bar staff.  At evening meal twice we were forgotten after main course had been served. When informing reception of this there was no talk of us being refunded for not receiving the rest of our meal two nights in a row.
 On checking out  we were informed  by reception that we had an  unpaid bar bill that was not a small  bill.
  This was found to be untrue . We had one bottle of wine to pay for. In all I was sad at what had went on as I was so looking forward to staying at the castle. Loved Dublin loved the people. More staff needed and attention to room or rooms.",3,2014,07,08
229,Avoid at all costs,"Despite the fact that the Reception Staff were friendly and efficient, things went rapidly downhill from there.  Bedroom was small and very cluttered.  dinner that night in the Music Store was an absolute disaster - food awful, service even worse, with the exception of one young man with a northern accent, the rest of the staff were bordering on being rude.
Breakfast next morning was totally unacceptable. Food had been pre-cooked, restaurant ran out of (a) Plates (b) Eggs (c) toast (d) drinking glasses.  I spent most of the time queueing and waiting and the quality of the food was by far and away the worst I have ever seen.
I would NEVER stay at the Castle again",1,2014,07,08
229,Didn't Live Up to Reviews,"The Castle Hotel was extremely clean and the staff were superb. However, our first room was extremely noisy for the 30 minutes we spent in it at around 4pm. We had very noisy neighbours next door and we could hear very loud voices from beneath the room (kitchen??). We asked for an upgrade and were given a family room without any hesitation. This room was so much better but very noisy due to the main road outside (this was pointed out to us). We had breakfast in our room on the first morning due to spending the previous evening in the very lively hotel bar as it was my birthday. The bar staff were excellent and a very friendly atmosphere. The breakfast the next morning was above average. The following morning we went to the restaurant for breakfast. This was located in the café next door. Totally hideous!! As a café there was Joe public at one side and the hotel guests on the other side. This was 8.45am and it was jam packed. We were given a table in the basement. My husband is waiting for a hip operation so we would've had to go up and down the stairs to get the self serve breakfast - not a chance!! I went to reception and informed them of the situation. Within minutes of arriving back at our room, reception rang and offered us breakfast in our room at no extra charge. This arrived within 20 mins. and again a decent breakfast. The hotel is at the top end of O'Connell Street off Parnell Square. It has private parking but get there early. The Hop on/off bus is about 5 mins away. Personally I would have preferred to be towards the other end of O'Connell Street but for the money can't really complain.",3,2014,07,06
229,"Great location, atmospheric bar and restaurant","Nicely placed just on the edge of the city centre, but set back from the busiest roads.  Friendly staff throughout the hotel and the stay.

The room was nice; a decent size with comfortable furnishings.  The only problem I had was the shower controls were exactly at elbow height for me.  The bruise took some days to fade!

Very atmospheric bar and restaurant area in the vaulted cellar underneath the hotel, with friendly, efficient service and great food.  There was a live traditional music act most nights.

The only couple of negatives I would give are that the car parking space is quite limited, and the staircases are possibly the noisiest, creakiest stairs I've ever used!",5,2014,07,03
229,"Great location, and nice hotel too","All I can say, is this hotel exceeded our expectations.  We loved the location up O'Connell Street and away from the nightlife and noise, but yet an easy walk to attractions.  In 20 minutes we could be anywhere in the core area of Dublin.
The Irish Breakfast was very good, and staff very accommodating.
We visited June 21st to 29th, and an open window was fine for air.  However, not sure if temperatures rise as there is no a/c.
Hotel very clean.
We would definitely recommend, and will stay here again too.",4,2014,07,02
229,Avoid,"Dank, poor service and just a bad idea.  Checked into a ""family room"" with 2 kids last Saturday.  Turns out ""family"" room is a regular room with four single beds jammed in.  Bath was newly redone, but shower drain was completely stopped up. Lobby was dark and junky. Finding our room was like a trip through a halloween corn maze. Breakfast was good.",2,2014,06,29
229,Could do better,"My wife and I stayed in the Castle hotel for a 5 day break in Dublin , did not get off to a good start as when we arrived they asked for payment which was ok but then wanted payment in Sterling or would charge a 3% surcharge to by in Euro, this is Ireland and they are in the Euro zone how dare they charge extra to pay in their own currency , it is just so they can rip you off on the exchange rate. The room was poor in that we had a tiny hanging area for cloths but no drawers so had to keep most of our cloths in the suitcase , bathroom was grubby really in need of a refurb , shower was just cold water , breakfast was hit and miss and very average . On a positive note staff were friendly and great location for exploring Dublin but look around you could do better than the Castle Hotel",3,2014,06,27
229,Stuffy,"During our recent trip to Ireland, The Castle Hotel was our least favorite of the three places that we stayed while in Dublin It was ridiculously hot and stuffy in the room, so much so that it kept us from getting much sleep before a big day of events. This might have been due to the location of our room (one in the corner that had an exterior window that could barely be cracked because of the same window from another room adjacent to ours with the window open). Regardless, it was stifling with little ventilation. If you choose to brave this one, take your own fan. They told us that fans were available for the rooms, but when we went down to get one that evening, the much needed little vacillating machines were all spoken for by other guests. With so many options in and around Dublin that offer full breakfasts, I was surprised that theirs consisted of primarily cold cereal. We chose to have dinner in their restaurant downstairs.  The food was great, but our order was lost for an hour or so before the waitress realized it.",2,2014,06,25
229,Did not like!,"Stayed at the hotel in February,it was cold,lived in unheated single room ,the first night was terrible...Going up to the administrator I said in room heating not working,she said that in Russia too cold and I have to be accustomed!I did not like the attitude of the staff.The breakfasts were quite normal.Next time I will choose another hotel, and my friends that went in June in Dublin I do not recommend this hotel.",2,2014,06,25
229,Avoid breakfast!!!,"We stayed here room was ok.. 
Breakfast what a disaster!!!After a wait for our fry my daughter found a hair in hers which made her to vomit as she had ate a fair bit of it to discover... tryed to explain to two non English speaking waitresses who just keep smiling when I was explaining I literally had to point to get someone who's speaks English 10 minutes! !! Yes 10 minutes later women appeared as I was just leaving to go to my daughters aid was apologetic but it was far gone at that staged. My daughter was sick and we were still hungry! And to add to it still charged the three breakfasts!! ",2,2014,06,21
229,Very average hotel,"Stayed 2 nights recently, on the 3rd floor. Room was warm and stuffy. Front desk pleasant enough, not overly so. Breakfast a disappointment, little choice and we were sure the scrambled eggs were powdered! Breakfast room noisy, two days in a row ate perched on an ill fitting stool after you wait in an endless line and serve yourself. Bit of a maze to get to the room, especially lugging suitcases around. On the upside, the hotel does have its own charm and the room was quiet. Coffee/tea in room. Location was good.",3,2014,06,20
229,Beware street noise,"Rooms facing the front gets a lot of street noise, windows are not well insulated. No fans or airconditioning. Bed matresses also seem to be old. Location is good but we will not stay here again becuase of the street noise.",2,2014,06,18
229,Lovely Old Hotel with Character and Charm,This is a lovely old hotel with a lot of charm and character. It's in a safe location with many things in walking distance. The hop on/off bus also has a stop very close by. The breakfast was good and the pub in the basement was fun with live music. The staff was very helpful and our room was recently updated. Yes the halls are winding with creaky stairs but that is all part of the experience. The rate was very reasonable and we would stay here again. If you are used to newer hotels with a lot of amenities then you probably don't want to stay here.,4,2014,06,17
229,Absolute average,"May, 2014. I spent 2 nights there. Single room on second floor, it was very small and cold, looks like a servant-room in old building. No curtains on window, so it was uncomfortable because the neighbour windows are so close. Average furniture, clearness. Bed was ok, great blanket .The reception and bar were ok, nice persons. The breakfast room's staff were blase and the breakfast was poor. The location is great, walking distance the most sights. From airport take the Airport express bus and take off on station ""Cathal Brugha Street"". Positive attitude at the end, I could check out early morning ( 04:00 ) and got a breakfast too.",3,2014,06,13
229,Don't Bother it's cheap but awful,"Room 311 third floor at the front, too hot to sleep first night so we didn't really notice the noise, second night with less bed clothes could not sleep for the constant noise. Window mechanism broken so we could not close the window, half the power points did not work and neither did the hair dryer.
Quite clean and bed was comfortable even if you could not sleep on it.
Staff were good and very understanding when we checked out after two nights cancelling the rest of our stay!",2,2014,06,12
229,Castle Hotel,"Built in 1750's converted to hotel in 1800's.
So understandably a little shabby. I was travelling
with husband and sister so were given a very spacious room 
3 singles and one double bed.   Sitting room/ TV etc.
Situated about a 20 minute stroll to Temple Bar.
Music in bar downstairs most nights.  Not too loud though. 
Shower over bath, no guest laundry. 
Not luxurious but a pleasant stay and friendly staff.",3,2014,06,12
229,Best Hotel Ever!,"The Castle Hotel is a great hotel. The georgian-style rooms are gorgeous, with a breathtaking view. All of the staff were excellent, and the beds are quite comfortable. It is easy to get a good nights sleep here and feel refreshed in the morning. The Castle Hotel is right in the middle of many stores, resturants, and parks, and walking distance. I have no complaints: my 13 day visit was amazing.",5,2014,06,11
229,It's like Guiness,"It is Irish and you will either love it or hate it. I read several reviews before booking and that's exactly what I was told. But it did have a family room and that made economic sense as much as where it was located. 

Reaching there from the train station is all but a 15 minute (15 Euro) journey by taxi. Check in was friendly and was offered a very large room with a King and 2 single beds. Rooms have a period decor and the floorboards under the carpet do creak. It is not luxurious but a walk back into the past. The 14ft height ceiling with what I assume were faux antiques gave the historical character to the room. Beds are comfortable with good quality linen. 

the hotel is a combination of a couple of buildings and each was built at a different level - so there are steps where one connects the other. Not a great place if walking is a challenge. Otherwise no issues. 

The bathroom is modern. (The exhaust in my bathroom did not work and was not attended to either - but that is probably the only complaint). And yes, there is no air conditioning and no fan so the rooms can get pretty warm in summer. 

There is an eatery on site which serves decent breakfast. A continental breakfast buffet to get you going and a full (hot) Irish plate made to order. 

All the major sites are within walking distance and we did not use either a taxi or bus or tram to commute within Dublin. Walk on O'Connell st. and there are several pubs, coffee shops and eateries. But, the Temple bar area and Grafton street are livelier. Both are about 20 mins walk from the hotel. 

Enjoyed my stay.",4,2014,06,11
229,it was the best place necessary for my first visit to Dublin,"Located on a quiet street in the old Fishembl Street fashionable district of Dublin's Temple Bar, where the focus cultural life of Dublin.
a 5-minute walk from the theater ""Olympia"", photo galleries, and the Irish Film Institute.
Dublin Castle takes less than 10 minutes.
Pubs and Porterhouse and St John Gogarty are close by.

free Wi-Fi and elegant rooms.
here prepare a full hearty breakfast.",5,2014,06,07
229,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel, very clean, excellent staff, breakfast was huge so much to choose from. Two mins from all amenities, would definitely stay here again. I travelled with a hen party and found the staff very accommodating bar staff were brilliant putting up with 21 hens . The hotel is huge and lovely decorated",5,2014,06,05
229,Great stay,Well located hotel. Staff extremely accommodating and friendly. Room clean and comfortable. Food tasty.  Entertainment very good.Would definately recommend and if returning to Dublin would stay again. Thanks again to all the staff for making our stay so enjoyable.,5,2014,06,04
229,3.5 Out of 5,"We recently spent 4 nights at this hotel as a family of 4.  The staff were very helpful and couldn't do enough for you.  The food in the restaurant was good quality/value and the breakfasts were okay too.  On the downside, the family rooms are located on the fourth floor and the noise from the bar area kept us awake most of the first night.  However, the bar was not open and the guests who were making the noise were asked to leave by the hotel staff after 5 complaints.  The hotel consists of 3 hotels joined together and the areas you are not supposed to see are still accessible.  One of the stairways was supported with a metal frame so don't let your children explore on their own.  The rooms are comfortable and reasonable value for money, however there are no mattress protectors and their were pieces of the last guests rubbish still on the floor.  The hotel is fairly accessible for families but I would not recommend the location for anyone who has trouble walking.  You are close to bus routes but due to the traffic it can take a long time to get about the city.  Another down side to Dublin is the number of beggars (who all seemed to have good quality clothing and iphones).  Also, this area at night is a bit rough and whilst we were there somebody had their bag snatched.  I think if we visited again I would prefer to stay over the other side of the river as we have done in the past.",4,2014,06,03
229,Convenient city center hotel,"I liked the location of this hotel. Just a short walk from the Dublin City Center. Rooms are comfy though you can hear other guests closing/opening their doors. Good  cooked Breakfast!! Overall, a good hotel for city center destinations.",4,2014,06,02
229,Friendly and convenient,"I spent 3 nights at the Castle Hotel and cannot fault my experience. The staff were very welcoming and helpful, the food was beautiful (hats off to the chef!!) and the location was superb - literally a stones throw from O'Connell Street. There were bus stops just around the corner for tours and trips around Dublin and its surrounding areas.
The only small suggestion that I would make is that at breakfast time, there needs to be more staff on - as it got quite busy meaning they were rushed off of their feet.
Other than that, can't fault it for ease of access and nice, friendly staff and beautiful food.
Will visit again :)",4,2014,06,01
229,Ridiculous in this day and age!!!!!!,"We stayed here last Sunday night, convenient for 1D concert......we booked a family room...arrived to find it was up to flights of stairs with no lift access....2 adults, 3 kids, 11, 8 and 2....needless to say we had a buggy for our youngest, luggage nd bags of all shorts......had to take 2 yr old outta buggy and have her walk upstairs while we went up and down with bags etc.......then at check in we were told it was €10 to park your car in there private car park for the night and you need to leave your keys at reception.....em why??????...in case they need to move it.....don't think so if it's moved then and there is mark who will own up.....we arrived back to my husband and our 2 yr old after concert at 10:45pm....my husband was sitting outside room with door open so our 2 yr old could go asleep....well then the fun started......people up above us jumping on beds up and down stairs and opening and closing doors.....went on for about half hour and then they went of downstairs and came back up in middle of night roughly 3am and same thing started again......then breakfast was a total disaster....ordered 2 full irish one came with no sausages....ordered vegetarian breakfast with poached egg.....got fried egg, no tomatoes.......ordered two different small breakfasts for our two,youngest and after 3 attempts right breakfast came......the next time it definitely won't be Castle hotel I would rather we all stayed in the car than put up with that c**p and pay nearly €300......never ever again....",1,2014,05,29
229,Good for a last minute place to stay,"We booked online at the last minute 
Cheap clean place but very confusing to find your room kind of a rat race through hall ways and doors when you carrying your luggage it's a pain.
Good location top of the town  close to buses and restaurants pubs ect ect

 ",3,2014,05,29
229,Well located city hotel,"A lovely hotel evolved from several buildings so has lots of stairs, there is a lift that serves the main floor levels.. The rooms were clean and well equipped. The Water pressure wasn't brilliant but by running the tap for a while there was hot water. The Irish breakfast was served plated but there was help yourself cereal, ham, cheese and grapefruit and plenty of bread for toasting. The reception staff were welcoming and the bar had live music.The hotel is located 50 yards from the hop on hop off sightseeing tour bus and local buses and is a short walk up O'Connell Street from Temple Bar.
A Dublin Bus Freedom Pass can be bought at the airport either from the Dublin Bus desk or a vending machine by the bus stop this gives unlimited use of the Airlink bus, the hop on hop off sightseeing bus and the local buses for 72 hours.
Catch the 16 bus to Temple Bar area and back up to Parnell Street across the road from the hotel.",5,2014,05,24
229,Would go back with pleasure!,"The hotel is in perfect location, short walk from O'Connell main street, yet in quiet area. Staff are helpful, courteous and very friendly. Room was large, light and airy and beds very comfortable. Breakfast was an enjoyable affair, plenty of choice and plenty of staff taking care of your every need. Well recommend this hotel to anybody travelling to Dublin. There is live music in the cellar bar each evening which was good fun!",5,2014,05,16
229,"Good, actually","Tricky one this. The Castle is certainly better than average but ""very good"" is maybe putting it a bit high. Ideally I'd give it a straight three-and-a-half blob ""good"". Our room was no-frills but quite okay. Staff kept their cool and dealt very well with a rush of arrivals, including two simultaneous groups, although the luggage room was a bit chaotic. And the place was full but friendly. Tip: the cafe two doors along (not connected with the hotel as far as I know) is not recommended.",4,2014,05,14
229,"Great value, Convenient Location","We were very pleased with our stay at this hotel.  Yes the hotel is a bit dated - but it is clean and efficiently run.  We stayed with 3 children and our room was HUGE.  It had a double bed and 4 small single beds.  Even with all the beds there was plenty of room for the kids to stretch out (which was much needed after being crammed into small rooms the rest of the trip) The bathroom was large and modern.

The restaurant in the basement is very dark but actually has great food and is reasonably priced.  Breakfast is a bit chaotic but has plenty of food to fill you up for the day.

It is just a short walk to Connell street and the buses.  All in all, we thought it was a great value for the price we paid.",4,2014,05,14
229,Very Nice!,"Stayed here in November 2013 with a friend and we had a lovely time. 

The staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean, spacious and comfortable. The restaurant / pub was nice for breakfast.

We met the owner as well and he was a very nice man!

The hotel is brilliantly located just off O'Connell Street with easy access to the tour buses which take you to all the major sites (like the Guiness Storehouse and Temple Bar).

Overall, very nice experience and will definately consider booking again for next visit to Dublin!",4,2014,05,13
229,Good value in a great location,"We chose this hotel as it was the only one with good reviews in this price range that was not on a busy street and we were not disappointed.  We had a room at the back, but I can't believe that the rooms at the front suffered that much street noise.

The room was a decent size, the bathroom was smart with a very good shower. Breakfast was good apart from there being no fresh fruit.

The only criticism I would have was that the TV picture was poor quality and only a few channels, but then that was not why we were in Dublin so it did not bother us unduly.",4,2014,05,11
229,Old hotel with charme,"Travelling together once a year with 9 friends in the 60`s, we was visiting this hotel for 4 Nights, all of us first time in Dublin. The hotel is old, and feels like what we in Norway Call ""reve-hi"" (fox-home). That means it is a number of stairs in all directions (but 2-3 lifts), and we think no rooms is equal! My wife and I had a OK room in second floor to the street, newly painted, also bathroom OK. The bed, however, was HARD. We asked for an extra mattress, they said ok but we did not get any. Otherwise the staff was friendly and serviceminded. Check-in and -out was very effectively, and in the breakfast-room in cellar everything was funktional. In the evenings it is live irish Music in the charming cellar with stone vaults. I heard Our friends had very different rooms, some to small to pass the bed in walking position. The only single lady in the group had a small Chamber on the top. All together, a good place with a central location to a acceptabel cost.",3,2014,05,03
229,Dublin Weekend Visit,"The Castle Hotel was an enjoyable location for a weekend in Dublin. Check in was very quick, the room, was average size for a single and had everything I needed for my stay. There was a nice TV in the room but only had 6 channels which in this digital age was surprising. The only thing I would say against the room was that the guest in the room above me seemed to like getting up very early and walking all around the room. The creaking floorboards were annoying and did disturb my sleep. Other than that the room was very quiet and there was no late late noise to be heard at all. The hotel is just north of the top end of O'Connell Street and there was a 15 minute walk to reach the river Liffey. However, all the attractions of the Northside were only 10 minutes away. Croke Park is also only 15 minutes away. Breakfasts in the hotel were a bit hectic and I had the usual problem when travelling alone of finding my table occupied when returning from the buffet. The food was fine and set me up for the rest of the day. 
Nice bar in the hotel with live music at the weekends. Surprisingly, the price of a pint of Guinness was the cheapest I paid all weekend.",3,2014,04,30
229,Theft,"I wouldn't recommend this for any groups going over on a party weekend to Dublin. We were there last weekend and it was marred on the last day, when we awoke at 8.30am with a guy in the room stealing a purse. I highly suspect it was a member of staff who had seen us all coming home intoxicated at 4.00am, and thinking we would all have been sound asleep. There was no forced entry and they managed to avoid the CCTVs, which are only in the main hallways. I'm just glad we awoke when we did or there would probably have been two purses gone, and since there was no forced entry, we would have assumed they had been stolen when we were out the night before. It's unfortunate because, until this happened, I would have given them a 5 rating all around. The hotel was lovely, clean, comfortable; breakfast was great; they have a nice restaurant and live entertainment in the basement; and the day staff were all wonderful and helpful.",3,2014,04,29
229,"Decent, Not Great","Spent 3 nights at the Castle Hotel (April 21-23, 2014). We are a family of four and stayed in room 217, which had 4 beds. The room was clean and lots of room for storing our stuff. While this is not the quality of a Hilton or Marriott, most of the chains don't have the charm of the Castle. If you consider charm uneven floors causing a bed to tilt and a window that would not open properly, you will appreciate the Castle.

Considering the cost of eating in Dublin, a full breakfast included in the room charge was an excellent benefit. The breakfast staff was very attentive and the food was very good.

From a location perspective, the hotel is nearby everything you need. My son and I walked to the Guinness factory, which was a hike, about 45 minutes. Buses are very close if you prefer public transportation.

The staff were very friendly and helped with everything from booking a tour to assisting us try to retrieve something we left in a taxi.",4,2014,04,25
229,Cosy Georgian time hotel,"Have never been to Dublin before and did not know what to expect for a Dubliner hotel. Arrived at noon and got friendly welcome at the reception. We had to wait a couple of hours for our room to be ready. It didn't harm since there was a nice Vault bar at the basement where we could have ""one for the road"" in spite of Good Friday (pubs do not serve alcoholic beverages then).

Our room was a spacious, ""romantic"" (said my girlfriend), a bit aged room. There was terrible draught thru old windows and the room was a bit cool. A couple of central heating radiators were cold and after consulting the receptionist they promised to switch heat on.

After a couple of hours visit downtown we returned and found out that the room was still cold.
I didn't want to go to shower nor sleep in cool room so I asked my fiancé in turn go and ask for some heat.
We were offered another room which was round the corner in same building. This new room was a bit smaller, but warm. So warm that I had to screw down the radiator valve.
Windows were also new with very good insulation for heat and noise. Everything was again spotless clean and cosy.

Next morning we went to breakfast, which was very good ranging from traditional Irish (British) breakfast to continental one. Bacon, eggs, beans, black/white pudding, sausages, different types of cereals, weetabix, marmalade etc.
Coffee/tea was served to table and we were asked what we would like to have, full breakfast or something else. Very good service. I bet if I wanted porridge they would have cooked it for me.

Nothing bad to say about the the hotel. Location was near to all attractions, bus routes and not far (20 eur by taxi) from the airport. Also hop on/off double decker stop was just a few hundred meters away down O'Connell Street.

Being vulgar: why there are so many bathrooms without a bidé or why the hand shower hose is too short to reach the toilet bowl itself? Ladies would like this small polite gesture for sure. Would also save precious water on planet Earth.",4,2014,04,23
229,Excellent breakast,I stayed here for 2 nights in April 2014. A nice friendly hotel in a decent location. The breakfast was excellent both mornings with a quick and friendly service. Room had a bath. It was quiet at night.,4,2014,04,21
229,Clean. Would stay again.,"I stayed here for 3 nights in April.  We arrived at the hotel early however we couldn't check in until check-in time at 2:30pm, which was fine.  The room size was about average as far as European rooms go.  Everything was very clean.  The only odd thing was that you had to call the front desk to turn on/off your heat in the room.  It wasn't a big deal but it was the first time I had seen this. I would recommend this hotel and would stay here again.  Walk down O'Connell Street and go to Murray's for great food and music!",4,2014,04,20
229,Highly Recommended!!,This hotel is ideal for someone new to Dublin or a well seasoned traveller. It is in the heart of the city and it is very easy to walk to many of the attractions. The room was big and clean and had all the amenities you would need. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the food in the restaurant was delicious (although slightly expensive). I would 100% book another night at this hotel!,5,2014,04,20
229,Dr Jim Osborne ,"I checked in Tuesday!  The staff has gone out of their way to assist me. I am very pleased and will now make this hotel my place to stay every time I come to Dublin. The hotel is convenient to all local Dublin Central attractions, as well; all local transportations.  I fully recommend the Castle Hotel. I met the owner and his brother, and in my opinion they are honest, and truly care about the ""guest experience""
Additionally, for the price it's the best deal in town!!!!!'
",5,2014,04,18
229,A caring hotel with a great staff,"I stayed at the Castle Hotel from 03/31/14 to 04/16/14.    Lovely staff and extremely patient with the most demanding of guests.   Full Irish breakfast is part of the room cost.   Rooms are very clean.    It is a grouping of 9 Georgian mansions going back to 1802.   Dinner in the evening in the vaults in the basement was top notch, individually cooked to order.  It is old world with an up to date flavor.   Well worth it.    Central to seeing Dublin and the surroundings.   Highly recommended.",5,2014,04,17
229,Charming hotel.,"Our room was a converted dormer; charming for me but my husband could not stand upright in the tub/shower without hitting his head. I window, from the ground to about 3 feet up; you had to bend over to look outside. I liked it; the old wallpaper, the creaky floors, the odd steps and weird fire doors. Expected from a renovated Georgian mansion. Lovely Irish cooked breakfast. Had dinner the last night and it was very good. Very surprised at that! The hop on/off tour buses ended across the street or started a few streets down. Could walk to almost every sightseeing destination, so, we enjoyed the location. Staff was lovely. There is a baggage room to hold your belongings while you wait for your check in time; we explored the city and it worked out.",3,2014,04,14
229,Friendly and excellent value,"I booked - at short notice - through booking.com and got 3 nights for £154 including full Irish breakfast. Now, this is a capital city and the hotel is central. How brilliant is that? 

Plus points: 
it's in walking distance of a whole load of interesting stuff - at the top of O'Connell Street (oh - and I'm not exactly youthful).
the staff is fab - friendly, helpful, good humoured
the rooms are comfortable but not luxurious - but at just over £50 a night on my deal, better value than a Travel Lodge or Premier Inn
the bar is nice - in the basement - and smoking is not in the street (I am a smoker)
the live music was very good and not overpowering
the bar prices are OK

Minus points:
the shower in my room was HOT or COLD. Nowt in between
dinner - I'd go somewhere else to be honest
breakfast isn't freshly cooked - but it is certainly generous and the waiting staff is lovely - very attentive

Would I stay there again? Absolutely.",4,2014,04,12
229,A weekend in Dublin,A pleasant hotel within walk distance to the Centre. Suitable for a short visit. Breakfast room rather crowded in the morning. Staff is friendly and helpful. Live Irish music on Friday evening was really great. I will be back soon.,3,2014,04,10
229,Great location and comfortable,"A really good hotel, perfect for a long weekend  and in the perfect location, friendly helpful staff.  Some places of interest right on the door step and bus stops within a five minute walk. The bar found in the Vaults was great and fab live Irish music playing Thursday and Friday.",4,2014,04,08
229,Good clean hotel,Had a long weekend with my friend the room had every thing in we needed very clean. Breakfast was manic but once you got a table food was good. Staff very helpful and friendly.We had a meal at night in the resterant which was also very good,4,2014,04,08
229,Great Weekend!,"This was our third time back to the Castle Hotel and like my previous 2 trips i could not fault it. We arrived on Friday Morning around 8am and our room was ready immediately, which was a nice touch after our flight. We found the room/bathroom clean and loved that the windows were open to let the fresh air in! :) The bar downstairs was always welcoming with Irish charm and the live music on Saturday Night was a great touch. The Hotel is literally a 2 min walk to O'Connell Street and within a 10 min stroll you can be at Temple Bar! The Reception Staff were helpful and efficient. On Sunday we entered the breakfast room at 9:45am, i was apprehensive that we would be rushed as it finished at 10am but the staff were more than accommodating and we enjoyed a lovely breakfast. As before i thoroughly enjoyed my time in Dublin & my time at The Castle Hotel, i will be back!!!",5,2014,04,08
229,Pick a different hotel! ,"I stayed here just for 2 nights and that's was far to long! 
There are signs up all over saying that are getting a refit, so needed but no signs of this taking place! The reception staff made you feel you unwelcome, the room had no heating, plug sockets didn't work, hair dryer provided didn't work, holes in the wall and paper peeling off! And the walls are paper thin so you get no sleep! ",1,2014,04,07
229,Fab weekend,"Just returned from Dublin, party of 8 adults and stopped at the Castle
Hotel.
Ideally placed for the city center and 5 minutes from were the airport
Shuttle bus stops.
5-10 minutes walk and you can be anywhere in the city.
Staff very friendly and helpful, room we had 138, clean, tea and coffee facilities tv, bathroom excellent. Breakfast, hot food cooked to order without a long wait, buffet for cereals juices toast. All excellent.
Bar is downstairs and on Saturday night was rocking with an Irish ballad singer playing to a packed room of hotel guests English, Dutch, German & Norwegian.
We ate in the cellar restaurant on Saturday night nice setting and again the food was excellent.
Would stay here again.",4,2014,04,06
229,Worth a visit ,"A ten minute walk from the city centre so nicely out of the way but not to far. Staff where very friendly and went out of their way to help. Had an issue with the room on the second night and was offered a new room. Manager was very helpful and apologetic and not only gave us a refund for the night in question but paid for a taxi back to the airport. Room was comfy and well equipped, bathroom was a little small but there was always hot water. 

Breakfast was VERY nice. Great start to any day. 

Recommend this hotel of your visiting Dublin. ",5,2014,04,02
229,Standard Hotel,"Fairly standard hotel, however staff were excellent and friendly. The lift was not working during our visit and our room was quite along way from the stairwell. Breakfast was nice but gets very crowded later on. Overall good value for money",3,2014,04,01
229,Good location ,Good location to O'Connell St. We were able to  walk to most attractions. Our first room had no hot water and the toilet wouldn't flush. They were able to move us but the first room was bigger and had better views. We ate at the restaurant in the basement and had to wait over an hour for our food to be served. They got my order wrong. Breakfast was good but not as many options as some other places. I would not book this hotel again. ,3,2014,04,01
229,Excellent hotel,We stayed at the castle hotel for 3 nights and could not fault it.  The room was spotless and the bed was very comfy.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice.   Looking forward to staying here again. ,5,2014,03,31
229,Average only!,"Recently stayed for three nights and was generally left quite underwelmed by this hotel. To start with the plus points it was clean, in a very good location to walk into the centre of Dublin and temple bar. The room was spacious although quite dated in terms of decor. The negative points for us was the fact that the central heating seemd to be permenantly on in the hall ways which caused the room to be very hot and stiffling. Having to then open the windows to try and make the room bearable then led to the outside noise coming in and leading to disturbed sleep every night and still waking up most mornings feeling very dehydrated due to the heat. Im sure this could have been easily solved and the stay made much more comfortable and it would be a perfectly reasonable stay for the price.",3,2014,03,31
229,Brilliant Hotel,"We have just arrived back from four nights away and found the hotel excellent, the rooms are large, clean and the bed very comfy. The breakfast was plentiful and the serving staff very cheerful and helpful. All in all a very good hotel at a reasonable price.",5,2014,03,31
229,I bet it's a lovely place to stay in Winter...,"I say this because the aesthetics and decor of the interior appeal to my taste. I like 'cozy' places full of charm and character and this hotel has it in abundance.
The bed was comfy, staff very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was nice too. I think I paid around £60 p/n as I booked an elongated stay (3+ dates) to qualify for a discounted rate. This proved to be well worth it and great value.",5,2014,03,30
229,Perfect balance of price and quality,"In this trip we had a limited budget and therefore we are looking for a reasonably priced accommodation. Caste Hotel was an ideal solution. It’s perfect balance of price and quality. This is a wonderful, cozy hotel in the old Georgian house with clean, cozy rooms (but very small) and a classic interior in the lobby.

Restaurant is in the basement, which creates a special atmosphere. On weekends there is live music. Musicians perform folk Irish songs. 

Hotel is located a 5-minute walk from the center. All major attractions are so close that there is almost no need to use public transport.",4,2014,03,29
229,The Castle - great but not grand,"Stayed here for a few nights at the weekend and was happy with the hotel and location.  The staff are friendly and the room was clean and comfortable, what more would we want.  Breakfast couldn't have been better, staff at hand to get you what you want though there is more than enough to choose from.  The only thing I would say is the porridge was a little thick so would stick to my cereal in future.  The Irish fry is more than adequate and set us up for our days out at Phoenix Park (do go to the zoo),  Dublin Castle (okay but not as impressive as other castles I have visited), Trinity College, Book of Kells, Library etc (worth a visit) and then the shops of course, of which there are plenty.  The Hotel is old with a lot of character, though probably could do with a little DIY here (creaky floorboards) but I still couldn't fault it as it all adds to it's atmosphere.  Would stay here again.",4,2014,03,27
229,Just right!,"We were only in Dublin for a few days and this was a great spot to be near it all.  We visited Guinness Brewery, vintage shops, local churches, fantastic pubs and musical nightlife.  Elephant and Castle nearby is yummy choice for food.  Its a very charming old place, nothing very fancy, but nothing gross either.  Exactly how I thought it would be, no surprises.  Great location and great value.",4,2014,03,25
229,St Patricks Day to remember,"This is my third time staying at the Castle Hotel. Me and my friend arrived last Sunday and were greeted by friendly staff. The room was lovely and we headed down to the Vaults bar. Staff in there were friendly and helpful. Breakfast the next day was served promptly and the staff could not do enough for us. We headed out for St Patricks Day parade and arrive back at the hotel for drinks later on in the evening. The drinks were very reasonably priced and the staff seemed to enjoy talking to us. All in all a fantastic trip and the Castle Hotel just adds to the whole St Patricks Day experience. As I said back in 2011 ""I will be back"" here again :)",5,2014,03,22
229,Friendly Place,"Stayed here for my birthday weekend and came back today, St Patrick's day.
Friendly and helpful reception staff, however staff in the vault were not very amenable on the night of my birthday as the St Patrick meal took precedence ruining my birthday meal.
Great location.
Lots of information on hand for things to do in Ireland.

Hotel was very stuffy and the water was TOO HOT at scalding point.
Had no shower curtain and hair dryer didn't  work reported this and was rectified straight away",5,2014,03,17
229,Lovely stay,"Went to watch Wales v Ireland rugby taking my wife and 5 members of our family. Like all city hotels hosting main sports events the prices charged by hotels was at a premium. This hotel was no exception but, fortunately the hotel and staff helped soften the blow.
The hotel was clean and ideally placed to give easy access to the city centre. There were 
plenty of staff available to look after all of our needs with nothing being too much trouble for them.
We particularly enjoyed the live traditional music provided by the hotel and the bar prices were very reasonable for Ireland.
The rooms were basic but very clean and comfortable and we would definitely stay there again.",5,2014,03,16
229,Excellent,"Stayed here for 2 nights excellent hotel faultless would recommend and will be back !  Location was central to dublin buses near by, within easy reach of pubs restaurants. The staff at hotel were extremely helpful ! ",5,2014,03,13
229,Great base,"We spent two nights here. The owner Fionn greeted us at one stage and is a real Irish charmer and very happy to chat and give insight to the magical city of Dublin. The staff were all so friendly and would go out their way to help. There is onsite parking available (€10 per day). The breakfast was good. The location fabulous and as close as needs be to the Temple bar area. The hop on hop off tour bus starts just down the road. 
Our room whilst was only a base had seen better days, my partner called it 'showing its age'. The hot water needed jogging one evening by a staff member (who was up pronto when we called reception). 
All in all an enjoyable trip and a room that did what it needed to do. ",3,2014,03,11
229,"Beautiful hotel, perfect location!","I stayed here with my boyfriend for 2 nights on 21st February and absolutely loved this hotel. I'm not usually the person to write reviews but the castle hotel definitely deserves one and I'm struggling to understand why previous reviews have had anything bad to say. To start with we arrived at the hotel at 8am expecting the room not to be ready but just wanting to leave our luggage somewhere but much to our surprise the room was ready! The staff were all extremely helpful gave us out key and we were off. Not only that but the reception was beautifully decorated, old elegant styled furniture with a red/cream/gold theme and a roaring fire. Our room was on the top floor which in the corridor had a large glass ceiling. We did have a couple of stairs down to our room one of which was a bit wobbly but what do you expect with an old building! Our room was lovely decorated very clean, nice wallpaper and bedding. Good desk area and plenty of space in the wardrobe. Still keeping with the old furniture so the hotel decor was not contradictory. By old I don't mean outdated. Bathroom a little bit basic but clean, tidy and everything you need. Breakfast was good limited choice if you're a fussy vegetarian like me but I still had plenty to eat. Location is probably one of the best things about this hotel too. Just off O'connell street so away from the noise but still right in the centre. Buses stop all down o Connell street too which is good. One tip I would give is if you're there for the weekend get a city tour bus ticket €18 lasts for two days hop on hop off. And the stop by the writers museum is just opposite the hotel so very easy and quick. On the Saturday night we even chose to eat in the hotels restaurant. Food was good and well priced. The restaurant is like an old tavern had a great atmosphere and great live music which made our meal extra special. Overall, the hotel in my opinion is perfect. Very helpful, polite staff too. If I was to return to Dublin there is no way I'd stay anywhere other than here. I fell in love.",5,2014,03,10
229,Excellent location,"My husband and I came here for my 30th birthday.  The castle hotel gave us a beautiful room with 4 poster bed.  The hotel is brilliantly located for all the touristy things to do in Dublin yet we weren't bothered by noise at all - and our room was front facing.  This was also a rugby weekend AND Beyoncé was playing at the O2 but still we didn't have any noise issues.  There is live music at the hotel but it is in the vaulted basement and there were no problems with noise travelling through to the rooms.  When we first arrived we were too early for check-in but Reception called to see if we were able to get into the room; we weren't but they kindly offered to store our bags for us whilst we got our bearings round the neighbourhood.  When we came back and got into the room we found we had no towels - we phoned Reception and someone came up within minutes with a bundle of fresh towels and an apology.  Later that day we also tried to get the shower to heat up but it remained stone cold...again, called Reception and literally within seconds she came up and resolved the issue straight away for us (the dial had been put on wrong way so cold was hot and hot was cold!)  Traditional Irish breakfast next day was ok; you could tell the sausages and bacon had been cooked in advance but most hotels do that with large numbers of guests and it was all hot enough; eggs were cooked fresh to order.  More than one rasher of bacon would have been nice.

We read the other mixed reviews here and I really think your experience of this hotel depends on what you are here for - we only wanted the room as a base for exploring Dublin.  Our room was a very pleasant surprise and it's only a pity we didn't spend more time in it.  If you want a hotel which is in an excellent location, convenient yet quiet, I think the Castle is perfect.",4,2014,03,10
229,No complaints!,Stayed here at the weekend and was a bit doubtful due to all the dodgy reviews - however I needn't have worried! Ok hotel is slightly old and dated but it is clean and tidy. Breakfast was great although we had an evening meal in restaurant and weren't very impressed - food wasn't great an staff just didn't seem to care! It was close to city centre and I would stay here again...it is probably slightly overpriced but if you got a good enough deal I'd recommend it! ,4,2014,03,10
229,The Castle Hotel in Dublin,Stayed here on the 8th of March 2014. Me my husband two children and a new born baby on arrival at the hotel we were given our room on the first floor as the lift was broken it was a struggle to climb the stairs with cases children baby and pram.The numbers on doors were not properly signed but we found the room eventually.The room itself was clean but the bathroom was basic and poorly finished.For the price of two hundred and thirty euro for one night the breakfast was a disgrace one sausage one rasher and one egg.We felt robbed. We are regular visitors to Dublin and we will never stay here again.,2,2014,03,09
229,I don't want to stay anywhere else.,"Not a hotel I'd used before but certainly one I'd return to next time I'm in Ireland. We went over to Dublin to research family history so we wanted somewhere near the city centre with a good breakfast to start the day. The hotel is a bit like an old country house with creaky stairs, odd corridors and lots of old furniture. We wanted ease of access, wi-fi in the rooms (which was fine) and nothing too expensive. The staff were great, very helpful and courteous, storing our cases on the first day while we went off to explore. We met the owner in the hotel one evening: very friendly and cheerful.
 When my wife had a fall leaving the Savoy Cinema in O'Connell street, the receptionist couldn't have been more helpful and fixed up an ice-pack for her on the spot. Top marks.",5,2014,03,08
229,"Very Disappointing, and Definitely Not a 3 Star Hotel","Don’t be fooled, it might be called The Castle, but it is definitely not a Castle. It might be rated 3 stars, but it definitely is not worthy of that (Holiday Inn's are for the most part 3 star, this place comes nowhere close to that).

This is an old Georgian house turned hotel, antiquated, overpriced ($126 via Hotwire a night), but adequate given that it is close to city center and this was a busy weekend in Dublin and I booked last minute.

It’s clear advantage is its proximity to Dublin city center, with walking distance to most places, and the staff were all, without exception, excellent.

GOOD
Bathroom was clean and adequate
The restaurant/bar with evening entertainment was nice, food was excellent
Free Wi-Fi worked well everywhere, but you will need a proxy to access some sites as it is heavily censored by the hotel (think Saudi Arabia style)

NOT SO GOOD
Room 211, small, outdated, carpets look worn, floors creaky, door drafty as it did not close tight
Mattress was very uncomfortable, bed clothes seemed small for the bed
TV was a small portable 14 inch, old style, located in a little corner 
Very low water pressure from the shower
No hot water in the mid and late afternoon, they blamed the city, but that was an excuse as there was lots of water, just it was cold
Not luggage/handicap friendly, there is an elevator, but to get to your room you still have to climb stairs

Not good value for the price paid.

Would I stay here again, no, unless I had to no other choice due to other hotels in the city center being fully booked.",3,2014,03,06
229,Was expecting more.....,"We were really disappointed in this property...this was our last stop in our trip throughout Ireland. This hotel is old, and very outdated. The pictures shown represent ingot he hotel are deceiving. Outdated rooms, cheap linens and mattresses....creaky stairs...I will say the staff was very helpful, and tried to make us happy, but as I said, this place needs a lot of TLC.",3,2014,03,05
229,Thoroughly recommend,"Stayed at this hotel weekend 28/2/2014  Three minutes walk from where the airport buses stop on O'Connelll street  excellent location 10-15 minute walk to temple bar.  Staff very friendly the breakfast is big enough to last all day  the rooms are very clean  live Irish music Friday  and Saturdays excellent location cannot fault this hotel. If I ever return to Dublin again this will  be my first choice of hotel

Warning alcoholic drinks in hotel pricey but to be expected and is good value if adding in the entertainment during the weekend.  Temple bar if you are a heavy drinker will break the bank i.e. pint  of lager 6-7 euros  two small glasses of wine 12 euros  keep to the back street pubs to get normal prices",5,2014,03,04
229,Fab cosy traditional Irish place to stay,"Stayed 2 nights  and really loved this hotel. It has a really cosy feel to it, the staff are all so friendly and lovely. The Irish music on Saturday night was just brill. Our room was basic but it really didn't matter. Would definitely stay again. ",4,2014,03,02
229,brilliant!,"This was my 5th stay at the castle because it is the best hotel in Dublin at the best price and best location.On this occasion I was with my two little girls and our room was fantastic.We had the bedroom,bathroom with bath and shower and I dining area too.We were facing into the courtyard so it was nice and quiet apart from the extremely flatulent guest in the room next door-seriously he must have hurt hisself!My kids of course found this highly amusing and proved one of the highlights of our trip for them.The staff as usual were fantasic and the live traditional irish folk music with Dino and Catherine on Friday night was just brilliant.The full Irish breakfast was just what we needed and the breakfast staff were lovely.The location of the hotel is perfect as it just on the edge of town so no noisy revellers outside and only a 10-15 minute walk to temple bar.we will be back soon.",5,2014,03,01
229,First timers to Ireland !! :],"we arrived late on Monday night to be greeted by Sam who was very welcoming. quick and efficient. we stayed for 3 nights and every morning breakfast was lovely, again the girls down stars where breakfast was served were also very quick and friendly,
every time we left and come back to the hotel we were welcomed with smiles and  hello. 
the one dinner we had in the Vault Restaurant was lovely I always have fish where ever I go, and this was one of the best. 
rooms were very clean and tidy and plenty of storage space. was very nice to see rooms were cleaned daily and we got fresh coffee cups. 
your Wi-Fi was very good and was always working . 
over all we really enjoyed our stay and WILL be coming back to you. 
location was PERFECT not to far out that we had to walk miles but not to close that was noisy at night. 
we also got a very nice send of from the Hotel Owner . so would like to thank him as well. 
we look forward to coming back.

Ben and Sam. 
x",4,2014,02,27
229,Brilliant!,"I loved the hotel as soon as I walked through the door - open fire, smiling receptionist, lots of seats in the lounge, fast service, 24 hour reception. I stayed for 3 nights and had lovely breakfast every morning - brought to me by lovely staff members. Just sit back and order anything you need - perfect ;)",5,2014,02,26
229,Good base could easily be so much better,"Staff very friendly and welcoming. Odd that I had to pay on arrival but never mind. We had a double superior room lovely Georgian room with plenty of storage. 
Great location as only a short walk to the centre of Dublin with bus routes nearby.
Room was very cold on arrival but it eventually warmed up. Bathroom had a slight dampness odour to it but not too unpleasant to cause offence.
Minor issues for me there was no hand soap then the next day no shower gel (there was only enough for one day left)
If your going to have a TV then can we have a channel guide and it tuned properly or invest in a signal booster.
We didn't eat in the restaurant and breakfast was ok but why do hotels use cheap sausages?? Was going to try the continental but there were no croissants or pastries which was disappointing. A few minor changes here and it'll be  great. We didn't get disturbed by others in the hotel although it could do with investment in sound proofing as the road noise was at times too much.   
So sum up its in a great location  and all the staff were very polite, helpful and friendly. Would I return here again - probably",3,2014,02,23
229,Average,"Adequate facilities and rooms, good breakfast and excellent location for exploring Dublin. Reception staff were friendly, rooms were basic but tidy. Cleaners did a great job every day without disturbing. The only downside was our room overlooked a noisy car park (only noisy during the  day)",3,2014,02,18
229,"Buyer Beware, Hotel charges upfront...","We recently booked this hotel for a upcoming concert in Dublin (in July 2014) only to find ourselves unbooked 2 days later and the room let out (probably at a much higher rate) to someone else.
My bank confirmed that the hotel had gone into my account looking for the full room payment rate and when it wasn't there they cancelled our booking even though both they and Booking.Com say that your bank card is only to secure the room and that you pay at the Hotel.

If you can afford to pay in advance go for it...

We called the hotel for an explanation on the Thursday and it wasn't until the following Wednesday that we got an unsatisfactory answer from the Manager",1,2014,02,06
229,Great location.,"This hotel is in a great location, the staff were friendly and really helpful. They let us check in 5 hours early and the breakfast was nice.
The room and bathrooom were spotlessly clean and there was plenty of tea and coffee in the room. 
Noise did travel from one room to another, but in such an old building and for a reasonable price you have to expect some flaws.",4,2014,02,04
229,Really enjoyed the hotel,My husband and I stayed here for a weekend really enjoyed it.Rooms were spotless and bed very comfortable the staff are fantastic and couldnt do enough.Live music was great and craic with other guests great would return.,4,2014,02,04
229,OK for a short stay in Dublin,"A simple hotel with friendly staff who offered us some warm hospitality.

Yes, the rooms and decor are a bit dated, but the hotel was clean, tidy and the staff very friendly.

Whilst we were there was live music in the bar each night, the standard of which was remarkably good.

Situated just off the end of Grafton Street, the location is great for those looking for a city centre base.

Not the most comfortable of beds, never-the-less a good choice for a short stay.",3,2014,01,30
229,Ok for a couple of nights.,"Good location within easy walking distance of the main Dublin areas. Arrived early and the staff checked us in straight away. The room was pleasant as well as clean and tidy. Breakfast was reasonable with a good selection, waiting staff very attentive and helpful. Both myself and my wife are vegans, thus the cooked breafast consisted of a full fry up minus the meat. The result being a plate of beans and some mushrooms. Situation normal there for a hotel then!
The second night we hardly got any sleep due to your usual drunken idiots using the rear courtyard to smoke at 3am. Maybe you could do so a little more quietly and with consideration for other guests? Perhaps the hotel could look into this?
The real disapointment I think came when we went to check out. Handed our key over and received a ""Thank you"" that was it. Call me fussy but I like something along the lines of ""Hi, Hope you enjoyed your stay with us, was everything ok?""
A mediocre hotel that could be better I think.",3,2014,01,27
229,Quirky hotel in a great location,"Just spent a great couple of days in Dublin. Chose this hotel because it was very reasonably priced yet in a great location.  We had a lovely greeting on arrival and even though it was well before check in our room was ready. This is not a modern 5 star hotel with all mod cons - for us it was far more interesting.  It has a winding staircase with creaky floorboards and some great original features and ornaments.

Our room was adequately sized as we were hardly in it and very clean and comfortable. Breakfast was a relaxed affair with no-one rushing you out when you had finished.

The staff were absolutely lovely from arrival to departure.  We would stay here again without a doubt.",4,2014,01,26
229,NEVER AGAIN !!,"Having just returned from an overnight stay (Friday 20th Dec 2013) I am to say the least most disappointed with the Castle Hotel, we were booked by my son who is aware of my wife and I both liking traditional Irish music, only to find out (by asking) that Friday night would have no live music, despite what was said on the website, also the TV remote control not working I was told due to the wind, I am an ex TV engineer and thought that explanation rather strange, the bar appeared to be running down their stocks, no brandy, and very little Irish whiskey Friday evening. When we arrived our room was cold, radiators were turned off (in December?) when turned on the valve dribbled water, the room smelt damp, so needed to open the window with no heating (remember this is in December)

The website appears not to have a review facility otherwise these comments would be posted.

This complaint was e-mailed to the Hotel, was read by them but no reply has been received.",2,2014,01,21
229,Lovely budget hotel,"We stayed here for 1 night in Jan 2914 and found it great.
The staff were so friendly and it was within walking distance of everything.
Breakfast was nice.
Bedrooms were basic but very clean.
The bar stayed open late for guests and as it is located downstairs its perfect for a late night drink while not disturbing other guests.",5,2014,01,20
229,one night say with teenage kids but never again!,"Stayed here on Jan 2nd as part of a shopping trip with my 3 teenage kids,room v shabby & dated net curtains filthy room v stuffy & blaring music till late in bar downstairs had to ring recpt
ok b/fast",2,2014,01,17
229,"Not like the website, we moved hotels as not as expected","The staff were friendly but the hotel is really quite shabby and the heating system is centrally controlled only, meaning that you either boil or freeze.  Last night staying here, we really struggled to sleep as it was so hot (radiator boiling and right next to the bed) and unable to adjust the radiator.  Opened the windows but street noise added t the problem.  Overall, quite dingy and not as smart as the website pictures.  We paid extra for a superior room but this was a bit of a joke - didn't even have a bath or shower (wet room only). We asked for a refund this morning and were told this was a regular problem and then went to a different hotel for our second night.  Other rooms we were offered were a bit smelly and same heating problem.  Some nice music in the cellar bar 9pm-10pm last night and friendly staff.  Not the safest of areas. If staying here - look after your belongings and consider taxis rather than walking, esp in evenings.",2,2014,01,11
229,"Good, could be great with some refinements","Nice hotel,  friendly staff.
With some refinements this could be a great hotel. 
Room was fine,  although you can hear everything that is going on around you.  
Heating was either off or full on,  thermostats on radiators would be a good idea.
Main shopping street, O'Connell street is 5 minutes walk with plenty of pubs and restaurants.
",4,2014,01,09
229,Great value for money,"Just arrived home from a 3 night stay at this hotel. Location was fab, only a few minutes of the main O'Connell street.
First visit to Dublin was greatly surprised of how easy to arrive at the airport and straight outside the is bus stops and a lovely irish conductor who can help you with what ticket you may need. 20 minutes later you are dropped of a Catha Brugel Street , 4 mins up the road is the hotel. When you need to return to the airport its on the same road just on the other side signposted city link 747.
The room was lovely on the second floor, had an extra bed in ours. Very clean and tidy and looked quite new. Staff very pleasant and helpful. 
We were looking forward to listening to the  irish band that should be playing thurs through to Saturday, but unfortunately they weren't coming. 
But that was okay as there are plenty of bars and restaurants in the area within walking distance where some play some irish music. 
Visited Murray's bar on O'Connell street, food was hot, fab and tasty and the staff were great!!
Many places to visit, we walked everywhere and saw pretty much all of the sites. But you can get a hop on and hop off bus or tour anywhere on O'Connell street. 
Hotel has lots on information to hand. 
Or you could just chill out in your irish surroundings.
A definite place to visit.",4,2014,01,07
229,Excellent accommodation & fab breakfast,"Just spent a weekend in Dublin staying at this hotel.  A quirky hotel with all that you need for a city break stay.  Room had everything we needed. Breakfast service fast and efficient and excellent food.  Really comfy bed and lovely shower.
Only negative was that there was no live music at the weekend as stated on the website, therefore we did not eat in the hotel as we wanted more atmosphere. And there was very little drawer space for clothes.
Would definitely recommend and stay there again.",4,2014,01,07
229,Fab elegant hotel,Stayed here for one night in a brilliant large family room on the top floor. Room 423. 5 people in a room and heaps of space. Even had a sofa for hubby and I to relax on. Food in the restaurant was gorgeous and they catered for our wee girl who is a very fussy coeliac! Early bird menu was 20 Euro for 3 courses and they had great choices to suit us all. Kids were only 5.95 euros for 2 courses-super!! Entertainment afterwards was traditional Irish and sounded great. We did request a few songs and he accommodated us-thank you. From check in til check out we had no problems. Loved the fact it was just off O'Connell street so shopping was a must! They have a private secure overnight car park which they kindly let us stay in even after we had checked out-wow!! Hope to stay here again.,5,2014,01,06
229,Great value for money!,"We've just arrived home after a 3 night break over the New Year period. I cannot fault this hotel, the staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean and spacious, the breakfast was lovely and the location was perfect. It's only 2 minutes walk from the airport shuttle bus stop (1 small tip, buy a hop on hop off bus tour and your bus ticket to the airport is free) and 5-10 minutes walk to the centre of Dublin. I would definitely stay here again!",4,2014,01,04
229,"The Castle Hotel, Fit for a King","I have not been more impressed with a hotel then I am with The Castle Hotel in Dublin.  The staff, from reception to the Castle Vault Restaurant have been exceptional during my entire stay.  I have been to other parts of Europe, Africa, and all over North America not having found such a fine hotel as The Castle.  My first night here I enjoy the three course selection on the menu with goat cheese salad, 11 oz sirloin, and baileys cheesecake for dessert, I walked away from the dinner table satisfied and with plans to return.  The steak is better than RuthsChris steak in the US.  The accommodations for all 8 nights was peaceful and quiet with the consideration that my stay was through the NYE Dublin Gathering.  Thank you Castle Staff for making my first time in Dublin a memorable and pleasant one.",5,2014,01,03
229,Good hotel,"We have just got back from a New Year break to this hotel, and it was a lovely place to stay. The staff are very friendly and will help with anything. The bar is nice and cosy with entertainment every evening. Everywhere's kept nice and clean. Breakfast was a bit chaotic, but the hotel was full. Would recommend.",4,2014,01,02
229,"Classic Hotel, Great Location","This was our first trip to Dublin. We wanted a hotel with easy access to tours, restaurants and the airport shuttle. This classic bed and breakfast met our needs perfectly. The Dublin Airport Shuttle drops off two minutes from the hotel on O'Connell Street. (The hotel is a quarter block from O'Connell/Parnell.)  All the major tour companies leave from the Ireland Discovery Center, also nearby on O'Connell Street. The Temple Bar District is an easy 20 minute walk. Lots of shopping, restaurants and pubs are within a few blocks. The hotel is in a friendly classic building, with roaring fires and nice staff. Full Irish Breakfast was included, as well as lighter alternatives. Unlike the B&Bs directly on O'Connell, the Castle didn't have street noise. The rooms were older, but clean and nice. We would stay here again.",4,2014,01,02
229,Castle  Hotel,"Loved this quirky hotel. The hotel is filled with antiques, squeaky floors, and a pub in the basement. It is a five minute walk from the airport bus stop. The center is a ten minute walk away with lots of shopping in the area. The breakfasts were very good. The staff were friendly. Dublin is a great City. I plan to go back and I will stay at this hotel again. The price for my room was very reasonable and it included the breakfast.",5,2014,01,01
229,Stinky Bathroom,"We visited the hotel the weekend before Christmas for a city break.
The hotel staff were very friendly and welcoming and were willing to help us with taxis, directions etc.
However our room was not up to our standard of cleanliness. The bathroom did not have a shower cubicle, just a wet room, so after a shower the whole room would be flooded. If you wanted to go to use the toilet the bottoms of your trousers would get very wet! Also the bathroom consistently smelt bad.
The room itself was ok, although mattresses were not 100% clean and I trod on a piece of glass with bare feet. Staff very apologetic though.

Overall this hotel is fine if you want a reasonably priced weekend away. But not great if you have high standards of cleanliness.",3,2013,12,30
229,Much better than I imagined.,"I stayed at the hotel on a reunion for a weekend in early December. Every other hotel we tried to stay at was much dearer than this. I was rather concerned how north of O'Connell street the hotel was but it is a few minutes walk from there. The reception staff were friendly and helpful. There were 5 of us checking into 5 single rooms and the hotel system seemed a bit time consuming. The hotel is full of character and my single room was OK. I had to turn the radiator down as I would never have slept later. We stayed 3 nights, the breakfast was reasonable and the staff friendly.
We went into the bar area later on the Saturday night and there was a singer singing Irish music. I rather like traditional Irish music and the singer was very good. We did not eat at the hotel in the evening. 
Dublin is one of my favourite cities and in the future I will stay here  again. Dublin is expensive to stay and this hotel offered very good value.",4,2013,12,28
229,Won't Return,"My main complaint was that the front desk staff was not really pleasant to deal with. Only one young lady took it upon herself to help when I complained that people off the street could watch me shower not to mention, the bathroom had no heat and it was cold. In general, the staff seems put off by the guests and for my first time visiting Ireland, it was not a nice welcome. Thanks to the one staff member, I was switched to another room away from the street and with heat in the bathroom - the rooms in the back seem to have been updated while the street rooms haven't. I was informed that this was an upgrade and while I appreciated it, it's not enough to get me to recommend the hotel. The cleaning staff was very pleasant and helpful and the hotel in general is clean.",3,2013,12,22
229,It was OK,"I stayed three nights at the Castle Hotel last week. It failed to 'wow' me, but was generally OK. The room was a good size and the bed was comfortable. Room was comfortable temperature; bathroom was fine, and the internet worked well. Breakfast was not bad, and staff were generally friendly. I did find that noise from the hallway carried into the room more than I would have liked - not sure if the doors are too thin, lack insulation, or what, but this must be something that could be fixed. Overall it was OK and I would stay there again if the price was right.",3,2013,12,16
229,no heating,"hi both my son and i we stayed in the castle hotel in early november and when we got back to our
hotel around 830 we notice that our room was cold, so i went to reception to report it and i 
was told that they would check it out , we went out to the cinema and returned to find that
nothing was done about the heating so it was late and i asked them for extra plankets 
the next morning i again reported our room to reception and again i was told that they
would it out, we left the hotel around 10 o clock and returded at about 9 o clock to find
 that the room was still freez'ing , i went to reception and ask to see the manager whom
i was told was on holidays so i talked to the next in charge and she sent up some one to
check out the room , he told me the rads where air locked and he had a same problem
in about 8 other rooms , anyway he couldent fix the central heating so we had to put up
with a small heater that went bonkers in the night , the hotel is a lovly place to stay in
 if you are a eskimo , i wont be staying in it again",3,2013,12,10
229,Trip to Dublin,"Relatively Central, short  distance to shopping ara and Temple bar. Hotel is  old and a lot of stairs and small corridors. Clean and very good breakfast.
Doors  letting in much sound and  small bathroom.  Shavers  contact not working. Converter handed out. Nice and friendly staff.",3,2013,12,09
229,Christmas cheer:),"Had a fantastic overnight stay in The Castle Hotel, couldn't have asked for more. Our family room was massive and we had the sole use of a sitting room beside it so it was like having a suite. We were 2 couples and 5 kids in total and everyone enjoyed their stay.

The hotel is in a great central location, it is a quirky elegant old building that is a maze of nooks, crannies and little sitting rooms. The dining room served a 3 course meal for 20 euro and kids meals for 6 euro which was great value as the food was superb. Waiting and bar staff were lovely and us adults received a free Irish coffee each for dining in the hotel restaurant. the friendly owner came round all the tables for a chat which we felt was a nice personal touch. There was entertainment in the bar that night and a great night was had by all.

The beds were incredibly comfortable, the room was warm, dark and we didn't hear any noise at all from the street so a good nights sleep was had by all.

The only thing that let the hotel down was the breakfast. It was a free for all with too few tables and no organisation. A few young non-english speaking staff were waiting the tables and we ended up waiting about 40 minutes for our cooked breakfast which was cold when it arrived. It was obvious these staff were just passing through and didn't really care about the customers. However, 2 older staff members were very apologetic to us and brought us fresh teas and coffees.",4,2013,12,03
229,Castle Hotel Dublin,"We have just returned from a stay at The Castle Hotel in Dublin and would definitely return & recommend. 

Can only echo what other reviewers have said in terms of location - its very centrally located just off O'Connell Street, and is ideal for the airport bus drop off/ pick up points on O'Connell Street.  Temple Bar is only a 10 minute walk away, as is Grafton Street, with Henry Street Shopping about 5 minutes away.

The hotel is a very typical Georgian style ""maze"" of a hotel, with lots of interconnecting staircases and corridors.  The rooms were really big and spotlessly clean.  As other reviewers have said, this is not the most modern hotel, but equally it does not set itself up as being so and I personally really liked the charm of the place.  This hotel really represents great value for money in a central location.

We ate in the hotel bar on our first night there and were really surprised by the quality and value of the food - we don't usually eat in hotels, preferring to get out & about, but the food was really excellent and as we found out later in our trip, excellent value for Dublin which is an expensive city.

Staff seemed really lovely too.  Would definitely recommend & return.",4,2013,12,03
229,Another great stay,"This was our 3rd stay at Castle hotel Dublin and we will surely be back again. The location is great, just a short walk to temple bar and the city centre shops. The staff are very welcoming, I want to mention Mick at the bar in particular as he is an asset to the hotel and goes above and beyond what is expected of him and we felt like old friends rather than hotel guests. Also Trevor who we didnt see this time but has always been very welcoming. Its the bar staff for me that steps this hotel up from good to great, plus the fact that the bar has traditional live Irish music at the wkend which is outstanding! The only downside is the music finishes too early for my liking at around 10pm but I understand this is because they dont want to disturb the guests who opt for an early night.
We ate dinner at the hotel for the first time this time and the food was just average in my opinion but my husband had steak which he said was very good.
Overall we had another excellent wkend and will definitely be back for our 4th stay in the new year!",5,2013,12,02
229,Really nice hotel in good location.,"Good value for money. Not the most modern but comes with a certain charm. Friendly and helpful staff. 

Rooms small but pleasant and clean.

City sight-seeing bus stop on the door step. 

Two minutes walk from O'Connell Street. ",4,2013,11,24
229,Good Hotel Property,Spent 10 days at Castle Hotel. I have visited Dublin several times and I have to say this was the best value for my money. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Good breakfast with lots of choices included in room charges. That's a nice benefit. Rooms are clean. The property is located right off O'Connell street so you're near to all the sights. The property consists of a number of old Georgian buildings connected together so not everything matches up and there are some narrow corridors and interesting quirks. That's part of its character. It's a bit noisy especially on weekends but that's to be expected in City Center. I take earplugs just in case. ,4,2013,11,22
229,Really nice hotel,"Stayed at the Castle for for 5 nights and it was clean and very comfortable.  The staff were friendly and helpful and for a 3 star hotel the food was exceptionally good.  Music in the bar on Friday night made our stay even better.  Wonderfully situated and a short walk to tour buses, etc.  Not too good for older, less mobile people as the rooms are off a warren of hallways and the dining room is reached by a flight of stairs.
Breakfast was good with a vegetarian alternative.  The only reason I gave this hotel 4 stars was after full Irish breakfasts, on the fifth morning it would have been nice to have a bit of fresh fruit rather than the tinned grapefruit and mandarins and also a choice of cheese would have been appreciated, but it was still excellent value.  We'll be back!",4,2013,11,22
229,"sweet hotel, better value than the shelbourne...","we stayed here one night, and should have stayed the second...after transferring to The Shelbourne, we found out they had a chimney issue and were downgraded to a room lesser than this one, and we paid a mighty one-night stay as well at the Shelbourne...our Castle Hotel room was lovely, tall ceilings, ensuite bath with shower, and a little noisey, but hey, you're in Dublin, city does not sleep:)))anyway, great staff, very friendly, and nice breakfast spread, didn't get any at Shelbourne-the value here is so much better at The Castle Hotel, and still had some nice frills. Thank you, Shelly and Brett, Michigan",4,2013,11,15
229,Clontarf Castle,"Dinning experience at the knights bar was wonderful, bar and waitress service was superior Dympna we never saw you stop, and you were great with all the guests. Bar staff were attentive and switched on. The Castle itself had an amazing feeling and if you are a smoker there is a wonderful airy outdoor area to accommodate your needs.

Not too sure about house keeping, not all bins were emptied, and not all glasses and rubbish had been removed.

Over all I will be returning, what a welcoming place with good history

I love Ireland, from a New Zealander, we couldn't be further apart",5,2013,11,08
229,Great Weekend,"just arrived back from a 3 night stay, excellent weekend, there were 6 of us in 3 twin rooms, all located near to each other on the same floor as requested. Hotel was full so breakfast was a liitle hectic but the food was good. We ate in the hotel one night and the food was very good. The entertainment in the cellar bar was great and good for us my 13 year old granddaughter was with us and she was not allowed in local bars after 9pm. Staff were great, very helpful for information etc and very friendly. Hotel is about 10 min walk down O'Connell street to shops, Temple Bar area etc. Far enough away to be quiet but close enough to get to places. Overall we had a great time and will be returning",5,2013,11,05
229,"Friendly staff, great value","It's a bit of a rabbit warren of rooms this hotel... Surprisingly easy to get lost!  But otherwise the rooms are excellent value and the location is good.  It's a short walk to where the tour buses start in O'Connell Street, and the River Liffy, Temple Bar and most attractions are a walkable distance.  The staff were exceptionally helpful both before and during our trip.  There's also a really good restaurant and bar with traditional Irish music which gave us an atmospheric Irish welcome.  Only downside...It was pretty noisy at night (from the street), but we were there over Halloween so there were a lot of noisy people out late",5,2013,11,03
229,Great,"Have just returned from a couple of nights stay at the Castle Hotel. Arrived early morning and were able to store our suitcases safely until check in. Staff were very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Rooms were good, comfortable and clean. Breakfast was lovely, staff accomodated our family's needs. Convenient location.  Loved the fact that many of the Georgian features have been kept. ",5,2013,11,03
229,Great hotel for city break,"Hotel was clean and comfortable with very helpful staff. Breakfast was good and we enjoyed our stay. A bargain hotel close to the city centre. The only improvement we would have liked to see would be for the staff to at least ask for a name each time you pick up your key, as it worried us that it would have been possible for anybody to have accessed our room.",5,2013,11,01
229,Excellent and thanks,"I stayed at this hotel the night before this years Dublin Marathon and i just have to write to thank the staff for the excellent service provided, 
From the moment we checked in they could not have been more helpful.
They opened up the breakfast serving early so the runners could get an early breakfast before the race, they also allowed us to come back to the hotel after the race for a shower and a change of clothes even though we had already checked out which i thought was a brilliant service as it made our day a whole lot easier.
The hotel might be a bit creaky but its perfectly clean and comfortable and in a great location.",5,2013,10,31
229,the hotel needs refurbishement,"i booked this hotel through booking.com, the room was small, old bed, we had like a ramp in our room. the bed was cracking too much noise we can hear the noise around us. the room is clean. the tv is funny just like those old small tv's well this an hotel in the 1970 or in the 2013. when u go down the stairs you can hear the cracking all over the hotel..... and about the breakfast.... so poor when i asked for and irish breakfast they gave me  a plate with one bacon one saucages some scrambled eggs well this is so poor for dublin a two star is too much for this hotel.... it is not so close to the city center 15 min walk to temple bar",2,2013,10,30
229,Great for Honeymoon,My husband and I stayed there two nights  in June 2013 on our honeymoon while we explored Dublin. The people were very friendly and the rooms nice.  We got an upgrade when  we mentioned the honeymoon and that was lovely.,3,2013,10,30
229,Castle Hotel Dublin,"Really would recommend this hotel in Dublin, we always read the reviews and with this one we were not disappointed. It is very centrally located, easy walking distance to everywhere and we felt safe exploring this city in the day and at night!
Hotel is lovely, staff very friendly and the room was great. Breakfast is good. We also had an evening meal at the hotel and the food was nice and the service excellent.
Recommend a trip on the DART to Bray just to see the coast-line if nothing else, but if you fancy stretching your legs when you get there take the coastal path to Greystones it's about a 7km walk and it's fantastic!",4,2013,10,30
229,Nice hotel,"I stayed at the Castle Hotel in Dublin this past summer.  It's an older hotel, but it's a nice facility.  The restaurant is very good.  The staff friendly, courteous and professional.  The rooms are clean and comfortable, but my room had very noisy plumbing.
      ",4,2013,10,29
229,"A little creaky, but an all round success...","We arrived early on the Saturday morning to a pleasant welcome from reception staff, we were allowed to store our cases as our rooms weren't ready and we headed out for the day. Before doing, we asked for some help from the desk and they spent a good 20 minutes giving us really helpful advice, really good service. All the way through the stay nothing was too much, my wife and sister both wanted baths in their rooms and our rooms were changed without any hassle. Breakfast time and Carmel was a star, she memorised 7 different breakfast and drink requests and delivered every time without fail. Extra eggs, no problem, extra sausage was no issue. We ate in the restaurant the first night and again, service impeccable by a young Argentine man on his travels and good food for a fair price. Overall the stay was great, my only criticism is one that really can't be helped and actually one that you would expect from a Georgian hotel with character, but the walls are incredibly thin, you can hear everyone walking past, talking and early checkouts are obvious with loud dropping of suitcases potentially giving earlier than needed wake up calls. Personally, none of this bothered me, but I know it affected some people in our group. 

I would recommend this hotel as the service was great and the location handy right at the top of O'Connell street, just may not be right for you if your a particularly light sleeper!! ",4,2013,10,29
229,Castle Hotel a Good Base for Dublin,"My wife and I recently spend three nights at the Castle Hotel in Dublin.  We were very pleased with the location, service, breakfast, and room.  Plus the price was very reasonable.  We would definitely use it again for our base when visiting Dublin.",4,2013,10,26
229,Great location,"Pleasant stay at friendly, well-located hotel.  Desk very helpful with local information.  They have a contracted cab for transport to airport scheduled as you request.  The decor is faded Georgian elegance,
but clean and a good value less than a block from O'Connell Street and easy walking distance to many Dublin sites.",4,2013,10,22
229,Great stay,Stayed in this hotel while attending a concert. I come to Dublin often and I would defiantly stay in this hotel again the staff at reception were so nice and that really made our stay. So looking forward to booking it again.,5,2013,10,13
229,COMFORTABLE friendly and convenient,"Well placed for easy walk to main visitor sites. Our room was a bit small but clean and had all we needed.  Many interesting objects, rooms, furniture etc gave a quaint feel to the place but makes a change from ultra modern places. Bathroom slightly dated but perfectly adequate.  Bar and restaurant only ok, but convenient for a quick drink.  Breakfast fine, although one room was very hot, and the other 
incredibly noisy. Toaster very inefficient but that seems to be a feature of many hotels.  We got a good deal so good value. 
Helpful staff.",4,2013,10,11
229,Fab weekend,"Had a brilliant weekend at Castle Hotel, Dublin with 3 friends. The hotel is in an excellent location 2 minute walk to O'Connell Street and about 15 min walk to Temple Bar. We had e mailed ahead and asked for a room at back of hotel after reading other reviews saying it can get noisy at front, and got a large room ( only 4 of us but room had a double and 3 single beds, large bathroom and settee). All staff very friendly and helpful (thanks for the number for dominoes pizza!). Plenty of choice for breakfast, considering the number of tables both mornings we received a fresh,hot cooked breakfast which was delicious. The hotel was spotlessly clean with fresh towels each day (don't worry about taking shower gel or shampoo plenty available in room, also tea and coffee!) very good value for money will definitely recommend and we will return.
Hints: if you are students take student ID as can get good discounts on tourist attractions and in some bars.
The hop on hop off bus is the best way to see all of Dublin.
Mandarin House Chinese on Parnell street excellent and good value- meals very large!
Alcohol can be expensive there is an Aldi and a Lidl on Parnell Street to get you started before you go out!",4,2013,10,08
229,An oldie but a goodie,"This is like Fawlty towers in the City, corridors going in all directions,  closed doors, stairs up and down everywhere, a very frazzled maintenance man and cleaning supervisor. 
Antique looking sofas with wobbly uneven legs, beautiful sideboards and immitation  masters artwork adorning the walls. 
Reception staff very friendly and helpful with pleasant smiling eyes, even if they have no idea of where anything else is in the city. 
Rooms recently refurbished to a 3* standard, tiling in bathroom completed by a blind tiler as nothing is level must drive cleaning staff crazy! 
Free wifi, great meals and traditional music plus the bonus of off street parking at only 10€a day.",3,2013,10,03
229,Well situated,"We stayed from 27th-30th September.  The room was a good size and the bed was comfortable. Breakfast was nice and all of the staff were very friendly and helpful. The location is good for everything, shops, bars etc. The people of Dublin are very friendly. The only complaint that I would voice is that the street was filthy with paper wrappers and cigarette ends and it still was when we left!!",4,2013,10,02
229,I liked it!,"Stayed in a single room on Sept 28th and 29th.   it's well situated for city center museums, shows and  gaelic games in Croke Park.   The room was small but adequate. Breakfast, served over three tidy rooms had good variety but the fry could be less greasy with a small effort and I think them self service rotating toasters only cause queues, delay and frustration .  Ray Cox with his one man show was excellent in the bar at night.   Giving brief histories to some of his ballads and folk songs. He was a master hand and getting his audience to participate without intruding, he even had  Michael Barry the young bar man singing along!   Michael was  so cheerful,friendly and capable I felt he was a bosses' dream employee.  He was also  entertaining and informative if you wanted to chat.  (No! he's not a relation!!!  I never stayed or met anyone from that hotel before)    Well done I'll be back!   MPF.",3,2013,10,02
229,Great location with all conveniences,"We stayed 3days, and went on the red bus hop -on hop -off tour which means you can use that bus for 2 days.  There is a bus stop just across the street so you have transportation to the shops and restaurants. There is also a nice bar /restaurant inside the hotel. Also there is a soup /salad /sandwich /pastry shop next door which seems to be connected to the hotel by a lower level dining area which they share. We found everyone helpful and friendly. A great price for such convenience.",5,2013,10,02
229,Awesome hotel,This is an exceptional hotel with an exceptional staff. It is conveniently located by all the best attractions as well as the airport. We stayed for 4 nights and enjoyed every bit of it. The food is great and the service is great. They have a live band on the weekends and Mick is by far the best barman/server. There would be no need to go to another pub in Dublin because this one bar far has the best people from all over. Be sure to sit at the bar to be served by the best (Mick) and have good conversation with Christy. I would recommend this hotel to everyone and will be visiting again in March.,5,2013,10,01
229,Welcoming Staff Fantastic Service,First the reason im writing is i could not find management to say this too!I visited the castle hotel on the 28th for the gaa replay as i heard they do a good feed for breakfast. Somewhat of a challenge to find the bar where breakfast was being served and was not dissapointed what i got! For 10 euro i got a full irish with 2 of everything great value for money! I was one of a group of 8 and we got chatting to the barman and the drink started flowing it is a beautiful bar and a proper cosy feel. If it was not for the barman Mick we would not of came back after the game! When we arrived back we were greeted by him and our pints were up without asking! He is a great asset to the hotel and all of my group agreed nothing was too much and from people we were talking to the feeling was the same! Topman we will return again. Thanks Mick,5,2013,09,29
229,Brett & Lynn,"An interesting Hotel we stayed here upon arrival in Dublin and on our last night before leaving Ireland to catch the morning Ferry.  Nothing was too much trouble, had a great dinner and breakfast here.  Rooms were spacious, the first stay we had a room with road frontage which was very noisy the second time we requested a room to the back of the Hotel which was quieter.  A clean Hotel with lots of nooks and crannys to explore.  Staff couldn't be more helpful with requests we made and information we needed.",4,2013,09,27
229,Excellent location and exceptional value for money,"I booked 4 nights here online as part of a package and was really dubious as it seemed so cheap but the reviews seemed good and the photos looked like it was an interesting place. I still do not understand why it is so reasonably priced! Everything about it was great! Yes it has faded charm but that adds to the feel of the place. It is a very good 3 star hotel. Lots of odd steps and stairs so watch out if you are unsteady on your feet - especially after lots of guinness, but I really can't recommend it enough. I was travelling alone so was expecting a broom cupboard room, but was really pleased. I was on the 4 th floor at the back, so it was really quiet even with the window open. The room was fairly small but had a double bed and more than enough space for one. The bathroom was immaculate. The shower water pressure was a little weak, but on the top floor, you'd probably expect that. I was really impressed. The food in the bar was great and the bar staff fantastically friendly and attentive. From previous reviews I was kind of prepared for the breakfast and yes, it was a bit hit and miss. The staff were not always really sure who had been served and who hadn't and it wasn't always clear if they were just ignoring you or were just bussing tables (different staff doing different jobs but this got lost in translation). I imagine that if you are in a hurry to meet a tour then this would be annoying but I just found it bemusing as i had nothing to rush for. The breakfast was just ok, but again, for the price I was surprised breakfast was included at all. To sum up, as long as you have a realistic view of a 3 star hotel, you'll be delighted. I'd definitely recommend and would definitely return. ",5,2013,09,27
229,SA visitor,Good value. Room comfortable  and staff all very friendly.  I would recommend to anyone wanting a reasonably priced hotel in central Dublin.  Not really suitable for people with small children  as lots of steps.,4,2013,09,24
229,Perfect location,"The staff was outstanding and very accommodating. Full Irish breakfast served with a smile. We had two rooms. One was quite small- (2 nd floor)had a nice big winDow and actually had everything you would need..it was charming and the bed was very comfortable.  the other was a little bigger(4 th floor) but had a tiny tiny window so it felt kinda like a cell. This bed was not so good. ( luck of the draw)  Hotel is dated and could use some new furniture-- maybe this is part of the charm.?  lots of little steps here and there. We didnt near ""the noise"" others talked about. We were leaving before breakfast one morning for a tour across Ireland.  They made us toast and coffee and brought it up to the lobby for us. They would have given us more to eat but we didn't want a full breakfast. It was a short walk to the train station,any tour bus and the airport bus. We took the train to Howth (25 minutes) for the day. It was a charming little fishing village ----a great day trip.. The bar had good food reasonably priced and the Irish folk music was delightful. The Irish people were so friendly and helpful everywhere we went.  I believe this was a good value for the price and I would stay here again",3,2013,09,14
229,My Birthday Visit 28-30th August 2013,"Superior Room 107. 

We truly enjoyed our stay at ""The Castle Hotel"" and we were over the moon with everything especially with Room 107. My Birthday on the 29th August went well we were meant to go on the Wicklow tour but we read the information wrong ending up missing the bus. The Hotel staff were extra helpful rebooking our day trip there and then. We ended up going to a place called Newrange ready for the next day. We were both extremely happy with the hotel, food and staff. It was my partners first time in Ireland and the staff at ""The Castle Hotel"" made us feel very welcome and at home. 
The location of your Hotel was easy for us to bus around Dublin, visiting family & Airport links. 
The trip to Newrange was a great day out for us, beautiful country views and lots of history.  
Overall the staff's hospitality was Five stars they did everything possible to make sure mine and my partners stay was perfect. I would rate your B&B Hotel 10 out 10. Its one of the best B&B we've stayed in so far after all its Dublin your talking about. 
I had the best Birthday ever enjoying it going to Bray, Guinness Store House for Birthday drinks, seeing my family and dinning out. The trip was the best ever many thanks to The Castle Hotel Staff. 
Yes I would truly recommend ""The Castle Hotel"" to people looking for a good location, hotel history and a friendly family atmosphere.
looking forward to my next visit.",5,2013,09,14
229,Quirky place,"The Castle Hotel is just what people state it is-a conveniently located, friendly, basic place to stay. Upon reading the reviews prior to booking, I requested a room on the 3rd floor and at the back of the hotel to cut down on the bar and street noise. I was given a room on the 3rd floor, but close to O'Connell Street. Being it was summer, we had to sleep with the window open (no air conditioning, which was NOT an issue) and at times the street noise was unbearable!!! The breakfast that was included was great. A continental buffett was set-out and waitresses would be around to take orders for the full Irish breakfast, if that was your choice. The bar downstairs had entertainment on the weekend and prices were reasonable. The hotel was a 10 minute walk to the river Lieffe. Across the bridge, was the main shopping area and Temple Bar. We walked most of our time in Dublin. Also, not far down O'Connell Street was the Tourist Center and the Hop-On Hop-Off Bus-fantastic deal!!!",3,2013,09,12
229,Central location,"Very central location. Very friendly staff. Clean but a little 'tired'.Tasty,full breakfast. Because of its central location check carefully that there is not some major sporting event on as it would be very difficult to access by car.We would come back",4,2013,09,10
229,Value for money,"The hotel is in a great location, but could do with a refurb. Our room had been recently redecorated, with a new carpet. The bathroom was minute, with just enough space for a small shower, toilet and basin. Breakfast was very basic cereals and tinned oranges and grapefruit to start. There was also processed ham and cheese. This was followed by a cooked breakfast to order. When we realised that the sausages and baked beans were of low quality, and stuck to basic bacon and eggs, we were fine. None of the 3 toasters worked very well, so there were long queues for them. This isn't an expensive hotel, and I think it represented value for money.",3,2013,09,08
229,Great hotel minutes from centre of Dublin,"This is a great hotel with very friendly staff, not the top end of the market but pleasant enough. Breakfast was excellent with a choice of fruit (normally tinned), ham, cheese, different types of bread which you could toast and full Irish or veggie breakfast, though if you ask they will do what you want, I had poached eggs on toast most days and added what I felt like. One of our party was on a gluten free diet which was sorted by the kitchen staff. The location is very good, few steps from O'Connell Street, it was about 15-20 minutes stroll to Temple Bar area. There's plenty of shops in Grafton St and Henry St and the pubs are too numerous to mention. Food in the pubs is generally excellent and you get huge portions, don't be afraid of sharing. Like any main city prices can be high depending where you go. We can highly recommend Gogerty's for food and live traditional music There's plenty of places to visit, a must is the Guinness Storehouse, very interesting and there's a great view from the Gravity Bar plus a free pint of Guinness included with your ticket. The Docklands area is very nice too. If you want to go further afield you can pick up loads of leaflets at the tourist offices. We would definitely go back to Dublin and stay at this hotel.",5,2013,09,08
229,Service With A Smile,This hotel is in a great position with all the main Dublin attractions a reasonable walk or short bus or taxi ride.  We had Superior Double Rooms located at the quieter back of the hotel overlooking the car park.  The was some noise from other rooms & fire doors but the hotel was generally quiet through the night.  All the staff were friendly & more than willing to accommodate any special requests or need of assistance.  Breakfast was both buffet & table service with a good choice of hot & cold food.  Portions were generous & the quality & service was excellent.,5,2013,09,08
229,Good location,"Spent 4 nights at Castle Hotel. It's in a good location at the top of O'Connell street in Dublin, near the writer's museum. The hotel is clean and the staff are helpful. The food is average and they stop serving at 9pm as I found out after a day at the races, however I did get a free packet of nuts.  If mobility is an issue please note that the lift does not go to the basement where the restaurant and bar are located",3,2013,09,08
229,"Nice hotel, great value for money","This hotel is in a good central location, and was good value for money. The staff were really helpful and friendly, and our room was clean and spacious, although perhaps slightly dated in it's decor. We would definitely stay here again.",4,2013,09,08
229,"good location, but disappointing","We recently stayed in this hotel but were disappointed. The room was very dated and the quilt on the bed was very grubby. it was also VERY noisy, we had to have the window open as there was no air-con and the room was very hot. The breakfast was really confusing lots of rooms underground .....very claustrophobic and the breakfast itself was grim, no fruit left when we got there which was at 9.15. The breakfast didn't flow and nobody seemed to know what to do. Good location though just a short walk to O'Connell street. Loved Dublin but will stay in another hotel next time.",3,2013,09,06
229,"Nice hotel, value of money","Very nice hotel with friendly staff, perfect location, few minutes walk to the pubs etc. And visit Murray's Pub, lovely staff and food etc. When we go to Dublin next time, this is a hotel where we are going to stay!",5,2013,09,06
229,"Nice, typical Irish hotel","Very nice hotel, with good location, close to everything but still not noisy as in the Temple bar district. Nice rooms with a lot of space. Wonderful breakfast, better than I expected. Very helpfull and friendly staff including the owner who stopped by in the evening.  The dining room with live Music was also cosy. Nothing to complain about and we were a party of 6 peoples.",4,2013,09,04
229,"Charming, but no sleep!","I can only speak for our front ground floor room... but, we didn't sleep!  The noise of people & cars was non-stop all night long!  Maybe other rooms are quieter?
What we loved.... very large room for 4 of us (although one bed was an uncomfortable cot), high ceiling, full breakfast included.
BEST...  live music downstairs in cool restaurant/bar. They were fantastic!  I also enjoyed a wonderfully fresh chicken & mango salad.  Dinner came with a complimentary Irish Coffee - yum!",3,2013,09,03
229,A little funky,"This is a hotel made up of several old buildings that are connected. Located on the edge of the center of Dublin. The staff was the best part along with the vintage lobby area that has three or four rooms. The pub in the basement was good fun. The rooms are nice, but can be a little noisy on the back side. No AC. If you like creaky floors, you will love it. Again, great staff !",3,2013,09,03
229,"Quite all right, nice location","Castle hotel is a standard hotel with a nice location in central Dublin. The service is fine, breakfast okay. Our room was satisfying, but not more than that. Situated on the 2 nd floor, hot like a steam bath although we kept the window open day and night (only 20 degrees outside). The desk and desk chair was placed in front of the wardrobe. Electric plugs placed behind the desk and at the end of one of the beds gave us quite a challenge making tea and charging mobile devices. Would possibly stay there again, but not in the same room.",3,2013,08,29
229,"Friendly kind staff, disappointed in room cleanliness","Very friendy staff made me feel welcome, helped me with any problems. I stayed in the castle hotel for 3 nights on Arrival in my room 124 I was dis- heartened to find a very musty box room with paper coming of the walls, no plug for kettle, TV on top of wardrobe, I was moved to another room which was better but felt cleanliness let it down bed duvet cover came out no fasteners, sink in bathroom has glass right above it can't splash face with water without it soaking floor, daddy long legs, good location though liked staff. ",3,2013,08,29
229,"Lovely place, lovely staff, but could be improved","Our stay at this hotel was very good. Reception staff always ready to help and very nice at any time. The Hotel is in a wonderful building close to the city center, just a 3 mins walk from O' Connell Street. Rooms on the first floor are quite noisy, but we did not care about it. Our Family room was huge, with a very comfortable bathroom. Parking is available for quite a fair rate.
Some things could be improved: 
1) breakfast is quite limited
2) noisy stairs :-)
3) fridge in the room is not available",4,2013,08,29
229,Castle Hotel Dublin,"This is an old hotel near Dublin City centre, O`Connell Street is about a 10 minute walk away.Stayed here in august and really enjoyed our stay. The rooms are clean, comfortable and   a good size. However the rooms at the front of the hotel can be a bit noisy due to traffic noise.
The breakfast is very good, get there early to avoid queues for the toaster :) All the staff are friendly and helpful, the bar has live music and the restaurant serves good food.
Would recommend this Hotel.",4,2013,08,28
229,good location,"old style hotel in great location 10 minute walk to town centre friendly staff, good breakfast, good bar downstairs with live music on certain nights. ideal place to stay if you want to explore Dublin.",4,2013,08,28
229,"Nice Location, Good Breakfast","This is an old hotel in Dublin, the rooms are a bit creaky, and there is quite a bit of noise from the road, and seagulls. The breakfast is good, and the service is very good. The bar downstairs has the occasional live act. All in all comfortable, but slightly dated.",3,2013,08,27
229,Castle hotel dublin,"This is a georgian hotel near the centre of dublin. It is a number of houses converted  into a hotel. Although this does result in a maze of corridors,  it also gives a large hotel a small hotel feel.
The hotel itelf is situated in a convenient location about a 15 minute walk to the Temple bar area although there are some very  good pubs nearby.
The room was clean and provided TV and coffee making facilities.  Exactly the sort of room that are now standard in hotels. Breakfast is provided downstairs  in the restuarant . This can get fairly busy  but the buffet was kept well stocked and the Irish breakfast  was excellent.
On acouple of nights we went to the hotle bar where there was some good live music which generated a friendly  pub  type atmosphere",4,2013,08,27
229,Good,"Great location, only about a ten minute walk to the city center. Rooms were clean, staff was nice, breakfast was free and pretty good. Wifi on the fourth floor was pretty much nonexistent. 
This might not be the hotel for a light sleeper. We were there for three nights and there were drunk people screaming in the street each night for a significant amount of time.
It's a bit basic, but it's good for the money. 
Just a note, I would have preferred to rate this as ""good"" it's better than average, but it's a bit of a stretch to say it's very good.",4,2013,08,25
229,Just good things to say,"Last year I went to Dublin with my boyfriend and we stayed  in the Castle Hotel. Location is great, since it's so close to O'Connell Street and Temple Bar is just about 10 minutes walking (a nice walk, by the way). The bedroom was clean and really nice and the bed was so comfortable!

Staff was nice too and they helped us with any queries (the recepcionist even lend us a plug adapter!). 

So just good things to say about this hotel :)",5,2013,08,20
229,Basic but Clean,We stayed for two nights in Dublin.  The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  The bar downstairs had a good atmosphere with live music however we didn't eat there.  The wifi was very fast.  It was quite outdated but served the purpose of being in a good central location.  About ten minutes walk to Temple Bar.  Negatives would be that our room smelt quite musty and the bathroom mouldy.  It was very warm in the rooms as well so could do with a fan.  Also very noisy.  The carpark was difficult to get into and a bit tight to get out of.  All in all happy with our stay there but needs a refurb.,3,2013,08,19
229,good choice,"I visited the Castle for 4 days when I was attending a conference + doing a bit of sightseeing. It is normally much more expensive when travelling alone, so I was looking for a reasonable deal, and I felt the Castle not too bad in this respect.
The room was OK, if a bit basic. Comfortable bed, tea & coffee, TV but toiletries (apart from soap) would have been nice & there was only one hair dryer at reception, and they wanted it straight back.
Breakfast adequate if a bit unimaginative.
Convenient for O'Connell Street & airport & other buses.
An OK choice for a woman travelling alone & not wanting to spent too much.",4,2013,08,18
229,"Good location, but noisy",Stayed here twice during time in Ireland both times on level 1 facing the car-park.  Rooms were okay but it was very noisy particularly as you need to keep windows open as there isn't any air conditioning.  Didn't get that much sleep on any of the 3 nights of my stay.  Breakfast was okay but could be better.  Close to CBD and not too far to walk to a number of attractions.,3,2013,08,18
229,Deceptively nice if your room is newly refurbished.,"4* room rating if you're in the newly refurbished rooms . We have 419 family room with twin beds & 1 single & 1 fold out. Very clean and new. Ensuite clean and newish too. Entrance is much older with deep red carpets and dark wood, but staff so far very nice and lift to 4 th floor useful. Not tried brekkie yet but sure it will be ok. ",4,2013,08,15
229,Traditional,Stayed in the Castle Hotel in Dublin for one night the room was small slightly shabby and overlooked a busy street. The room was uneven so everything looked slightly lopsided. You could just squeeze into the en suite which was very dated but clean. The bed was comfortable and the room smelt clean along with the bedding. The staff were friendly and helpful organising an iron for us and apologising for the delay.,3,2013,08,14
229,Wonderful stay,"The Castle Hotel was a great choice for staying In Dublin. The hotel was tucked in ,down a quieter street just off O'Connel Street It was across the road from The Garden of Remembrance and The Writer's Museum.
The hotel was in an old georgian style building. Check was nice and easy. The ladies at the front desk were very helpful. They explained where things were in the hotel. Also,told me about the computer I could use for free. There's only one,so go early,if you want to use it.
There were plenty of seating areas in the hotel lobby. The colors were a pretty gold and red.
My room was a single with nice furnishing. Bed,sofa,wardrobe closet,desk,chair,coffee maker and a T.V. 
The room was very clean! and cozy. It had a very tall window facing the street.
The bathroom was up a step. All white,lots of tile. Very clean. Came with little amenities. shower gel,soap and shampoo. The sound of sea gulls seem to make the most noise while in my room. I liked it.
Mornings offered a free Irish breakfast in the breakfast room near the lobby. Eggs,beans, tomato,bacon,sausage,a buffet table with canned fruit,breads,cereal and yogurt, sliced meat and cheese. Beverages :Juice,coffee and tea. 

In the lobby ,you'll find pamphlets for tours and excursions. I took one of those hop on hop off buses that took you to all the top sights in Dublin. You can book it online.
The hotel was close enough to walk to O'connel Bridge ,Ha Penny,the post office, temple bar,shops and restaurants. O'connel Street is very busy. I liked the pretty flower's hanging every where. nice touch to the city.
I would definitely recommend The Castle Hotel for your stay in Dublin,Ireland.",4,2013,08,12
229,Avoid the breakfast scrum!,"We stayed here for four nights last week. Oldish hotel which has seen better days and needs some updating but rooms were a good size and comfortable. We looked out on to the main road and this was somewhat noisy. Staff were generally helpful although let us down over some information they promised which never materialised.  Breakfast in 'the vaults' was OK but unimaginative  and the coffee and cooked breakfast at 09.00 had obviously been prepared sometime before this. It was a bit of a scrum with queues for the DIY toast and juice table and with so many people it was a bit too warm to enjoy the experience. 
Handy for O'Connell Street and about 10 minute walk from Grafton Street.",3,2013,08,12
229,TAKE A FAN WITH YOU.,"Recently stayed here for 2 nights, the staff were very friendly and good. The hotel is old but I knew this when I booked, but it was very warm, we had to have the window open on the night and this meant we got a lot of noise from outside so did-not get a lot of sleep. Breakfast was ok but once again it was very warm in the restaurant and could not wait to get out of there to cool down.So if you stay here I would recommend that you take a fan and ear plugs with you. we were in room 311 on the front.",3,2013,08,09
229,Think again,"A long way from a castle- rather an amalgamation of two smaller hotels resulting in rabbit-warren corridors, and rooms at different levels. Be prepared to exit a lift and then go up half a flight of stairs.  The best feature was the front office staff who were exceptionally friendly and helpful. We stayed for 3 nights in total in two different rooms. Our second stay was facing the busy street which meant considerable noise. The bathroom was less than a metre wide on this stay, with not so much as a shelf to put your toothbrush on. On our first stay the bathroom had mould On the grout. Breakfast was traditional Irish style, though service was closer to army style. This is a budget hotel but, we expected better.",2,2013,08,09
229,"Pleasant, clean, great staff and service.","Really pleasant stay.  Nice, basic rooms although facing O'Connell street was noisy with late night busses and pedestrians.  Nice breakfast included, great service in restaurant and at front desk.  Fun entertainment in bar at night but bartender didn't know how to make one of their own specialty drinks on the menu.  Good location, easy walking to downtown.",4,2013,08,04
229,summer break to dublin,"we stayed at the castle hotel for 7 nights, it was a beautiful old building with a few niggles, front bedroom very noisy no sound proofing at all every bit of noise could be heard, tv  would not tune in very tempremental, u had to wait about 10 secs for the bathroom light to come on. putting all these niggles aside EXCELLENT SERVICE FROM ALL MEMBERS OF STAFF from reception down to breakfast and cleaning staff. we ate in nearly every night, food absolutely 1st class no complaints helpful and friendly staff all the way again 1st class service nothing too much trouble, entertainment was a nice end to the to the evening.  seriously considering staying again next,",4,2013,08,01
229,"Nice, but try to avoid the O'Connell Street side","We spent 4 nights here and the picture was overall nice. Good breakfast, even if the personnel seemed a little bit difficult to understand. Irish breakfast choosable without being charged extra.
Some evenings a folksinger entertained in the basement bar which was really hilarious in my view. Staff friendly, guest computer slow. Absolutely clean bathroom, room quite old-fashioned (which we knew and deliberately choosed). The main minus (but not a big one) was the street noise from O'Connell Street, mostly buses and trucks, but also shouting people. I would advice future guests to avoid rooms facing west due to that.",3,2013,08,01
229,Just like staying at home: very friendly but some of the decor needs work!,"What better place to stay in Dublin than a charming old Georgian hotel? Unless you are in the middle of a heat wave when a hotel with air-conditioning, or effective ventilation, would have been better.  But as rain is the usual problem in Dublin you can't blame this charming 200 year old hotel too much for this oversight. Our second floor double was just about big enough for us, the bathroom was fine and everything in it worked. There was a large damp patch in the corner of the bedroom ceiling which rather ruined the effect. You expect damp in old buildings but such issues should be kept under control by management. The hotel was full so we didn't have much option, but rooms in such condition should not ordinarily be occupied.

We slept really well despite the heat, maybe it was all the walking to and from Temple Bar, maybe all the alcohol we drank while there. Our room overlooked the courtyard but noise was rarely a problem (see alcohol). Our windows were propped open as far as they would go but with no air flow this didn't do much good, on returning to the room to sleep it was like entering an oven. All the rooms around the courtyard overlook each other so keeping the curtains open was not viable.

On the plus side the Irish Breakfast was excellent.  Good quality, and unpretentious. However at busy times it was clear the fried eggs had been cooked a while ago and kept warm and so were very rubbery. It's best to avoid busy times if you can (you'll get a better table too). If you don't fancy a cooked breakfast there's a buffet but it looked very limited. Toast can take a long while as the toasters merely illuminate the bread, rather than heating it up. Why hotels inflict this ""DIY bread toasting"" system on guests yet offer an otherwise fully cooked breakfast is a complete mystery. Toast is even on the menu, but you can't order it. It's very easy to ask guests what toast they want (white/brown/mixed) with their coffee or tea and provide it to the table. It's frankly unacceptable to have to hover around for about five minutes (it feels much longer) feeding your bread through a heated conveyor two or three times to get even the slightest hint of browning on the bread.

We didn't eat dinner in the hotel so I can't comment on the food, but it suffers from the general Dublin malaise of offering two or three courses together at a reduced price. If you only want a main you are stuck with full menu price, which is expensive. And of course it's mostly traditional Irish food. Just like 90% of Dublin pubs and restaurants. Every menu in every such restaurant is near identical. The hotel bar is however excellent and no more expensive than the busy pubs in Temple Bar. Live music is provided Wednesday thru Sunday and very entertaining it was too. Very warm and friendly atmosphere, just the kind of thing you expect to enjoy in Dublin.

The Castle Hotel is really well situated. Bus stops are nearby. The Liffey, Temple Bar and city centre restaurants and shops are just a few minutes walk down Ó Connell Street. Do get a hop on/hop off bus ticket, they are great value and the tour starts close to the hotel on Cathal Brugha St. The 747 airport bus stop is also in that same street so unless you have an aversion to walking there's no need to catch expensive cabs. If it's wet there's always the Dublin Bus service, but that does seem to stop running around 11pm.

Overall it's a good enough place to stay for a break in Dublin. The charm of the staff more than makes up for the drawbacks of the building. Just don't expect your room to be anything like the glossy website photos.",3,2013,07,29
229,About right,"Considering the price and location, the quality to price ratio is about right. The breakfast is not up to much though. We ended up going out for our breakfast after the first day. Our room was nice and functional, but it looked like it needed some updating. The style of the decor made you feel it had seen better days: quaint and sweet, but verging on the shabby.",3,2013,07,28
229,Average Hotel,"I've stayed here for one night during my holiday. The hotel is just good, and about a 10 minutes walk to the city centre. 
The staff was very nice and there was live music in the bar at night. The room was just ok, nothing special and for 1 night just fine.",3,2013,07,28
229,Wonderful small hotel,"Stayed here after arriving on a cruise ship and really enjoyed the staff and hotel.  Unfortunately, we arrived during a ""heat wave"" and without air conditioning, the rooms were very warm.  The hotel is quaint and the staff wonderful, however they do need to refurbish the first floor. 
Don't miss having the Irish Goats Cheese in the Castle Vaults downstairs and if you're there on the weekend, there's Irish music after dinner.  The full English breakfast was excellent.  Costs of cabs in Dublin can be expensive - it cost us over 30 pounds from the port to this hotel.",4,2013,07,27
229,Good for family,Stayed w my husband and 13 year old son. Our room was huge. I loved the architecture of the building. I felt like i was staying in an old home. I would stay here again. Also very close to Dublin bus which was great.,4,2013,07,26
229,Not Quite a Castle and Overpriced!,"Don't let the name of this hotel fool you, this is no Castle! We stayed here for 3 nights in July 2013. There is nothing overall wrong with this hotel it was just that I was expecting so much more!
The location is only okay, 15 minutes walk to Dublin city centre and in a quiet area that has no bars or restaurants and right across street from a large church. So after partying at the Pubs in Temple Bar, you have quite a walk back to the hotel!
As for the hotel, it seems like a combination of several buildings where you can easily get lost finding your room. It does have a lot of character with high ceilings, interesting decorations, sash windows, curving staircases, creaky floors, etc. There were 4 of us and we stayed in a room with 4 single beds along the same wall separated by small nightstands. We joked that we were in a boarding school bedroom. The rooms are basic and I would have liked them to be cleaner. We were on the second floor and our four windows looked out to the front of the hotel where there was a lot of noise from the busy road during the night.
The staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was adequate but very busy at certain times and hard to get someone to take our order.
But my biggest complaint was the value. We paid around $300 U.S. each night and as I read other reviews, I see that we overpaid! It was certainly not worth that much per night! 
To sum up: there is nothing drastically wrong but I would check on the cost before I booked and maybe even look for a different and better accommodation for your stay.",3,2013,07,24
229,We would stay here again,"The hotel is north of the Liffey and about 10 mins walk to the river, we found it to be well placed to see all we wanted to see. I noted before we went that the hotel was noisy so took ear plugs. It was much quieter than a London hotel that close to the centre would be. We were in room 100 and we really liked it, it had high ceilings and was cool, it had lots of space, a reasonably small but fine bathroom, and a lounge next door that we sat in during the evening which was excellent. We were either fortunate or well placed as we didn't here any irish music late at night only traffic and as I said it is a city it is central it is not a rural locality (!). The breakfast was a bit of a scrum but we ate well and for the price we paid it was fine. This hotel is neither the Ritz nor the Gresham neither is it priced as such but it was clean and comfortable. We would stay again.",4,2013,07,24
229,"Good Value, Great Location!","My husband and I stayed here last July on a 10th anniversary trip. We had e-mailed ahead and asked for a quiet room since it was an anniversary trip and we were not disappointed. We had a room that faced the car park on the 3rd floor - it was a lovely little room with two full beds and a nice sitting area. The breakfast was filling, if not a tad repetitive, but for the price, totally worth it, and the location was, for us, quiet and perfect. Easy access to a multitude of buses, right across the street from the Writers' Museum, and within walking distance to the Millennium Needle and the river. Would for sure stay here again. The staff was friendly, we stowed our luggage when we arrived prior to check-in and again after checking out but before leaving for the airport. There is always someone monitoring the front desk and when we came back late (which we did often - we couldn't resist going out for music and pints EVERY night - got carried away a few nights- hey-o!) to buzz you in, leading you to feeling very safe - not that Dublin isn't safe anyway. If you can get a deal - go for it. And as a bonus, the property has a great feel - creaky stairs, great art hanging, and very homey-feeling.",5,2013,07,23
229,Comfortable,"This Hotel appears to be a combination of several properties joined together. This in itself is not a minus, but as someone who is slightly disabled I found it a little difficult to get around. Perhaps a little more help or an offer of help,with the luggage etc. could be forthcoming from the reception staff without having to actually ask for it. Food is excellent although a little pricy. Staff at Dinner were very helpful.  Breakfast selection is  fine. We stayed two nights and the staff were helpful on the first morning but quite offhand on the second. 
The rooms are comfortable and well equipped. However attention to detail could improve. We had a Hairdryer that didn't work, a light bulb not functioning and a table lamp that also appeared faulty until I investigated and found that it wasn't plugged in. Problem was that the plug was behind the dressing table and only accessible if it was moved!  Yes,  I would stay there again but only because it is convenient to the City Centre",4,2013,07,22
229,beware of extra charges,"The hotel is in an excellent location,5mins walk from town centre,hotel was nice and clean,breakfast was lovely,staff friendly.but a word of warning,if you are planning to book this hotel pay for it in full when you book,as we booked in February,left our credit card details and we're paying upon departure,we had a letter of comfirmation and full details of the payment details,yet when we went to settle the bill we we're told it had increased by 208euros,because the exchange rate had changed since we had booked.we asked if the exchange rate had gone up would the price have gone down,obviously she said no,but where is that fair,we we're in a party of 22,as it was a hen weekend,we had a fabulous time,but this leaves a really bitter taste,the stars would have been higher if not for this.",3,2013,07,22
229,Fantastic for our group,"Booked a group of 15 for my friend's hen do. Great location close to an Airbus stop and to shops and temble bar. Got a lovely room for hen and bridesmaids with separate lounge. Had 4 rooms in total all lovely and clean.  Great value we got a deal on travel Republic which worked out at 90 per person for 2 nights. Lady at reception was so helpful organised taxis for us and looked after our keys,  only issue I had was with a miserable night manager who let us in and accused us of losing our keys and was very funny about letting us in, bear in mind I was relatively sober, I got the impression he thought we were silly drunk girls who had lost their keys, funnily enough went to the lovely receptionist the following morning and she confirmed our keys were there all along and gave them to us. That was the only negative.  Breakfast was good. ",5,2013,07,22
229,Average hotel,"Stayed here with my wife for one night only, don't get me wrong there was nothing altogether wrong with the hotel but it was more of a B&B to me. 
The location itself is just ok, 10-15 minutes walk to Dublin city centre and there didn't appear to be any bars or restaurants in the immediate area, be prepared to take a taxi back here at nighttime.
As for the hotel itself it is a nice Georgian building with plenty of character, sash windows, high ceilings, creaky floorboards etc - the rooms are basic but clean, we were situated on the front of the hotel so there was quite a lot of noise from the busy road during the night.
The staff were all very friendly and helpful, the bar and restaurant once again has character and they have live music playing on certain nights.

To sum the hotel up there is nothing drastically wrong with it but at €119 for one nights stay (breakfast included) i'd maybe expect a bit better.",3,2013,07,21
229,"Stifling, out-dated, down-at-the-heels. Avoid room 134.","I wanted to like this place, I really did. It had a certain faded charm in the lobby that I found appealing. The room, though - room 134 - was AWFUL. We booked about three months in advance for stay, and I suppose they saw a sucker when we booked. The room (which has been mentioned before in reviews) was oddly shaped and stiflingly hot. I don't care much about the shape unless - as with this room- there's a WALL in front of the window. We were there during a hot spell, so yeah, we figured it would be hot, but this was beyond the pale. The window opened onto the loud car park where the staff seem to congregate for cigarettes and chat, there was no airflow and very little natural light. 
We asked nicely for a fan and were told they were all in other rooms, that perhaps when people checked out we could get one. We asked twice more, of other staff and were finally told they had none. 
We found ourselves at the end of the day tired but trying to avoid going back there. 
It just wasn't fun. See the picture below, it will give you a sense that maybe we aren't the first to complain. They should not be selling room 134, unless its deep discounted and there are NO other rooms available. 
The bar downstairs is great, and the musicians were awesome.",2,2013,07,21
229,Great location. Excellent value,Nicely located for walking to many Dublin attractions. Had a great room. Service was efficient and friendly. Good value. A very pleasant and enjoyable 4 night stay. Thoroughly satisfied. Had a great room. A good basic hotel in a nice old Georgian Dublin building.,4,2013,07,19
229,Service how it should be,"A breath of fresh air in this modern rushing world.... Nothing was too much trouble during my stay.... Friendly helpful haapy staff and even a personal greeting from the hotel owner.
My room was clean and airy.... could have done with a new shower head but apart from that perfectly adequate.
I stay in Dublin quite often and this is definitely my new base.",5,2013,07,19
229,Reasonable hotel - well located,"For the price paid I expected slightly more although it was well located
The hotel is a bit of a maze - difficult to find your room! 
The room was ok - pretty small and annoyingly overlooking another persons room so had to keep curtains closed making the small space more claustrophobic. 
Staff could have been a bit more organised - you have to proactively ask to be served both at the helpdesk and at breakfast - not particularly forthcoming in wanting to take breakfast orders. Once the breakfast was served it was good.

This hotel is cosy and a reasonable place to stay and has a lot of potential for improvement to up its rating",3,2013,07,18
229,Excellent central location,"Stayed in the hotel for 3 nights in July. The hotel has an excellent location, 2 minutes walk from the centre of Dublin. The hotel's age is reflected in its old fashioned decor, which is very nice. The lobby, interior, dining room and bar has a lot of character, perhaps could be more luxurious. However the rooms are modern, lovely, and very well kept. Our room was incredibly clean and well presented and had everything we needed. The staff were very friendly and helpful. However breakfast service leaves room for improvement. Only cooked meals on offer was a traditional breakfast (which was very nice), but other meals would have been nice. The breakfast staff were friendly but it took some time for them to take our order and I felt that we were ignored. I would also recommend new and more luxurious place settings- I feel everything just needs updated. All in all we had a very pleasant stay!",4,2013,07,17
229,Great Hotel For City Centre Pursuits,"This Hotel is of a high standard with comfortable rooms and friendly staff.The Breakfast menu is good with fast and efficient service.The Car park is small but private and at ten(10) € a better choice than driving around looking for parking at a meter,particularly if you are exploring the City Centre. About 15/20 minutes walk to Temple Bar,Trinity College and Grafton Street.
Plenty of eating houses nearby  and if you are whacked out after a long drive, the downstairs bar is handy.
A very interesting creaking staircase leaks to the first floor so you might want to use a little care if you're coming in late at night or creeping out early morning.Nice little secluded lounge at foot of said staircase which would suit for reading the morning paper,using the Hotel computer or just chilling out with a good book and a coffee",5,2013,07,16
229,Superb Hotel for 2 Night Stay,"Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights over the weekend of 5th July to 7th. We arrived early on the first day and headed straight to the hotel were they took our bags and secured them in a room until we could book in. We were then told we're to head for the hop on hop off bus and were on our way. What seemed I believe to be the manager was so welcoming and nice to all guest. On returning later on in the day we were checked in and went up to our room which was Number 316 which was a lovely little room which we were more than happy with as it was just somewhere to sleep really. The first evening we headed down to the restraunt which was a lovely cellar and felt like a really posh restraunt. Bar staff were lovely and the guiness was spot on. We were then shown to our table and were waited on for the rest of the night by the brilliant hotel staff. prices for food were pretty good as well. I've music that night was a bloke on his own which was good but we found a 3 band Irish group just down the road in murrays bar which were brilliant. Breakfast was good as well and staff couldn't of been more helpful bringing teas coffees and asking if everything was ok all the time and seeing if we needed anything else. Overall our experience with the hotel was brilliant. we done the guiness factory, tour round the jail which was on the hop on hop off route as well as stopping in dublin park which was a lovely park. Location was brilliant as its just off o'Connelle street.",5,2013,07,10
229,Old World no frills,"The castle hotel is located North of The city center, a 15 - 20 minute walk to Trinity College. The hotel bills itself as the oldest in Dublin, and one can see traces of old world charm. Our room had very high ceilings, a rather dated bathroom ( again no frills) and a comfortable siting area. They have live music at night in their Pub / restaurant and the food is fine. The staff is helpful and the facility is clean. Don't expect a 5 star hotel, no pool , gym .business center etc.,  but clean, comfortable, and good value.",4,2013,07,08
229,Castle Hotel,"The Castle Hotel is a reasonably priced hotel with good service and an earthy atmosphere.  While the room was pretty lacking in the charm claimed on its site on the Internet, the bed was comfortable and the room a reasonable size.  Overall a pleasant stay in a reasonably central location.  I will note for those wanting quiet you may be disappointed, at night a local bar and nearby construction does not make for a peaceful stay, nor do the paper thin walls. But if you want great service, easy access to O'Connell Street this is the place for you.",3,2013,07,06
229,first trip to Dublin,"From the time we sent the first email until leaving everyone from the hotel was first class. A no frills family run hotel with a good location and ease of access via car from N1. 
We had requested adjoining rooms with easy access as a member of the party had mobility difficulties.No problem .
 Room was clean, bright and the bed firm but comfortable.There was some noise from the TV next door and from The Vaults and car park but this had quietened by midnight. Not bad given people were on holiday.
 Food in the restaurant looked good but as  we had eaten earlier can only comment on dessert and coffee which was lovely,  fruit crumble and ice cream which seemed home made .
Given ongoing work , parking was limited and finding a space not for the faint hearted but good value at €10 per day.
Keenly priced with breakfast included. Would return at another date as it fulfilled all requirement for a short family break to sample the delights of Dublin.",3,2013,07,04
229,King of the castles.,"The location,staff,food and quality of our room was better than expected..this hotel was ideal for our four day break,ignore any bad reviews the staff are fantastic especially at breakfast and our room was cleaned daily...Will use again..many thanks...",4,2013,07,03
229,Castle hotel,"We recently stayed at this hotel.The location is very good. Reception staff very efficient and helpful.Our room was a Little on the small side  but we enjoyed a very peaceful nights sleep,  breakfast  was tasty and the waitresses were great fun. The weekend we stayed was extremely busy in Dublin so the room rate was high .Parking  is also €10 per night.",3,2013,07,02
229,1 night,"I stayed here the weekend but i was suppose to be staying in their sister hotel georges but our room their got flooded. The receptionist their had us driving around dublin city for an hour before i realised she was on goole maps trying to direct me and then she decides to tell me we would not be staying their because of our room. I rang the staff in the Castle hotel the lady i was speaking to us was so fab. She got us their in 5 mins and had a car space for us and she also came out to the car park to greet us. the recepionist their were both nice but the man in the bar the ""bar manager"" i tink he was ""he was there years i tink"" so nice he was so nice polite and great company. Our room wasnt the best but it did the job ... the bath would defo need to be replaced!:) xx",4,2013,06,27
229,Great location Excellent staff,"Six of us stayed for two nights. Central location a 5 minute walk to the city centre. Excellent staff very warm and friendly, great breakfast and bar restaurant. My wife left her iPad behind and Alison quickly organised registered post to UK. We would definitely stay again.",5,2013,06,18
229,weekend in Dublin,"Upon arrival, we were greeted by a very pleasant lady on reception. We were too early to go to our rooms, but no problem, there was a baggage room nearby. From that moment untill we left every member of staff was excellent! Not the same for the hotel though, rooms were small, floors uneven. The food was adequate, and none of the downsides spoilt our weekend, but, be aware this is no luxury hotel.",3,2013,06,18
229,Front desk staff!,The front desk staff at this hotel honestly MADE the property.  The hotel itself was nice and the location was fantastic.  The breakfast offerings could easily be a bit more and the beds are definitely in need of some replacement.  Overall though the staff of this hotel made up for any issues that we had simply through their welcoming and helpful behavior.  Five star service!,4,2013,06,18
229,Brilliant hotel we will go again,"This is a brilliant hotel, and we were made to feel really welcome starting with the receptionist, who was English and could not have been more helpful. She provided us with information on the area and maps to guide us.
There were a few Americans and Australians that made quite a bit of noise, but I like to see people enjoying themselves and lets face it everyone is on holiday. You cannot fail to enjoy yourself at this hotel The owner is wonderful and makes a point of kissing everyone good night. The food is lovely and don't listen to people who have said the breakfast is not good.....all I can say is they must be greedy!",5,2013,06,12
229,We had fun!!!!,"This is a lovely hotel and our stay was perfect. The staff (especially Mick) went out of their way to accommodate our large group celebrations. 
Yes we were loud but don't blame the hotel for that because this happens everywhere my family goes!
The hotel I a lovely old building and it was very comfortable. 
The food was great and so was the live music (especially Ray Cox).
We met some lovely people at this hotel both staff and guests. The hotel's owner is a character and he arranged for us to stay an extra night. 
They even laid on great weather for us! Lol
We will definitely return.
",5,2013,06,11
229,Sleepless,"Pleasant and helpful staff, quirky touches made it interesting, but the noise from the street and the building behind was continual. We had requested a room at the back of the hotel after reading previous reviews, but we didn't realise it would overlook the car park and the back of other buildings where people seemed to party all night! We also didn't realise it was in the 'drug' area, or one of them, in Dublin. This wasn't an issue for us as we were in a group, but could be a problem for people on their own or as a couple. We  had a skylight in the ceiling of our room which would be great in winter, but was extremely bright in summer!
Bar and restaurant was great, we ate there twice, and enjoyed it very much.",3,2013,06,10
229,Good value,"Was only in Dublin for a day/night before heading into the country with my young daughter. The hotel was really well located for us, right on the airport bus route (the 16 is half the price of the 747 airlink and stops closer to the hotel), far enough away from Temple Bar to be peaceful and close enough to walk anywhere we wanted to be. 
The reception staff were friendly and welcoming and there was no problem leaving bags long before checking in. The room was a bit of a hike from reception but not a problem. The room itself was clean and comfortable, and perfectly fucntional. None of the 'period features' from the write up but wouldn't expect it for £79! The breakfast was plentiful and the quality matched the price. Service was prompt and friendly too. 
The only downside was what seemed to be paper thin walls as we heard every word spoken in the next room (among other things) and the builders that started work bang on 7am right outside the window (big digger etc).
Good value, good location and good service. Just make sure you get a quiet room unless you want to be out by 7am!",4,2013,06,08
229,Great old hotel,We had a great time here. Staff was great. Owner was a great Irish gentleman and had very good food and Irish music. 130 rooms in this old sparling hotel seconded off so you really can't tell it's that big.,4,2013,06,03
229,Castle Hotel,"What a pleasant surprise this Hotel turned out to be. It had its own  traits to get to my room on the 4th floor you took the lift to the 4th floor then walked down two flights of stairs. Food in the restaurant was excellent one of the best Sirloins ive had in a long time. The Bar at night was buzzing, live music, good Beer, and good company of a mixture of Irish, Europeans, and American guests. All in all a really good hotel centrally situated close to O' Connell St and all Dublins attractions",4,2013,06,03
229,OK Stay at the Castle Hotel.,"I'll start with the positives. Staff was professional and super helpful. Good location (easy to get to O'Connell Street), easy to catch city buses from this location). Near the Gate Theater, and some excellent restaurants (like Chapter One).

The hotel itself is spread across a few older buildings that have some charm... but rugs, paint, furniture is quite tired and somewhat dingy. Rooms are clean, and generally comfortable. I had no problems with hot water. Walls are very thin... so you can hear your neighbor's conversations, and more... 

Breakfast was included with my stay. The waitstaff attending to breakfast are great. Super nice and professional. The food was ABYSMAL. Yes, there was cereal and bread... and some cooked to order items (irish breakfast, veggie breakfast). The quality of the ingredients for these dishes, flavor, and presentation made then quite unappealing. The coffee here is terrible (order tea instead). I stayed at 5 different hotels in Ireland and this breakfast was simply the worst. I would skip paying for breakfast, and walk to the Candy Cafe (literally right next door) and order breakfast there.",3,2013,06,02
229,Quirky accommodation,"Excellent location for the city centre, rooms clean, comfortable with all facilities.
We travelled as two couples but were given a room on 2nd floor and on 4th floor, no problem once we worked out the easiest way to each other but as I said it was quirky. You could not walk up stairs from our floor to theirs as it was as if we were in different buildings, we had to go down onto ground floor and take a different lift to the 4th. If returning to the hotel would request rooms nearer to each other.",3,2013,06,02
229,A traveler's hotel is her Castle,"While I usually stay at Trinity College when I bring student groups to tour Ireland in the summers, traveling alone with only one other person before classes were out, I was forced to find another venue for my week in Dublin.  The Castle Hotel, at the top of Parnell Square, is conveniently located across the street from two of my favorite sites in the city:  the Dublin Writers' Museum and the Garden of Remembrance with its poignant statue of the mythical Children of Lir.  Although most of the rooms are small and the ones facing O'Connell street can be noisy, all the rooms are comfortable and satisfactory, and the staff is friendly and helpful.  The restaurant downstairs serves excellent breakfasts and dinners, offering good deals on meals for early eaters.  The 200-year-old establishment is charming in its historical context, and I was delighted to meet its equally charming owner, Mr. Finn McCumhaill.  Too bad he already has a wife!",4,2013,05,31
229,Such a lovely place,"Stayed here for two nights. The front desk arranged a car for our trip to dinner. Sat down with the owner and was a lovely man, he gave us a small tour of the hotel. Great location. Old building with beautiful staircase. The breakfast is amazing as well. ",5,2013,05,30
229,"Tired, worn, and forlorn","Firstly, don't take any notice of the pictures on their website - they portray something that isn't. This hotel is very tired, the rooms are adequate, but uncomfortable. The shower takes a while to warm up, and the shower heads could do with cleaning out. The décor has seen better days, the furniture shabby.

Breakfast, although of fairly decent choice, was of poor quality - obviously cheap end of the market produce, worse than a little chef, and no improvement on a motorway service 'all day breakfast' - that had been there all day. The restaurant at breakfast was chaotic.... as with most hotels now, the bread was 'toast it yourself' - however, there was one toaster for approx. 70 people. After the first morning, we chose to have breakfast at the little café next door, a much more enjoyable and relaxed experience, one which we would highly recommend.

We found the service from the staff to be curt and abrupt, and again, not what you would expect of a hotel as is it shown on their website.

We chose not to eat in the restaurant, as I saw a member of the kitchen staff coming out of the toilet without washing his hands.

Finally, with regard to bar prices, over 16 Euros for a pint of Guinness, a Bacardi and coke, and two bags of crisps is not what I would pay for this level of hotel.

Would we stay again? A resounding NO.",2,2013,05,28
229,Lovely stay!!,"Edwardian style hotel, so some would say a little dated but I think it's nice! It was very clean, crisp white bedding and a sparkling bathroom! We had a very pleasant nights sleep, beds were comfortable! We stayed in a family room, this was ideal for a family of 4. The hotel is very central, it is just off O'Connell street and we were able to walk to St Stephen's Green from the hotel. The breakfast was very good also. They also offer a 3 course meal for 20 euro between 5-7pm. We didn't have this but it looked very good.",5,2013,05,28
229,Great location for exploring the city,"Castle Hotel has a decent breakfast, honest-sized rooms and s proper free internet. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly and the location is - strictly spoken - ideal for exploring the city. They have an in-house bar where you get even a free drink offered.

The main down-side is that the breakfast room is too small in busy times.",4,2013,05,28
229,What a dissapointment.,"Let me say that the Castle Vault was fabulous and the live Irish music a treat.  Now for the hotel...  To start the parking is very difficult to get in and out of and they charge you for this.  The hotel is extremely hot inside.  There was no way to cool off our room except to open the window.  Here in lies a huge problem.  The traffic noise and the people partying under our window all night would be a nightmare if you could get to sleep.  The electricity must have been shut off to the outlets in our room as nobody could make them work, not even the one for the TV.  The bathroom had mold on all the walls, the tub was raised up off the floor to a scary height, the wooden molding around the bottom of the tub was lying freely on the floor and it took forever for the light to come on after the switch had been turned on.",2,2013,05,27
229,GIRLIE WEEKEND,"My friend and I stayed at this Hotel last weekend.  I would highly recommend it.  The Hotel is oldey, woldey but is tastefully done.  The twin room we had was lovely, very clean and had a very modern en suite.  Breakfast was a full Irish, although they catered for everyones needs, cereals, fruit etc.  The staff were brilliant, especially Mick, who was one of the barmen (hang on to him I say), he had exceptional customer skills.  The weather was fantastic so the walk down to the town area and Temple Bar (where all the excitement is) was very nice.  If you find it difficult to walk you may find this a little out of the way but we loved it.  We were in room 420 which was lovely but there was a little outside noise i.e. traffic etc, which didn't bother us after having a drink or two.  The Hotel also puts on it's own entertainment, I would also recommend that you give this a try also, the atmosphere is brilliant.  We will definitely return next year.",4,2013,05,26
229,lovely stay in georgian hotel,"Hotel converted from 9 georgian houses 10 minute walk from centre of Dublin.Great breakfast with plenty of choice, nice bedrooms of varying size and quality of rooms with opportunity to upgrade for a small charge.We were happy with our rooms.Hotel has restaurant and great bar with live music.There are plenty of places to relax down stairs on sofas.Staff were very friendly and helpful.Very happy 4 day stay.",4,2013,05,24
229,castle hotel dublin,"a lovely hotel in the city of dublin with the most friendly and helpful staff.ideally situated just off oconell street.the breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice.the serving staff were always there to cater for your every need.
      
      ",5,2013,05,24
229,City trip,"Good location, warm welcome, forgot to call a taxi so we  had to hurry to catch our plane back home; a lot of noice between rooms, very warm in the bedrooms (couldn't turn off the heating) and  in my room no window could be opened.
      ",3,2013,05,24
229,Some say quaint. I say crap!,"Horrible hotel. Uneven floors, uneven bed. Feet were higher than head. Phone did not work. Shower water temperature constantly changed from scalding to freezing. Thin walls made it noisy. Street noise made sleeping difficult. Pillows were pathetically thin. Two together added to about two inches. TV is tiny and remote control could not turn it on. Luggage holder was broken and could not hold a suitcase. Front desk girls were ditzy. After my wife and I checked in, the other woman we were with wanted to check in. The girl said ""I thought you were all together."" The room was very tiny. Elevator had a mind of it's own. Had to press the button multiple times to finally get it to come to the fourth floor.",1,2013,05,22
229,Good location,"Location ok, but terribly noisy, wooden floors ensure that entering and passing guests wake you up continuomusly during the night. Too warm everywhere in the hotel. Basic infrastructure an dbreakfast. Friendly staff",3,2013,05,18
229,Warm and personal,"Not an attractive outside appearance may put the non booked person off but step inside and the story changes. We were also concerned as parking may not be available or costs. However after riding in rain all day from Killarney our fears were relieved. They allowed us secure parking and even undercover, which was soon joined by 6 more motorcycles!. They even offered cleaning rags. The rear off street parking is only accessible by a remotely controlled gate with CCTV monitoring from reception. Check in was quick, friendly and above all efficient. The rooms were adequate to very large in size and well appointed in the style of the 50's. There are a number of public sitting rooms and a reading area with internet but all rooms have WiFi freely available.The hotel has free entertainment in its well appointed snug bar area well insulated from the public on the street. All the colours are warm and the staff seemed to know the guests by first name soon after arrival.",4,2013,05,12
229,Just what we needed,"My son and I just came back from 5 days at the Castle.  We were just looking for a place to shower and sleep while we traveled around the city, but I think we got much more.  The hotel was clean, safe and much larger than it looked.  The clientele was totally international.  It was a great chance to hang out at the bar with folks from all over Europe listening to great music.  And the service was great!  Very friendly and helpful and fun to talk with after a long day of walking around the city.  Also everything was in walking distance - buses, shops, clubs and the Temple Bar area.  We would totally go back!",4,2013,05,10
229,ok European hotel,"Go in fall spring or winter there is no air conditioning.  My room was on the street up 3 floors and to be cool I had to keep the window open.  With the window open I could not hear TV unless turning the volume way up.  The shower had a very poor drain and people going up and down the hall were too noisy.  The hotel is spotlessly clean, bath, bed and room.  The desk was friendly and helpful.  The free breakfast was monotonous but cereal, toast, eggs, sausage, bacon and cold ham and cheese offered enough choices on which to fill up.  For Europe I was comfortable.  Little inconveniences don't bother me.  The location, price and cleanliness were more important.",4,2013,05,08
229,Location is No 1 here,"My wife and four year old stayed here for 4 nights around the start of April.  On arrival we placed our luggage in the holding area and there we met the owner of the hotel.  Had a chat to him for a while, went out for some lunch and came back.

My general advice for the hotel is, request a room at the back of the hotel, as this will keep people traffic walking past your room to a minimum.  Its a very old hotel and the sound travels through easily.  If you intend on walking/sightseeing all day and coming back for a meal downstairs, a nightcap and then bed well this is anm ok place.  Our room was small, but a small price to pay for lack of noise.

The breakfast is good enough and the location is great as you can walk down connolly street into the main part of Dublin.  The city is great and go on the Guiness factory tour, its awesome.

The staff were fine and had no issues at all.  We left our milk for my daughter downstairs and just went down every night and got cup heated before bed as there are no fridges in the room.

If your room is warm, check the towel heaters as our room was quite small it didnt take lonmg to heat up.

Good luck",3,2013,05,08
229,What a disappointment,"I was swayed by the website and description of the place when I made reservations. The only thing the Castle Hotel had going for it (as far as we were concerned) was the location as it is conveniently located in Dublin and we could walk to many major sites that we wanted to get to.  The room was hot and the temperature was not easily regulated. The floors are uneven and creaky (yes, I realize it's an older place), there was a funky smell in the air, the ""fresh"" towels had a displeasing aroma, the staff was aloof and seemed put out when asked for assistance, the bed wasn't very comfortable, the pillows were hard and flat, it was noisy (sounds from the car park echoed up to our room where we had the window open to try to cool off and get some air circulating... I could go on, but I'll leave it with this--it wasn't worth what we paid.",2,2013,05,06
229,Not your box hotel,"If you like staying at a chain box hotel, then don't stay at the Castle Hotel!  This hotel is for people who enjoy tripping into the past at every corner!  This hotel is filled to the brim with antique furnishings and super interesting mismatched everything.  It made me feel like I was just invited to stay at someone’s Victorian home in 1850!  Wonderful location along with fantastic staff that will help you do/find anything you can imagine.  Great bar and restaurant too.  If you want a truly quirky, reasonably priced place to stay in busy Dublin, then give the Castle Hotel a try!",5,2013,05,02
229,a grand dame,"Our 3rd stay at The Castle Hotel in 4 trips. Welcomed by the staff who recognized us as repeat customers and gave us the same beautiful and funky room as our last visit. If you need shiny surfaces, ultra-modern furnishings, are bothered by carpeting that isn't boringly uniform and can only find a room that is in a straight line from the front desk, this isn't the place for you. If you are a Lonely Planet traveler and like staying at places where every corner is a new adventure, love old world glamour, look for great value for the euro in a place as expensive as Dublin to visit, then this is the place. Walkiing distance to everything you want, friendly staff that will drop everything to help you, great downstairs pub/restaurant with great music if you are too lazy or to late to go out.",5,2013,04,30
229,Great hotel with very helpful and friendly staff.,"A group of 8 of us stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate my dads 65th birthday and from the moment we arrived to the moment we left the staff couldn't have looked after us any better. Really nice staff, good food and great craic in the castle vault. Great location for exploring the city, would definitely recommend this hotel and hope to return before too long.",5,2013,04,29
229,Fine for Us!,"We read some of the reviews before we went for 3 nights at this Hotel. We have to say we had no problems at all. I would grade this as a 3 star, but it ticked most of the boxes for us. It is located about 500yds from the northern end of Connoly St., which makes it a good location for walking every where, which we did. We ate in for two of the nights (thurs & Sat) which was good and with Irish music entertainment from 8pm., again suited us fine. Our room was at the back over looking a building site, so what, we came to see Dublin not spend all day looking out the window, and all was quiet at night. All in all I would recommend this Hotel for location and price.

As afoot note we were very disappointed with Dublin it self, a one star here and no recommendation from us.",4,2013,04,29
229,"A WARM WELCOME, ON OUR FIRST VISIT TO DUBLIN.","Me and my wife booked a flight/hotel package deal at a travel agents, for a last minute trip to Dublin, it was a first time in the city for us both. 
The Castle Hotel was to be our base for three nights, from start to finish, it was an absolute pleasure. The hotel had an old fashioned feel to it (in a good way) and the staff were some of the best we've ever came across, friendly, warm and genuine they were. 
Our room was spacious, comfortable and spotlessly clean. On our first night, we found ourselves in the downstairs bar, until late, again the staff were brilliant to talk to, the young lady who was the night receptionist came to chat too. There were two regular chaps in the bar, The Guinness and the crack just flowed, they made our trip from Scotland worthwhile on the very first night. 
Breakfast was very good, quality of the food, and the slickness of the service, outstanding.
The hotel's location was also spot on, just a very short walk from O'Connel Street, whicjh is the main street in Dublin. We loved the city, but found ourselves being drawn back to the hotel bar at night. I'm terrible at remembering names, but the bar staff, the receptionists and FINN were all superb. I spoke to FINN about a project I had, (i'm writing a book) and he was really interested, even gave me the number of a publisher he knew, what a nice man, FINN, the owner. 
We hope to be back in Dublin soon, but only if we can stay in the majestically comfortable Castle Hotel.",5,2013,04,28
229,Nice place to stay,"This hotel is located close to the O'Connell Street. It takes about five minutes to walk from the River Liffey and up to the hotel. 
Castle Hotel is quite old and that is easy to see. The floor is uneven most places and the interior is a bit old. With that said the hotel is also clean and well kept. 
For breakfast you can choose between a small buffet or from a breakfast menu. They also have a bar with live music in the evening.
The employees are very welcoming and nice. We asked them for directions all the time and they all helped us all the time. 
I will stay at this hotel again.",3,2013,04,25
229,This is not a hotel,"Hotel is really a wrong word for this place. The room is so big..that the moment you enter the room and guess wat....its over....hardly any place to walk around. I asked for an Iron to iron my tie, and i was told that I would be charged 10 Euros for that, and that was a real shocker of my life. No where in the work, I had heard about that....I would not recommend any one to go to this hotel any time and stay in those tiny rooms. I am sure, there are better places to stay in Dublin.",1,2013,04,24
229,A quirky introduction to Dublin,"We had the greatest welcome to the Hotel with the owner greating us and telling us stories , it really made me smile! The castle is situated perfectly for travelling around the city (We walked most of the time but is close to the trams too!) . The rooms was clean and spacious and had some real character , we did have a few problems with the water (it was very hot all of the time!) but aside from that the room was great and more than comfortble. The breakfast was simple but satisfying , toast , ceral and eggs in anyway that you want (or the lure of the full Irish breakfast) . We went out on our first day and after dinner it was great to come back to the hotel bar and enjoy a nightcap whilst listening to some traditional music. For one of the oldest hotels in Dublin it more than satified our needs for the long weekend ....we'll be back!",4,2013,04,23
229,"Expensive, cold atmosphere","Well, after 5 days in the same hotel we were still strangers. Nobody recognised us, and twas hard even to get a good morning or a good evening from the staff at the reception. Very expensive, 130 euros per night, the cleanliness has been disapponting. I had the same dirty glass in the room for 5 days and guess what....after cleaning the room they left at least twice the window open...not very nice to find a cold room at night, and the heater is central you cannot do anything just sleep in the cold. The English breakfast was just average.",2,2013,04,23

229,Great Location,"I stayed a night in this hotel as my daughter was in the mater hospital and it was very convenient. Less than five minutes walk to Hospital.  Got taxi back at night as it was late and did not take the risk of the walk.  Found the hotel to be good value, location, and friendly staff, lovely breakfast.",5,2013,04,21
229,Enjoy the vintage feel,"If you want to experience all the amenities of a modern hotel, then the Castle Hotel should proberly not be your first choice,  But if being surrounded by a throwback to an earlier time, you can't do any worse. The furniture and paintings throughout the reception area and puplic spaces have a wonderfully antique motiff.  My room was a single twin - very basic and bit lacking in comfort, but I wasn't in Dublin to live in a hotel room.  The room had a hospital room size TV on a stand above the foot of the bed, without a remote and the room was missing the basic amenities like an alarm clock and hotel stationary.  If I stayed here again, I would pay the small fee for an upgrade.  But the WIFI worked and the shower always had hot water.  Full Irish breakfast is available the next morning, served quickly and attentively and dinner is available in the Castle Vaults - with live music several nights a week, and the food was always great.  Reception staff was always friendly and willing to assist. Great location too, right above O'connell Street.",4,2013,04,18
229,"Nice,Clean and Warm","Stayed in the Walton side off the building. Room was warm and comfortable for 3 of us.
We dined in the restaraunt on the first night and we found the food quite good and presented nicely.
On the second Night we arrived back at the hotel a bit late due to visiting friends. even though the kitchen was closing the bar man was able to get chef to fix something for us.
The entertainment on both Saturday Night and Sunday night was good and enjoyable.
Now Breakfast, whilst the staff were runnining around extrremely busy they remained polite and as helpful as they could be.
We had full Irish on the first morning and this was enough once eaten.
The next 3 mornings we each had different items on our plates to suit our tastes as we did not want full breakfasts on every morning and this presented no problems.
I can understand the fustration of the customer saying stay away but this is unfair as all the staff are attentive and can only work with what they have and they done themselves proud. Serve a full hotel of guests with breakfasts in 2 hours and most of the customers probably didnt appear till the last hour.
The Cereal Bar might. need a little TLC but thats all.
The building, well it is a Georgian building so it will have its creaks and groans but that only adds to the charm.
2 adults. 1 13year old child, 4 nights Bed and Breakfast. 426 euros. 5 minutes from City Centre, I call that good value for money.
Will we be back. Yes. (2016)",4,2013,04,13
229,Great Hotel,"Right next to the center of Dublin. Near all the shops, bars and restaurants. Easy walking.
Very friendly staff. Big room and good beds.
Nice bar as well.
Not far from the Wicklow Mountains. Very nice area to walk.",4,2013,04,12
229,chalk n cheese,"The place is clean with great Reception n Bar Crew..however the breakfast staff need training.
1. Eating breakfast.,staff drops tray of untensils next to me to make the table opposite!!!
2. This next one is y i had 1 breakfast in 7. we asked for milk after the coffee had arrived,...the staff picked up the jug from a recently vacated table refilled it in my full view from the machine and presented it to us!!!!

Beds..more sunk than Davy Jones Locker

Water pressure.forget it if u r placed on the 4th floor

Room..nothing like the wideangle lens they use for their promo pics, give this place wide berth not worth 80 euros a night",2,2013,04,11
229,Comfortable hotel in a good location,"Stayed at the Castle Hotel on a recent weekend trip to Dublin. The hotel is just off Parnell Square at the northern end of O'Connell Street, maybe 10-15 minutes walk to the centre south of the Liffey.
The hotel is clean and comfortable and although it was busy, the staff were very friendly and efficient.
It is obviously not a luxury hotel (floorboards are creaky, hot water supply is a bit temperamental and the TV in the room was a delightful throwback to the 80's) but it is a perfectly good base for exploring Dublin. We would certainly come back here again.",4,2013,04,08
229,Classic Comfort Georgian Style,"This hotel is steps away from the Writer's Museum, Rememberence Gardens, Lane Gallery, many cafes, and the main street O'Connell.
I loved the turn of the century lovely antique furniture in the lobby where we relaxed and we especially enjoyed the downstairs Vaults bar/restaurant in the evenings, and the complimentary full Irish breakfast. The buffet breakfast for the cereal lovers was inviting too, but most mornings we had the Irish breakfast. They even had early breakfast ready for us for the early departure.
The Irish music Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights were part of the amabiance that we will remember and come back to stay again in the future.
The front desk people were friendly and they tried to help with our bookings.",4,2013,04,08
229,Close to O'Connell street & Temple bar,"10 min walk to O'Connell street, 15 to Temple bar area. Building is older so expect creaking stairways if you're near them. Our room faced the street and the traffic didn't stop. Could be noisy. Skip the hotel breakfast and hop next door to the ""candy shop"" for breakfast on the go, snacks and lunch. We arrived at 7 am and couldn't be accommodated until 1 (next time we'll reserve the room for the night before) which was a killer. Felt safe walking to/fro.",4,2013,04,06
229,Ideal guesthouse,"My family and I had a pleasant stay at the Castle hotel.  It's location is ideal as it is located in the heart of Dublin centre, off O'Connell street.  The hotel is very clean and staff is very friendly.  A perfect guesthouse to stay at.",5,2013,04,06
229,Irish charm and good value for money,"We stayed at  the Castle Hotel over Easter. It's in a great location, just off O'Connell street. It's a lovely Georgian building and the decor and furniture match the period. Breakfast is traditional and the staff are so friendly and welcoming. The owner came to each guest and asked how their stay was-I've never had that personal touch before. 

Overall, very good value for money.

229,Anniversary treat,"Well situated in city centre, walking distance for shopping and to airport buses. The staff at this hotel were friendly and helpful. The lift to our third floor room was clean and efficient. The room we stayed in was well proportioned with a clean and good sized ensuite. In the room a hairdryer, kettle, TV and phone were provided. The room was overlooking the street with Abbey Church opposite, so not overlooked by anyone. Not much traffic in this area so not bothered by traffic noise. Breakfast choices were  cereals, fruit juices, yoghurt and fruit. These choices were followed by a full Irish cooked breakfast. The Vaults bar was a nice feature in the basement of the hotel. We enjoyed our first visit to Dublin staying in a lovely, warm, friendly hotel.",4,2013,04,05
229,Wonderful experience,"We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough! The staff were so welcoming and friendly.  The room was spotless, warm and very cosy.  Our room was at the back of the hotel so there wasn't a sound to be heard from outside. Breakfast was first class.  The hotel is made up of 9 terraced houses so is full of character and history.  The hotel owner was there to welcome the guests and thank them for their custom - a lovely gesture.  We will definitely stay there again on our next trip to Dublin.  Thank you to everyone and well done!",5,2013,04,04
229,Top location within short walking distance to city center,"I stayed at this hotel 3 nights at the end of march this year. My room was small, but OK. The radiator heating in my room was defect, so they had supplied me a small electrical heater on wheels. There were only 2 current outlets in the room, one up by the ceiling and one on the middel up on one wall. Because of that, the small electrical heater was not a good solution. In the bathroom, the washin basin did not have a mixer - only separate varm and cold vater cranes. And the toilet drawdown was not fully functional. The staff in the reception was very helpful and friendly. The breakfast was OK, but nothing special. I think there are very variying standard on the rooms in this hotel, so the experience as a guest will maybe depend much on which room you get. The price was OK, but not extremely cheap - therefore the value was in my opinion no more than medium when the room standard and breakfast was only ""so-so"".",3,2013,04,04
229,50th Birthday treat,"A very nice place,staff could not be better,the only thing i would fault was the room was far to hot at night and the windows were were to high up to open,but that would not put me off coming again.

Thanks

229,Perhaps not fit for a king or queen… but nice all the same,"My friend and I stayed here over Easter. The room was clean and comfy, and the hotel itself has bundles of charm. Only a couple of issues: we asked for a wake-up call but it never came, so it was lucky I woke up before we had to leave for a tour we were booked on. The man on reception claimed he called four times, but both my friend and I are both very light sleepers, so we think he must have either got the room wrong or the volume was turned down on the phone. When I spoke to someone else on reception about not receiving a call she said , ""Oh, yes, that's been happening a bit lately!'', so just make sure you set your own alarm too to be on the safe side! The heating was also cranked up so high that we sweated all through the night without being able to turn it off which was a bit annoying. It's a nice hotel though and about a 10-minute walk from all the action in the city, so I'd still recommend it.",3,2013,04,01
229,Friendly and Close by,"Overall the hotel was good. The size of the room was pretty big for two people, and everything was really clean. The location was excellent, a short walk from temple bar and right along the route for the red City Bus Tour and the bus link to the airport.

Don't get room 407 - it was really hard to find (through a door marked 'Private'?!) and we had to slam the door to get it to lock. The bar in the basement was really cool, and served us until 4am on St.Patrick's Day! Breakfast was standard but adequate. 

The staff were really nice, and they have a large luggage storage room to keep your luggage if you're not leaving until late on check-out day. 

Would definitely return.",4,2013,03,29
229,Good Location - Great Price!,"This hotel is in a good location, just at the top of O'Connell street which is basically the gateway to most of the attractions in Dublin.  The hotel is very old, but kept up, our room was very clean. Our only complaint was the water pressure was low in the shower.  Breakfast was great, but the best attribute to the Castle Hotel is the staff.  Gillian was extremely helpful.  She went above and beyond to help us book the tours we wanted during our stay.  Taxis were always right on time and getting around Dublin was made easy.  Castle Hotel was great for us!",4,2013,03,26
229,Lovely!,"I stayed here from March 2-March 14. The place really is a maze! I had to laugh at myself as I made my way to my room: loads of steps, bumpy floor boards, long hallways mixed with 2 heavy suitcases was probably a good sight to see! I didn't mind any of that, though, I think it adds to the charm of the hotel. The room was very nice and cozy. I was expecting a single room with a twin bed, but the room had a full size bed instead! The bathroom was basic (but who really needs a fancy bathroom??) and the heated shower rack was a nice added touch, especially after walking around in the cold all day!! I always wrapped up in a towel to warm up! The shower is very small and water always seemed to get on the floor of the bathroom. There was a good-sized wardrobe with some provided clothes hangers for all of your belongings. I always had to keep my window open because the air within the room tended to get really thick after having it closed for awhile. The walls between the rooms are VERY thin and the doors are loud. I had to make sure I closed the door quietly in the morning to not disturb everyone around me. A couple was staying next to my room and I could clearly make out all of their conversation. My room faced the back side of the hotel, which was nice because I wasn't disturbed by street noises. The only downfall of this is when people took a smoke break outside, the smell of the smoke would travel up and into my room. The cleaning staff was very thorough and always made the bed, took the trash and straightened up the bathroom. A couple of times they would take the handsoap I was using and throw it away, so I'd have to open up a new package, it seemed like a waste to throw out perfectly good soap. The complimentary breakfast in the vaults was pretty good. I never tried the full Irish breakfast, it was too much food for me personally. I ate eggs, bacon and toast, which were all very good. If you have to be up early and want breakfast before 7:30am, you have to tell the reception so that someone can set up the food for you. It's not a full breakfast, just the basics like toast, cereal, fruit, cold meats, and cheese. On two occasions during breakfast (before the main 7:30am breakfast), the dishes were dirty and had food residue on them. I would just switch out the plates for cleaner ones. I ate at the restaurant downstairs a few nights, I always got the chicken with mushrooms & onions with chips...very simple, but it was delicious and I find myself craving it at home now! The prices seem to be just right for a hotel. Instead of ordering a drink, take the hotel up on their offer of a free Irish coffee with purchase of a meal! You'll find the offer in their menu. The location of the hotel could not have been more perfect. I didn't have a car, so I had to walk everywhere. It's a 2 minute walk to O'Connell Street, tons of shopping, various options for food, and about 10-15 minutes from the Temple Bar area. I met the owner of the hotel a day before I left, such a nice man and I could tell he truly cared about his visitors and his hotel. Lovely hotel and I would definitely stay again! Thank you!!",5,2013,03,24
229,Lovely stay for a long weekend,"On the tail end of our recent trip we stayed at the Castle Hotel to be close to the sights and it was a nice hotel.  When checking in we met the charming owner and the staff was very kind and helpful.  They let us know about the live music that evening and we got to our room, settle in and headed to the restaurant the Vault downstairs.  Very charming, lots of history and quirky features to this place.  We had some nice small plates and pints while watching the musicians which was brilliant.  The weekend and hotel were busy for the 6 nations rugby match yet the service was very attentive.  Our room was just right for us and while a little noisy with sold out nights, very comfortable and roomy with a lovely ensuite bathroom.  The breakfast was great and all suggestions from the front desk were spot on for the sights in the city or restaurants down the street.  We enjoyed all the common spaces in the hotel and more.  Thank you for the lovely stay!",5,2013,03,20
229,great hotel,I stayed here for 4 nights with my partner and i have to say what a great hotel. This is my third time to Ireland and by far the best experience i have had largely due to Michael the bar man who really added to our experience he was really fantastic. Our room was beautiful and really enjoyed our stay. Defiantly Come again,5,2013,03,20
229,cute hotel,"I think this hotel was fun.  When we first got there, we thought it was hard to get around because it's little halls and doors every where, but after we got the hang of where our room was and explored the hotel a little, my friends and I enjoyed it.  the hotel is decorated pretty well.  It has a lot of rooms.  It was a bigger hotel chain than I expected.  The location was right off O'connell street but at the end of the street away from Temple Bar and the areas we planned to go.  I don't think it was a bad walk to and from.  We could stop and shop on the way to and from.  The floors were old and creeky.  The window in the room didn't seal well so there was a breeze.  There were 3 of us in a room with basically 4 bed. 2 twins seperately and then 2 more pushed together to make a larger bed.  The heat in the room worked well so that was nice.  It had 2 mirrors (one full length) a small en suite bathroom, a small tv, black out shades, a closet and chairs.  We had breakfast in the morning which was nice.  They had a small restaurant and bar downstairs as well.  I think it was called the vault.   On St Patty's they had live Irish music.  It has a nice atmosphere and was relaxing.  The food was really good.  It was definitely a home cook feel vs the fast food that you find in a lot of areas and hotels.  I would defnitely reccommend this hotel if you're willing to do some walking.",5,2013,03,19
229,"Clean rooms, friendly staff, close to the sights","This hotel was great. The staff was friendly and informative, the rooms and public spaces were clean and comfortable, and it was an easy walk to the Temple Bar area, Dublin Castle, Guinness Storehouse, Grafton St., St. Stephen's Green, etc. My only advice is to ask for a room not overlooking the street as it was a bit noisy.",4,2013,03,18
229,Great hotel,"I stayed three nights for St Paddy's day with a couple of friends. It was on the second floor facing the church. There was 2 single beds and a king (2 single beds put together) Everything was nice and comfortable in the room. Bathroom kinda small but its ok. The windows did not have a seal, so you could feel the a little breeze, but it wasnt bad, I kinda liked it, kept the temperature balanced in the room. I did feel people moving on the room above us, but not that bad. The hotel is like a maze, there are stairs and hallways everywhere, it was interesting. The staff were all nice and so was the restaurant at the bottom of the hotel which had live music and nice atmosphere.
The location is ok, about 20 mins walking to temple bar area, it does get tiring after a while having to walk everyday.",5,2013,03,18
229,Great hotel very central value for money,W stayed here for only 1 night. We had trouble finding a hotel with family rooms as there are 6 of us when I came across this hotel. When we arrived we were directed to our room on the 4th floor which was massive. It had a double bed and 4 single beds with plenty of space also. They forgot to put a cot in but when I asked for 1 it was there within 5 mins. The room was very clean with tea/coffee making facilities and a very large bathroom. There is private car parking available at the back of the hotel for 10 euro although it is small. The staff were very friendly and helpful. When we were leaving we met the owner who was a lovely man. We had already checked out but wanted to have lunch before heading home and he allowed us to leave our car parked in the car park at no extra cost. It is a great hotel and great value for money at only 129 euro for 6 including breakfast!!! We will definitely be back again. ,5,2013,03,17
229,Lovely!,"We stayed for three nights, upon arrival to the hotel we were greeted warmly , check in was very fast! we were brought to our room , there was 3 single beds in our triple room , 1 bathroom , tea making facilities and a few bedside lockers , we had a room at the back of the hotel but we didn't mind very much because the room was quite breathtaking as it was! , It was lovely.

It's about a 5 minute walk to O'Connell St., We were going to Dublin for a weekend. We had a concert in the Aviva Stadium , we went to the Cinema also and The Guinness Brewery!

Connolly Station is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel and drops you right off at landsdowne road , direct from the Aviva!

The Cinema we went to was 15 minutes walking distance and there are multiple all over the place!

The bus which took you to St. Jame's Gate brewery was right down on O'Connell St. literally 5 minutes walk from the hotel!

Overall we had a great stay!, Staff were nice, food was lovely! Room was perfect!

Will definitely be staying here again!!!!",5,2013,03,11
229,not as good as I'd hoped,"Stayed for three nights, although the hotel was nice enough it did not live up to my expectations. based on the website.  The room we were given, although clean, was small and cramped. windows were too high to reach without climbing on a chair. towels were small. The public rooms were nice, and I liked the interesting little sitting rooms.  The staff were friendly and helpful and food in the restautant was good,if not inspired.",3,2013,03,09
229,The Tardis,"Would stay here again,from the outside it looks like a tall house inside we couldn't believe the amount of rooms. Our room (quad) was massive and comfortable, the seperate sitting room was delightful. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Traditional music in the bar at the weekend. Breakfast hot and tasty although rather busy, rooms clean. Central location. Word of advice when out shopping take great care of your purse or wallet lot of pickpockets about we know we were victims.",4,2013,03,04
229,Much better than expected,"We stayed at this hotel for one night but I could have  happily stayed for longer as it was very comfortable and had a great location. The staff were very efficient, warm and welcoming. The hotel itself is really old and interesting, with vintage jewellery and other quirky old things for sale.  The atmosphere was lovely, and air of old Dublin about it. Our room had recently been refurbished and was very clean and fresh, and with a good supply of complimentary toiletries in the small but modern shower room. A good deal too.",5,2013,03,03
229,"Great place, well located","I would stay here again. It's an old building as so many are in old towns. Well kept, clean. Great staff. The day we arrived our early checkin was no problem. The route through the building to room 218 was wonky b/c it's an old building. Most rooms were not like that. Hotel bar had trad on Fri-Sat night, great fun. Did not eat at the restaurant.",4,2013,02,26
229,Expected a Little More,"We stayed here for 2 nights.  When we checked in, they had us in the very back of the hotel, up the elevator, back through several up and down stairs until we found the room.  We had reserved a matrimony room only to find it was 3 double beds in the room. So back down the up and down stairs and the elevator with the luggage to reception.  They changed our room.  It was acceptable. Breakfast seemed to be in the basement, and was very small.  Service was adequate.  The reception did help us check in for our flights which was really helpful.  The location was reasonable.  It was a reasonable walk to the downtown and tourist areas. The night receptionist helped us find a laundry which we desperately needed.",3,2013,02,25
229,Great Craic!,"Just back from a short break in Dubs and we had a brilliant time. The Castle Hotel was perfect for us - a row of authentic Georgian town houses joined together which had a faded genteel feel and bags of character. Lovely, helpful staff, and we were able to check in at 9am, so just dropped the bags, had a quick freshen up in the modern bathroom and we were off out exploring!  The airport buses drop you off nearby on O'Connell st - that's the main thoroghfare, and you walk uphill for a few minutes and Great Denmark St is on your right. There's a blue painted cafe/cake shop on the corner, you can't miss it,  and The Castle is right next door. Our room was fine, the bed comfy, and it was very warm, in fact we had to have the window open in Feb! Sure, the floors are a bit creaky - it's hundreds of years old! If you want new and charmless book a travelodge.

Breakfast was good - help yourself to cereals, toast, juices and fruits and they bring you a cooked Irish if you're up for it. When we told the waitress one morning we'd had a few too many the night before and were suffering, she immediately brought extra food to help soak it up :-) Great craic in the bar downstairs with the singers/musicians who had everyone up dancing on the Saturday night. Good mix of older and younger guests, and all enjoying themselves. We'd not hesitate to book it again next time we're in Dublin as it's clean, friendly and within easy walking distance of everything. Take the hop on hop off tour bus on your first day if you can to orientate yourselves and you'll soon be confidently walking all over Dublin taking in the many sights and attractions.  

Hope you have as much fun in Dublin as we did but beware...we lost our hearts. Can't wait to go back to recapture them ;-) xx",4,2013,02,25
229,Worst hotel,"Checked in at 2.30 pm and we wanted to take a shower and there was no hot water,we left at 5pm and we came back at 11pm and still no hot water. We went to the reception 3 times and first she said they will have 2 more bathroom thats why they have no water. Second lady said its gonna be half an hour and we have water again. That was at 4pm. When we left at 5 we told them again we have no hot water and she said its not possible... So at 11pm when we came back we had to take a shower in a cold water because nobody cared!!! Next day morning around 9 a staff came in to our room and asked are we still sleeping?? And the walls are very thin we could hear the neighbors snoring in the night. This hotel is a nightmare!",2,2013,02,25
229,Lovely Hotel,We stayed at the Castle Hotel for one night.  It was in a great location being a short walk from the main attractions.Our room was lovely and warm which was welcome as it was snowing.  Met the owner on our way out and he was very welcoming.  Bar area was lovely and would have liked to use it more - just no time.  We will be back!!,4,2013,02,25
229,Clean and Comforatble,Just returned from our first trip to Dublin. Hotel was centrally placed and within walking distance of main areas. Staff friendly and helpful and we were able to get into our room when we arrived at 9am. Only downside was being able to hear our neighbour snoring!!!! Would recommend the hotel as good value for money.,3,2013,02,23
229,"Good accommodation, great service","We spent a fabulous long weekend in Dublin that was made even better by our stay at the Castle Hotel. Perhaps the most striking thing for us was that we found the service exceptional and always pleasant, and we travel extensively. Every request was met with a smile and  willingness to help.
The rooms are affordable and the location excellent by our estimation -- we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go.
Loved the breakfasts, the decor, the overall atmosphere.",5,2013,02,21
229,Good but not cheap,"Hotel was good but a bit expensive. Breakfast was OK but nothing extra, long queues for the toaster at peak times. You hear everything from the other rooms. The nicest stuff I can imagine, very helpful. Room was cosy. Great bar and restaurant, great stuff there, perfect for the last beer or 2 after you spend some time at Temple Bar and want something quiet.",4,2013,02,21
229,Amazing time in Dublin...,"I have just got back from the best weekend in Dublin. The hotel is in a great position on Parnell Street, just a short walk from O'Conell St and the Temple Bar area. The hotel is full of character and old charm, being a converted georgian townhouse. Breakfast (full Irish) was great every morning, rooms were clean and homely with maid service every day. check-in was very quick, we had 3 rooms booked and 1 was ready early which was very handy to store our luggage until the other 2 rooms were ready. The reception staff were fantastic, booking us taxis, advising us on the best routes to lots of the attractions. The rooms were very hot, but we sorted that out very quickly by turning off the rads and opening a window! 
The hotel is very close to hop on hop off bus stops and the luis which is the tram service, we walked to a lot of the attractions like croke park, botanic gardens etc but relied on the tram/taxis to get us to guiness factory, jameson distillery, Dublin Zoo and Trintiy college/grafton street area.
We pre-paid for the dublin pass which is such a good idea, it works out cheaper overall and you can queue jump. Shopping was fantastic, all the normal high street brands with designer and more quirky shops mixed in. we sampled a few pubs (!) and you cannot beat Irish pubs for atmosphere, all of them were fantastic with live irish music. We didnt have a bad meal, massive portions and great choice. Try the Elephant & Castle on Temple Bar...bit of a wait even though we pre-booked the table but it was definetely worth it. We saw James Nesbitt in there eating at lunch time so we thought it must be good!
There is not many holidays I dont want to come home from, but we could of done with a couple more nights in Dublin easily...we spent a lot of money, its not cheap in Dublin but you dont go on a break away and skimp and save, we stayed for 3 nights, ate a lot, saw a lot and drank even more!!
One thing I will say is be aware of the beggers (you get this in every city and it certainly didnt spoilt it for us) and pick pocketers! On Half Penny bridge, a dirty beggar had her hand in my bag...my own stupid fault because id taken my camera out to take a picture and not closed it again...nothing was taken but if they see a chance they will go for it.
All in all an absolutely amazing trip and I cant wait to go back!",5,2013,02,21
229,excellent friendly hotel,"Great hotel, warm clean and  staff very friendly, great food  large portions and terrific atmosphere, Live entertainment at the weekends.
Easy access to local transport and lots of top attractions.
Walking distance to shopping centres.",5,2013,02,14
229,Brilliant wee band,"Stayed here twice before, the staff treat you like an old friend and my favourite thing about this hotel is the traditional irish band that plays here on wkends, they are brilliant, belting out old irish ballads and songs you can sing along to. If you want a proper taste of Dublin come here. The location is great aswell, a short walk into the city centre. I would definately stay here again infact was trying to book it for a few wks from now but its booked up.",5,2013,02,12
229,first taste of ireland,"just returned from my first visit to Ireland. Loved the people and Dublin. The hotel was full of character, clean and comfortable with a good location. Food lovely and the staff very friendly and helpful. Top marks to Mick (bar staff), and the Irish trio very entertaining. The bus around the city is a must and the live commentary was excellent.",4,2013,02,10
229,DO YOU LIKE NOISE?,"Old, tired  building that creeks and noises at every opportunity.

Pipes bang, motors pump and thingies thing all the day and night long. 

Breakfast was poor, a token effort at food.

And it was not cheap either?

Next time I'll stay in a tent ",2,2013,02,09
229,mayo,"Good location,walking distance to OConnell street,frequent bus service 2mins.walking distance from hotel.Clean and warm (the weather was v.bad) The staff was frendly and helpfull,night porter on duty.Food was very good we enjoyed two evening meals one early bird pre theater dinner 20euro two courses.Hope to be back.",4,2013,02,08
229,Good Little Hotel,"A good base for exploring Dublin just up the road from all the shops and bars.
Hotel over 300years old so expect quirky corridors with VERY squeaky floorboards! It would be helpful if the doors had soft closures on instead of everyone having to bang the doors.
The breakfast is good but very quick service so make sure you tell them to hold it back until you have had your cereal.
Nice little restaurant and bar that has live music friday and saturday nights.",3,2013,02,08
229,Poor,"Hotel not good, went to have a shower there was no water. Won't be going back. The noise from the traffic lights kept me awake. Breakfast was just ok.Bedroom was awful.I would not use this hotel again",1,2013,01,26
229,Very Average,"The room wasn't big or small, the facilities weren't good or bad the breakfast was Ok, the service was again Ok, in fact everything was Ok.

I would not use this place again, their wasn't anything especially bad about it, but for the money i would like to have at least one good thing to say about a place",3,2013,01,24
229,Oldish but clean,"Good sized room for a family of 2 adults and two kids.
Great location, walking distance into O'Connell street.
Breakfast is really tasty and cooked freshly as you enter the restaurant and give your order.  Cereal and toast are also provided.
The Hotel itself has many Victorian style features like high ceilings and architrave around walls and ceiling.
I would ave to say that the room have a bit if wear and tear but are clean.
Well recommended for the breakfast and location.

One side point..... They have a VERY SMALL Car park at the rear of their premises.  If you're not a confident driver you mat struggle to actually park.",3,2013,01,23
229,Truly Uplifting,"My mother recently passed away and so I came to Dublin for a three day break and to attend the Philo Vibe.

I must say that the Castle Hotel is a hotel full of charm and a traditional Georgian style and the staff really make you feel at home, especially at breakfast time when a traditional Irish breakfast is served.  If you have a spare few minutes ask about the history of the hotel and I am sure you will be very surprised!

Everyone in the hotel did their utmost to make me feel welcome.  When I asked for my room to be changed to one that was quieter at the back of the hotel the receptionist accommodated my wishes and this I found was very helpful as I had quite a few late nights.

The best thing about this hotel is the fact that it has Wi-Fi which will enable you to find interesting places to visit whilst you are visiting Dublin.  It is within walking distance of most of the major attactions, such as the Button Factory and the Museum of Literature  if you need a buss to visit Phil Lynott's grave just ask and you will be told what bus to catch and where to pick it up from.

I would certainly stay at this hotel again and hope that guests in the future also have an uplifting experience.",5,2013,01,23
229,So happy we came back for second stay!,"My Aunt and I stayed here for 2 nights after arriving on the ferry from Wales.  After a nightmarish trip on the bus from the Docks to the city it took us awhile to get to the hotel and I was never so happy as to find everything in order.  

We were so happy with our room, location, restuarant etc that we booked a further two nights later in our trip.

The girls on reception were amazing.  At one point when I could not print something from the guest computer, they assisted with their work one.  Nothing was ever too much trouble.

We had several meals in the faults - one when it was busy and their were musicians playing and another when there was only us and another couple.  Both times the food and the service was fantastic.

The car park is a little tight - be warned and try to get there early.

I loved the location and was able to catch buses and walk the city. Close proximity to so many things.

The walls are thin, however I always wear earplugs when I am travelling so that I DO sleep as I will generally wake at any noise - even at home.

The maze of corridors was only an issue when pulling the cases.

I felt safe and secure at all times, including walking back up O'Connell St in the dark ( mind you it was only 6pm)

I loved it and would now stay nowhere else.",5,2013,01,15
229,Great overall experience,"Stayed for three nights and thought the hotel was nicely presented, appropriate to our expectations and had plenty of room for our things and for us to move around comfortably. Thought the bathroom walls were in need of some repair, but overall the experience was enjoyable and I would recommend people to this hotel in the future. The breakfast in the morning was quick and easy, and the availability of both hot and cold foods for breakfast made it even better. We also had a room away from the main street, blocking out traffic and making sleep easy and comfortable. The hotel's proximity to O'Connell Street and other locations around Dublin also made travel convenient. Staff were friendly and helpful in answering our questions. Overall, we highly enjoyed our experience and would stay here in the future.",4,2013,01,07
229,"Better hotels in same area, choose another","Stayed for 5 nights over New Year. The only positive things to note about this hotel are the location and the staff at breakfast. Its in a great location at the top of O'Connell Street but is severely let down by the shabby interior and terrible rooms.
Our room was very small and a very odd shape, with a wardrobe that was so small it could only hold 5 coathangers. There was no room for drawer space either! Our duvet cover was torn and the dust hung on the walls.
No safe in the room. Dont be fooled by the photographs they were obviously taken some time ago and the rooms we saw were definately not to the same standard.
There are many hotels in this area and we will definately choose another on our next trip to Dublin.",2,2013,01,05
229,Good location,"Stayed for 4 nights recently including over new year. Hotel was quite central (which was very nice), within walking distance of the city centre. Old style hotel, which was very full when we were there end Dec. Stayed 1 night in a very small room, then we requested to be moved to a different (larger) room and this was acted upon very promptly by the reception staff. New room was much larger, although the double bed was very small. Staff were very polite, friendly and helpful (both reception and restaurant). Free Wi-fi was very good in all places (several networks throughout the hotel). Breakfast was very basic (not a lot of choice at all) but good and filling, especially full Irish; in some mornings, very long lines for the toast machines (which presumbably can be very easily fixed by setting up couple toasting stations instead of cramming several toasters into the corner of the room). Hotel was very noisy, you could practicaly hear all activities / movements, etc from neighbouring rooms (especially top floors) and also from outside. Not sure what can be done about this, the noise is the main reason for the average rating for this hotel. Hotel was clean, bathrooms appeared recently modernized (which was quite nice). In the lobby lounge there was a baggage scale for guest use, which one could use at a cost of €1 (charging for this is something we found very strange; we did not need to use it ourselves since we did not have lots of luggage but just mentioning as a comment). Good value overall.",3,2013,01,01
229,Look elsewhere,"Firstly I will start with the good points - the girls on reception were very helpful and the hotel is only a very short walk from the centre...however:

- our room was tiny and you can barely even move in the bathroom
- the room had 2 very large windows which meant it was quite cold
- we couldn't get any hot water on 2 occasions 
- room was not very clean 
- walls are very thin I could hear next doors conversation
- much needed painting was taking place however this meant our room stunk of paint
- toilet handle was broken (you had to press it against the toilet as it had come unstuck) 
- breakfast was poor we arrived at half 8 to bread, cereal, slices of ham and cheese

I'm glad I only stayed here 2 nights",2,2012,12,29
229,Fantastic service and lovely hotel,"We have stayed in this hotel 4 times now, and I can only praise the service and wonderful staff.
It is situated on Parnell square at the top of O'Connell street so is central and  the airport bus stop is just around the corner.
We had a very noisy family gathering in the bar downstairs, I had asked for an area to be reserved for us, and this was duly done the staff couldnt do enough for us. The bar food is lovely, although pricey, even by Dublin standards,and the breakfast was amazing.
The rooms are beautiful, however my only complaint is that they were cold. The radiators are in no way big enough for the rooms. We are hardy Scots and found the rooms really nippy.
Excellent value and I would not hesitate to stay again.",5,2012,12,20
229,"Really Lovely Place, definately recommend it.","The Castle hotel was a great place to stay on our weekend to Dublin. The staff were friendly and very helpful, the location is good and the hotel itself is just lovely. Would definately recommend and stay again. Food was nice and the atmosphere in the bar was good. The room and surroundings are kept to a high standard and are clean.",5,2012,12,08
229,highly reccommended,"i stayed at the castle hotel with 2 friends and we couldnt have picked a better place to stay.the staff were very friendly and went out of their way to help us.the breakfast was epic and very tasty.the room was great with plenty of tea/coffee/shampoo etc and had the most comfortable bed ive ever slept in.the en suite was immaculate and the shower was great.the castle is ideally situated with a 10 minute walk to the temple bar area and away from any noise.on the morning we left the hotel receptionist had booked a taxi for us to the airport with a special rate,gave us all a wakeup call and provided breakfast all before 5.30 am.we would definatley stay here again and so should anyone who wants a first rate service.",5,2012,12,03
229,"Great hotel, good location, ok experience","I visited the castle hotel for 3 nights on my first trip to Dublin. The location is great right at the top of o connor street, all within a 10-15 minute walk of temple bar and all the shops. 
The room was fine and very warm. Also the complimentary wifi helped and prevented me being stung with roaming charges. The staff were also very useful..apart from the night shift receptionist not answering for 10 minutes while we came back from temple bar quite late! (we think he must have been napping)
The downside was the noise, from the traffic and sirens outside (still could hear on 3rd floor with windows closed) and the noise from the floorboards above us, we think their may have been some renovation work being done on the 4th floor as when we went to check it out we could smell paint. it  sounded like people were jumping up and down in the room above for one of the days, didnt help when we were trying to sleep off our hangovers from a night down at temple bar.
also- the breakfasts are ok (me being vegetarian doesnt help though), same with the drink prices in the very warmly hotel vault bar which also plays live music which is a touch.
overall great value for money we paid £150 each with flights for the trip for 3 night stay inc breakfast. would stay here again but would request a room on the top floor!",3,2012,12,03
229,"Good location, very thin walls","We stayed here November 30th for 2 nights.  We drove and was told there was a car park on site.  Unfortunatly no information was provided as to where this was located so after getting lost driving around the hotel we decided to go in and ask.  The lady on reception was very helpful and directed us to the car park.  We checked in with no problems, having paid through expedia there was no further information we needed to give and we were given our room keys to room 105.  Now at first we thought this would be ideal as it wasnt next door to anyone and the room was huge,however in the evening even the slightest noise could be heard which resulted in us getting minium sleep the first night.  Am sure they would have changed our room for us had we asked but we coudnt be fussed to be honest.  Breakfast was average, not much and you have to queue ages for toast. The bar in the hotel was ok with some Irish music on in the evening.  All in all it wasnt a bad hotel for the money we paid, and a nice walk into the centre about 10 mins to the Dublin Spire.  This was my partners second visit to the hotel and my first but we will be back.",4,2012,12,02
229,Good hotel,"This was my second trip to Dublin and second trip to this hotel, location wise I love it as its far out enough to be quiet but close enough for everything else! We arrived at 9am after an early flight from the uk and checked in straight away which was great as we didnt think this wouls be possible, The room was fine we booked a twin room. Yes there are long corridors but if u want a box book a new purpose bult hotel!! Bathroom looked very new with no bath but a huge shower. Which was great for us. Breakfast was fine. I work in a hotel and it was a standard self service buffet, nothing special but it's breakfast I'm not sure what people expect! Unlimited free wi fi which was great and the signal was really good in room 228.

Check out is mid day which is good and they have a luggage room so it was easy enough to drop bags in there for the day

All the staff were helpful and friendly I'm going back in January and will stay there again!,",4,2012,11,27
229,Good location and not bad value for Dublin,"Chose Castle hotel mainly for its location and price – since we wanted a place within walking distance to city center and not too overpriced with free wi-fi.  It’s on the northern edge of city center, quite easy to find, just a couple of blocks up O’Connell from where the Aircoach dropped us off.  Hotel’s in a row of combined townhouses, décor not sumptuous but had character and there were a couple of cozy public sitting areas.  Our room’s on the third floor, felt like we zigzagged through several townhouses to reach it through a long corridor.  Both room and bathroom quite large, no view however, just looking out the back at other buildings.  Bathroom has the largest window so far (6 x 3.5 ft) so was bright and airy.  Bed was two narrow singles making up a king, each with a single comforter.  Furnishing was simple but comfortable enough, and the shower was strong (4 on a scale to 5).  Only thing was insulation wasn’t so good, in the middle of one night was woken up by people talking in the next room.  Breakfast in the basement dining room, self serve continental (which we found out later that you could have as early as 7 am, while hot breakfast starts at 8:30) with custom hot dishes.  Nothing special but fairly adequate.  Overall quite happy with our stay (3 nights).  Good location and pretty good value for Dublin (compared to options near Trinity College or Stephen’s Green).",4,2012,11,24
229,"Shoddy, shoddy, shoddy","Well I'm tempted to say good value but I just can't bring myself to quite go that far.

The hotel's seen better days as the umpteen layers of paint on the stairs testify to.

The small rooms are accessed by a maze of corridors and levels and have been decked out in sub IKEA furniture but with non of the Swedish style. In fact the rooms were so compact that it was impossible to get into the bathroom if the wardrobe door was left open. Once in there was nowhere to put toiletries and the shower was the smallest I've ever used. 

The breakfast was poor to sub-average and the general level of service could be described as unenthusiastic at best.

All in all it's a thumbs down from me I'm afraid.

Oh, yes, and the location isn't great either.",2,2012,11,22
229,Old World Charm in Downtown Dublin,"I love this hotel.  It has such old world charm, from its antiques and decor and nifty nooks and crannies, to the high quality service standards of its staff.  I totally enjoyed my stay - my room was cozy and comfy, the included full breakfast was outstanding and the location is fabulous for people who like to walk without it turning into a hike.  Quiet, too, considering it's just off OConnell Street - even with the window open at night. I live in a busy, urban area, and so city noise coming through the window of this hotel did not bother me. The owner gave me a tour and talked about certain renovations, so I look forward to going back and seeing the resulting updates.",5,2012,11,20
229,The BEST party hotel in Dublin!,"We were a Hen (Bachelorette!) Party from Scotland, and this was such a revelation! The staff were so friendly and obliging and tolerant of our lively party! The vault bar was atmospheric and utterly charmingly IRISH! The barman and night porter were so great!
The rooms were clean and comfortable and there was a vintage charm to it all! The Irish breakfast was so delicious and in spite of the staff being rushed off their feet, was served quickly!Recommended++++",5,2012,11,19
229,Most Charming Hotel in Dublin,"The staff was great, the room was very cozy and we ate 3 nights in the Vaults at the hotel. The scones are by far the best in Dublin. The location is very convenient.  And don't be surprised if you're greeted with a big hug and kiss by the owner! Can't wait to stay there again.",4,2012,11,15
229,"Great location, but heavy traffic","Our group of six people stayed 5 nights. Location of the Hotel is great and the staff very helpful and friendly. Rooms have partly been renovated and are clean but very old. Innersprings of mattress made a comfortable sleep impossible. Walls are thin like paper, you can hear everything! Traffic at one side of the Hotel really loud, it was like there was no window build- in at all.",3,2012,11,15
229,Very comfy,"We stayed for two nights and found it very clean and friendly. We were made very welcome and nothing was too much trouble. The traffic was very noisy as no adequate double glazing. Because of the age of the building the floors were very creaky, so abit noisy if someone goes past your room at night! On the whole though we found it a charming and cosy hotel. The breakfast was good and plentiful.",4,2012,11,14
229,Eh - So So,"Staff - not as friendly as reviews claimed. First room given, was freezing, tiny and awkward. The staff did listen to our concern and changed to a much better room.
Room - walls are very thin - you can hear everything - specially hallway. Don't plan to sleep in.
Distance - about 20+ min walk (moderate speed) to temple bar etc
Restaurant - food is not great and over priced (as every hotel) but has very homey interior and just for that have a drink there one night when you're tired. 
If you are not planning to sleep in or hang out in hotel, don't mind bit of a walk and don't want to spend a fortune - this hotel will do the trick.",3,2012,11,13
229,Comfortable stay,"Stay here for our wedding anniversary for two nights from 3rd-5th November. We booked through a third party website and specifically requested a double room. when we got there we where given a twin room which had two single beds pushed together with single bedding on each and the beds kept moving appart. Hardly the best recipe for a romantic break away. The hotel is currently undergoing extensive renovation so we wheren't sure if the booking agent made an error or there wheren't any doubles available, leaving it to the booking agents to investigate. Our room was on the 4th floor and the window catch on one of the windows was broken and we had quite a noise night, we did complain to the staff on the sunday morning but this wasn't fixed.  All the staff however where extremely helpful, I was  on crutches and all the staff we encountered where always willing to help. The hotel rooms where very clean, and the meal we had in the resturant was good. I would be happy to stay at this hotel again especially after the renovations are complete.",4,2012,11,09
229,great value,"Stayed there for the dublin marathon.
Very accommodating and nice staff.
Paid very little money and got exactely what I paid for. No more, no less in terms of quality of the room.
Deffinitely recommend it.",5,2012,11,08
229,"Old world, not modern","Stayed two nights in an adequate room as far as size, bed comfort and amenities. Winding hallways, a small elevator and steps up and down everywhere let you know you're in an old building that's been remodeled to handle a hotel. Breakfast in the Vault was typical Irish fair with smiling waitresses.",3,2012,11,08
229,"Great Value, Great Location","My mate and I booked in here for 2 nights in middle of October. It was very cheap for two single rooms in the city centre. Excellent location, as it is only a short walk to the top of O'Connell Street. The car park is small but very secure. Staff were very helpful in letting us leave the car parked for a couple of hours after we had checked out on the Sunday.

I felt the breakfast could have been hotter coming from the kitchen. The toaster didn't work either, so, it might be time to get a new one, I put slices through twice and they still came out white.

I would still recommend the hotel though, as we enjoyed our stay and would stay again",4,2012,11,08
229,Could be better,"Stayed here last weekend for 2 nights , small tired room with a tiny shower and uncomfortable bed . Staff friendly and good service of a decent breakfast . Location of this hotel is excellent for the sights and bars . Cheap hotel in a good location .",3,2012,11,07
229,Dublin trip with friends,"
Location of  this hotel is brilliant.   Approx a ten minute walk  to the shops and start  of the bars, about 20mins to Temple Bar (too far to walk in heels  on a cold November night!) .
Costs about  10  Euros  in a taxi from the  hotel  to Temple bar.  (NB it costs about 3 Euros  extra  callout  fee  from the hotel.)
About a 5 min walk from  the red 'Hop on Hop off ' bus stop on Parnell square.
The rooms are adequate, clean and comfortable. The bathrooms small and tired looking - in need of a makeover but clean.
Couldn't get the TV to work but that may have just been us.
Breakfast was varied and very tasty - ample to full you up until  mid afternoon.
The  walls of the rooms are quite thin and we  could hear people walking up and down the corridors late at night   but  probably no more than any other hotel.

Friendly  and welcoming  bar downstairs playing  live Irish music - worth a try after a  long day sightseeing.

Staff friendly (infact everyone we met in Dublin was friendly  and helpful!).

Would use again for a cheap / budget weekend  away in  Dublin.
",3,2012,11,07
229,Good Location and Staff  is Attentive,For my final hotel in Europe I chose this place to stay in Dublin for eight nights after a long sojourn in Italy and France. The hotel lies in several old private row homes which are quite old and interesting with period furniture. The old wooden stairs squeaked a little as I descended but a modern elevator is available. I stayed on the second floor in a very quiet and comfortable room with a nice bed and free WiFi. My room had free tea and coffee and an electric hot water heater which worked great. A plentiful decent breakfast (included) is served downstairs from 7 to 10 am and the servers are very nice. The porridge and Irish bacon are very tasty. The bar and restaurant in the cellar (The Vaults) is open at night and local musicians play Irish tunes on several nights. I confirmed that the people of Dublin are very friendly and helpful after being told the same by many people that I met before I arrived. I enjoyed my stay here at the Castle Hotel very much. Attached a pix of the cute sign in the hallway outside my room.,4,2012,11,05
229,gorgeous georgian hotel.  great locatiob too. absolute treat,"amazing georgian hotel. beautiful. very friendly. very helpful. 
we stayed over halloween weekend. loacation at top of oconnell street was perfect for us. especially as we could walk to everything we wanted to see or do. 
a network of corridors to our room gave a real feel for how it had once been separate homes. room was large twin  large bathroom very comfy bed and quiet. we were on second floor off to the left. 
breakfast was in 4  rooms ajoined. staff worked hard and very accomodating to individual requests.
an absolute treat.",5,2012,11,03
229,Rooms vary greatly,"Our first night was on the third floor with a creaking and sagging floor and noise from above, the passage and adjacent rooms. 
We considered leaving but were readily offered an upgrade for the second night. 
What a difference!  We had to negotiate a warren of corridors, but the room  on the fourth (top) floor had a solid floor and soundproof walls. 
Apart from the noise on our first night, the hotel was great. Clean rooms, friendly staff and a great breakfast. ",3,2012,11,02
229,"Location, location, location...","That was the prime reason I chose the Castle as my first accommodation in Dublin. That and the fact that reasonably priced hotels were a scarcity when I was trying to find one. My trip to Ireland was a last-minute vacation between jobs and about two weeks prior to my arrival. Rifling through TripAdvisor didn't yield many attractive options, and I knew from the reviews of the Castle that it would be on the older side. But I decided to give it a try, and I have to say it was decent for what it was - an old Georgian-style hotel just two blocks from the heart of O'Connell Street, Dublin's main thoroughfare.

My standard/single bed room was small but clean (see photo) with a large window that couldn't be completely closed. Given the chill that time of year, I spent an inordinate amount of time under the extra woolen blankets I requested to keep warm. The only awkward moment came when a loud woman came barging in to ask about turning over the bed when it was clear I was taking an afternoon nap. She saw me in my skivvies and alerted me that she wasn't looking at my privates. Good to know. On the upside, they accommodated my early-morning arrival by accepting my suitcase into a parlor room where all the other waiting luggage was.

Breakfast was somewhat lacking mostly due to the haphazard service. Although I wasn't necessarily looking for a hot Irish breakfast, I wasn't even aware that was an option for me until the second day after I finished my toast and coffee. Good to know. The free WiFi did work just fine though, and the service at the front desk was reasonably good if a bit standoffish. But it was all about location, location, location, and it was nice to be able to walk to the city center without thinking about which bus line to take. Especially convenient was being close to the first stop of one of the local hop-on, hop-off buses, a blessing when I was suffering from a severe case of jet lag. For two nights, I paid € 160, a relative bargain near the center of Dublin.",3,2012,10,28
229,Good Location - Value For Money - Homely,"I have just returned from a 4 night stay at this hotel, and found it an excellent base to explore the city from.  My room was of a good size, very clean and well kept. The hotel is created from a row of Georgian house, knock though to create one building, its a bit of a maze of corridors and stair cases but the buildings retain a lot of their Georgian charms internally, if you don't like stairs and their are lots of them, not to panic they have lifts.

Full Irish breakfast each morning was always well cooked but on the small size but enough nevertheless to start the day with.

Would stay her again should I return to Dublin which I intend to do;",4,2012,10,25
229,Homely and Very Welcoming!!,"This hotel was awesome! If i could say one thing about these guys it was their service was impeccable! We were coming and going quite a lot and even though we left at 5:30am some days, they still had a breakfast available for us and couldn’t help us enough. The owner/manager of the hotel was a hoot! Such a cheerful and welcoming man! The rooms were lovely too! After a busy day out travelling, it was nice to come back to such a nice hot shower and a comfy bed. Definitely would recommend this place to others and go back again if I had the chance!",5,2012,10,24
229,Dublin visit,"We arrived well before our check in time of 2.30pm with the intention of leaving our cases so we could go sight-seeing. Receptionist was very obliging and found a family room which was ready and checked us in which was about 9.30am. Brilliant start. Room was spacious and very clean. Tea and coffee provided which was replenished daily, as was bedding and towels. Staff were very pleasant and helpful. Breakfast very nice and plentiful. Location excellent short walk to O'Connell Street  and city centre facilities. Would fully recommend and will certainly use again.",4,2012,10,24
229,A great place to stay- very friendly and extremely helpful.,"Extremely nice place to stay- people are friendly and helpful. Could leave car parked after checkout while you walked the city of dublin( which saves on car park prices) breakfast was delicious. The great wifi password ever, lol",5,2012,10,22
229,4 night stay,"Lovely hotel, lovely breakfasts, lovely rooms, lovely staff.
Staff are really friendly and very very helpful and accommodating. Any problems (there were a couple of initial niggles!), and they were dealt with pretty much immediately. They moved us to another, nicer room, which suited us better, they gave us an extra electric heater, to make the room warmer. Nothing was too much trouble. Customer satisfaction definatley came first at this hotel!.
It's ideally situated, being on the north side of the Liffie, and a 10 minute walk to O'Connell Street, and the river. Nice pubs and eateries nearby, without even needing to go to Temple Bar!.
Have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to others, and would happily stay again.",5,2012,10,15
229,Not quite as in the pictures,"My daughter and I stayed at the Castle on our first trip to Dublin.  We arrived very early and were allowed to wait in one of the little side rooms.  We found the staff to be very accommodating and friendly.  The hotel is on a row of Georgian houses and the facade is in keeping as is many of the internal decorations.  It also benefits from a car park though round the back is rather unsavoury.

Our room, overlooked the car park (quiet) and  was a complete disappointment.  Definitely not as shown on many of the websites.  It was absolutely tiny and apart from a modern headboard and modern bedding, was very badly appointed.  The bathroom was most definitely the worst I have ever been in.  I suggest the management visit the room and ask themselves if they would like this.  Cracked floor tiles, broken clothes hook so had to put my clothes on the toilet seat, the bath panel broken and surround had a piece of wood (painted) as obviously no-one had tiled it and the extractor fan required cleaning.  No-where to put our toilet bag as I didnt want to chance the only ledge which was above the toilet.  Sorry but this is unacceptable.  

This was the first hotel on our Irish trip and have to say the worst.",2,2012,10,14
229,"Inexpensive, convenience, nice room","Convenience - the hotel is located up O'Connell St. just across from the Garden of Remembrance.  It was an easy walk to most places, about a mile to the river and Temple Bar area.  There are a lot of buses, theatres, and cabs in the area.

Wi-Fi - the internet worked well even in my bedroom!!

Room - I stayed in a single room, so in the spirit of Europe, it had a small bed (either a twin or a double), which was perfect for just me.  There were plenty of power outlets, and the room even came equipped with an actual hairdryer (not one of the weird wall ones).  The room & bathroom were clean and just big enough for me.  I am not someone who stays in my room long, so the size was perfect - with a large window that I was able to open.  My only complaint would be the shower curtain - the size of the shower was pretty small, but I was a little irritated that the shower curtain kept touching me (blowing against me) during my shower.

Getting to the room was interesting - they had stairs & an elevator, and once you entered the hallway, I had to go through an extra couple of fire doors to get to the room.  It was easy, the floor was obviously old as it creaked below my feet, but it was easy getting in and out of the hotel.

They locked my luggage away for me as I explored, and the staff was very helpful and friendly.  They were at the desk 24 hours.  For some Americans who aren't used to the practice, be aware that you leave the key at the desk each time you leave the hotel.  There was a restaurant (I preferred to go to the little cafe next door and ate at pubs for dinner), but I didn't try it.  They had a reading room and internet desk if interested, some people used it.

Overall, it was exactly what I hoped for based on the price that I paid.  Very typical size for European rooms, and very clean (and smelled nice), didn't really notice much that it was an older building.  Very pleased with the hotel, would definitely recommend to a friend!",4,2012,10,13
229,lovely little hotel,"Me and my friend visited here in june (age 21) staying for 2 nights. We arrived at 9am from an early flight and were able to leave our bags no trouble, with the same leaving as we had a late flight. The receptionist gave us advice where to go, pleasant staff. We had a triple room as there were originally meant to be 3 of us. Comfortable room , good breakfast, if people complain then very fussy! Cant comment on the restaurant as we went out to eat. In a central area, 10 mins to temple bar..pubs galore. If eating out try the Gallaghers Boxty House on Temple Bar..fabulous",4,2012,10,10
229,Feedback,"The hotel is old, but very nice and good located. Staff at the reception was  friendly  and helpful, service at break fast was super, room was  clean at our arrival,  though not spotless the next day.

We were not satisfied with the service during dinner. Looked like we pestered them and offered management compliment  at our arrival,  we received  after the  third notice. We felt like beggars. The next evenings we decided not to visit it anymore.
 We  believe it was the only exception, but ruined our whole impression of the hotel.",3,2012,10,09
229,Fantastic!,"I visited this hotel at the end of July this year. I was on the back end of a long month travelling on my own. I could not have asked for a better hotel to end my trip on. The Castle Hotel, is close to everything, it has an amazing location considering the price of the room was quite cheap. The room itself was clean, the bed was great. The staff were super friendly and the bar/resturant was an excellent place to enjoy a nice meal and drink after a day of travel.There is also a lift available! which is an amazing win to anyone who has experienced lugging 20kg luggage up multiple flights of stairs in europe. This hotel is close to o'connell street and is really only a 5-10 minute walk to grafton. its close to paddy wagon pick up points, and it overall, its vibe, location and service was a very pleasant end to my stay in Dublin.",4,2012,10,07
229,good but service at breakfast needs improving,"this hotel is great, staff are lovely, helpful and polite only downside would be that the service at breakfast weren't up to much, staff in trainers,we were left for ages before we were spoke to, to order. That was only because we went to find someone. There isn't really any organisation during the breakfast but apart from that i would still recomend this hotel and would stay there again. Rooms were clean, and hotel is family friendly,",3,2012,10,05
229,A good base to see Dublin,"The hotel is just off O'Connell Street upper.The staff were very polite and helpful.There is a good choice of dishes for breakfast and the evening meal i would class as good pub grub.The bedroom was a touch on the small side for a double,but adequate.Good value for a short stay.",3,2012,10,05
229,recent visit to Castle Hote l- Dublin,"I recently stayed for a week at the Castle Hotel - Dublin and wanted to thank all the staff members for a very enjoyable and welcoming experience. The staff are very helpful and friendly and I would  like to go back there one day . I recommend iit to anyone who is looking for an excellent hotel in Dublin. Thanks

229,"Clean, friendly and helpful","This hotel was lovely to stay in, as we walked in the door the owner approached us to say welcome to my hotel:) the staff were very friendly an helpful in ordering cabs, giving directions, arranging early breakfast etc, the rooms were clean and warm, the breakfasts included in the room price were great to set you up for the days sight seeing, and the Irish music played in the restaurant downstairs on the weekends was awesome! Plus a free Baileys or Irish coffee with each time you had dinner in The Vault, and Just minutes walk to O'Connell Steet, the heart of Dublin",5,2012,10,04
229,"Creaky, dodgy and noisy","Oh dear.. I got booked into the Castle hotel when the Jurys custom house and seemingly everything else in Dublin was fully booked. On arriving at the airport and telling the taxi driver where to take me, he made that ""phew"" noise and said ""are you sure you want to stay in that area??"" 
On getting out of the taxi, the first thing you notice is the next door neighbour ""Barrys hotel"". Look up the reviews for more info on that little gem.. The taxi driver told us it's a lapdancing club. Throughout the week, we were warned by several other taxi drivers and locals that the area is known for having heroin problems, and you should avoid walking back to the hotel after dark. 

The Castle hotel is basically a Georgian row converted into one place. This has led to a complete maze of rooms all over the place. It's not unusual to bump into people wandering around looking lost with a bit clunky 1970s brass room key in their hand. The staff are not particularly attentive, and I noticed that the full balance 4 nights was taken from my bank account already after 2 days. That's never a good start. 

The first room I got was awful. 103 is directly above the bar toilets, and badly suffering from all kinds of noise. I complained and was moved to a room ""somewhere"" on the 4th floor, which was a bit better, although with lots of noise from neighbours in the paper thin walls and the busy street below. The first night, the guy in the room behind me kept me awake with his snoring. 

All in all, I think it's safe to say I won't be back in a hurry, even for the English breakfast. You can get that anywhere in Dublin..",2,2012,10,03
229,location is best asset,"Within 10 mins+ walking distance of Temple Bar, Trinity College, Grafton Street; very good location.  Old building with character however The Vault restaurant/bar smells like a musty basement. The breakfast eating room was fine. Had a family room for four at back of building which was quiet and a good size.",3,2012,10,02
229,Castle Hotel Dublin,"The positive: Good location. Reasonable  prices  via on line  booking sites. Excellent reception, ,breakfast and room staff.
The negative:tired and in need  of  a  deep clean and significant  basic maintenance  programme. Kitchen smells permeate  most parts  of  the  hotel. Horribly  creaky  floorboards in  corridors  and bedroom resulted in very  disturbed  sleep.",3,2012,10,02
229,Early morning staff incompetent!,"Overall the hotel was not bad. Decent location, clean, average price. The staff during the day is helpful when asked, but if you have an early flight the young man (mid 20's, indian decent, spiky blk hair, earring) is INCOMPETENT! He forgot to order my pre arranged taxi till I asked, my breakfast never showed up and he got mad at me for using ponds instead of kilos on the luggage scale. When i did use kilos, he flat out lied to me an told me he had no internet access to check the the conversion and then without another word, went out to smoke. I know the have internet access because I used the internet at the front desk computer the pervious day when the room wifi was down. Based on these things I will NEVER stay there again.",3,2012,09,30
229,visiting dublin,"the stay was nice, breakfast was great, the room was clean but small,for an upgrade you could get a better room, but first you pay then you go to the room, and if your not satisfied go fast and get an upgrade, or either  you get 5 channels on the 1985 tv ! the hotel was a maze, full of stairs and corridors, very clean, the personnel, nice and friendly. Overall, i would come back. ",4,2012,09,26
229,Very low budget .. Terribly noisy at night,"Stayed 4 nights .. Reviews were fine .. Very disappointed . Located in centre of Dublin in Georgian style all looked fine .. To be honest on the surface the hotel is cute . Staff brilliant .. Reception excellent .. It's really let down by noise from road and pedestrian crossing outside .. We had double glazing but didnt realise sash windows supplementing them were open .. And on last night closed .. Still
Pretty noisy .. But just about bearable . Bar musty in morning for breakfast .. Stairs creaky .. More noise .. Breakfast itself v good .. Loads of dust on skirting boards ..And high level boardings at the lift ..  Car park .. Kamakazie .. Limited .. All over the place and 10 euro a night .. Not cheap for the state of it .. If the place was quieter .. Cleaner .. Or if I was from downtown new York .. Would stay again .. But it's a no from me .. ",2,2012,09,24
229,"Clean, convenient and value for money.","I stayed here with my family for 2 nights in August and we had a great time. The hotel itself isn't somewhere we would want to stay for more than 3-4 nights but it did the job. The staff were friendly, the location is convenient to the main high street and the rooms were clean. 
If your looking for luxury this isn't for you but for a base whilst exploring Dublin it is perfect. 
Breakfast was great the first morning and average the second (very dry sausage/white pudding). 
I would recommend this place to my friends for a basic room that your not going to be spending a lot of time in. ",4,2012,09,24
229,"Dirty, badly maintained, discourteous staff - stop here if your are not fussy annd do not mind the outrageous E150 pn","We stayed here on the last night of a two week stay in Ireland - it left us with a bad taste after what had been a lovely two weeks, for the following reasons. 
Window held open with a wooden block 
Mouldy brown bread on window cill outside window 
Paint on top half of sash inside overlap absolutely filthy 
No fasteners on quilt cover 
Quilt escaping from bottom of cover and state of quilt inside that cover (looked old, messy and not that clean) 
Bathroom - plumbing around bath overflow not fixed and apparently leaked to room below when we had a bath 
Gap between floor tiles and bath edge - not properly sealed 
Strip between end of bath panel and wall missing tiles 
Tiles over bath - down long side not properly cleaned - laying in bath it was possible to see where something had been sprayed over the tiles and not wiped off 
Went to breakfast on Sunday morning at about 9.20 am and waited as directed at the ""wait here to be seated"" sign. 
After a long wait getting on for 10 minutes, with no sign of any staff wandered into the dining room and joined a group of people who were apparently waiting to be seated. The group gradually thinned without any tables apparently becoming available. Eventually after nearly 15 minutes a member of staff, who appeared to be nominally in charge of seating people, approached the group and requested someone to prepare a table for the next group. After being advised that the group were not all together she said they would try to sort something. At this point decided had waited long enough and advised were giving up the idea of breakfast - at this point the waitress muttered "" some people have no patience"". She was advised that it was not a question of patience but after waiting at the ""wait to be seated"" sign for nearly 10 minutes without seeing any staff members and then a further 5 minutes through in the actual dining room it was not worth waiting any longer. She then commented that you can see how busy we are what do you expect? A complaint was registered with the reception desk. No response has been received from the Hotel despite leaving a list similar to that above on departure. 
Using the shower on the Sunday morning the water temperature fluctuated excessively (between cold to scalding and back again without any adjustment being made by the user) whilst it was being used. 
Given the above we feel that the room was over priced. We have stayed at the Jury's Inn hotel in the West End of London, that was newer, clean and better appointed for less and we were able to eat breakfast!",1,2012,09,23
229,Overpriced - good location - tired,Here on business - good location - complete rip off at €180 per night.  It is a few hotels that have been merged together in an old Georgian building.  It is old fashioned and all the fittings including the small bathroom are very tired.  They were very busy and the checking staff throughout we're pretty grumpy.  The room was large and had high ceilings with a feature fireplace but a tiny tv and very old fashioned furnishings.  Free wireless Internet worked fine but I would never choose to stay here again on business.  Feeding off tour groups...,2,2012,09,22
229,Stay in Dublin,"The hotel is in a great location with easy airport & city access,(walking or by bus) very helpful staff. Rooms were clean. The only weak point were the thin walls--you could hear your neighbours talking. There was live music at the weekend with a fun atmosphere.",4,2012,09,21
229,good situation,"A good situation near the O`Connel Street and Temple bar. Very quiet hotel to sleep. Good breakfast but no vegetables.
The bad thing and minus is that you must pay quite a lot when you use hotels computer and internet",3,2012,09,21
229,Dublin break,"Booked flight and hotel through Aer Lingus and found ourselves at the Castle Hotel in Gardner Row (Denmark Street).  Great vantage point just above Parnell Square at the top of O'Connell Street. Hotel very good, clean and great breakfasts, staff very helpful (24 hour desk). Airlink from Airport the whole package great value for money.",4,2012,09,20
229,Fantastic,Me and my husband stayed for three nights and couldn't fault it we would stay again staff ten out ten  really close to everything and would recommend Also close to temple bar area breakfast was ten out off ten ,5,2012,09,19

229,"good hotel, centre","it was a good hotel, very centre with just about 3 minutes by walk to the heart of the city centre. good value for money. had a quad room - very spacious! nothing to complaint about. staff was very friendly - like all dubliners. we could also book excursions through the hotel itself instead of going to information booths",3,2012,09,18
229,Cozy Georgian Charmer,"We had a lovely room, clean, bright and with large windows.  The hotel is walking distance from the city center but far enough away to avoid hearing late night revelers.  Breakfast is standard Irish and plentiful.

The staff was warm and helpful.  The only 'adventure' was the parking lot which is in in an alley behind the building.  Took 3 people to figure out how to get our cars in and out of the lot..

The manager was a lovely man who took time to make sure we were enjoying our stay and asked after us when he saw us the next day to ensure we had enjoyed his recommendations",4,2012,09,17
229,Dublin,"An excellent hotel in a very convenient location, within walking distance of the centre. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful . The rooms were comfortable and good value for money. We only had breakfast there but it was served efficiently and just about anything from the usual range of breakfast foods was on offer. would defintely use again.",4,2012,09,09
229,Cosy hotel,"Cosy hotel very close to the city centre. The staff was friendly, especially the owner of the hotel! The room was well cleaned every day and breakfast was good, though it didn't include any vegetables, for example cucumber, tomato or lettuce. 
I would definitely stay in Castle Hotel again!",4,2012,09,09
229,Dublin Trip,"My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights while visiting my son, the hotel is in a good location but finding the car park is a nightmare. The room was a fair size and clean, breakfast is a bit of a nightmeare also as it gets very busy but dont let that put you off staying.",4,2012,09,09
229,Needs a big facelift,"I wish I could give 2 and a half stars.  The staff here is utterly lovely and so helpful.  To be fair, we were here the busiest weekend in Dublin in ages--both the Gaelic Football semis and the Notre Dame-Navy football game.  Every room was booked.  However, beyond the common rooms, the hotel was in need of a deep clean and some fresh paint.  Our bathroom (in one of the large family rooms) had mold on the ceiling, and the hotel in general smelled musty.  As we walked down to breakfast each morning (food is fine), we saw a layer of dust bunnies and other trash on top of the fire door platform the floor below us.  It is not the greatest location, either--as most places to see are south of the Liffey.  A true A+ to the staff, though--for all their work getting us American football fans where we needed to go.",2,2012,09,07
229,Great location but....,"We recently stayed at the Castle Hotel with our thirtysomething son and his lady while we enjoyed Dublin for the first time.  The hotel has a good location-it is on a quiet side street not too far from the main shopping and entertainment streets.  It is a very easy walk to just about everything.  The staff on the desk were friendly and helpful.  Our room was on the 3rd floor and had two different levels of steps along the way, which must have been awfully noisy for the folks in the rooms nearby as luggage was humped up and down.  Our room was small, musty smelling and dated and was always too warm.  It was clean though and the same for the bathroom.  Our son and his lady were upgraded to a superior room and we were quite impressed with how spacious and nice it was.  All of us said that we really didn't get a good night's sleep  while we were there.  The walls and floors transmitted a lot of noise from other rooms.  My husband and I were very careful to be quiet conversationally in our room as we were able to hear all the details of conversations in other rooms....this was not the entertainment we were expecting-although it was mildly entertaining at times!  We enjoyed the breakfasts very much.  We were there when the city had an influx of 35,000 Americans in town for the Notre Dame vs Navy football game and due to that, the hotel was very busy and full...despite that, the service was pretty good in the breakfast room.  We were down in the Vaults one night for a drink and enjoyed it.  Tried to get in the next night, but it was full of folks in for the game so we didn't bother.  I realize it is difficult to retrofit a Georgian era hotel to bring it in to the twenty first century, but I can't help but think that air conditioning would not only cool down the rooms but would also act as a noise buffer to give some privacy to individual rooms.  We only had one problem with the shower, one day, when it went from comfortably warm to very cold in an instant (a good way to wake you up in the morning!) so can't fault the hotel for that.  All in all, it was a nice place to visit, once, but when we return to Dublin, which we will, we will be staying in a hotel with better soundproofing.",3,2012,09,05
229,GREAT DUBLIN BREAK!,"Just returned from a 4 day break in Dublin-great ,although as always weather could have been better.We flew Air Lingus and did the hotel booking with them.This hotel,The Castle was a 'real' find-good ,high standards ,exceptional for price and value.All the staff,with no exception were 
cheerfull,efficient and more than helpfull-this include Finn ,the owner,front of house ,housekeeping and restaurant,bar staff.We dined twice in 'The Vaults' and enjoyed the music &
the 'craig'-plus the breakfasts served here were good to keep us going though the day.All in all
this hotel  made our'holiday'-just wish we had picked the right horses running at the Curragh!!",5,2012,08,28
229,"Excellent value in a cosy, friendly atmosphere. Lovely hotel.","I stayed in the hotel on a home visit with my dad and had a wonderful time.  We had 2 single rooms which were absolutely fine, very comfy beds and clean facilities.  Perfect for purpose and the bar and reception areas great for tea and resting up.  The music in the vault bar on the Thursday night was a nice way to end our trip.  The hotel is really convieniently situated and very welcoming, the reception staff are lovely, chatty and friendly.  It has a sort of vintage, homely feel.  The only thing I would say is that I would have liked a shower cap and the coffee in the room is not as nice as a Bewleys, but these are small things compared to the bigger picture and I would definately stay here again, in fact considering an easter stay with my sister. No complaints at this hotel.",4,2012,08,27
229,A good base for a Dublin break.,"Although we had some minor niggles with the hotel we enjoyed our stay here. The hot water was erratic, the staircases were creaky,the decor is a bit tired. Having said this the upsides outweighed the downsides.A good, generally quiet location and excellent service and breakfast offered at an reasonable price left us content overall.

The hotel will not suit the fussy or those looking for modern facilities and cosmetic excellence. if you are reasonably tolerant and want good value in a character property then this hotel may suit.",4,2012,08,26
229,Horrible Place,"I can honestly tell you if I ever find myself in Dublin again, I would NEVER stay in this hotel - it was dirty, room was extremely small - bathroom was the smallest one I have ever seen and it too was dirty!  If I stayed longer than one night, I would have absolutely found my family another place to stay.  Do yourself a favor and don't stay - not worth the money..  Would NEVER stay here again!

229,In Dublin's Fair City,Excellent central location family hotel.  Classic old fashioned but excellent.  Not your Hilton.  Somewhere where you feel very much at home.  Breakfast service was more than attentive as was the general service.,4,2012,08,21
229,Lovely for couples.,"My husband and I booked a mid week special at this hotel, which included, Breakfast and an evening meal. At first glance we were disappointed with the size of the room. It was quite small, but we soon got used to it. Everything we needed was there. The staff were extremely friendly and the food was outstanding. A lovely old fashioned hotel. The hotel bar had a really lovely atmosphere. It's location was great, within walking distance of everything. Would definetly go back again as a couple. Don't know if it's really for younger children though.",4,2012,08,13
229,Wouldn't stay again!,"Brochure pics are misleading.  Windows are old and need to be held open with a block of wood. Hairdryer switch was cello taped on, TV remote was held together with parcel tape.  Public areas are tired and dusty looking.  Restaurant staff were unable to cope with breakfast customers and service was very poor - we had or breakfast eaten by the time anyone came to offer us tea/coffee inspite of asking for it when we sat down.  Shower was a disaster - it either scaled you or froze you and the head was was old and rusted looking.  More like a b&b than a hotel. Not an experience to be repeated.",2,2012,08,11
229,First trip to Ireland,"This hotel was recommended to us by our friends who travel a lot  The room was a nice standard, bathroom small to What we are used to.  But the location was great, the staff was great, the Irish music especially in the restaurant was fabulous, and the food was excellent.  My husband said the steak he had was the best he ever had.  Highly recommend.",4,2012,08,08
229,Pleasant Surprise,"We booked this very reasonably priced hotel for a short break in Dublin without any great expectation of quality and were pleasantly surprised as the staff were extremely friendly, the rooms comfortable and clean and the breakfast good quality and served by helpful staff. 

It is also well located within easy reach of the town centre and transport etc.",4,2012,08,03
229,disappointing,"stayed in this hotel late july, We arrived from the airport on the 747 bus costing 10euros return, the bus dropped us off at higher o connell street and we made our way up a slight incline to the hotel, our first impression of the hotel were a couple of guests smoking outside the main entrance blocking our entrance, we pushed our way in and were greeted by friendly staff on reception, we used the luggage room to store our cases until check in at 2pm, After receiving our keys we made our way via the small lift which was hidden around the corner of another room were people were seated, The room was a reasonable size with two twin beds but the decor was poor, the walls between rooms were very thin and we could here people snoring all night, the toilet in the bathroom was really noisy when the flush was pulled and must have disturbed other people staying there, we had to go through long corridors and steps to make our way back to the lift, We had breakfast which was served very quickly, possibly the food was precooked , we were only offered two different cereals, and their was a long line each morning to use the toaster. However we did have an evening meal at the hotel which was very nice. The hotel is quite convienient to the city and the hop on buses, The hotel needs redecorating especially in the back areas by the toilets, I would not return to this hotel if staying in dublin again, i would prefer to pay a little extra to stay in a better hotel",3,2012,08,01
229,Excellent staff. Tired hotel,"The staff on reception were friendly , helpful and welcoming.As were the girls working in the breakfast room. When booking I could find no option to upgrade to a superior room, and unfortunately when I did ask at reception they has all been taken. They did however offer me one of their larger 3 bedded rooms at no extra cost, although when we got to the room the window had been left open and the room was full of flies. As soon as I rang reception they apologised and found me another room. This was a standard room with a little extra space, because it was a corner room I think. it was clean but rather  shabby, with the smallest tv I have ever seen in a hotel and no remote. Hotel is in process of upgrading the tv's and had no spare remote.No air conditioning made the room hot and needed widow open at night, but this is rather noisy.
 Breakfast is excellent and plenty of it. Location is great with and airlink bus stop a few mins walk away. On the whole I think this was pretty good value for a hotel in a major city but jsut needs a bit of updating",4,2012,07,31
229,Castle Hotel,"The Hotel was easy to find. Take the 747 bus from the airport and the hotel is just off  O Connell St. Although we were too early to book in the room the staff were very friendly and looked after our luggage. We didn't eat their but had drinks in the bar listening to violin and guitar. Breakfast was served very quickly even though it was very busy. I would stay there again.
",4,2012,07,30
229,Great value hotel,"This hotel is excellent value for money in our opinion, the room was pretty basic but clean and had everything we needed for our 3 nights stay.the breakfast is very good with plenty of choice but get there earlier rather than later as it does get very busy.there are a lot of steps and stairs here so I don't think it would be suitable for disabled people although there is a lift(but still a lot of steps),the staff were friendly and helpful. Within easy walking distance to all the main tourist places, would I stay there again? Yes I probably would.",3,2012,07,28
229,Totally Overpriced,"Very very small room, tiny bathroom, unfriendly staff, marginal in room amenities (e.g., no tissues), filthy (and unusable) water heating device for coffee or tea and no place to plug it in anyway, door rattled.  Opened window for air, very noisy traffic.  This was sold to us as a triple and there was not even enough room for three suitcases.  If it were a 'bargain' hotel, I could 'forgive' the discomforts, but it was quite expensive!!!",2,2012,07,23
229,good hotel,This was a excellent holiday our first time in Ireland. The staff were friendly helpful and the hotel was very clean and the staff worked hard at breakfast to ensure you got served quickly and this was not an easy task due to the sizeand how busy the hotel was.,4,2012,07,23
229,"Fair service, but","The stay was ok, great location (near city centre), rather calm at nights, fair service (attentive reception personnel and tidy room service). The bathroom was clean and fairly large sized. The bed was clean and comfortable.

However I was rather less pleased with the fact, that I did receive a smokers room (although I do not smoke), and smoke from adjacent rooms (the neighbour must have been a chain smoker) permeated through the walls during my 2 weeks stay. Additionally there was no real cupboard to put my clothes in (just an old spind without any shelves - so my clothes had to remain put in my suitcase).",3,2012,07,23
229,GREAT LOCATIONS BUT QUEUES FOR BREAKFAST,this hotel was at an ideal location as it was only minutes away from the hustle and bustle of  city nightlife. Reception staff were friendly and helpful. The room we stayed in was dated and tv didnt work properly but hey we werent there to watch tv far too much to see and do.Floorboards creeky everywhere so if you are a light sleeper this not the place for you. The biggest negative was breakfast .. we queued for 15mins for a table and although there seemed to be plenty of staff only one staff member per area was allowed to take your order. Breakfast was of a good quality thou. but there are plenty of places to have that outside this hotel for 5 euros..... My biggest tip is if your flying into dublin do use the local bus its only 6 euro and the stops are all near hotels and they run every 15mins and the drivers are very helpful. Enjoy your time in dublin because we certainly did.,3,2012,07,22
229,Great hotel!,"Stayed here for a long weekend and it was really nice.  The room was clean and the staff were really nice.  We had driven down and parked our car in the car park.  due to the large numbers of people there we had to leave our car keys with reception encase it had to be moved but we later realised that all the keys were just in a basket and not even in a safe which was quite worrying when you have a new car! Breakfast time is quite manic, it’s a lucky dip if you get a free table but when you get sitting and get your breakfast ordered it is really nice.  The location of the hotel is great close to everything and really easy to get to yet far enough out that it’s not noisy. There is also complementary wi-fi which was really handy.  I would definitely stay in this hotel again as its great value for money and great location!",4,2012,07,18
229,Good central hotel,"First room we had was on the main road and rather noisy,but the room we had on our return was very good. This an old hotel but the warmth of the receptionists and bar staff was a bonus . The rooms were cosy and clean. The meals and drinks in the downstairs bar and resturant were not cheap but were of good quality. The breakfasts were good and served quickly. Would recommend this hotel.",4,2012,07,17
229,Very nice hotel,"Stayed for a long weekend Fri-Mon in March for my birthday, hotel was in a good location and easily accessible from the airport on a bus / taxi. First impressions, receptionists wasn't that welcoming or friendly, personally I think front house staff should have a bit more personality. Room was small, cosy, clean and modern. Ate in the restaurant first night, I would say a bit over priced but a nice meal. The restaurant is lacking in atmosphere, although there were some fella playing music on the corner no one seemed to be enjoting theirselves I just didnt get it really.
Breakfast was manic, no free tables, waitresses buzzing around the place, we had to share a table with a family of 4. Food was lovely though and staff were attentive. Location is ideal for sight seeing in Dublin, apart from the little niggles we would definately go back to this hotel.",4,2012,07,16
229,Good value,"A pleasant Georgian building but feeling its age. Helpful staff and an enthusiastic owner who enjoys making himself known. The trouble with travelling in a group is that you compare rooms and room 412 certainly was not on a par with the others which was a pity.
The breakfast was fine and provides a substantial start to the day. The location is perfect for a walk to the Liffey and all that Dublin has to offer. Good value I would stay there again",3,2012,07,13
229,Value for Money,"It's not your modern, soul less, super efficient central city hotel but it is good value for money.  Quiet, no street noise, old-fashioned but adequate and 5-10 minutes walk to central Dublin.  Beds comfy, clean room, standard Irish food.  A welcome Irish coffee.  Breakfast room can be a bit crowded at times but not a big problem.  Have a chat to the owner.  He's a nice guy.  I particularly liked the creaky stairs coming down to the guest sitting room.  Felt I was in a production of The Mousetrap.  I would certainly stay there again - and probably will.",4,2012,07,12
229,3 Night stay July 2012,"Hotel was comfortable and our double room was clean and had everthing that you would need for a short stay. The staff were very curtious / polite and very helpful. Only complaints we had were as follows;
1 ) Service at breakfast was poor, due to the amount of guests and the lack of numbers of staff. Although there seemed to be enough staff around, it seemed that only a couple were allowed to take orders ??
2 ) One part of the breakfast area was like a dungeon...lighting poor which proved a very dismal place to sit.
3 ) Bar area was the same...No wonder it was called the vault. Not a place to enjoy a meal or even a night cap drink .This area will not raise your spirits. Suggest a visit to town for food and drink.
4 ) Close windows at night. The incessant noise from seagulls will keep you awake.",3,2012,07,07
229,Solo Stay at Castle Hotel,"Rooms small, but very clean and comfortable
Good food in the bar and restaurant

The service was generally good, but as a single, I felt ignored in the bar and restaurant
The Castle is a bit far from ""things to see"", but if you're a good walker, it won't matter too much.",4,2012,07,05
229,1 star hotel - hotel should be SHUT DOWN!!!,"Went as a group of 6 (3 adults and 3 kids) for an overnight stay treat for the kids. Found the hotel extremely dissapointing. In rooms wallpaper was peeling off, tv remote not working and phone in bedroom would not make calls! Furniture totally outdated, no ventilation, AND windows were VERY unsutiable for family rooms as a child could EASILY fall out! Where to begin on restaurant...........dark, gloomy,musty, unhygenic, unfriendly and unhelpful staff. The staff very rude, cleaning off table and banging ware into a basin while guests were trying to enjoy their meal. Kids soft drink bottles were chipped on top AND on bottom, when asked to change staff were very rude. Drink prices were very expensive and very little variety of drinks. And now onto breakfast, staff made no attempt to clean off vacant tables and was hard to get their attention. When breakfast eventually came it consisted of 1 sausage, 1 rasher, 1piece of white pudding. SO all in all will not EVERY return to this hotel",1,2012,07,03
229,Good  Hotel,"The hotel was a good value for the price.  The quad room was large and situated in the back, so the night noise level was very quiet.  The location  was good for accessing the city by foot during the day.   It was also in close proximity for getting a bus tour.  The only considerartion is that  it is  not in a  partuicular  ""nice "" area.  We had aboslutely no problems, but I would not have felt safe on the side streets late at night.    There was a lovely cafe next door  for a traditional breakfast.  The staff was helpful and pleasant.  I would stay again.  ",3,2012,07,03
229,Quite a Pleasant Stay,"We got a room for three instead of the twin we paid for. So the room was really spacy and everything. The hotel is well-located for all major tourist attractions, which was nice - we never had to take a bus. Downside - thin walls, which was really annoying sometimes; and they don't refill tea supplies if you leave the room late. Breakfast is edible, but not something particularly tasty, plus they have actual people serving it. Despite that, I might stay there again during my next visit, as all in all it was a very good value for the money.",4,2012,07,02
229,Value for money and nice Georgian stay,"Nice, beautiful hotel(on the inside). Rooms were tidy and clean. Sheets were well kept. Room is just adequate in size and the TV was small and at a height, so you can watch it only in lying position. Breakfast was good but repetitive, but the service was very good, pleasant and swift. Overall, enjoyable experience",4,2012,07,02
229,Shocking!,"We booked this on the final day of a holiday to get to the airport early in the morning in Dublin. Staff were unenthusiastic but gave proper advice regarding parking. Of the greatest concern is there were NO security precautions- we received names and room numbers of other guests in asking for our key. There was no ventilation, except open windows. There were filthy walls,  no door view, chipped paint everywhere, mold on the bathroom ceiling, and no way to know where to go in a fire. Simply awful.",1,2012,07,01
229,"a nice,oldstylish hotell","Good location,just a few minutes walk from the city center.Nice and helpful staff. Great breakfast.The room was a bit small,but nice and clean.We thought we made a good choice.",3,2012,07,01
229,A Hostel at Hotel Prices,"The Castle Hotel has nothing horrible about it, but there was also nothing to cause me to go out of my way to ever stay there again.  Overall, I left with the impression that guests were just an annoyance to most of the staff, and that their job would be far more pleasant without us.

When I arrived, I checked in, and asked about a place to get food, as it was late and I was horribly jet lagged.  I was told to just walk down the street and see what was open.  The next day, I asked for directions and was given ones that were incorrect (and not given a map - which I received at a friend's hotel (the shelbourne hotel) from their extremely pleasant staff).  There was also a pile of dirty dishes that were left in the lounge area for over 8 hours.  (There was a young man working the desk at one point, who was quite pleasant, I don't want to push this negativity onto him)

The room was on the small side for Dublin, and the wardrobe was coming apart a bit, but it was overall quite adequate for my needs.

After leaving the hotel, I stayed in other hotels and hostels in Ireland, and I would say that it is very comparable to a private room in a mid range hostel, but at almost twice the price, and with less friendly staff.

I would stay there again if the price was halved, or if I had no other options.  Another friend of mine stayed at the grand canal hotel, where she paid less than me, and had a much nicer experience.",2,2012,06,30
229,Average,"Booked 3 nights at the end of our 12 day stay at the Castle as we had day tours booked from Dublin. Booked the large family room which was suppose to contain a double bed and two single beds. We were given a typical family room with one double and one single. When I inquired they said it was due to the computer automatically assigning the room due to the number of travelers (myself, my mother and my daughter). I know this is not true as I emailed 2 weeks prior to our trip to verify the booking and specifically asked if we were booked for the large family room. Front desk said they needed to check with the manage. Upon return from a 14 hour day trip I asked the front desk what the manager said. We only received a refund of 30 euros (10 per night) which amounted to the amount they charge for an upgraded room. On the internet that room was going for less than 300 euro for the 3 nights-we definitely were not given the refund we should have gotten. Also beware of buying the hop on/hop off bus tickets as the girl at the desk didn't even know there was a senior rate until we showed her the price twice. I won't stay here again due to the fact that I don't feel they were fair in the refund they gave.",2,2012,06,30
229,Worst hotel I have ever stayed in,"Hotel staff unfriendly, dirty dingy room not cleaned properly, broken toilet seat. Food poor staff could not have been more unhelpful. Would not expect my cat to stay in this place whole place needs a thorough clean and a new manager. Don't go there.",1,2012,06,29
229,Faulty towers!!!!!,"My fiancé and I just came back from an overnight stay in the castle hotel and to say the least it has left a lot to be desired! We arrived at 14.05 and our room wasn't ready and the receptionist told us it would be ready in 10 minutes which was fine as we had to park the car in the car park, I'd you could call it that! We drove round the corner and were buzzed in to an alley where there was another car parked also waiting to get into this car park which turned out to be a small courtyard which had about 10 car park spaces. We were then met by a young man who worked in the hotel who told us just to park behind a car which was already parked because there was no spaces and to leave him our keys and he'd move our car later if they other car which we were now blocking needed to get out! Apparently this is what the hotel does every week, so we were informed by the receptionist. With all the messing with the car it was now nearly 3 o'clock. We were then told our room was ready, so much for the 10 minute wait! We proceeded up to our room to open the door and find the bed undressed by which I mean had been slept in and the covers thrown back. Dirty towels on the bed, cans of beer in the bin and two teacups with lipstick stains and coffee still in them. By this stage I was extremely annoyed as we had just waited an hr for this room and we had also paid 199 for the room. We went back to reception and complained to which our answer was ""I'll get you another room"".  No such thing as an apology or I'm sorry for your wait or that's unexeceptable. I pressed the matter saying it wasn't good enough given that check in is at 2 and it's now 3 and also the fact that we had paid 199 for the room only to be send to a dirty room. To which she answered well we have had a busy weekend, I'll get you another room. Again no apology what so ever! That night we ordered breakfast to our room for the next morning I'm allergic to eggs so I ordered that there b no eggs on mine however that seemed to much for the staff to understand or care enough to get it right as the following morning both breakfasts had eggs! We found our room tiny and the walls paper thin so much so that at 8 am we were awoken by the couple next door having some intimate time! The ensure again was tiny it didn't have a bath just a shower. The building is very old so every stair creeks and there's a lot of corridors. The. Bar seems to b in I suppose the basement that doesn't open till 4 in the evening. The dining room consisted of about 4 small tables. All in all this hotel was awful there was clearly no communication between reception and accomadtion staff. The staff didn't seem to care if you as the customer were happy or not and the car park was a complete joke. If you want a real life faulty towers experience then I recommend this ""hotel"" for one otherwise keep away from it. ",1,2012,06,28
229,Perfect for croke park and the city centre!! But its like a maze!!!,"I got the feeling that the rooms we stayed in were in the process of getting redecorated everything was very miss-match. They definitely weren’t big rooms but were perfect for what we needed! It’s an old building so lots of character though the place is like a maze and the rooms aren’t very well sign posted! Breakfast was the weirdest set up ever!!! 5 rooms for breakfast and there still wasn’t enough tables!! 6 of us had to squeeze around a table that was really for 4!! Very simple breakfast no potato or soda bread which was odd!!! There is very limited parking - I mean like 10 spaces for the 100+ guests so you could be lucky!! We had to park on the street which wasnt the best but anyway!! All in all, this place was handy for a one night stay wouldn’t have stayed any longer than 1 night but all in all was perfect for what we needed. The staff were lovely and good craic which is always a bonus!",3,2012,06,27
229,Absolutely value for money,"This is a cosy hotel, a bit old fashioned in pleasant way. Close to everything. Parking possibility at a low extra cost. Clean and pleasant service. The breakfast nothing to boast about and a bit crowded in the morning. Music at least once a week in the evening.
We stayed there 4 nights and do not regret it in anyway.",3,2012,06,27
229,"Poor service, disappointing.","Didn't stay in this hotel but had an evening meal which was an experience! There was a party of 6, hotel was recommended to us. We arrived and were shown straight to our table in a room beyond the bar. It wasn't overly busy but we felt we were forgot about as we were the only people in this area.  We all ordered our food & drinks. 1 of the party ordered a starter, rest just main course & 2 desserts. Waited 30 mins then asked where starter was. We were told that the hold up was the steak for main course??? 10 mins later the steak was the 1st dish to arrive at the table, and I mean the 1st. It was out b4 the starter? Never known this to happen anywhere before. The lady who ordered the starter was given her main course, followed by the starter, 5 mins later. Her drink was forgot about too and arrived after the starter! Totally ridiculous!! We were able to see a funny side at the time as we were en-route to a concert but really, someone would need to take charge. Didnt seem to be any co-ordination between staff at all. Not good in this day and age when people are wanting good value & service for hard earned money!",2,2012,06,25
229,"Inexpensive, clean, good service","Stayed for a week of work in June 2012. For £50 a night you get a clean, comfortable room, good service and a tasty breakfast. It's not the height of luxury but I can't think of anywhere I've stayed that's been better for the price.",4,2012,06,22
229,"very nice, simple and comfortable hotel","Just completed a 6 day stay at the hotel ! Very nice and comfy. Clean and quiet. Prices in Dublin were a bit steep this June, so cannot complain because there wasn't a better option at the price ! Excellent location near the city centre. The hop on hop off bus leaves just a few hundred metres away.
Staff were helpful. My room was quite good and was cleaned everyday so had fresh towels and a clean bathroom every evening. Wifi coverage is best I have seen even compared to quite posh hotels - certainly a major plus for this hotel ! The daily breakfast timings and food was good. The only thing I would suggest to the management (without complaining ) is to have some variety in the day to day breakfast menu. For people like me who stay more than 2-3 days, it does become a bit monotonous. Would stay again if got a chance to visit Dublin!",5,2012,06,21
229,sylvia,"This hotel is situated near to the heart of Oconnell Street. The rooms were clean and warm - very necessary during our stay! The staff were very friendly and helpful. The bar and restaurant are in the basement and, as the lift does not go down to the basement, anyone with mobility problems may find this an issue. My room was at the back of the hotel and we slept well but my sister had a room overlooking the main road and she found this noisy at night, especially at the weekend.",4,2012,06,20
229,Lovely,"Enjoyed a three night stay at this hotel, rooms very good, food good, staff very helpful. Close to attractions yet in a quiet area so sleep not a problem.",4,2012,06,18
229,A disappointment...,On the 16th May we stayed at The Castle Hotel and were most disappointed with room being extremely noisy and if staying recommend ear plugs.  Also in need of refurbuishment.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was average.,2,2012,06,18
229,Great place to stay if you want to sight see,"We stayed here for 2 nights over half term, we arrived to good service (although the receptionist wasn't that nice to a colleague on the phone....shame) anyway everyone was nice and we were able to leave our luggage there as we were early, the hotel looked stunning on entrance. 
The room was very spacious and again it was lovely. We had a room at the front and at night it was very loud from outside from the traffic and the problem is it's so hot too we were in a catch 22 situation! So I would advise a room at the back of the hotel.
The breakfast was really nice and the staff again were very pleasent. 
If you are looking for somewhere to eat I would recommend the cafe next door 'Candy Cafe' to the hotel and for dinner the Parnell Heritage Pub (at the bottom of the hill) were both fab.
Overall I would recommend this hotel and I would stay again.",4,2012,06,10
229,Ideal base for visiting Dublin Town,"This is a great & handy place to stay in Dublin town all the local attractions are within a short walk, 5 mins walk from the airport bus stop. If you do not like road noise ask for a rear room as this is a georgian hotel with sash windows that allow a litttle road noise through, although saying this the room was great with lots of extras that make your stay comfortable, tea, coffee, hair dryer, large bed, sofa, free internet access & an amazing traditional Irish breakfast with added fruit juice, cereal or continental additions- Recommended",4,2012,06,10
229,Not what it says on the tin!,I was dissapointed with the hotel.Maybee we were unlucky in having a small room at the top of the hotel.We faced onto the street which made it noisy and had to close the window to be able to sleep.The tv was a small portable with a broken remote.Also the tiles on bathroom floor were badly cracked.Didnt match the photos on web site.Also because of the nature of the hotel too many corridors easy to get lost trying to find the room.Breakfast was ok but bit like a canteen hurried not relaxed.The staff were all very nice but I would not stay again only paid a small amount less than top hotel in Dublin.,2,2012,06,10
229,Castle Hotel central with parking,"Just back from one night in the Castle Hotel. We travelled by car so parking was essential this hotel has secure parking for 10 euros per day. Hotel is as other reviewers pointed out like a maze there are corridors, doors, steps and then some.Don't think its a suitable hotel for clients with mobility problems. We had a clean airy room which was adequite for overnight. Staff friendly and helpful all you need at the price. Would stay here again as its just a short walk to O'Connell street and all the sights.",4,2012,06,08
229,"lovely hotel, well recommended!!!","Just returned from a 3 night stay in the Castle hotel, Dublin. I would well recommend staying in this hotel. Its close enough to the sights (10min walk to Temple Bar) and sounds of Dublin, but far enough away for a quiet night sleep. The hotel room is ample, very clean and tastefully decorated.    The staff are very friendly, they cant do enough for you. My opinion, is go for it, you wont regret it!!!",4,2012,06,07
229,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed with the castle hotel hotel over the weekend for my 30th birthday. 
The staff was lovely and very helpful, couldnt do enough for you. Even had a free drink from them for my birthday which was lovely of them. 
The room was spacious with a huge king size bed. The Vaults bar was lovely for a quite drink before heading out with the irish music being played by bands (who was excellent). The breakfast was lovely as well, first mornign we had breakfast in bed, brilliant, the second and third morning went down, which was busy, but the staff went out of there way to help and make sure we had a table and the food came quickly and was really enjoyable, the right start for a day of walking and sight seeing. The Location is fantastic for shopping, temple bar the river, and bus tours. Overall the best B&B we had stayed in whilst in Dublin.  
Couldnt recommend this hotel enough.",5,2012,06,06
229,Great weekend!,More than twenty of us either stayed or visited the Castle Hotel to celebrate a 40th and 50th birthday. Family from all over England and Ireland came along and the Hotel looked after us very well. The rooms are clean and comfortable and The Vaults restaurant served lovely food. The staff were excellent and helped to make ita really good weekend - thank you!,4,2012,06,06
229,"Good Value, perfect base","Location was perfect. Walking distance of the river and you could pick up buses or trips from very near on O'connell street.
Rooms were what you'd expect of this price range. Comfortable, not spacious.
The vaults restaurant and bar were very good. We were in a large party and the menu and price were just right for mixed tastes. the bar stayed open till you wanted and the service was good. Live music was a plus.
We went for my wifes 50th birthday and her nieces 40th and to meet up with family from all over Ireland. The Hotel was flexible and tolerant of a very large group having a great time and using it as a base for both guests and residents. I would definitely go there again.",4,2012,06,05
229,The month of May at the Castle,"Our family of four adults enjoyed our stay at the Castle Hotel in Dublin.  We had a quiet, large room on the back side of the hotel, with four single beds, one double bed and a nice sized private bathroom.  We were there in the middle of May, so the weather was nice and cool.  They also included a hot Irish breakfast which we enjoyed.",4,2012,06,02
229,A Real Castle!,"The Castle Hotel is a ~ 23 Euro cab ride from the airport, or a 10 Euro return PP Airlink bus ride which drops you off about 1/2 km away (uphill from the drop off point). Front desk staff very helpful during checkin; but access to rooms is rare before about 2 PM, since cleaning staff starts @ noon. Plan on sightseeing all morning if you arrive early. But there are comfortable couches in the lobby. A secure luggage storage room is available. There are at least 2 categories of rooms: the old section, which has smaller, cozy ones; or the newer section, which have airy, larger rooms. Be prepared to walk down corridors, thru doors, and up & down stairs to find your room, although the single, small, lift will take you to the proper landing! All come with ensuite, as well as complimentary coffee/tea & biscuits and internet. Beds are comfortable; but there's no A/C, making the top floor pretty warm in summer. Complimentary breakfast is served in a former dungeon - now a dining room/bar, with either a full Irish - to order; or continental, with cold cuts, cheese, cold cereals, juices, breads & coffee/tea. More than adequate for a day of sightseeing. The International Staff is a nice touch, with people coming from all corners of the globe to improve their English. Hotel is located about 1/2 km from the Ho-Ho bus (a GREAT value for 18 Euro for a 2 day pass - and besides, it's too far to hoof it to the Guinness brewery!); and the same distance from the Moore St Mall, which has an open air fruit/veg market, as well as numerous restaurants serving International buffets for 5-6.5 Euro. In the Moore St. area are 3 supermarkets, as well as an underground mall where you may obtain Polish food from a deli and 3 more Middle-Eastern buffets (LOTS of locals partake in the culinary delights!!!). Explore this area before eating in a more expensive cafe on the main drag!!! The food, sights & sounds are unforgettable. Spouse & I (both well over 65), spent 3 nights at The Castle, and were very pleased with our choice of accommodations: the price was right; the breakfasts were very nice; the location was well away from (but within walking distance to) the more noisy cafe/bar area; the staff was very helpful & efficient; and the free internet was a bonus. Couldn't ask for more.",4,2012,05,31
229,so so,"Good location, however walls are paper thin, very noisy, can hear your neighbors, and LOTS of door slamming. There were no hinges, so heavy doors made lots of noise if other guests weren't considerate enough to shut quietly.
Staff very accommodating and breakfast was good (especially if you like beans in the morning!)",3,2012,05,28
229,Friendly and welcoming,"Staff worked very hard to ensure we felt at home, room was big, light, airy and clean with small ensuite which was fine for our 3 night stay. Cooked breakfast served at sensible time with lots of options. Good location for shopping, main tourist sites and transport links. Enjoyed a drink in the cosy basement bar, A value for money hotel which we would use again.",4,2012,05,27
229,hotelreview,"Well located good hotel, good breakfast, nice people. One day my room was not cleaned, after complaint, the receptionist (at 2100hrs) promised to have it cleaned first thing in the morning. Next day when returning  at 1400hrs it was still not done, the (same) receptionist gave a kind but silly reason.",3,2012,05,26
229,very nice hotel,"Very nice and clean hotel, good value for money.
Beautiful old mansion, which has also some disadvantages: I found the room, where I stayed in very noisy. I could very well hear what was happening on the floor above.
Above all I can recommend this hotel, because of its location, clean and nice rooms, very friendly staff. I further enjoyed a breakfast of good quality there. I never visited Ireland before but I will certainly go back and would advise this hotel to my friends.",4,2012,05,25
229,the vaults are the best part.,"this hotel is mediocre. it's not awful, but it's not glamorous. it serves its purpose - a place to sleep. i would probably stay here again because of the location, price, and the restaurant - the vaults. it's an old georgian building within walking distance to the river. i would definitely say the restaurant is the best part of the hotel. live music on the weekends was awesome. the food was really good. so if you're looking for super modern and fancy, don't book here. if you just want a bed to sleep in close to the big spots in dublin, book here.",3,2012,05,22
229,Good Location,"Stayed for 2 nights in May 2012. 

Well-located hotel. About 10 minutes walking distance to main shopping street, Henry Street; 15 minutes to Temple Bar; and 20 minutes to Trinity College. The address is listed as Great Denmark Street but it's actually on Gardiner Row. Apparently, it's easier to get directions to Great Denmark Street but it has caused some confusion. The other thing about directions is to get clear directions to your room. I couldn't find my room initially and I also encountered other lost guests. The passageways are a bit of a maze and signage is inadequate.

The staff is friendly and accommodating, helping me track lost luggage and obliging with tips and assistance. They readily changed my room when I had problems with the lock in my first room.

Wi fi connection is good in the lobby but it was not available in some of the rooms.

Breakfast was good. Full Irish breakfast and you could also help yourself to cereal etc.

Will definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2012,05,12
229,Gem in the heart of Dublin,"Stayed here before and returned for business. This hotel is excellent and somehow radiates a feeling of home. The hotel has a very interesting history and has a Georgian design. The owner is unique and loves meeting customers with a warm and welcoming ""cead mile failte"" Rooms are of a very good standard and very clean. Staff are extremely friendly with a sincere and genuine approach to making your visit really enjoyable. I enjoyed my meal in the restaurant, food was really fresh and cooked to order, service was good, bar staff more than hospitable, and the prices of the menu. very reasonable considering the fact that I was in Central Dublin. I will stay again as it's a geat location to explore Dublin, and with it's own secure car park, can't fault the hotel at all. I've read some of the reviews before staying here and would recommend this hotel should have a much higher rating. I just wish I knew about this horel before, as I have been travelling to Dublin for many years. As I mentioned it is a Gem in the heart of the city.",5,2012,05,10
229,Couldn't have been happier,"We spent three days at The Castle for our honeymoon and were impressed indeed.
 From the moment we arrived staff were friendly and helpful and couldn't do enough for us. We arrived well before check in due to flight times and our bags were locked away securely whilst we headed into the city (short walk)
 Our room was exactly as described and was clean, warm and comfortable. Though the hot water took a little while to arrive it has to be expected in a building of its size and age. When it arrived it was plenty hot! 
 Breakfast was excellent and food was delivered with speedy service during what was obviously a very busy time and choice was great. 
  The Cavern bar and restaurant in the hotels basement is well worth a visit. Again food was excellent, service good and the setting very pleasant.
 The only noise problem we found was an inconsiderate guest in the next room and no more (TV on full, being raucous in the early hours etc) That's no fault of the premises! 
 I've rated the hotel full marks for everything because it's no less than it deserves. Cost of accommodation was very reasonable, the Georgian style was fitting and to top it all off service was great. Fully recommended. ",5,2012,05,05
229,Great location and great breakfast,"My fiance and I stayed at the Castle Hotel in Dublin for three days. Our room looked exactly like the photos- it was very clean and the bed was comfortable. The room was a bit small but that was expected. The shower was also really small but the bathroom was clean and all the fixtures were modern. I've read several reviews that said the hotel was very noisy but I didn't notice that at all. The breakfast that they serve in the morning was great- everything in the full Irish breakfast was so tasty and very well cooked. The location was great, just at the top of of O-Connell street, just a few minutes walk away from the bus stop for the Airlink and Dublin Bus Tour. I thought we got a great value for our money, and if I ever go back to Dublin, I would definitely stay here, and I would recommend it to anyone.",5,2012,05,02
229,Great location for exploring Dublin,"The Castle Hotel is in an excellent spot for exploring Dublin. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. The room we had was a good size and very clean. The only issue we had was that we had to ask them to turn the heating down a couple of times ! The restaurant and bar downstairs had great food and was reasonably priced and the breakfast ... Yum ! Try the Irish sausages ..
The Hotel is only a short walk away from the main street and buses. We walked to many of the main tourist attractions and caught a sightseeing bus to the rest, it was easy.
A great hotel in a great spot !",5,2012,04,29
229,Great breafast included.!!,Fantastic hotel with fantastic staff.Good clean comfortable with the best breakfast that will keep you full all day.!!Good location for airlink bus and the hop on hop off buses.,5,2012,04,26
229,overnight stay in Dublin,Nice place - offstreet parking - great restaurant in the basement w breakfast included in the AM!,5,2012,04,23
229,Great location,"This is my third time staying at the Castle (sometimes known as Waltons!) Located at the very top of O'Connell St. it is very central. The staff is always helpful and pleasant, and I find it to be good value. This time the room I was in had a small telly with only the 4 terrestrial channels, this didn't bother me as I didn''t spend too much time in my room.  
A fine hotel with secure parking (about 7 spaces) centrally located.",3,2012,04,22
229,Lovely Historical Hotel,"Staying at this older hotel makes a change from the bland corporate hotels I tend to stay at. It was very convenient to travel around central Dublin and the staff were excellent throughout  my stay. Getting a seat at breakfast over the Easter Holiday was a challenge. However, I would be happy to use this hotel again.",4,2012,04,12
229,Good hotel to stay at in Dublin,"I travelled to Dublin with my husband and stayed in this hotel for 5 nights on a bed and breakfast basis so that we could enjoy the sights of the city.  It was very good value for money.   We found the hotel to be clean and comfortable with very friendly and helpful staff.  Ladies at reception particularly were always willing and able to answer our various questions about Dublin.  The food was very good, with a good choice for breakfast in the morning and usually very quick service.  The dining room could get very busy at breakfast but the staff coped admirably.  There was also a bar in the basement which we didn't actually use, but did enjoy a 5 course Gala dinner one evening accompanied by traditional live Irish music.  Our bedroom was very warm and comfortable, with a very comfortable bed.  The hotel retained it's older Dublin charm with old fashioned features still retained in this large terraced building.  High corniced ceilings, an old fashioned fireplace and mantelpiece in our room, as well as an old fashioned wooden wardrobe. The location of the hotel was excellent for reaching the centre of the city as we were practically there already.  Very near to O'Connell street, an Art Gallery, the beautiful memorial gardens to relax in, a theatre and many other eating places.  All in all we found this an ideal place to stay in the centre of Dublin and would thoroughly recommend it to others.",4,2012,04,12
229,Great stay,"My family and I stayed at the castle hotel over St. Patrick's day weekend.  We shared a family room (sleeps five) that was what we've come to expect, clean with a small bathroom. We had a courtyard view room so noise was not an issue. The owner, Finn, was visible in the lobby and in the basement lounge/dining room in the evening and was very friendly. 
Overall, clean rooms, hot water, good food, and good beer. No complaints. We would definitely stay here again.",4,2012,04,09
229,Good city hotel,"Nice hotel with a friendly and helpful staff. Easy for bus connection from and to airport. Within walking distance from most attractions, buses and Connolly Station.",4,2012,04,09
229,Needs updated,I was on the last two days of our trip to Ireland. we got to the hotel and two very nice girls helped us get our rooms. The rooms were very stuffy so we opened the windows. We had an old tv and in one of the other rooms they had new tv's . Rooms were small and the bathroom tub and shower were difficult to get in and out of . The beds were comfortable I expected the room to be a little noisy because we were in town. But the birds never let up. But I can honestly say that didn't bother me. It wasn't the best breakfast we had it was the worst . the service left a lot to be desired. The price was very good. Would I stay here again if I came back probably not. I would want to stay closer to town. But we still had fun and it didn't put a damper on our trip. ,3,2012,04,05
229,Noisy,"This was an ok hotel, centrally located in Dublin....within 15-20 mins walking to Temple Bar, Ha'Penny Bridge, etc.  The hotel is old and the bathroom smelled like mildew.  The biggest problem was the road noise.  Even with the window closed, you could hear people's conversations on the sidewalk at all hours of the night and cars, ambulances, etc!!!  Hard to get a decent night's sleep.  Breakfast was good and included in the price.",3,2012,04,03
229,Good experience,I stayed at the Castle Hotel for three nights and found the staff friendly and helpful. Breakfast was quite good as well (included in price). The building is old but rooms are clean and water is hot.,4,2012,04,03
229,Great spot with nice people,"Besides the paper-thin walls and very loud snoring next door (not the hotel's fault) the place was cool.  Breakfast was hearty, plentiful and efficient (if you want speedy).  Dinner at The Vaults was ok and attentive but I remember one portion being a bit small for the price.  Great staff at the front and a great location. Nice bathroom and good maid service.  I would recommend this place.",4,2012,04,03
229,Value for money,"Okay hotel. A bit tired, but clean rooms and friendly staff. Central location with walking distance to the Spire. Free wireless internet. Some of the rooms have windows looking on to a busy street, and it can sometimes be a bit noisy. And the hotel is in a old house, so everytime someone in the neighbouring rooms walks your can hear the walls and floor creak. And that was a bit annoying. But all in all a nice hotel, in a good location.",3,2012,03,29
229,All good,"Very central located hotel. Perfect if you are looking for a pleasant city break stay as it is closed to all kind of entertainments in the Irish capital. Very convenient as well for transport from and to the airport. Brilliant breakfast and tidy clean rooms. Just one ""but"", can get a bit noisy as even it is a old building the walls are very ""thin""",4,2012,03,26
229,-,"The hotel was really good in all points. The only thing i was a little desapointed was the dinner we had the friday evening for 39euros at the restaurent of th hotel. The food was good.  But they forget our dessert, that we had to ask for after 45min. And they never came to give us the coffee. In spite of this, it was a really good hotel.",5,2012,03,22
229,Nice stay,Recently spent two nights here in family room. Room was what you would expect for European hotel- smallish but functional. Location is great and staff very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was also good. Would stay here again. ,4,2012,03,20
229,Great Location,"This was my first trip outside the US & I undertook it alone. I arrived in Dublin at 5:30 am & took a taxi to the hotel *big mistake, as there's an airlink bus pickup just down the block that would have saved me 20 euros*. There was no one at reception until 8, but they did allow me to check in as soon as staff arrived. The duration of the stay was very pleasant, the staff was knowledgable and the location of the hotel allowed me easy access to all the tourist-y bits without being on a busy street. Also, as a bonus, the St Patty's Parade started just down the block. Breakfast was decent, the only problem being that the waitstaff is very rushed. Overall, I'd definetly stay again.",4,2012,03,18
229,"Fantastic location, helpful staff, lovely hotel, shame about the noise!","This hotel was ideal for my 4 night get away with my friend, the hotel was decorated nicely, rooms were spacious, beds very comfortable and food was delicious!
Only problems were the doors banging so loudly the room shook, this could be solved with door closers fitted to stop them slamming! This would stop us staying here again as the sleep was disturbed. If your a heavy sleeper however this would be fine!",4,2012,03,15
229,Nice hotel,"It was a little bit cold in the room at first, but they have hot whiskey to deal with it. Friendly and helpful staff, clean",4,2012,03,12
229,funky old charm,"We found ourselves stuck at the airport and having to spend another night in Dublin (April 2011). We were able to get a room at The Castle Hotel and couldn't have been happier. Just a short walk to the General Post Office, The Liffy River with all the pubs and restaurants just minutes away. The hotel is a Grand Old Girl, past her prime but still looking good. Plenty of charm, beautifully funky rooms and more character than you can measure. The excellent breakfast was served in an elegant dining room by one of the friendliest wait staffs I've ever met in Ireland. It is by far one of the best values in Dublin. We loved it and will stay here every year from now on during our annual Ireland trip.",4,2012,03,09
229,excellent value for money,"we arrived early in the morning.thankfully our room was ready so we were sat in a nearby cafe having breakfast by 9.the staff were very friendly and helpful.the rooms were clean.the shower was hot.the irish breakfast wasnt big but plentiful as you could have cereal,yoghurt,fruit and toast.my only problem we had was because we had got up at 2am to travel to bristol for our flights we were shattered when we fell into bed at 11 hopefully to get up refreshed for our next day-sunday.but unfortunately theres a pub opposite attached to a hotel.and the noise was unbearable when they were kicked out.i was praying it was going to rain cus i thought they might have gone home then.thankfully it was only the saturday night.all in all we had a fantastic stay there.only minutes from o connell street.and few more to temple bar-a must visit.also we took a train to howth-a fishing village where we went for a lovely walk round the coast then back to the pub next to the station for a crab sarnie and much wanted pint of smithwicks ale-lovely!",4,2012,03,07
229,"Good location, but thin walls","Thankfully I'm a fairly heavy sleeper as there seemed to be a family of about 20 thundering around above us.  Despite this, the hotel was in a great location, staff were friendly, great breakfasts made to order, Wi-Fi and parking outside.",3,2012,03,03
229,Good value for money.,"I stayed at this hotel for two nights, last week. I visit Dublin regularly and have stayed at numerous 3* hotels in Dublin, and this compares well with the best of them. The room was clean, warm and comfortable - as was the bed. A very efficient shower and sufficient, decent towels.
The hotel has been renovated since my previous visit, but they have still retained old fashioned charm rather than clinical modernity.
Staff were friendly in reception, bar and restaurant. I've had better breakfasts, but that said it was very well cooked and started the day well. It should be noted that the Castle offers a complimentary breakfast, whereas the majority of 3* hotels will charge extra. 
This is a very good, value for money 3* hotel to which I would happily return.",4,2012,02,21
229,The Castle View Hotel Dublin Ireland,"Myself,boyfriend and another couple booked this hotel over the internet. It looked stunning, there was a carpark in which you pay 10.00 per night but we didn't mind that because it looked really nice and for 84.00 a night (inc breakfast) we thought it was very reasonable. When we arrived at the hotel we were showed the car park in which we were absolutely disgusted by... it was more like an alley way, cars were parked every where in every angle, we had to park in the drive way because there was no where to go, also there was a huge pile of rubbish at the back including dirty stained mattresses which turned me right off. We had to leave our car keys in with reception (every one does) because every car is blocking another car. The rooms were ok. We went out that night and when we came home i was outside the hotel door smoking a fag i was on slightly inside the porch but i was leening out and the fella on reception came out and started giving out to me saying to move that visitors were leaving... i was there for 10mins and nobody came out in that time. Such arragants. The breakfast the following morning was really bad there was only 4 varieties of an full irish on the plate - more beans than anything else. Over all a very bad experience in this hotel would never stay here again. Left my feedback on there facebook page as i couldn't find where to leave it on their website and I wasn't even that hard on them and they blocked me from their page so therefore i want people to know about this hotel.",1,2012,02,15
229,Needs a bit more attention to detail,"This is a difficult review to write  as the hotel has good and not so good points. My husband and I stayed here for a weekend in February. We arrived early morning expecting to leave our cases and check in later but reception couldn't have been more helpful. Our room was ready and we were allowed to check in right away. The friendly receptionist gave us lots of information about the hotel and surrounding areas.The hotel is in a great location.
When we arrived at our room we were pleasantly surprised to see a four poster bed. Later in day however we realised that we had no heating in our room but once reception had been told they instantly sent an engineer and the problem was solved. Closer inspection of our room  did reveal some magnificent cobwebs and the whole of the four poster was definitely in need of a good polish.The room was by no means filthy carpets were clean as was bedlinen just a little more attention needed. That said when we did go to bed one side of the divan was broken resulting in one of us sleeping in a big hole! 
The same can be said about breakfast. when we arrived in the dining room all the waitress staff were chatting and totally ignored us for several minutes. We were unclear what to do so sat feeling a bit stupid. Having said that once we did get served they couldn't have been nicer and breakfast was hot and tasty. We just felt that someone welcoming us and explaining how things worked would have made our experience so much better.
Overall just needs a bit more attention to detail to make this a really good hotel which would mean  excellent value!",3,2012,02,12
229,vacation home base,"We had the Castle Hotel as our home base as we traveled over Ireland.  We slept in several different types of rooms during our stay.  Some were small, but over all comfortable.  the desk people were always good to help us with our many questions. we could leave our bags and come back another day to pick them up.  the food in the vault was very good.  service was excellent. we began to feel like home there.  it was also a close walking distance to many things to see.",4,2012,02,07
229,Wonderful place to stay for a great value in Dublin,"I was on a solo trip to Dublin, and this hotel was perfect for what I needed. When I booked a single room, I was expecting a shoebox size room with a teeny bed, so I was surprised at the size of the place. It was nice and roomy, with a double bed just for me! It is in a great location, walking distance to everywhere downtown. Plus, breakfast is included, and delicious. I had an early flight out my last day, so they even set up a continental breakfast extra early for me. I'll absolutely be coming back here next time I travel to Dublin!",5,2012,02,04
229,Perfect Choice,"We spent three nights here in January and could not have asked for more. The location was great, near to transport and restaurants and was located in a lovely building. Service was friendly and helpful and our room was clean and well presented and a decent size.

Included breakfast was freshly cooked and filling and the restaurant provided one of the best meals on my trip as well as live music. The hotel allowed us to leave luggage after check out and assisted us in organising transport to the airport.
Great value hotel that I would happily stay in again.",4,2012,02,03
229,Dublin trip,"We arrived at your hotel on friday 20/1/12 to a very warm welcome from the receptionist who was more than helpfull on telling us where we should and how to get there by way of public transport..
> 
Unfortunetly on the first morning when my girlfriend and i went down to breakfast we were not welcomed by the two waitrese staff downstairs. We went for breakfast at 9.30 and was met by what seemed to be very stressed staff who we did not find to be pleasant at all. We were glad to get out of the breakfast area as soon as we had breakfast, there were a lack of tables set and we were place on a table half set and we had to ask for several items so we could get on with breakfast. The hotel mention in their advertising that the hotel is renowned for its full irish breakfast, why? All we had was a small cooked breakfast of which there was nothing special about it.
> 
We were offered by the manager to have our breakfast on the second morning delivered to our bedroom of which we accepted because we did not like the idea of having to go though again what we had to endure on the first morning. Again the braekfast was average and certainly did not live up to their advert.

The bedroon was ok but the shower room was very tired and we were unable to close the shower door properly as it was broken.

Overall we were dissapointed with the hotel and certainly did not feel we were getting value for the money we had paid for the stay.",2,2012,01,23
229,OMG - Quirkey,"Overall disappointing and didn't meet our expectations compared to what we usually spend on a hotel in the UK.
Travelled as a couple for a romantic weekend and stayed 3 nights during October 2011
Despite making prior arrangements for a smoking room we didn't get one until we asked to change rooms after only 1 day because the first room was so shocking.
2nd room was OK but it did give us an insight into the total inconsistency of the rooms.
1st room - Shabby, wooden fixings not undercoated or glossed, Headboard not fixed to bed or wall, Holes in the wall where raw-plugs used to go, used soap in the shower, uneven floor which was creaky every-time anyone passed our door in the corridor.
The Food: We only stopped for breakfast and this was OK when we eventually managed to catch the eye of one of the serving staff on the 1st day. The 2nd day was better.
The Restaurant: I couldn't see any way for wheelchair access to the restaurant which is located in the basement.
The smoking area at the rear of the premises - I have seen better.
The FOH Staff - Very nice, efficient and attentive, a credit to this hotel.
Lifts: Brilliant, fast & clean.
Not good at all for wheelchairs",2,2012,01,17
229,Good value hotel in an historic setting,"A good value hotel very close to the center of Dublin with friendly staff, comfortable rooms and lounges and a nice bar and restaurant in the vaults.",4,2012,01,05
229,"Quiet location, traditional hotel...","Lovely old style hotel in a quieter part of Dublin. Reminded me of traveling with family in the early '80s. Clean and recently refurbished though - just had that old family hotel feel. Very good value for money, large rooms and a full breakfast included in our rate. Not too much in the very near vicinity, but only a short walk away. ",4,2011,12,20
229,Noise and heat made for an unpleasant stay,"We stayed in this hotel for four nights in October. The hotel is in a great location just a short walk into the city centre. Our room was large and the bed comfortable. Unfortunantly thats where the good story ends, the room was almost unbearably hot day and night. Which made for extremly uncomfortable nights. We were also disturbed by other guests who were having a very loud domestic in the early hours of the morning one night. I do understand that, thats not really a problem with the hotel but it didn't help with our experience. The other minor issue for us was the shower. The water pressure and temperature was extremly variable and the best we could hope for was to have the temperature somewhere that we could avoid being burnt.

We would not stay here again, despite the location.

The food and atmosphere down stairs was really good though.",3,2011,12,17
229,Fit for a Queen,"A great location for exploring Dublin. Old Georgian building. Antique furniture in abundance, creaky olde word staircases, framed musical prints, friendly efficient staff, excellent food at a reasonable price, complimentary Baileys with meal. Car parking on site. Good live music on the Saturday but all over by 10:30p.m. Stayed there last December 2010 and again in 2011 and will do so another time. Booked two adjacent rooms and found them warm, clean and full of charachter and charm...just like the staff. Little murmer between rooms but that is a reminder 'no man is an island'. Great venue.",4,2011,12,08
229,Fair Value,"Our family two room,three night stay at the Castle Hotel was fine.Location is very good and typical [large] Irish breakfasts were a great way to start each day.The older furniture and different small lounge areas add to the period feel of this historical establishment.
The bedrooms were fine though despite reporting my phone being out of order it remained so throughout.The only evening dinner we had was very tasty but did not compare quantitywise with breakfast and the enjoyable wine was overpriced.

In my 70 years,I have stayed at hotels all over the World but have never been required to pay in full at the outset of my stay.I did here.When I asked for my dinner bill to be charged to my room I was told that payment was required then and there.I thought that this policy was wrong and reported my views to reception staff.

Despite the negative aspects of my comments,I would happily return as it was a value for money break and the staff were friendly and welcoming.",3,2011,11,28
229,Worst hotel I've ever stayed in,"Had to pay on arrival, went to our room, smelt of stale smoke/damp & very small, requested new room which we got. Bathroom not up to standard. Shower curtain fell off repeatedly, not very clean at all. Radiator in room didn't work so room was very cold, reported to reception but wasn't fixed in our time. Remote control for television didn't work. Very dusty in general. Hotel in much need of renovation, breakfast was organised chaos, no one to show you to your table, breakfast was poor, we ate in a cafe next morning, couldn't face going through that unpleasant experience. On the plus lovely bar is the only positive thing I could say. We felt totally riped off by this hotel & definatley wouldn't reccomend it. We have also emailed the hotel stressing our complaints and we still haven't had any acknowledgement from the hotel regarding this. Very poor all round ",1,2011,11,27
229,"Clean and characterful, but noisy with poor maintenance.","Just a one night stay in this city centre hotel which really is just a four minute walk to the top of O’Connell Street. The hotel itself is a converted row of terraced Georgian houses which means you have quirks. This can be charming like the high ceilings and scattered antique furniture and furnishings or irritating, the floor boards creek beneath the carpet, there is little sound-proofing between rooms and it can be a pain to pull curtains on a 15 ft window.

Plusses – friendly, efficient staff. Good restaurant with reasonably priced meal deals, mind out though that Steak and Chips has a €5 supplement not shown on the menu given to you at check-in and a small glass of wine at €6 is not cheap, efficient if a little rushed service. On Friday and Saturday evening, they have a local trio of musicians that can belt out “Ring a Ring a Rosy” and “Fields of Athenry” with the best of them.  Good flow and temperature in shower. There were three biscuits in the coffee basket which were welcome. Checked out of hotel before full breakfast was served, continental breakfast was okay, but no more than that – the full breakfast which is served from 7am at weekends is said to be excellent, it’s not buffet though. Saw a review which said rooms were cold, but mine was absolutely fine and the radiator was on. There was a nice sofa in the room. Okay value at €64 including breakfast. Broadband in rooms was fine. Spotlessly clean.

Minuses – hairdryer in room didn’t work, but reception had a spare. Toilet fitting needed repair as it took 15 mins to refill. Shower only, no bath and the shower was pretty small. TV was old-fashioned and 12 inches. In this day and age, you expect flat screen and large. There was no curtain in the bathroom so your showering was visible to the office block opposite if you had the bathroom light on. There was masking on the window but only the bottom half. The hotel is very noisy, the floor boards creek, you can hear conversations in neighbouring rooms, you can hear noise from the street and given it is a city centre hotel, that can be annoying especially at the weekend with revellers and the constant click-click-click of a pedestrian crossing beside the hotel. The windows look  original, so no soundproofing at all. I did not sleep well there.

Overall this is, to my mind, clolser to a two star hotel than a three star, decent value, close to the centre of things, with friendly and efficient staff and a nice restaurant with good entertainment on Fri/Sat. It is however a noisy hotel and its charm is offset by the fact it is a cheap conversion of an old Georgian terrace.",2,2011,11,26
229,Good hotel Stay again,"Our two day stay in Dublin in Mid May was rewarded  by the accommodation at the Castle Hotel. The location in the city was central and we found it very easy to get to and from the hotel in the the city and also to and from the airport by public transport [bus]. Staff answered all e/mails promptly and gave us good information on the hotel. Our room was spacious, had a good comfortable bed, very clean including the ensuite and best of all virtually noise free. Breakfast was spot on. pleanty to eat and fulfilled our needs and the evening meals were also good. However, due to dining room availability and the number of patrons eating we endured a short wait in the bar, which of course  was plesant chatting to people  and few ales did not go astray. The hotel has character and even though it is a older hotel,  the character of the hotel made our stay pleasant .The staff were courteous, pleasant and very helpful and satisified our inquiried needs. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to others and definately would stay there again. Thumbs up for this one.",4,2011,11,24
229,Miss grandmother? Stay here!,"If you loved and miss you grand mother as much as me, you will love this place.

The furniture really came out of a grandmother home. I liked the place. Hotel staff was nice, location great for my taste and quiet untouristic. It is a good place to explore daily life in Dublin.

And bonus Info: hottest male room cleaner I have ever seen. Not that it says much, but in this case, it does. Smashing.",4,2011,11,22
229,Great location and friendly staff,"Stayed at the Castle hotel with friends for weekend.  Loved the quaintness of this hotel.  The staff were helpful, very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Location is ideal for walking to centre or main attractions.  Will stay again.",5,2011,11,21
229,Quirky hotel in great location,"We stayed 1 night in a family room that comfortably slept 5 of us.  It was fantastic to all be in the same room for once as usually we have to book 2 separate rooms. Everything was there that we needed and the bathroom had a bath and a separate shower, which was nice.  All the staff were extremely helpful and went out of their way to help us.  
The hotel is within easy walking distance of the city centre and attractions.  The breakfast was delicious with plenty of coffee and toast as requested.  Again the waitress was helpful and efficient.
We did not experience any problems with noise as some previous reviewers have commented on.  I would recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to return.",5,2011,11,20
229,"Good location, hotel needs updating and sound proofing!","Positives- the hotel is in a good location and is close to all the main attractions, restaurants and bars.

Negatives- the decoration is very tired and old, the rooms are in serious need of modernization. The rooms could be cleaner. The hotel is incredibly noisy, you can hear the conversations of people in the rooms next door, and you can even hear them going to the loo!",2,2011,11,19
229,Break Away,"Hi I sent my Mum and Dad to this Hotel for a break away as a present for there wedding anniversary.  They told me that it was very clean, friendly staff and lovely food.and that they would stay here again on a visit to Dublin. It is quite close to the Lewis Transport And to one of the theatres",5,2011,11,18
229,Dublin Hotel,We stayed in Dublin for only 2 days. which in my opinion was long enough. The Castle Hotel was more than adequate for our stay. Reception staff were helpful and the room was comfortable and quiet. The en suite bathroom looked like it had just been repaired and decorated. not very well. Breakfast was good and the service was very good. Overall a pleasant stay in a very nice Hotel.,4,2011,11,18
229,Overall an average hotel at a reasonable price in a good location,"Stayed here for 2 nights and it has some great points and some not so good points.

The lounge areas of the hotel are plentiful and very nice with lovely chairs and settees. The reception staff are very helpful and friendly, as are the staff in the breakfast room. Hot breakfasts are prepared quickly to order and are of good quality.
Our room was a good size for a capital city hotel and was reasonably appointed. The bathroom was clean, however the decor is looking a little tired and there is a lack of attention to detail in the maintenance - with gaps in woodwork, beading / sealant in the bathroom etc. The shower was on the verge of dangerous - feeding from the mixer tap the temperature would go from ok, to cold, to SCALDING from one second to the next. Because of this I ran a bath, but you could only do this through the shower - so it took a while. Friends in other rooms found the showers to be fine, but we overheard others complaining about the water temperature at reception - so it appeared to be a known problem.
Great location - handy for airport buses.
For the price we paid it was a reasonable place to stay, but could be better with a little work.",3,2011,11,14

229,Good Value for location,"I stayed alone in room 104 in october 2011. Two minutes walk from the top of O'Connell street. Very bland art on the wall and a shower that won't  compromise. Otherwise a very characterful room and slept well.
Breakfast was fine but the service needs to be better organised as seating is limited for the number of guests that they have there.",4,2011,10,26
229,Made very welcome by great staff.,"3 days of superb food,both breakfasts and evening meals,Will stay again but will ask for a room away from main road.(room 222 a little noisy due to traffic and late night revellers.Otherwise great stay lovely people.Comfortable rooms with nice ambience,not pretentious and great value for money.",4,2011,10,25
229,Great Stay!,"Stayed at this hotel for a very comfortable 3 nights .Recommended by parents who stayed here a few years ago. Easy to find as is on the air link bus route from airport (stop 7)
Staff v friendly allowing us to check in 4 hours early and leave our bags there on the last day when we did some more sightseeing after check out. Also gave us best directions to nearby sights. 
Breakfast was also served v quickly as we took our seats. We did not eat here in the evening.
Hotel is quirky but we enjoyed the character of the georgian building, our room was clean and bed made daily.",5,2011,10,21
229,Quirky hotel that requires an update,"Very friendly staff who work hard to make guests welcome. Room layout poor due to many corridors, steps and turns. Full Irish breakfast served on a plate assuming that you require all contents.",3,2011,10,17
229,It has its positives and its negatives,"Stayed at the Castle for six nights.  First, the positives--comfortable bed, quiet room, helpful staff.  It was nice having a bar in the hotel and it was particularly pleasant the evenings there was live music. We had no problems whatsoever with breakfast service.  Additionally, the staff will provide a continental breakfast if you have to leave before 7 a.m.  I got coffee and some wonderful brown bread toast at 6 a.m.  the day we left for the airport.  

Next the negatives--shower drainage didn't work (reported on Friday, fixed on Monday), discovered that my key worked for my friend's room, but her key didn't work for my room.  Luckily, her door had a second lock.  Mine did not.  

Location--not bad, within walking distance of the south of Liffey sights.  Excellent restaurant Le Bon Crubeen a few minutes east of spire on O'Connell Street. 

To sum it up--this is not a modern hotel by any means, so if you like the convenience of a Holiday Inn Express don't stay here.  You'll be disappointed.  But if you're flexible and get a good rate on a room go for it.",3,2011,10,16
229,This hotel could do with some refurbishment!,"We felt that the service provided was not good value for money especially during breakfast. The Irish kitchen staff had no regard or respect for the girls cleaning the tables. This was passed to the guests by the cleaning staff and we were generally ignored when looking to be seated.  The reception staff were generally polite. The accommodation in Ireland is very expensive for what you get.  Come to Scotland as you will experience much better quality for the money, and get great shopping from Glasgow and Edinburgh! ",3,2011,10,11
229,A Great Place to Stay,"We stayed at this hotel as we where flying to Abu Dahbi from Dublin and on to Australia and Back.A three night break at the beginning of the trip and three nights on the way back the staff are realy friendly and helpfull the rooms we had where realy clean and comfortable and I would highly recommend the full Irish Breakfast and theres a full selection of cerials breads and fruit juices tea and coffe its a great hotel to explore Dublin being just off O,connel Street and close to Temple Bar where you can enjoy great resturants and take in the Irish Music Pubs and Bars 
5 minuits and your in the main shopping area in the city centre we will definately stay here again as they make you feel so welcome",5,2011,10,11
229,Our 5 night stay in Dublin,"We found Castle Hotel to be clean, comfortable and the staff were very pleasant.    Breakfasts were very good with the usual options plus the full Irish Breakfast was very good.   Can't comment on other meals as the menu wasn't to my husband's taste - he likes plain food without onions and other stuff so we gave it a miss after looking at the menu.     Our bedroom had been recently re-carpeted along with the corridor and other rooms and very tastefully done  .    The only thing that we found was missing was a quiet residents lounge that we could have sat in for a couple of drinks.   The new restaurant in the basement (The Vault) had comfortable seating but it was always busy with meals being served.

The hotel is situated in an ideal position with being just 2 minutes to O'Connell Street and about 10 minutes to Grafton Street/Templebar area.    All in all, we were more than happy staying there and would consider going back if we had another trip there.",4,2011,10,02
229,Watch out when you take a shower. We alternately scalded and then frozen.,Great location. Nice staff. Old plumbing! Overall I would recommend this hotel.,2,2011,10,01
229,Castle Hotel,"Very nice older hotel. Enjoyed short stay. At top of O'Connell Street, very convenient to downtown and sights of Dublin.",4,2011,09,27
229,Errr? Uhmmm? Ok I guess!,"Stayed here with group of mature girlfriends for a birthday celebration! Rooms were average to below average! Old fashioned wallpaper and fittings, carpets in bedrooms extremely in need of replacing and windows don't seal properly! No wifi, Lots of light bulbs missing and electrical plugs in strange places! Pillows terrible! To be fair the newer side of the hotel is a good 3 star with wi fi and a hairdryer and decent tvs! So check which which wing are in carefully! Staff are pleasant and friendly! Breakfast room not for the fainthearted fussy diner! Service too quick so no time for cereals and 'tinned fruit' to digest before they bring the cooked Irish breakfast, probably a good thing as indigestion stays all day! Would probably just book room only if I had to stay again however it won't be in this century!",3,2011,09,19
229,Very enjoyable 2 nights,"Room 105 Double and a single bed - very comfortable. Sofa and TV viewing not so comfortable but room was largish and on the back overlooking the carpark so was quiet with 2 large opening windows.
Bathroom was modern with shower and WC. My wife is partially disabled and although this room was closest to reception there were still 3 stairs to climb and the breakfast room is in the basement - more stairs and no lift to basement or indeed ground floor accommodation. Would not recommend for wheelchair user. When the manager noticed my wife struggling with the stairs after breakfast she did say we should have been told that we could have had breakfast in our room for no additional charge. Breakfast by the way was an excellent full Irish Breakfast. As we left before breakfast on our last morning and received an early continental breakfast in our room. Secure carpark on site is great.
Location at the top end of O'Connell was a good location. easy walk to the Liffey and Temple Bar also  Trinity College and Grafton Road shops.
Hotel is old with creaky floors but feels comfortable and homely to return to after a days sightseeing or shopping. Staff were all very helpful including the night porter who changed all my Euro coinage into a note out of his own wallet on the morning of our departure.
Well done - great stay. Would definitely return.",4,2011,09,15
229,Great location and friendly staff,"First the positives. Great location albeit somewhat dodgy neighbourhood (not good for walking alone at night), at the top of O'Connell Street. Staff are very friendly and obliging.
Not so positives. i booked a non-smoking room and was duly given the keys to a definite 'smoking' room which still reeked of cigarettes. When I complained though, I was moved fairly quickly. My room was tiny with two single beds, a very dodgy 'lock' on the door and a window which didn't open. Decor is shabby but nice enough although odd to have pictures of France everywhere when I am sure there would be lots of Irish ones available. Bed was comfy even given the small size. i woke too late for breakfast but for an extra 4euro they brought me up a few slices of bacon and some ordinary coffee- but they were obliging enough given I had missed official breakfast time. i paid 129 euro for the night so wouldn't consider this great value for money.",3,2011,09,11
229,never again in 100 years,"If your looking for a nice quite hotel for a weekend break avoid this place like the plague, it is so noisy that sleep is impossible, me and 3 mates stayed here 2 nights and the noise from outside the hotel, i.e traffic, drunks and pubs up the road at closing time. The inside isnt much better with doors banging all through the night, never again. The rooms were o.k could do with new carpeting but the beds were clean (not that you could sleep) We had breakfast in the hotel and it was nice, the staff were very friendly and helpfull but unless you get a room at the back of the hotel dont expect any sleep",2,2011,09,11
229,soooo noisy!,"Cons: The rooms are tiny, TINY!  The window didn't close, so I was blessed with both street noise and hallway noise all night long.  Shower is like bathing in an airline bathroom, but smaller.
Pros: hotel is in a great location- bring Ambien.  The staff is wonderful.",2,2011,09,02
229,not worth the pennies,"This was such a let down of a hotel to stay in, i took my girlfriend away on our anniversary and i was seriously embarresed by the hotel. Its cheap, old and tacky, you can hear everything and everyone from surrounding rooms, breakfast service was terrible, which i though from previous comments would be fantastic, you were told to just sit and if the table wasnt ready which it wasnt we told to just join other couples, the staff looked like they definitle did not want to be there. If you want and iron and ironing board you have to go to reception yourself and collect it and pay a ten euro deposit. There were 3 staff in recpetion and no-one offered to bring it up.
They other hotels looked alot better and if decide to visit dublin again i can guarantee i will be staying well clear of this expensive lack of product hotel.",1,2011,08,30
229,Definitely be back,"This was our second time staying here, the last one being 2008. The hotel staff are very friendly and the hotel has undergone refurbishment since our last visit. 
The hotel rooms are clean and towels changed daily. Hotel ideally located for all the main attractions within Dublin. We spent most of our days out and about on the CitySightSeeing Tours and this was a ideal base.
We stayed on the bed and breakfast basis and foudn this to be adequate. We opted for a full irish everyday along with a pot of coffee. The coffee was rarely hot but think thats just an irish thing.
Overall would highly recommend and we will be returning in the future :)",5,2011,08,27
229,Good enough,"The hotel is located in a traditional Dublin house. The decor is ""aged"" but fashionable in a way. I particularly liked the old parquet floor squeaking as you walk.

Most rooms have no view, they are comfortable enough but not particularly large. The hotel is just on a mail street, close enough to the city center but still not really ""in it"": it's a good 15 mins walk to Central Dublin, unless you take a bus.

If you are driving, parking is not easy.

Good price/value overall.",3,2011,08,25
229,Full of character,"We've stayed in the Castle Hotel several times, and every room is different, particularly in the older half of the hotel, but they're all comfortable and the whole hotel has loads of character. The staff are very friendly and helpful, the location is convenient for the centre of town, the breakfasts are good and our kids love staying there. It also has a small secure car park, though it helps to bring a compact car if you're going to use it!",5,2011,08,13
229,Very Good Value,"Close enough to the city, very comfortable hotel with friendly, helpful staff.   Excellent breakfast in well set up dining area.  Bedroom comfortable, away from traffic noise.",4,2011,08,13
229,Good value for money - ideally located,"This hotel is ideally located as you are within short walking distrance from the Airlink-bus, the Hop-on-Hop-off sightseeing bus, local buses and also within comfortably walking distrance from the Temple Bar district and the main attractions on the other side of the river.  There are also plenty of local pubs, restaurants and shops in the neighbourhood. The hotel staff were very nice and serviceminded and the breakfast was very good, and included the choice of full Irish and vegetarian hot breakfast. Our room was facing the O'Connell street, which is a busy street also at nights (cars, buses and lots of happy people walking home from partying in the week-end).  Since the window was old, the noise was disturbing wether it was opened or closed.  The room itself was clean and ok, with comfortable beds and tea- and coffeemaking facilities.  The bathroom was a bit old-fashioned, but spacious, clean and with plenty of warm water.  All in all a charming hotel and I would not hesitate to stay there again, but I would then ask for a room with less noise.",4,2011,08,12
229,Great location but....,"This hotel is in a very good location for sightseeing, within easy walking distance of O'Connell Street and very close to buses. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The breakfast was a bit chaotic, too many people for the staff to cope with. They had trouble keeping up with clearing tables and resetting them but the breakfast itself was excellent with a vegetarian option. The staff here again were very friendly even though they were rushed off their feet the whole time.
Then it comes to the rooms - room 134 is to be avoided at all costs!! It is nothing like the rooms in the photos of the hotel. The door opens straight onto the bed and the window is in an alcove with a wall jutting out, making the room extremely dark. There is a small cupboard in the corner of the room which serves as a wardrobe. The door to the bathroom is very narrow, a larger person would have trouble getting in there. All the walls are at odd angles with bits of wall jutting out - but you can get used to that. The walls are so paper thin that I heard the entire phone conversation of the person in the next room. The room is also next to the housekeeper store cupboard which someone went into at 6am, and there is a very musty smell coming from the cupboard. 
The room might be OK if there were quiet people next door but we had very disturbed sleep with next doors TV on and banging of doors etc.
We didn't sample the evening meal at the hotel so can't comment on that except the price seemed a little steep.",3,2011,08,08
229,Definately come back,"We booked this hotel as a special on wotif and had not even checked it out.  We were pleasantly suprised to find this charming old terrace hotel close to the centre of town and in easy reach of everything.  The staff were most helpful and knowledgable with regard to the area and local restaurants.  We ate one evening in the hotel and it was a pub meal and service was slow but they apologised and gave us a complimentary drink.  Reception rang and booked us 2 great restaurants in town, The Church, which was great and a bistro owned by Marco Pierre White which was fantastic and just buzzing. Breakfast was hearty and tasty but seating was a bit of a problem.  Parking was a bit of a nightmare at the hotel but it did not detract from our stay.  Yes it was not modern but that was the whole charm of it.  we loved it and if in Dublin again will definately stay there.",4,2011,08,01
229,"Had a laugh in the bar, but restaurant service poor",Stayed here in December 2010 for a weekend in Dublin. We had a laugh singing along with the musicians in the bar. It's also not too far from the centre of Dublin. Downside was the service in the restaurant both in the evening and at breakfast. Also had problems with lack of hot water in the shower. But other guests in our party didn't have these problems. It was reasonably priced for a weekend in Dublin.,3,2011,08,01
229,Nice Budget Hotel,"Castle Hotel is a nice, comfortable hotel near the city center.  It's located across the street from the Writer's Museum and just a 10-15 minute walk from the Temple Bar area.  The Hop On Hop Off bus stop is nearby as well.  We had the family room on the first floor-  very roomy with a large bathroom and great view of the Abbey Church.  A little street noise, but to be expected when you're room faces the street.  Clean, comfortable beds and nice to have a hot pot in the room with selection of tea and coffee.  Yes, the hotel has kind of a shabby chic decor, but everything is clean, and I found it rather charming.  Free wi-fi is a plus, though the computer in the lobby has a charge for it's use.  Didn't try the restaurant as it seemed pricy to us; try dinner at Flanagan's just down the road- excellent food and great service at a reasonable cost.  The breakfast was good, I'm vegetarian, so it was nice that they offered a vegetarian breakfast.  Small selection of cereals, yogurts and fresh fruit available as well.  The breakfast room did seem to be bustling every time we were there, but always received friendly service from the wait staff.  Just go in, find a table and sit down.  Don't be afraid to wave down one of the staff if no one comes right away.  They are very busy, but very nice and helpful.  Reception staff were always friendly and helpful.  Overall, a great stay at a comfortable hotel for a great price.",4,2011,07,27
229,never again,"very friendly staff,  and nice breakfast unfortunately it goes downhill after that,  there was a musty smell throughout the hotel, when we were getting dressed to go out in the evening the shower door fell off and as we had'nt time to complain we just managed without the door. when we returned later that night there was a smell of vomit and disinfectant. In the morning there were no lights in the breakfast room so we ate by candle light.  When we returned to the room to collect our luggage I noticed a dead bed bug in the bed, we got out or there a.s.a.p.",2,2011,07,24
229,we loved it,"well with in walking distance of the city centre. shopping and temple bar area. rooms well presented and equipped. staff friendly and helpful, but could do with staff greeting guest at breakfast to direct them to a table rather than guest just standing there not knowing what to do.",4,2011,07,18
229,First-class service,"I was in Dublin for a week working, and my first night I found my room noisy - it was a warm night and the windows were open. I asked the next morning if I could be moved and the staff couldn't have been more helpful; while I was out they moved my belongings to a perfect room, a better one than I'd originally had (a double) at no extra cost. The way they dealt with a (small) problem is a very good sign, I think; and i also liked the way the hotelier came round and introduced himself over breakfast. A welcome and unexpected personal touch for such a busy hotel.
Oh - great location too.",5,2011,07,15
229,"The buildings may be Georgian, but the room is furnished in early cast-offs.","Before booking a room for 3 at the Castle, I read a number of glowing reviews and some of the negative reviews, then decided to chance it.  My mistake.  There is no parking at the lobby entrance and the offstreet parking is impossible to find without staff directions.  The lobby was full, with staff trying to be heard over a staff member on the telephone who seemed convinced that louder was clearer.  Once we got the cars squared away and found our rooms (it's a bit of a labyrinth) I approached my room with trepidation.  Old should not mean ill-kept, which is my impression of the hotel once one leaves the shabby genteel of the lobby.  My trepidation was well-founded. The room itself is decorated in no style I can name.  The orange and yellow rectangles in the carpet play directly against the yellow stripes of the wallpaper, which themselves only serve to show off the  badly sagging plaster behind it.  The lighting is an odd mix of in-ceiling spots and a pendant covered with a dime store lamp shade.  The loveseat my wife is sitting on as I write would be at home in any basement; the wobbly three-legged table at which I'm sitting surely was found in a St. Vincent de Paul shop, along with the warped cardboard Renoir and Cezanne prints that grace(?) the walls, nicely offset by a cheap print of an Greek column in a gold-tine frame.   

Ventilation was needed from the moment I entered.  The only form of ventilation, however, is an enormous double-hung window opening out onto Denmark St., the lower half of which is now resting on the wastebasket because it will not stay up on its own.  (Need I add that the window doesn't even seal when it's down?

The bath is tiny but appears up to providing a shower and the other necessities.  The white plastic panel door to the bath is in keeping with the overall sense of cheap.

Others have raved about the breakfast, so I'm hoping to find some comfort in tomorrow morning's meal.",1,2011,07,15
229,Worst hotel ever!,The only good thing about this hotel was its location as it is near croke park however rooms are terrible staff are the most iggnorant ive ever come across in all my years of staying in hotels.We waited over an hour for our diinner and never got it they never apologised then at breakfast we were ignored 7 times before anyone took our order!we were also charged 200 euro per room which was a joke seen as the room was worth no more than 40 euro a night if even!do not stay here!!,1,2011,06,25
229,Fine place to stay,"The Castle Hotel is perfectly adequate for a nice stay in Dublin. I stayed for a week. It is an old building and a tiny bit shabby in places, but nothing that would spoil someone's stay, I don't think.
The hotel was quite busy when I was staying there, but the staff still had the time to attend to any queries or requests I had.
The room (room 104) wasn't too big, but it was clean and comfortable. If you have a lot of clothes to hang up, the wardrobe space might be a little small. The tap in the shower was marked incorrectly, so at first I thought there was no hot water, but once I figured it out, there was plenty.
The window of the room overlooked the door where people enter the hotel from the parking garage, so sometimes people would stand around talking outside, but it never happened so late as to disturb my sleep. I notice that other people are complaining about being able to hear other people talking and their TVs in adjoining rooms. That didn't happen in my case. I don't know whether this was because of the room's location or if I just had quiet neighbours, but it wasn't a problem for me.
It is located some distance from the city centre or places like Temple Bar and so on, but you can easily catch a bus or a taxi just across the street, or just take the 5 minute walk to the city centre. The location was never a problem for me.
The full Irish breakfast was very good every morning. Breakfast time can be a little hectic, but the waiting staff are friendly and don't mind if you stop them to order breakfast while they are walking through the room. There is also a large selection of joghurt, juice, cereals, fruit etc.
I didn't have a computer with me, so I can't report on the wi-fi quality. There is a communal computer in one of the lounges, but it costs one Euro to use for every eight minutes, which is a bit ridiculous. There is an internet cafe with friendly staff just at the bottom of Parnell Square that is much cheaper and has much faster internet anyway.
All in all, I would happily stay at the Castle Hotel again. It wasn't the higlight of my visit, but then again, a hotel isn't supposed to be the highlight of any trip.",4,2011,06,18
229,Quaint hotel in a bustling city,"I stayed two nighs in the Castle Hotel.  It's an old Georgian building, so you have to sacrifice some of the modern amenities in exchange for the atmosphere.  We ate at the hotel restaurant the first night.  The food was a little pricey, but very good.  The hotel owner even stopped by our table for a bit of the Blarney gab.  We greatly enjoyed the traditional Irish singers in the bar that night.",4,2011,06,16
229,Absolutely recommend this Castle Hotel,"We stayed at the Castle Hotel for our final 2 nights in Dublin. Absolutely loved it!  When we arrived we were able to check in right away. At first there was a mix-up, we were given a room with only 1 single bed and there was me and my husband. The clerk promptly moved up to a room with 2 beds.  The room was nice and big, the shower and bathroom was excellent and the beds/pillows and linens were clean, and very comfortable.

What I liked was the ""maze of corridors"" that you had to pass through in order to get to your room.  My husband actually got disorientated going through the doors and down hallways so I lead the way all the time.

There was a continental breakfast served in the dinning room located downstairs.  It had a traditional Irish Breakfast, quite a variety of breakfast items to choose from.

The front desk staff was very helpful and we were only 3 blocks from the main square of Dublin. They even ordered us a taxi cab when we were ready to depart.

I can honestly recommend this hotel if you are going to be in Dublin.",5,2011,06,13
229,"Lovely, quaint hotel.","My husband and I stayed at the Castle Hotel, Dublin from May 27, 2011 until June 9, 2011.  It is a lovely, quaint hotel and we would recommend it very highly..  From the day we arrived we received excellent service from the front desk, the housekeeping staff, the dining room staff and the pub staff.  Our room was a little small but was adequate.  Included with your room was a ""Full Irish Breakfast"" and it was excellent.  It's a great way to start your day and it held us over until dinner.  The complimentary breakfast offers a good selection and the staff gave excellent service even though at times it was very busy.  We particularly enjoyed the pub when they had entertainment. We also had two very nice dinners in the pub. It has a very cosy atmosphere and a good time was had by all who were there.  At breakfast every day we really enjoyed meeting and talking with people from all over the world and also a lovely couple from Cork.  The hotel is far enough away from the congested. noisy Temple Bar area but still within easy walking distance to everything.  We liked being north of the Liffey River because it is closer to the Jervis and Ilac Shopping Centres as well as 3 different grocery stores on Parnell St.  FYI the grocery stores carry alcohol and are very reasonably priced.  What we liked best was the complimentary breakfast and location of the hotel.  What we liked least was the size of the room.",5,2011,06,11
229,"Good hotel, Good Value, Good location","My wife and I spent 1 night here over the weekend.  We were in Dublin to visit the new football stadium and the game Ireland v Scotland.  The hotel was easy to find.  It is only a 10 to 15 minute stroll to Temple Bar.  The main shops etc are even closer.  We walked everywhere and is was easy to get to all the main places.  
The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.  Our room was clean, tidy and more than adequate for our requirements.  It was a bit of a maze to get to our room but no problems.  The breakfast was extremely busy.  We found the choice of food and quality totally acceptable.   Because of the number of guests it did seem a little chaotic.  There were staff chasing around with large bowls clearing the tables which is something I have never ever seen in any hotel I or my wife have stayed at.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay and the cost was value for money 89 euro.  We would recommend the hotel to friends.",3,2011,06,01
229,Excellent value in the heart of Dublin!,"Castle Hotel is an excellent value in the heart of Dublin!

With good internet coverage throughout the hotel and breakfast included in the price, this hotel was a great deal.  Many others attending the same conference complained about €20 internet fees and €15 breakfasts at their hotels and the distance to their accomodations.  I however got the opportunity enjoy walking distance location to St Stephens Green, Grafton Street, Temple Bar District.

The room was smaller than US standard, but for a single business traveler it was perfect.  Again, internet coverage put many US properties to shame and more than made up for the relative size of the room.",4,2011,05,31
229,Good value for money,"The Castle Hotel is a little bit outside the centre but it's only a 5 minute walk from O'Connell Street where there's a few things to see before you get to south of the river where the majority of places to see are.

The reception area is oldy-worldy but not shabby.  The reception staff are pleasant and welcoming.

The rooms are a good enough size with comfy enough beds.  This is why I've entitled this review good value for money.  Nothing is spectacular but if you're looking for that stay at the Merrion and pay the price!

Downsides were the temperature in the bedrooms - absolutely roasting!  And it was really quite cold outside.  You had to leave the windows open even overnight which proved a problem in our room as it overlooked the carpark where the staff gathered for a chat and a cigarette.  It was pretty noisy quite late into the night and then in the morning there seemed to be building work - well lots of banging and crashing anyway.

Breakfast was a little bit disorganised with tables not cleared quite as quickly as they could be and the staff perhaps not quite as friendly as they could be.  If breakfast is your favourite meal of the day perhaps this isn't the hotel for you.

The bar area was small but friendly with Guinness on draught of course.  We didn't have an evening meal in the hotel so can't comment on that.  It's quite a walk from the restaurants in Temple Bar but there's a few nearby which you might be interested in.  The Church restaurant is within walking distance but book first.",3,2011,05,30
229,Extremely disorganized service,"Overall the hotel was ok and in a good location.
Breakfast experience was awful. We had to fight for a table. The staff seemed completely lost, our table was not cleaned for around 20 min and the painstaking process took another 10 min. The quality of the food was poor. All in all the experience at breakfast made the whole experience unforgettable for the worst reasons.",3,2011,05,27
229,Never Again.....,"I'm not one to write a review but I just had too. We stayed in a room on the 3rd floor and I have to say it was one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at.

The moment we walked in the room smelt like a hospital and was really hot. Catch 22 - either wing it with the windows open and listen to nothing but street noise, or close the window and die of heat exhaustion. Even after closing the windows, it got worst as we could hear everything in the room above, yes that is right, the room above us, walking around, watching tv, building something in their room, yawning. I'm not joking it was terrible. I'm a very light sleeper so I this was hell.

The room was okay, except for the shower which would often give a spurt of hot water and burn your nads.

I would not recommend this hotel based on the noise, the rest I can live with. I know it is only a three star but you should be able to get a bit of sleep and not hear what your neighbour above is ordering for breakfast. Thumbs down unfortunately.",2,2011,05,25
229,Poor Service and poor value for money,"This was the last hotel my partner and I stayed at during our time in Ireland and unfortunately it was the worst. 
The outside,  the foyer /  check in area all looks very nice but we soon discovered that beauty was only on the outside. 
The customer service in general was poor and many of the staff seemed very stressed and not very friendly.
We organised to have an early breakfast on our day of departure which they were glad to do. But when we went down for our breakfast it wasn't until we had to leave that the waiting staff realised we where even in the breakfast room. Hence we only had the cereal and fruit that was already laid out. 
Our room was a huge disappointment , it was clean but we felt not up to the standard we had paid for. For the same price we had much much better value in another hotel in Dublin and over the rest of Ireland. 
 Our bed was definitely in need of an up grade. It was terrible, small , hard and very old and creaky .  

We did absolutely love the intimate bar area, the bar staff and food waiters they were so friendly and helpful !! AND the traditional music, those blokes were fantastic and made our nights! Our dinner there was good. 

This hotel is in a good location but unfortunately after my experience here i would not recommend staying.",2,2011,05,24
229,Fantastic place to stay,"As a family with two young children and one older teenager it is very difficult to please everyone, but the Castle Hotel certainly did.  My 19 year old commented that this is the best place we've stayed yet.   It was scrupulously clean, airy, comfortable and simply grand.  Location was great, there's a hop-on, hop-off bus stop round the corner and we opted to eat in the hotel every night because we were dying for a home-cooked meal.  Every meal we had was lovely and the live Irish music on Friday night was definitely a highlight.  We found that a lot of hotels find it difficult to configure the room for three adults and two children, but our room at the Castle was huge, with plenty of room for all of us.  Michelle at Reception couldn't do enough to welcome us and the bar staff were absolutely brilliant.  There's not many places where you get a personal welcome from the owner as you're sitting sipping your pint - so warm and genuine.  I can't speak highly enough of the whole experience, except to say we'll be back!",5,2011,05,14
229,brilliant hotel,"I cannot speak too highly of this hotel and the service given by the staff.  It is one of the best 3* hotels I have ever stayed in.  My wife was ill during our stay (nothing to do with the hotel) and the care the staff gave her was faultless.  The bar, though small, created a wonderful atmosphere with live traditional Irish music which did finish far to early but the owners were obviously thinking of the whole hotel rather than the party goers.  Please dont get the impression it was noisey - It wasn't - I just cant get enough of live Irish music

The hotel is not a modern one but is full of period charm and wonderful artifacts which will interest all who stay here. I simply adored the elegance of the whole place.  Period furniture, chandliers, historical items  fill every nook and cranny.  I particularly liked the sheet music of traditional Irish songs along the corridors to my room (I was a music teacher)

Breakfast was in 2 downstairs rooms and is a little bit ""canteenish"" in decor but the food was superb as was the serving staff - use the back room which was much less noisey.  I did like the several self stations which meant the there was absolutley no waiting to get your food.  We ate in the resturant in the evening and only just finished the ""whale"" they gave us disguised as haddock and I can eat a lot but this was verging on the ridiculous.  Everyone in our group thoroughly enjoy their meal as well as the banter with the young man who served us with a smile and a story at each visit.

Rooms were well presented but depending on where you are in the hotel, could be a bit of a route march to get to. As a result of my wife's illness we were told that we could keep the room as long as we liked on departure day which was a gret help.

Once again thanks to all of the staff in the hotel - you were all brilliant",5,2011,05,11
229,a friendly hotel with character in the perfect location,"I stayed here as part of a hen party so we were all in rooms in twos and threes. The rooms were all different but all had space and comfy beds. The breakfasts were great (cereal, yoghurt, juice, full Irish breakfast - like English breakfast but with white pudding). I have to say the whole stay was good value for money in that respect.

What was especially fantastic was the location. Apart from the fact that the hotel is full of character, it is just at the top of O'Connell Street which leads straight into the heart of Dublin. The open top city tour busses and the normal busses stop a two minute walk away if you're not up for walking that far and go everywhere.

The staff were so helpful and fun - we met the owner, Finn, on our last morning and he is the epitomy of Irish charm! I would go back to Dublin without a doubt and would definitely return to this hotel.",5,2011,04,17
229,Really enjoyed our overnight stay at the Castle,"Staff very welcoming, helpful and friendly.  Had a super meal in the small restaurant followed by live band entertainment in the bar.  Bedroom on second floor was spacious and comfortable and clean.  Lots of hot water for bath and shower.  Checkout very smooth.  Excellent location.  Breakfast was a little chaotic but food was delicious and hot and served efficiently.",5,2011,04,10
229,well located and clean,"The rooms were wide and clean and the beds were very comfortable. The ubication in the city center was perfect and the staff very nice and helpful.

The hotel is a litle old but well conserved. 

We don't like the breakfast very much, because it was beans with tomato and eggs: we are spanish!! :) However, you could ask for sausages to have with the toasts.",4,2011,04,06
229,Good hotel for City break,The hotel was conveniently situated near the top of O'Connell St. It is an old Georgian property with many features. The staff were very polite and helpful. The room on the first floor was comfortable with a sofa and of reasonable size but the bathroom was quite small and the shower took a long time to produce hot water which tended to spray everyhere. This is an old Georgian property and the windows on the first floor are not double glazed so there is quite a bit of noise from passing traffic. There was a good choice of breakfast which was more than adequate. Overall a reasonable hotel for a city break.,3,2011,03,18
229,Comfortable Hotel with character and very friendly staff.,"My room was clean and comfortable-location excellent -a few mins. walk from city centre.
Staff were extremely friendly and helpful and went out of their way to make me feel welcome. Food  was good and reasonably priced.",5,2011,03,07
229,Great hotel if you are a heavy sleeper / like it warm!,"Staff very friendly. I love the ground floor - beautiful buildings etc. Our bedroom at the back (3rd floor) was quite standard - bathroom nice.

The bed is very nice - comfortable and great - I went to bed with a very sore back and I woke up with the back gone.

The breakfast was standard - typical Irish - the breakfast room in the basement was like a hive - very busy, people coming in and out - which I really like :-)

The two drawbacks is: the room was very warm (even with the radiators off and windows open) making it difficult for us to sleep. My partner can hear people talking next door which kept him up.  Because of this, he was very tired therefore he doesn't want us to stay there again.",4,2011,02,27
229,Great location and a lovely hotel.,We have just returned from a 3  day break at Castle Hotel. We received a warm welcome .Our room on the second floor was clean and spacious.Excellent  En suite bathroom with shower .Staff were very  helpful.Lovely breakfast with plenty of choice. It was no problem for us to leave our luggage and call back at 5pm to collect it before our evening flight.Great location just a 5 minute walk to Hop on Off bus stops on O'Connell Street.15 minute walk to Temple Bar. A good value for money hotel .,4,2011,02,27
229,Disappointing and really needs a refurb!!,"Very disappointed with our 3 night stay and have been ill on my return cannot stop vomitting, rooms far too hot, had the windoow open all the time, a distinct smell of chip fat on entering the hotel, breakfast room not clean saw waitress pouring orange juice slops into teapot, also tea pots were not being washed as tea leaves or dust floating in them.  Hotel generally needs a refurbishment but it has probably been left too long now a lot of furniture needs putting on a skip, dirty and tired, even if they spent money on the dining rooms and receptions areas it would be a start.  No hot water, had one hot bath, one cold, one lukewarm, shower unuseable.",1,2011,02,15
229,Potential is there.....,"Stayed on the 1st floor of the hotel for 2 nights, Room.  Hotel looks really nice on the web site and talks of newly refurbished en suites.  We chose the hotel because it has a decent location and a competitive rate.  

Positives - Friendly welcome, good breakfast, comfortable bed.

Negatives - The walls are paper thin.  I had a conversation through the wall with our friends in the next room without raising my voice (no exaggeration).  Heard couples arguing very clearly, TV's, toilets flushing and showers.  Worst noise was the pipes ticking and creaking in the ceiling void when they heat up.  

En-Suite was as clean as could be, but has certainly not been refurbished any time recently as the web site suggests. Very dated with a missing, grotty seal around the bath, grotty silicone/putty behind the basin, the bath is installed way too high for those of you less abled,  no extractor fan, WC lid jumps up with a loud dunt when you flush (so does next doors as we kept hearing) and worst of all a lack of hot water (nothing to do with water restrictions as there was plenty cold water)  I had 1 hot shower, 1 cold shower and 1 lukewarm.   

The radiator in the Bedroom has no thermostatic valve so the room becomes very very hot.  The heating was off a lot when we were there so the room then became very cold!!  

Room was pokey and dated.  TV very small.

Should have pushed the boat out a little and found somewhere else, would not go back unless the hotel was refurbed.  Cant believe the company that owns the Atholl Palace in Pitlochry near where we live owns this hotel - they should look there for a little inspiration.......",2,2011,01,02
229,Stay well away from this hotel!!!,"I fell for the classic trick in the book ""pretty pictures"".....
As the saying ""Don't judge a book by it'sa cover"", I thought i'd stay away from your mundane standard service of Ibis or Travelodge etc. and try something new .
On the whole the hotel is presented very well on the internet, alluring the customer with it's colourfull pictures and modern style bedrooms. However, in reality it's nothing what is promised. Old interior, very poor customer service and extremley poor kept rooms. I stayed for 3 nights, and i soo wish i would have stuck to the normal Ibis or travel lodge hotels.
I had booked a single room for 3 nights, room was extremley small, with very old decor infact, the bathroom was horrible. Cracks all up the wall and an extremley filthy shower curtain. The window in the room had a mind of it's own. Once opened you needed to have the strength of an olympic boxer to shut it back. Window in the room was adjacent to a building next door. All 3 nights i heard people arguing, drunks outside and did not feel safe at all.
Was soo dissapointed with the service aswell, no helpfull friendly staff as other guests mention....
Breakfast was fine if you are a non-vegetarian. But, for vegetarians no fuss or ""special breakfast"" as the hotel advertises.
Only saving grace for this hotel was it's location on O'conell Street, apart from that nothing...",1,2010,12,13
229,"Quaint, but beware of their ads and promises.","At time of booking and through Email, requested a Handicapped equipped, No Smoking room.  Was assured that I could be accomodated in these respects.  Upon arrival was given a room that had no facilities for a handicapped person.  Was offered other rooms, but they also were not equipped for a person with limitations.  Was never shown to the rooms, we had to find our way to each and ended in making do with one.

We had to ask for the heat to be turned on each day.  It was turned off each morning for some reason.  The heating did not warm the room and we had to ask for a portable heater to get the room temprature into the low 60's.  The huge Georgian style windows allowed constant drafts and even shutting the drapes over the windows did not offer much improvement.  

The draft from the bathroom window was so strong it would flap the curtain 3 to 4 inches up from the window.  In order to use the shower safely, I had to place my walker in the shower stall, lock the wheels, hold on with one hand while I washed with the other.

As this time of year was a slow period for the hotel, we were allowed to check in early, one nice thing about our stay.  Our trip was to celebrate our  Thirtieth Wedding Anniversary.  The accomodations really let us down.

The only parts of our stay in the hotel that were enjoyable was the Traditional Music in the bar on Friday and Saturday evening.  The barmen were fantastic and many of the local folk we met the bar were great fun.

229,Very friendly service in a great value hotel,"We stayed in this hotel Dec 9-11. We chose the hotel over one of the bigger chain hotels as our dealings over the phone had been very friendly. We also particularly liked how the manager had responded to some of the negative feedback on this site. We hoped that our stay would be more personable than the bland chain hotel and it turned out to be just that. We arrived early on in the morning due to early flights from East Midlands, but this was no problem as our rooms were ready. We did ask to change rooms as our original was situated next to the lift and the receptionist, Michelle could not have been more helpful. We had travelled with my brother and his wife and Michelle gave us some keys to an alternative set of rooms to check out their suitability. These rooms were great and the issue was sorted in a very amicable manner. This was to set the tone of the stay, the staff were very helpful and friendly which made our first visit to Dublin all the more enjoyable. The hotel is situated at the top end of O'connell St a short walk from the airbus, tour bus, shopping, River Liffey, Temple Bar etc in fact just right. All in all a great mid priced hotel being run by people who wish you to have a good stay. Would certainly use it again",4,2010,12,13
229,"Excellent Hotel, friendly staff, excellent location","Excellent hotel, the staff were all very friendly, great entertainment in the bar on an evening, breakfast is lovely and again staff great - very obliging. Excellent value for money.",5,2010,12,13
229,Staff great outside traffic noise terrible!!,"Spent three nights 03/12 to 06/12.  Main concern was the lack of sleep due to traffic noise buses run all night and hotel right on busy cross roads. Had room 221 bedroom not badly kitted out for a medium ranking hotel, well heated, needed it in -5c weather, however bathroom stone cold, no heating at all in there, hot water ran out sometimes Sunday morning, put this down to numbers of people staying.  Great breakfast all you could ask for, full irish and all the trimmings.   Would stay again but only with inside rooms.",3,2010,12,07
229,choose your room,stayed here for a weekend the hotel was clean and the breakfast was good. the first night of our stay was in room317 overlooking the main road . the result was the worst nights sleep we have ever had the traffic noise was relentless . i hate complaining but felt i had to exchange rooms this was done by a very helpful receptionist the new room 102 was much better . we enjoyed dublin in spite of the snow and would stay here again provided it was room 102 !,4,2010,11,30
229,Great hotel in the heart of Dublin.,I recently stayed here for a weekend and would go back in a heartbeat. The staff where great and a gent called Jim who served me was more than helpful and very friendly. The live traditional Irish music on the weekend was great and a must see. A real Irish experience in the heart of the city.,5,2010,11,28
229,A great stay,"Just arrived home after 4 nights at the Castle Hotel. Our room was on the 1st floor, was a lovely large and warm  room  overlooking the court yard. We didnt hear any noise at night. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. The breakfast was great and served as you liked it.  Hotel was 5 mins walk to the city centre so a great location",4,2010,11,24
229,Enjoyable Stay,We stayed for a Tuesday night in a very pleasant refurbished room on the 3rd floor-- it overlooked the courtyard & we had absolutely no noise.We found the staff helpful & the breakfast excellent---quick service & a table was available immediately. The great location is a bonus. We would certainly  stay here again as we also loved the older character features of the  building.,4,2010,11,11
229,nice place,"Stayed here three nights recently.  The room was fantastic, the only mark against it was being on the central courtyard.  It got a bit loud on a Saturday evening, and the noise echoes a lot.  Still, it was reasonably quiet by 10pm, and wasn't an issue either of the following evenings.  The service was friendly and very helpful, and the morning full breakfast was consistently excellent.  The location is great, just a short walk to O'Connell Street, and it never took long to get to any of the local attractions.  I'll stay here again.",5,2010,11,08
229,Don't Stay Here,"This hotel was absolutely terrible.  Don't waste your money staying here.  Myself and my husband stayed here for one night in October and it was an awful experience.  The sheets on the bed were filthy, the beds were very old and dirty.  The walls are paper thin, the bathroom was disgusting and the hotel obviously hasn't been revamped in at least 30 years (not exagerrating!).  The pokey breakfast room was closterphobic, food horrible too. There's a much nicer hotel around the corner called cassidys for the same price we paid €89.00 per room per night.",1,2010,11,07
229,Could be better...,"I have recently stayed at The Castle Hotel (aka The Waltons) which I found to be a great base for exploring Dublin, well decorated / maintained with nice rooms. Some things that made my stay less enjoyable were...
Our room over looked the smoking area of the bar so there was constant noise of people talking / laughing / shouting under the window which made getting a good nights sleep difficult.
Breakfast was a complete free for all - the basement type room was packed to the brim each morning of our stay so we had to wait for a table each morning with the queue backing up the staircase and out into reception. The Irish Breakfast was edible but by no means good quality. The bacon was very over cooked and leathery as were the sausages. The juices were cheap as was the cereal and tea and coffee (too bitter to drink). The staff were totally rushed off their feet and under pressure, which showed with in the service. I also saw a member of staff eating cornflakes out of the box with her hand - not a good look!
On the first night we were served by a very pleasant young boy in the bar who did the best Irish Coffee we have ever tasted so wanting a repeat experience we returned to the bar later on in the stay to be served by Jim(?), an older, possibly more senior member of the team? The coffee he served was luke warm, in a glass a quarter of the size compared to the previous time and no whiskey AT ALL to taste. When we challenged him about this he free poured whiskey into our glasses, which obviously tasted horrible, as it wasn’t made correctly. The Bill for 3 Irish Coffees was 19e - not very good value for money. This in its self wouldn’t have been so bad but the argumentative attitude of ""Jim"" made the whole things much worse. 
The Reception staff were friendly if not a little over worked.",3,2010,11,05
229,"Nice hotel, good location","I stayed at Castle Hotel September 26-29 2010 with a bunch of friends from college.  It was a good match for our group.  We were split between three rooms, 201 and 202 on the second floor and 308 on the third.  I was in 201, a corner room that seemed to be the smallest of the three.  This was not a big deal as we had no intention of spending a lot of time in our rooms.  I can definitely reinforce other reviews of the walls being paper thin -- it wasn't really an issue since we were next door to friends, but this could understandably be annoying under different circumstances.  In general the staff were very friendly and helpful, with the exception of one woman who yapped away on her cell phone while we stood by the front desk waiting to ask her a question (we eventually gave up and ventured out).  I could see how the dining room could get very crowded during the busy season, however this was never really an issue for us.  The Irish breakfast (vegetarian breakfast in my case) was a great way to start the day.  We were pleasantly surprised to find the hotel has an elevator, which made our lives a lot easier on check in and check out days.  The location is good, right off of O'Connell Street, across from the Garden of Remembrance, but just far away enough from most of the action to feel a little secluded.  I don't understand the other reviews that claim this place is noisy, maybe we were just in town during the off-season but the surroundings were very quiet.  It was a bit of a walk to the main destinations throughout town, but it was a nice way to see the city and we also made good use of the hop on/hop off bus.  Thumbs up!",4,2010,11,04
229,Good clean hotel friendly staff,"When we arrived for our three day stay the reception staff were very helpful, happy and polite. The room was clean and comfortable and tea/coffee, kettle were there for us. 
The Hotel is in a brilliant location, just above O'Connell Street, for getting into the city, just 2/3 minutes walk.
Breakfast was good, plenty of choice and although the hotel was very busy, the waiting staff did an excellent job coping with the volume of guests arriving for the meal.
Papers were available in recption to read or take to your room 
The receptionist was happy to order a taxi for us the night before we were due to leave and it arrived on time.
We would recommend the Castle Hotel to anyone wanting a short break or even a longer stay in the fantastic city of Dublin.",5,2010,10,10
229,Got Cha!,I checked in with out a reservation on a trip to Dublin. We were tired from traveling and asked for a room for 4 nights. The reception gave me a price and I paid with my credit card. On the 4th night as we returned from sight seeing the reception explained that we had not paid for the 4th night and there was some confusion regarding our staying that night. She told us she would look into this and we could go ahead and stay and not to worry. In the morning as we were checking out the repception (a guy this time) informed us that there was another charge and that we needed to pay it. I paid it to avoid an incident and was told that I could talk to the manager about it.  I have and and informed that there will be no refund and I actually found another charge on my credit card statement. this was an ambush to get another charge outa me and I recomend that no one stay at this hotel. btw it was also noisy and not close to anything.,1,2010,10,08
229,Nice place to stay,"Found this hotel at a good price with breakfast.  Easy walk to all areas of Dublin being only 10 mins walk down O'Connell Street. Reception very attractive and was given room 324. Up the lift and what seemed a maze of corriors.  Be warned that The Castle and The Walton are the same hotel . The room we had was in the Walton side but to put my mind to rest did ask to see a room in the Castle and although slightly larger could not see the room offered any better. The room we had was in the back of the hotel, so no view, but quite.  Twin beds, flat screen tv, tea/coffee and a good bathroom. All looked like it was new. Towels are on the small side but shampoo and shower gel availabel. 
Breakfast is a cooked breaky with eggs cooked hoe you like. and toast, juice with ceral all very nicely cooked . 
Nice touch was that the owner came to speak to everyone in the dinning room.
Can leave you luggage  at the hotel if you have a late flight. 
All in all would return and hope you enjoy your stay in Dublin.",3,2010,10,05
229,"Fantastic place to stay, will return for longer next time!","Came across this place by accident but very glad we did.  Came to Dublin day earlier than planned to stay at neighbouring hotel we were booked into the next night but football game in city meant all rooms were full so in desperation tried the Castle.  They had one twin room left and luckily space in the very small car park for our motorbike. The location is great - just at top of O'Connell Street and the main tourist areas.
The staff were fantastic, the room cosy, spotless and comfortable.  The bathroom clean with plenty of hot water and fluffy towels and the hotel both quaint and grand at the same time.
The rooms had high ceilings and huge sash windows all the furniture and decor was in keeping with a period hotel but also had a contemporary feel.  In the corridors there were display cabinets containing some interesting peices which were facinating to look at.  I'm not sure if this hotel would appeal to the young or trendy but if you are looking for a great hotel with courteous staff, delicious food and comfy beds in a central location stay here - much better than Cassidys hotel, situated up the road, where we spent our next night.",5,2010,09,22
229,Good base for exploring Dublin,"We stayed at the Castle Hotel for 2 nights in early September 2010.
Our room was a smaller double overlooking Frederick/O'Connell St, 
but up a few floors so the street noise wasn't a problem.   The furnishings 
were simple but comfortable.  No problems with the bed in our room.
None of the windows had screens or child guards, but that turned to be
the case in all the hotels we stayed at in Ireland.  We weren't bothered by insects and we don't have kids, but parents with small children may want to keep that in mind.
The location was good for our purposes.  About a 5 - 10 minute walk to
the shops and the Dublin tourism office on O'Connell St, and another 5
or so to the Temple Bar area.
The included breakfast was the only meal we had at the Castle, but it
was very good. The service was friendly and efficient, and there were
no problems finding a place to sit.",4,2010,09,17
229,Good value for money and great staff,"This hotel was not expensive but the quality is a bit vairable. All the staff were fantastic, efficient, welcoming, and friendly - reception,bar,waiting and cleaners. The room was a good size, bed comforatable and clean enough, but a bit tiered. The bathroom really does need updating and although clean the sealant was moaldy, there were tiles missing around the edge of the floor and the showers need ugrading. Bar was great opened till you want to leave, and the live music was good. The public areas are well kept and nicley in keeping with the building, just someone would water the plant at the entrace a little more often. Breakfast was fine and quick, but the evening meals were not so impressive. Descent position. All in all its good value for money.",3,2010,09,16
229,Highly recommended,"The location is very convenient and most of the main attractions are within walking distance. The room was small, but comfortable and the housekeeping is excellent. The breakfast service was very good and quick, and the staff was very friendly, despite being extremely busy. They also served breakfast before regular time for some of us that had an early tour.
I highly recommend this hotel.",4,2010,09,12
229,Had to wear flip flops in the shower,"This was the first hotel on my husband and mine honeymoon to ireland.  I was initially very excited to start our trip in dublin, but after a long flight all I wanted to do was take a shower.  When we arrived at the hotel, only an hour earlier than the check in of 1430, they wouldn't let us check in early.  Well not big its one hour, well I should have known then, because I really do not believe they even cleaned our room.  Well we both were taking a quick nap and then maid came right in saying she needed too clean, but since we were already there, ""no big"".  I went to take a shower, and was very grossed out by the bathroom.  The grout was completely black, and the shower curtain had mold on it.  I seriously wore flip flops in the shower because it was someone nasty.  Also, if in room 132 the hallway smelled of pot the entire 2 nights we were there, a very distinctive smell that is hard to miss. Also, this hotel is old and.not in a good way. On the plus side the breakfast was good, they had a good selection top choose from.  Location is ok, about a 10 or 15 minute walk top temple bar, and the attractions.",3,2010,09,01
229,A Lick of Paint!!,"Both myself and my husband stayed at this hotel for three nights to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  We picked it mainly due to location and wanted somewhere traditional, rather than an impersonal hotel chain.

The reception staff were warm & welcoming on arrival and despite our early check-in, were able to accommodate us straight away with a room.  The original Georgian features were inspiring and the hotel has a definite homely feel about it.  However, we did feel as if the hotel could do with a lick of paint as parts of the hotel looked tired and dinghy.  Our room was nice enough, with a very clean bathroom, but it was dusty & grubby in places.

Breakfast was very tasty and the service on our first two mornings was exceptional; very quick & well-presented.  However, on our last morning, it was rather chaotic, but think it was simply the rush of Bank Holiday travellers booking rooms at the hotel.

All the staff were very friendly and helpful and it's a shame that I have to write anything negative about this hotel, but think a little extra TLC is needed to stop the hotel from looking neglected and tired.",3,2010,08,29
229,A soft spot for this place,"Great room, great receptionists, lift to rooms, clean and well run. A wee bit far from the centre of Dublin, but the walk will do you good. Firthermore, I'm embarrassed to say, its the only hotel I've stayed at in last 20 years where I could smoke in the room. (I dont even do that at home!)
Breakfast was a bit of a rush with waitresses running around trying to serve everyone. (And succeeding of course). The food was good and though I had mostly toast the plates looked full and tasty too.
What endeared me to Castle Hotel most was the fact that not only was the Wifi service excellent, fast, efficient and free of charge, but the hotel, as policy, blocks websites that are considered racist. One, a particularly virulent antsemitic site was unavailable to residents! I thought it a brave and especially human move on the part of the hotel and it certainly reflects positively on the management. Good for you at Castle Hotel!",4,2010,08,29
229,trevor is the main man!!!!!!!,"we had a wonderful 4 days in the castle hotel, the girls on reception were brill told us everthing we needed to know . Trevor the bar man is so intelectual he knew everything ,,,apart from the zoo that only had a dog lol ohhh and he likes M and M'S that we give him for his kide but he ate them all,,,,,hope Mrs Trevor reads this brill time hotel grat . thank you for nice time",5,2010,08,28
229,More like a B&B,"Firstly, some confusion with the Castle Hotel and the Walton Hotel which seemed to be physicaly linked and it looked like we were put in the Walton part which didn't look anything like the rooms shown on the website.  The family room was spacious, clean and comfortable with a small bathroom.  The shower was difficult to use as it was run off the bath taps.  The breakfast was nice and the staff friendly and helpful.  The receptionist(s) could certainly do with a course in customer care, just checking in felt like you were pissing them off!  Overall this is more like a B&B and really not hotel standard at all.",2,2010,08,25
229,Great hotel - highly recommended,"The hotel ticks all the right boxes - it's clean, comfortable, has a high level of service, and for a Dublin city hotel it's good value for money.  Cleanliness - Nothing to complain here, hotel was very clean.  Comfort - Again nothing to complain - beds comfortable.  Service - Service was great - On our last day in Dublin, we had an early flight and asked the hotel if we could have breakfast early - we were offered a continental breakfast with cereal and toast at 4am which is not something you would get from any hotel - I was pleasantly surprised. Location - The location is quite good too - a couple of minutes walk from O'Connell Street and a 15-minute walk to Grafton Street.",5,2010,08,20
229,Worst Nights Sleep I've Ever Had,"This hotel was great. I have nothing to complain about apart from the beds - which is usually the most important part of a hotel. 
It's a shame really, but my mattress had collapsed springs where you could see (and feel!) an imprint where other peoples bodies had been laying for the past 30 years. It is beyond me why they couldn't just buy some new beds.
The staff were extremely helpful and the breakfast was yummy, honestly though, i would definitely not recommend this hotel if you were hoping for a good night sleep. I am not normally a fussy sleeper but this was beyond a joke.",3,2010,07,26
229,the castle hotel made our weekend,"There were two of us sharing a twin room at this hotel for 3days in which we found the room most comfortable, spacious and well equiped, all the staff were very helpful, friendly and efficent. The breakfast was very tasty, well presented and fulfilling. 24hour reception enabled us 2 come and go as we pleased. Most city centre hotels do not have the friendly atmosphere of the castle, were we got to meet the owner Fionn who was very chatty and full of irish charm, we would not hesitate to go back 2 the castle again, and the sooner the better.",5,2010,07,26
229,Good serivce and value for money,Our room was very spacious and clean. The service in the breakfast room was very friendly and efficient - not always what you expect from larger hotels. Recpetion staff freindly and helpful when asked. The hotel generally was good value for money and well located (out of the town centre but within easy walking distance).,4,2010,07,22
229,What a warm welcome.  If only all hotels were as pleasant.,"We arrived at breakfast time, much earlier than we should have, after an early flight but received a very warm welcome nonetheless.  Our luggage was safely stowed, allowing us freedom to explore until we went back to check-in later on.  Our room was very clean with fresh towels/toiletries/tea/coffee daily.  We stayed on a B&B basis as we like to do our own thing most of the time.  There was plenty of choice for breakfast and we knew that once fed, we wouldn't have to worry about hunger pangs during the day.  The staff we came across were all very friendly and obviously took a lot of pride in their own particular area of expertise - Receptionists/Housekeeping/Dining Room Staff.  Although close to O'Connell Street, the hotel is off the main drag and while we were there it was very hot and we kept our windows open the whole time, we had no disturbance whatsoever from traffic noise.  Our bed was very comfortable and the shower a real pleasure of a morning despite being a bath fan myself.  It cost us in total £320 GBP for four nights B&B which I think is very competitive for a European Capital.  Dublin itself is very walkable and we found that from our base at The Castle Hotel, we were able to do all our city sightseeing on foot, only needing transport on the days we visited The Curragh and The Titianic Exhibition at City West Hotel.  A very pleasant experience all round.",5,2010,06,11
229,Lovely hotel with five star service,"My friends and I hadn't booked a hotel when we came to Dublin - we chanced it and were able to stay for one of our two nights in Dublin at the Castle Hotel.  The reception staff were fantastic - Louise, in particular, who apologised for not having rooms for our 2nd night (but said that she would check in the morning just in case) and sorted out rooms with such speed and with a smile - despite the three of us coming in to request a room at 5pm on a Friday afternoon!   Both Louise and Gillian on reception were very accommodating and Louise also sorted me with a hair dryer as my room didn't have one.

The hotel consists of adjoining buildings which gives a lovely quirky atmosphere - the mix of normal levels and mezzanine levels makes for a fun explore (with everything well marked out so there are no wrong turns).  The rooms are well furnished.  The beds are comfortable and everything is very clean.  The only 2 tiny problems were that in my friends room they had a great skylight over the bed but no blind to cover it from the morning sun - so they had a bit of an early wake up.  Although there is parking, it's a little hard to find and I had to go and ask twice for directions -- however we got there in the end!

The cooked breakfasts were great - very filling and a typical full Irish breakfast that kept us going for hours of sight-seeing.

Louise, on reception, was also good enough to call a sister hotel the next morning when we found that there were no beds at the Castle Hotel for the Saturday night and organised 2 great bedrooms at the St George Hotel - which was close by and equally as good.",4,2010,05,22
229,Ths hotel is perfectly located and we would definitely return,"Spent two nights in this hotel with a group of friends (all female).  It had not been recommended, we chose it mainly due to location.  It was perfect for our stay.  The staff were friendly and helpful and we were made very welcome.  The rooms are clean and comfortable. The breakfast was good and the breakfast staff were very pleasant.  The location is perfect for walking around the city centre and for buses.  Dublin was one of the friendliest cities I have visited.",4,2010,05,08
229,very helpfull,"thanks to gillian for helping me cancel flight. rebook on irish ferries and move my room to one of the best in the hotel away from al the stranded teenagers. also to all the breakfast staff and the night porter from Mauritus, jim the bartender you all went the extra mile. i will be back Tom",5,2010,04,30
229,Nice Hotel,"Very convenient for O'Connell  Street,lovely Garden of Remembrance across the road, very clean, bathroom nice,lovely Georgian Hotel  reception staff not over-friendly, they seemed bored an disinterested. Had bought my netbook with me and was very disappointed that I couldnt get onto facebook as it was barred. Such a shame as I like to keep in touch with friends and family.  Breakfast nice and very quick service, staff were polite and friendly. Unusual to have to pay  as you book in.  I would stay there again, maybe next time the reception staff will have changed or had some customer care training.",4,2010,04,25
229,"location fantastic, staff brilliant","Hotel is situated 5minuets walking distance from the heart of Dublin, the walk into the city is full of things to see and do.Hotel is clean and friendly,rooms cleaned every day.  The staff go out of their way to make you feel at home and will help to direct you to where you want to go.",4,2010,04,14
229,Charming Irish Hotel - Fair Value for Money,"Summary: The Castle Hotel proved to be fairly good value for money, and while neither the most extravagant, luxurious nor most centrally located hotel, it provided us with a great base for our daytrips to the city centre. Enjoy the bar, restaurant and service, but expect minor hiccups – remember, you’re not staying at the Ritz. 

Room: The rooms were clean and comfortable, but a little worn. Do not expect the sterility and modernity of luxury branded hotels; instead enjoy the Irish charm of the furniture, décor and working fireplaces. Amenities provided were simple but practical, but a huge put-off was that the electric kettle provided was filthy.

Bar / Restaurant: This was the most enjoyable part of the hotel – an in-house bar and restaurant that provided affordable food and drinks late into the night. Be warned: this is not a ‘resident’s bar’ and if you visit during a game-day, it will be packed with rabid sports fans. For us, this was not a problem at all, and we visited this bar everyday. Food was fairly good, and drinks were always alcoholic – for those needing to kick a hangover or illness, ask the bartender (Jim) for a Hot Toddy (hint: it’s alcoholic).

Breakfast: Although it is ‘cooked to serve’, out of all the breakfasts we had in the UK, the food served here was the weakest. While it will definitely fill you up with all the trappings of a traditional Irish breakfast, it is relatively mediocre

Service: The receptionists at the lobby were generally friendly, with some better than others, but all were accommodating to our queries and requests. We met the owner and he is a charming gentlemen. However, a giant complaint by my friend was the stoppage of internet access during our final night’s stay, and the staff’s nonchalant response towards guests. 

Location: The hotel sits opposite the Writer’s Museum, which lies at the end of O’Connell Street. Although it advertises itself as city center, expect at least a ten minute walk to tourist destinations such as Trinity College and Temple Bar.",4,2010,03,24
229,Nice hotel in good location,"Stayed here on a rugby weekend in March 2010. A nice hotel in a good location, only 2 minutes walk away from O'Connell Street and about 10-12 minutes from Temple Bar. The staff were all friendly and helpful and the bar had professional musicians on Fridays and Saturdays. 

We had dinner at the hotel on one night which was fine with good service.",4,2010,03,23
229,"Excellent hotel, friendly, extremely clean and lovely breakfasts","We stayed here to celebrate my sons eighteenth birthday on St Patricks Day, the hotel was ideal for us.  Tasty and filling breakfasts, extremely clean and large room, good location for sightseeing and nightlife - not too close but within walking distance.  The staff were extremely friendly and nights in the hotel bar are certainly worth a visit, sing alongs and live music are great fun.  One of the receptionists was a little cold but she was the only one without a constant smile, even the owner Fionn had a pleasant greeting everytime we bumped into him.",4,2010,03,20
229,No chance of a peaceful nights sleep!!!,"I stayed here Sat to Mon 13-15 Mar 2010. 2 nights but slept in 3 rooms. Why? There is no soundproofing. There are partition walls between rooms 327 and 328 and the tv is postioned on the partition wall of 327. So when my neighbour came back late and put his tv I could hear it crystal clear and it woke me up. He then went to sleep and I had to get the Night Porter to open the room and turn it off. I was then moved to room 133 and whilst there was no partition wall I spent the entire night listening to toilets flush from rooms on the floor above. I complained in the morning and was put on the top floor 425 for my second and final night with a promise that rooms either side of me would be kept empty. Thankfully the room on the other side of (another) partition wall was empty but the other side was not clear and whilst they were not noisy I could hear the tolilet flushing.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO NOISE. I have spent many a night in a hotel and expect to hear some coming and going but this is the worst stay I have ever had in a hotel, which is a shame as it is nice inside and is well located.

229,Comfy,"Walton’s Hotel and the Castle Hotel are connected, with the nicer – and pricier rooms at the Castle. You enter and check in at the Castle, then pass through a series of  parlors – with a step up or two – to the former lobby of Walton’s, where there is an elevator. The rooms are fine – nothing fancy. My room had a large deep tub that was perfect for soaking the feet and warming up after a full day of walking in cold and rainy Dublin. Lots of hot water. The radiators work very well, so be careful how high you set them before going out. Since the hotel had been full the night before my arrival, I was not allowed to check in until 2PM. Understandable, but the young woman at the desk was quite curt in telling me so. First impressions do matter. Perhaps more so t .The woman who replaced her before 2PM was far friendlier.  
The location of these two hotels is perfect for arrivals/departures on the 24-hour airport bus that stops only a few blocks away.  Easy walking distance to Temple Bar, Grafton Street, but you may need to catch a bus on one of the tourist routes to reach more distant tourist sites in Dublin.
The breakfast was filling and tasty, with a choice of Irish, American, or vegetarian, or any combination of those, in addition to cereals, yogurt etc.",3,2010,01,22
229,Perfect central location with a friendly cosy feel.,"We had a lovely break at the Castle Hotel. The staff were welcoming and helpful. Friday night is live music night, which was excellent. The hotel is in a perfect location to get around Dublin as well as being quiet and cosy to go back to.",5,2010,01,13
229,What A Gem,We were delighted when a friend booked us into this hotel over Christmas. Having travelled from The United States we were tired and weary but that was no problem to the wonderful staff that gave us a great Irish welcome. Having arrived in Dublin at 6am we were delighted that our rooms were ready and we were able to have some tea and a light snack before we went to bed. That evening we had some wonderful steaks in the reataurant. It was cosy and elegant and not too noisy. The ambience was superb. As were the excellent and amazing Irish Coffees that our gracious host Jim Quinn made for us. I wish I could have packaged the Irish Coffees and brought them back to New York City. We only had time to stay for two nights before we began our tour of Ireland. Thanks to everyone at this hotel it is a true Gem. We will be back.  Alfonsus O' Connor...,4,2010,01,09
229,Excellent!!,"Had a wonderful stay @ Castle Hotel Dublin.
The hotel warm and cosy, very clean and great Irish breakfast.
Would stay at tis hotel again it is very near to the shops and Temple Bar.
I would recommend this hotel to my friends and family.",5,2010,01,04
229,Really Nice,"Was in Dublin for work and was booked into this place by the company I was working with. Truly wonderful service from staff - went out of their way to assist. Found the hotel lobby cozy, they even brought us hot-cocoa by the fire (it was freezing outside).  The rooms were basic, clean and quiet. Nothing massively fancy but very nice. Loved the music in the hotel bar on Friday night. Felt like I was really in Ireland not in a big city. Would recommend this place to anyone who wants a great place to stay while visiting the great city of Dublin.",5,2009,12,21
229,Very Nice - Recommended!!!,"We stayed there for 3 nights.  We had searched several websites for budget hotels, I found Castle to be good value for money.  The staff was helpful and polite, as the majority of the Irish people we met.  They were happy to offer us breakfast very early as we had to catch our flight, they actually suggested it before we though of requesting it!
The room was small but clean and tidy.  The location is very good as it is 10 minutes walk from O´Connell street.",4,2009,12,18
229,Breakfast was diorganized chaos.,"We stayed for three nights and found the rooms ok but only just ok. Although payment for our stay was taken at reception when we arrived we never got a receipt, so we wont know how much it cost until we get our bank statement. Breakfast was so disorganized, with staff taking orders without writing them down and the result was meals being brought to tables and being taken away to be corrected, not just at our table (every morning of our stay) but at many others. Staff were walking past tables with used plates stacked up as if it was not there responsibility to clear them. We will be looking for another hotel for our next stay.",3,2009,12,09
229,"Lovely building, but chaotically run","We arrived to a warm welcome in the grand reception area, but things unfortunately went down hill from there.

Despite Ireland being Europe's first country to ban smoking in public buildings, our room (506) stank of stale smoke - not much better than the corridor leading to it, which smelt of bad feet AND smoke.  When my friend booked he had no choice over smoking/non-smoking rooms so we assumed we had a non-smoking room which clearly we didn't.  The room itself had a very low ceiling and a couple of the lights were dangerously positioned and/or loose.  We also couldn't get the TV to work because the universal remote hadn't been tuned into the set.  There was tea and coffee available but no kettle, so I had to go down to reception and ask for one.

The service from the staff was varied, ranging from the warm and helpful greeting on our arrival to the cold and abrupt girl who took a taxi booking from me.  I also met the Managing Director - a charming man who I'd happily talk to for hours, but the state of the hotel - peeling walls, dirty carpets and smelly corridors - suggested that either he didn't know what was going on or didn't have the staff on his side.  There were lots of indications that the place was in decline.

We had breakfast in an unheated annexe of the main room, although feeling like we were sitting in a fridge was probably my only complaint, as the breakfast itself was tasty and more than enough.

All in all, if you're looking for budget accommodation and you're happy to settle for not much more than a basic room and breakfast, you'll find this adequate.  If you're looking for a place that's in good condition and offers efficient and consistent service, this ain't really it.",2,2009,12,08
229,Great value and service,"I stayed at the Castle Hotel recently for three nights.  We found the hotel to be a nice suruprise. Well located, clean, cute and most importantly-great service.  Gillian and the crew at reception did a wonderful job, even making sure we had an early breakfast on our last day when we left at 5:30 a.m.  Thanks to all of them for a wonderful stay in Dublin.",5,2009,12,02
229,Great location and comfortable,"We arrived at Dublin airport without hotel reservations and are very happy that the tourist bureau at the airport arranged our stay at the Castle Hotel. 
The lovely Georgian townhouse hotel was perfectly located, a few blocks from the airport bus stop. At check in, the hotel owner walked into the lobby, welcomed us with a handshake and made us feel right at home.  The reception staff was efficient, but not personable.  The room was spotless and comfortable.  The public spaces were lovely as well.  We enjoyed the Irish band they have in the bar on Friday evenings.
Each day we walked the 2 or 3 blocks to the hop on hop off bus stop and highly recommend this inexpensive and efficient way to see most of the city's wonderful attractions.
When we return, the Castle Hotel will likely be our choice.",4,2009,11,21
229,Nice corner of Dublin,"The staff was great, very kind and positive attitude. 
The hotel is and old charming Victorian building. Clean and nice atmosphere, good location.",4,2009,10,16
229,Why did they give us a grotty room instead of one of the decent rooms?,"We were initially given a very worn room with door-less wardrobe and a bed so uneven and hard we could not sleep and bathroom with a large crack running across the floor tiles. When, after 2 sleepness nights we requested a new room we were offered a choice of excellent, modern rooms with very comfortable beds.
That experience shows they try to palm their guests off with the rubbish rooms when possible - not a way to get our repeat custom!!
Breakfasts were very poor - minimal choice, no bread rolls and cheap quality.",2,2009,09,14
229,This is the one!,"Fantastic staff! Very friendly and helpful. I have met the owner, who is also very friendly and who would gladly tell you the history of the hotel.

229,Good Value,"Stayed here for concert in Croke Park. The hotel is in a good location and carparking is secure. My room (415) was fine, clean, and bathroom spotless. My friends room was a bit more dated (406) but was again clean. It is fine if you are just looking for somewhere to sleep for the night, not suitable for a romantic break or with kids. The staff were fine but the 
receptionist left a lot to be desired. The only thing I did not like was the cushions on the bed as they did not have covers which could be removed for washing after each check-out, get rid of them they are not doing you any favours. Overall, it was fine.",3,2009,07,28
229,Good value very close to centre,"Clean, old fashioned hotel - better than many expensive neighbours. 
Good Wi-fi
Secure off street parking.",4,2009,07,06
229,"Excellent deal for a charming, quaint and clean hotel","I got an excellent deal for the price I paid (at the beginning of the tourist season, though).

My room and ensuite bathroom were impeccably clean, as every other part of the hotel (stairs, corridors, dining room, waiting room, etc.).

The staff will gladly help you (some have their special characters, others are more amenable, but all will help you politely). Really, my overall impression was very good.

A remote control for the TV would be good (although I was not in Dublin to watch TV).

Unfortunately, I could not use the bath but only the shower attached to it, but the room service was top-notch.",4,2009,05,22

229,Nice hotel - Just not room 333!!,"Stayed at the Waltons hotel this weekend. Ideal location for sightseeing and getting about in Dublin. The room we stayed in, 333, was a little strange in that there was evidence of subsidence (cracks in the wall) The ceiling was starting to fall apart and the fire alarm/speaker in the room didn't work. ( We know this as the fire alarm in the hotel went off 3 times during the weekend) .Glad there wasn't a fire for real..............
Apart from this the hotel itself is very clean, the staff friendly. The location ideal, for what we paid for the hotel i suppose cannot grumble. One word of advice, as the euro is currently so strong agaoinst the pound you will pay WELL over the odds at the hotel bar.",3,2009,05,04

229,You Can Do Better,"Our four-day visit at Waltons was bittersweet.  
Advantages:
Location on edge of the business district.  A nice 20-minute walk to the center centre.
Spartan but clean rooms.
Old, attractive, comfortable small hotel.
Disadvantages:
Not in an attractive area.
Full breakfast in an attractive but basement room that was so noisy you were glad when the meal was finished.  Strange, as the ground floor of the hotel has many lovely meeting rooms that are largely not used.
Unfortunately, due to a Rugby match on the Saturday of our stay, our room on that day almost tripled in price.   The hotel was overcrowded with an unruly crowd that bordered on bedlam.
Service at reception desk was uneven.

Suggest a nice bed and breakfast in the Merrion Park/St. Stephen's Green areas of Dublin.",3,2009,03,05
229,Lurrrved this Hotel!,"My partner booked this hotel for a suprize weekend away for us, When we arrived we were very pleased, our room was large, with lovely furniture & flat screen Tv. The rest of the hotel is obviously decorated to look old -thats the style of the building (dated back from the 1700's & NOT just old fashioned as some ignorant person has put!!!) 
The whole place was immaculate.
Breakfast was lovely.
2min walk up the road from O'Connell street. (very central)
The staff were very helpful, & you can ask them about anything, if they dont know the answer they will look it up on the internet for you!!
Fantastic little hotel - For the price!!",5,2008,09,30
229,"Charming, Friendly hotel - would recommend !!!","My husband and I have just returned home following a fabulous stay at Waltons Hotel.   The hotel has been described by some reviewers as ""old fashioned""  it seemed obvious to me that this is intentional and the general decor is in keeping with the Georgian era (was told by receptionist that the building dates back to the 1700.s) with lovely large sash windows in the bedrooms - at least there was in my room and 2 lovely very grand looking fireplaces in the lounge together with ""antique"" pictures and furnishings scattered thoughout.

I really thought the hotel was very charming and had a lovely atmosphere,  the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable about the local tourist attractions and all the best things to see and do.  I could not fault their recommendations.

The full Irish breakfast was excellent - nice hot toast, fresh coffee and plenty of it and all the works for the hubby sausages, bacon, tomato etc etc and lovely scrambled eggs for me - all too often I have been handed a plate of inedible watery scrambled egg while away - all in all  just the ticket to set us up for a full day's sightseeing.

I would definitely return to Dublin and to this hotel and would have no hesitation in recommend it to my best friends!!!",5,2008,09,14
229,orrible,"wwe were in 126. Very small, very poorly maintained. beds on a slant, high claustrophobic windows.
The heating is only put on in the evening for a couple of hours although it was cold and raining. Had to ask for extra blankets which were providedthat evening.

The have a nice small residents bar, very quiet but a lovely pint of guinness, the breakfast was great in the mornings to start off our day. The staff were great and very friendly and helpful. It is colose to all amenties so we could walk back and forth no matter where we went. We will definately be back, its great value for money and great throughout!",5,2008,06,23
229,Good location for our visit and pleasant experience,We stayed for two nights. We chose the Walton as it was within walking distance of Croke Park stadium and Dublin City centre. The price included a very reasonable breakfast and an evening meal was available as an extra if required. The staff were very friendly and helpful. This was useful as we left a bag in a taxi and had to make various telephone calls to aid its recovery. The hotel is not luxurious and the rooms at the front can be noisy in day light hours due to the traffic lights just outside. It has character however and the rooms are comfortable with sash windows. It was an ideal base for our first trip to Dublin which of necessity had to be as economic as possible. Hint don`t expect the bar to be cheap even in an inexpensive hotel.,4,2008,06,20
229,good budget hotel,"Looking for reasonable priced hotel close to Croke Park for one night.  This seemed to be the nearest available, so booked even though reviews weren't that great. You don't go to Dublin to stay in the room anyway, and as we were only there for one night, decided to go ahead. 

Previous reviews are quite accurate, but if you want a luxury hotel, then there are plenty to choose from in Dublin!  Our room was very spacious and most importantly clean. It was situated at the back of the hotel, therefore very quiet at night.  The only slight gripe that I have was that having paid for full breakfast, they only served it between 8am to 10am.  As we had an early ferry to catch, the receptionist arranged for us to have continental breakfast at 7am which was fine, but obviously not what we'd paid for!  

I have stayed in other hotels in Dublin nearer to Temple Bar and Grafton Street, but this is a great budget hotel with friendly staff.  Would be happy to recommend to others.",4,2008,06,11
229,Cosy and clean,"I stayed at this hotel for 1 night with a friend on 30/5/08. First impressions were that the hotel was fairly small, old fashioned but clean. We were given a twin room number 312 which was at the back of the hotel, and this room was huge.The room and bathroom were spotlessly clean. Decor is very old fashioned, but this is not a bad thing as long as you are expecting it. 
I experienced no problem with noise at night, but we were at the back of the hotel. A little bit disappointed that breakfast was only served from 8am to 10am. As we had a ferry to catch we needed breakfast at 7am. The receptionist quite happily arranged for us to have a continental breakfast at 7am, but I would have preferred the cooked Irish breakfast!  Overall, I was perfectly happy with this hotel, and it was ideally sited for an easy walk to Croke Park.",4,2008,06,02
229,Lovely Clean Hotel - will be back for sure!,"Had a fab time in The Walton's Hotel - the staff were ever so friendly and helpful. Gave us all bus/train/tour bus info we needed and recommended the best restaurants and clubs to go to at night time.

The breakfast had to be the best part of our day - we were there for 4 nights and every morning the breakfast was superb, a huge big full plate topped with toast and a lovely cup of tea and orange juice. they even have fruit and yogurts too so we could take an apple or bananna with us in our pockets to keep for later.

Our room was lovely and clean, it was modern enough but we loved the interior on the walls and ceilings. We had a lovely clean bathroom with a fantastic shower.

We had a hairdryer in our room but our friends didn't in their room so they just asked for one from reception, including an iron and ironing board which they recieved almost straight away.

The hotel has a beautiful stair case and the same carpet throughout the hotel which was really nice. they also have a lift which took us right to our 3rd floor room.

We had great fun in the residents bar in the evenings with a warm, friendly and happy atmosphere.

It is close to all amenities and i'd definately recommend this to anyone i know.",5,2008,05,14
229,should have stayed at home,The only saving feature of Castle Hotel is the beautiful fire place in the sitting area next to reception.,1,2008,03,19
229,Perfect for St Patricks Day,"My friend and I stayed at the Castle Hotel for St Patricks weekend in Dublin - it's a 10-15 minute walk from Temple Bar so you're close enough to the action but it can get noisy outside in the middle of the night.  The rooms (singles) were small but very clean and tidy.  The staff were lovely, very friendly and helpful, and the breakfasts were a lifesaver :-)",4,2008,03,19
229,Great Time,"Spent a weekend in Dublin recently & stayed in the castle hotel. The hotel is cosy, with log fires lit when it got really cold. Food was great espec the b/fast. Staff very helpful & friendly. Great location, just 2 min walk to O'Connell Street & Temple Var is only a stones throw away. My room was clean with housekeeping daily & chocs on pillow was a real personal touch. I will hope to stay in the castle hotel again",4,2008,03,08
229,Fantastic Staff,"Well what can i say,
I was over for the Scottish Rugby with a group of friends and had a great time.Croke Park only a short stroll away.Temple Bar only a short stroll away in the other direction.
The staff were really friendly and couldn't help more with telling us where to head and what to see while we were here.
The Breakfast was just what we needed to start the morning with a full breakfast or a lighter choice if we chose.
Overall had a brilliant time in Dublin and would come back to the hotel and hope to meet the same staff again",4,2008,03,03
229,Very cold room - no heating .,"Hotel clean, breakfast good BUT, yes there is a big BUT. Two problems: (1) We booked two rooms 7 days before we arrived and requested car parking space for one car (as advertised) When we arrived we were told the car park was closed for repairs so we were left to sort coins for parking meter fees on the busy road outside. They should have contaced us so we would be prepared.(2) This is the big one - it was a cold day in Jan 2008 and the rooms had no heat. It appears part of the  heating system had broken down. We had to wear our overcoats and scarfs and my nose and feet were very cold. We reported the matter 3 times and was told it was being worked on. Even the next morning it was very cold. They did not offer to move us to rooms where the heating was working nor offer compensation. In fact we were asked to pay on arrival, not on departure, so had no idea the heating was not working.
Wouldn't go back if you paid me.",2,2008,01,26
229,Terrible Hotel,"Our stay in this hotel has been horrible. It’s the worst hotel that we have never been. Trust me! You will find B&B’s too much better than this hotel. We spent 300 euros for 2 nights, and it was not a good value. Breakfast was horrible.
When we arrive the receptionist gave a sh… about us because she was talking by phone to her boyfriend. When we arrive to the room it was freezing because the heating was not working. We rang to reception and she was saying that the heating was working. After discussing with her that was not working she said that she will try to fix it. One hour later we were still waiting. We rang her again but she was still talking to her boyfriend and she did not pick up the phone. After half an hour more she picked up the phone and she said the same. After one hour nothing had happened. We rang again to reception but then was another guy who solved us the problem. Totally, we were waiting 3 hours, frozen in our room, waiting that they fix the problem.",1,2007,11,19
229,Good Experience,"Just returned from a four night stay. Hotel was busy due to Ireland v Germany football match.
I cannot agree with some of the negative comments posted about this hotel.
Firstly it is ideally situated 5 min walk from O'Connel Street .Major shopping within 15 mins and Temple Bar area 25 mins tops.
The hotel was clean and the room spacious with a couch in addition to a comfy bed. Bathroom with bath and shower. Breakfast was excellent and served in light and airy breakfast room. They sometimes use the breakfast room of the adjoining Castle hotel but again no problem
Even with German footy fans there was no trouble and no excessive noise( some people obviously require sound proffed rooms)
Staff were helpfull and friendly and I would recommend this hotel without reservation.",4,2007,10,16
229,Not bad value,"Having read previous reviews we requested a room at the back of the hotel but found we were given one right above the front door!  It is very noisey at night but for the cost of the room, not bad value.  Room was very small, bathroom was more like a cupboard, but clean and tidy.  Breakfast was extra but good value for 10 euros.",2,2007,10,02
229,Excellent for sleep deprivation,"Expensive  with some Georgian charm. The front facing room was a small double - superior single. Bed ok - pillows very foamy. Six teabags and two cups but not kettle in room. But that paled into insignificance with the night noise - couldnt sleep till 4am when the screaming and shouting subsided. I asked to extend the check out beyond 11.00 am on a Sunday and was told I could if the room wasn't wanted. Who would want it!! Perhaps the CIA on a stopover from a rendition flight intent on administrating sleep deprivation.
",1,2007,09,16
229,Great location...although not so great at night,"The lobby is very beautiful. The decorations is great. I loved the fact that I was going to stay in a Georgian house.
The room was small, but very cozy. The only problem was the central heating. Despite requesting someone to check it, it never heated. Seemed like no one checked it.
The breakfast is very good. Good value overall, considering how expensive Dublin can be.
The biggest problem for me was the neighbourhood.
Its localion is excellent (just a short walk to o´connel street). However, the hotel street was very noisy at night...people listening to loud music and shouting. I´ve also heard that it is an unsafe area, although I had no problems.
",4,2007,07,18
229,Not terribly impressed,"Originally booked online for the Castle but upon arriving I was given a room at the Waltons (the two hotels are adjacent to one another and share the same breakfast room). Staff were friendly. The room was disappointing. Noise from the neighboring rooms, hallway, and outside was too much at 300 or 400am. Lastly, the shower door was broken but never properly fixed.
",2,2007,07,17
229,Good hotel,"Good hotel, although I would not recommend it in winter time (bathroom did not have heating and was quite cold).
",3,2007,05,28
229,Enjoyed the Castle,"My eight friends and I had a very enjoyable ... if not EVENTFUL ... time in Dublin.  We were moved to the caslel hotel in Great Denmark St as there was no room at the Inn ( well, at the original hotel choice).  The hotel staff gave us a warm welcome and could not do more to offer help and advise on sites to be seen in Dublin !!  The breakfast was fabulous, although the dining room was a llitte busy.  The rooms were variable, ours was lovely but our single friends room showed signs of damp.  However, the rooms were clean and comfortable. The hotel could be recommended to those on a budget, but was a little far from Temple Bar (about a 20 minute BRISK walk !!).
Dublin was lovely, really friendly people by day, a little fiesty at night, we broke up two fights (being the responsible citezens that we are) and our friend was subjected to a bit of racist abuse (the drink talking we hope!!).
We took the red tourist bus with a very informative and amusing commentary from the driver ... we stopped at the guinness factory ( it was a tenner to get in) and  the prison ( The Rev Ian Paisley was our guide ... he was a tad political !!!). 
We had fab evenings in Maddigans bar on O'connell street,  just down from our hotel, live music and a warm welcome !! The whole of Temple Bar was buzzing at night with street performers (and hen nights)  .  We had a fab afternoon in Temple Bar bar, it was ... er ... riotous !!
Some of our party went to Grafton Street  shopping and said it was fantastic.
Overall, we had a great weekend break..... We'll go again, when we recover .... the Guinness was GOOOOOOODD!!!!!!
",4,2007,04,28
229,Appreciation to the barstaff,"Excellent hotel.We stayed here for the rugby 6 nations weekend. Although the result didnt go our way the staff at the Waltons were superb! Food was good at breakfast. No complaints at all. Fantastic city .Fantastic People. Fantastic hotel. We will visit here again.
",5,2007,02,26
229,Excellent location at a decent price,"If you're looking for room service, a gym, pool, spas or other amenities, this is not for you.  But if you're just looking for a comfortable clean room, an excellent location and friendly staff, this is your place!  

We paid $153 for one night, quite pricey for a two-star hotel but then everything in Dublin is expensive, especially with the horrible USD-Euro exchange rate. The only reason I gave it just three stars was because of the high price. But it's one of the better deals in Dublin.

The best feature of this hotel is its location. It's a short walk to the main shopping areas, and about 15 minutes walk to Temple Bar.  It's also near a tram station and several bus routes are served by this cozy hotel.

The neighborhood is quite safe, but be aware that there is a dodgy strip club located a few doors down to the right of the hotel.  

The staff are young, friendly and eager to help plan your itinerary. There is a small lobby bar that feels more like a living room. And the free breakfast is excellent. 

One strange feature of this hotel: the building is inter-connected to two other hotels through a series of maze-like corridors and stairwells. If you're not careful, you end up in the wrong hotel, and the only way back to your room is to go OUTSIDE and walk around the corner back to the Castle Hotel main entrance!
",3,2006,12,02
229,"Clean, Friendly, Central Hotel","We stayed at the Waltons Hotel, Dublin for the weekend in November and were slightly worried as to what we may find when we arrived due to other reviews that we had read.  Upon arrival we realised that we had no reason to be worried.

We found the hotel clean, the staff friendly, the full irish breakfast was outstanding, rooms were clean and spacious (we got a triple room instead of the double we'd booked).  The hotel had so much atmosphere to it as it dates back to 1790.  It has in the main been fully refurbished but as we were leaving on Monday there were some decorators around and about putting finishing touches to certain rooms.

The room had maid service everyday with clean towels and chocolates left on the pillows.

We did have a chat with the Manager/Owner of the hotel one night who was really friendly and gave us a brief history of the hotel and how it had become one of the infamous hotels in dublin with its Waltons Music store next door.

All in all I would definately recommend this hotel as it is really central to where all ""the action"" is in dublin ie shops, bars, restaurants etc.

We had a very enjoyable stay at the Waltons Hotel and would definately book again if we were going to return to Dublin.
",4,2006,11,17
229,Good value but forget about the heating .....,"Cheap hotel for Dublin standards, good value. Well located, room ok, not small. 
Nice to have a kettle in the room: coffee, tea.
Very nice full irish breakfast. 

The minuses: correct but not very warm employees, problem with heating. When it is working (not before 7pm !, it heats little. Not a nice feeling when you want to feel cozy. 

Definitely worth recommending if you do not use it during cold days
",4,2006,10,10
229,Could of been better...,"The location of this hotel is fine.  It can be VERY noisy on Saturday nights and if the All Ireland Hurling Final is on, on the Sunday as well.    No sleep till 4 am....... from passers by, singing
and enjoying themselves.

The hotel was dated and a bit shabby BUT clean.

Breakfast was very good.

In our room the bathroom was missing a curtain at the window (which faced an office block)

The double bed was shot at!  Very noisy even if you were JUST sleeping..

A little bit of money could be spent to make the hotel that bit better.",2,2006,09,04
229,Ii Is the Worst Hotel in Dublin,"We stayed at tis hotel as a birthday surprise,we were told it was a few mins from the train,,, yeah by plane!!!When we entered the hotle it looked old and not wat it was showed on the pictures.The lift was bad and smelt of different things.rooms are VERY basic,rand down for a hairdryer to be sent up to our room at 6.30 at 10.30 we had to go and still ahd no hairdryer, when we asked we were told another room had it and as soon as they were finished with it we cod have it   yeah watever!!! so make sure to bring ur own. when we were leaving the nxt day we owed 25 euros and one frined went to get it fom atm machine and the rest of us were locked into the lobby like crimals until he returned. the staff were very ignorant and no way helpful. I wod not recommend any one to stay in this dump!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

229,Needs a lot of improvements!,"I really was not in this hotel for long enough to give a comprehensive review of the place its facilities & location, as I was “bumped off” to this establishment from another hotel and arrived quite late at night.

Whilst the hotel does have a lift/elevator, I had to reject the first room to which I was being shown, because after alighting the lift, I was required to go through at least five separate doors, each with its own flight of stairs, to reach the bedroom.  When I saw the fifth door/stairs, I decided it was time to turn back, because (a) there may have been more doors/stairs ahead (b) I had a heavy suitcase with me and (c) even with having a reasonable sense of direction, I wondered if I would ever be able to find my way through the maze of hallways and doors, back to the reception desk/foyer, the following day, especially as all the doors appeared identical.

That room rejected, I was shown to another, this time, which required ONLY three flights of stairs to reach it after exiting the lift.

The room itself was a very good size, with a very comfortable bed.  The wardrobe was more than adequate in size and the room had tea- and coffee-making facilities, which I really appreciated.  The television reception was terrible though.

The bathroom, though small in size, was clean and everything was in good working order.

One thing struck me as ‘peculiar’ about the bedroom though was the fact that the room sloped, quite dramatically.  The cause or reason for this I do not know, but it certainly left me with a very strange sensation.  There was an odd looking hole in the ceiling above the bed also.  It probably wasn’t a bullet hole – but I couldn’t but help wonder!

Having managed to locate the reception area of the hotel the following morning, I discovered that breakfast again required one to descend a flight or two of stairs to get to the dining area.  The breakfast room was clean and the food very good and plentiful – but the breakfast juices and cereals were available in a smaller area beyond the dining room – and there were no signs available to tell one of this.

It would certainly appear, from my brief time spent here, that this is a hotel not suitable for anyone with mobility difficulties and/or with lots of heavy luggage.  However, I had a pleasant night’s sleep in a comfortable bed, followed by a good breakfast, and at the end of the day these things go a long way towards keeping a guest happy.
",2,2006,07,03
229,Not worth the expense,"This was the first night of our honeymoon vaction in Ireland.  The staff here was friendly, but the receptionist seemed not completely sure of themselves.  While the rooms and bathroom were very clean, I expceted a nicer room.  There was not a clock in the bedroom, nor an available iron to use, as the receptionist let us know that the ""only iron"" had been checked out.  We could not sleep that night either, as two staff members could be heard arguing loudly outside the parking area outside the window. We booked here on the recommendation of someone, so we do not plan on staying here on our return.
",2,2006,06,15
229,"Nice room, poor service","I booked this Hotel at the last minute as I decided to go to Dublin, spur of the moment to surprise my friend who was the Tisch University.

I booked a single but my room had a double bed and was reasonably sized, so that was a pleasent surprise. The bathroom was also quite large. The room was clean but rather plain. The TV reception was very poor and the walls were very thin, I could hear people walking up and down the corridors.

There was a bit of confusion involving breakfast. It was included in my rate but there weren't clear directions to where the breakfast room was. There was nobody at the Reception desk when I came down in the morning and so I had to wonder around until I eventually found the breakfast room in the basement at the end of a maze of corridors. It was pretty much help yourself and nobody asked me for my room number or to prove that I was a Hotel guest so it was quite a free for all.

On check out, the Receptionist accused my friend of staying overnight with me and wanted to charge me more for the room. Of course I refused and as I had paid cash on arrival they did not have a swipe of my credit card.

229,6th april 2006,"When I chose the hotel I actually clicked the wrong hotel on the booking page and was very worried that this hotel only had a 2 star rating..

However.. 

The hotel was well above a 2 star standard. Very clean room and communal parts. Hotel staff were helpful and friendly (bar one who was a little frosty)

We arrived a good 4 hours before check in and went to put our luggage in the hotel. We were told our room was ready so we could check in straight away.

Breakfast on the first day was a little poor (buit we did go down for it 10 minutes before the end) 

We had breakfast again on the Sunday morning at 0900 and it was lovely.

Fantastic location just off O'Connell Street and greta value for money! 

Large smoking room with a spare bed! 

Would book here again!

229,Very Nice,"I was part of a large group of student travelers, and was a little apprehensive about the hotel because it is very much like some I have stayed while in London. I was pleasantly surprise with the accommodation. The rooms are not huge but certainly adequate and nicely appointed. 

The staff was extremely helpful with everything. The Guinness was quite smooth and the best I have had. The morning breakfast crew was extremely accommodating.",4,2006,03,19
229,Great place for a weekend break,"We booked a double room on line for 3 nights and we were not dissapointed with our choice of hotel. The Castle Hotel is in a superb location for seeing the sites of Dublin. Based just off of Parnel Square and only a five minute walk from the top of O'Connell Street and the Airbus Bus stop. (Recommended transport from airport to city centre, get a return to save money, takes about 20 mins)The rest of the city is just beyond and all tourist attractions are within a short walk, when fueled by the black Irish liquid gold, Guinness of course!!!
The Hotel is Edwardian in construction and has lots of romantic charm, from its open welcoming door to the sweeping staircases. The hotel is old and it shows a little but we found it to be clean and very tidy. The staff were always friendly and full of good advice. The room, on the ground floor at the back, was warm, spacious and very quiet. The bathroom was well appointed and the shower hot and refreshing. The breakfast was served between 8-10 am in the basement dinning room and was plentifull and very tasty, with copious amounts of tea, coffee and toast on request. 
All in all our stay was just what we had hoped for and we hope to return again soon, to taste the wonderful Guinness and the exceptional Irish hospitality that is freely offered.

229,"Good location, price and definitely would recommend","Stayed at the Castle Hotel for 2 nights this week. Booked single accommodatiion, but was given a spacious twin bed room.

The hotel is very old fashioned, but clean. Adequate tea/coffee in the room, Multi channel TV.

My room was very quiet.

Breakfast served from 8-10am and was pretty good.

Pleasant warm homely bar for a drink or two before bed.

Would have no hesitation in staying at the Castle Hotel again.

229,So helpful,"Just before going to Dublin I broke my rib and thought we would have to cancel as I wasn't very mobile. I decided first to see how practicable it would be to try to hire a wheelchair. The Tourist Board gave me the number of the Irish Wheelchair Association who were very helpful but closed too early for us to collect a wheelchair from them. I called the Castle Hotel and spoke to Michelle who arranged for a taxi to collect it for me! She trusted us for the hire fee and taxi fare and even phoned me to say it was there, 'so I wouldn't worry'. All of the staff at the Castle Hotel were so kind and helpful it contributed a huge amount to our enjoyment.
Our room was really big with lots of storage. A little basic, but tea, coffee and milk in abundance! And lots of hot water for showering.
The hotel was clean and a very good price.
The tour buses were just around the corner and the shops in walking/wheelchair distance.

229,"Had a ball in Dublin, Castle Hotel good value for money","Myself and two friends booked to go to Dublin to celebrate the BIG 40 for all us, the first time we have been away together without kids or partners since we were 19!!!
We arrived at the Castle at around 10.30am having caught an early flight from Stanstead our room wasn't ready but we were able to put our luggage in a secure room while we went off to explore.
Did the open top bus tour which is well worth doing as it give you a feel of the size and layout of Dublin for 12 euros and you can hop off and back on again where ever takes your fancy.
We also did the Guiness Tour which ends with a complimentary pint of Guiness in a fantastic bar high over Dublin with superb views, if you find the Guiness at bit bitter ask the bar staff to add a bit of blackcurrant it goes down a bit easier!! Look out for the wall of messages at the Guiness Tour and don't forget to add your own.
We got back to our hotel late afternoon and where given room 101 a triple room off a lounge on the ground floor, at first we thought the location was going to be bad but infact it worked out really well.  The room was hugh with a double and two single beds, a sofa and a small bathroom with a fantasticly powerful shower. The room was clean and the beds comfortable.
We were woken the next morning at 7am by the night porter hoovering the lobby which was annoying as we had not got in till late the night before.
Breakfast was okay but small, however that could have been because we did not get there until 9.55 and breakfast finished at 10.00!!
The staff where friendly and helpful, the bar area comfortable.
We would recommend this hotel if you are looking to have a good base in the city at a good price.
Regarding night life you must go to the Arlington, good irsh band, irish dancing, a night club downstairs with a fantastic atmosphere just let your hair down and boogie.
Fantastic and memorable trip, we are already planning a return next year.

229,"Not bad, but could do better","I visited the Castle for 4 days when I was attending a conference + doing a bit of sightseeing. It is normally much more expensive when travelling alone, so I was looking for a reasonable deal, and I felt the Castle not too bad in this respect.
The room was OK, if a bit basic. Comfortable bed, tea & coffee, TV but toiletries (apart from soap) would have been nice & there was only one hair dryer at reception, and they wanted it straight back.
Breakfast adequate if a bit unimaginative.
Convenient for O'Connell Street & airport & other buses.
An OK choice for a woman travelling alone & not wanting to spent too much.

229,terrible.,"We were over from London for a game in croke park(26 sept 04) and we chose this hotel because it was 5 mins walk to the game. when we landed at the reception we could not get in because the buzzer was not working. we knocked hard to be met by one of the rudest receptionists i have ever had the misfortune of meeting. we were then told they had double booked our room and were sending us by taxi to their sister hotel at the other side of the city. this defeated our reason for staying at this hotel. we were told we had no choice and that our money would be taken fron our credit card. we asked for our deposit back and were told no. i asked to speak to the manager and the receptionist asked why... and suprise, suprise the answer was again no. while waiting for the taxi (against our will) other guests were trying to get in through the front door the receptionists called them -------- behind their backs.  
          On the way to the other hotel we stopped the taxi and rang and cancelled our credit card to stop Waltons charging it. We paid a deposit of 42 euros which we never got back after numerous chats with the manager. We actually consider ourselves to have had a lucky escape.
Worst experience of a hotel in my life and being irish i was totally ashamed that this happened in our own country..

229,Delighted with all aspects,"8 of us ladies were in Dublin for a weekend of Birthday celebrations. The Castle Hotel was perfect location wise, 5 minutes walking distance from the main shopping areas of Grafton Street and Temple Bar. Hotel was very clean, staff very accommodating, rooms clean and housing all you need, bed, en-suite facilities, tea and coffee making facilities. My group of 3 was fortunate enough to be given the family room which was larger than the standard 3 person room, nonetheless the whole group was happy with their alloted rooms. Would definitely use the Castle Hotel again.

229,bring your own iron!!!!!,"We stayed here over a recent long weekend - the location was good, just a 10 min stroll to the city centre, so within walking/staggering distance to temple bar. The room was clean, big (1 double and 1 single bed) and good bathroom with shower over bath. Walls were paper thin - mumbled conversations could be heard, as well as people walking around on the wooden and creaky floorboards in the room above us - early in the morning!! I wouldn't say the staff at the front were friendly. Now the iron story... we called one morning to see if we could get an iron to our room, but were told none were available. Ok. So later that day before we went out for dinner we tried again. This time the 'single' iron was not available... The abrupt girl at the front told us they do not keep a record of who has the iron at any one time, and for her to locate it for us would mean calling each of the 126 rooms to check. So there's 1 iron for 126 rooms!! So bring your own if you want to iron out your creases before hitting the town.

229,Not Too Bad,This was the last hotel I stayed in and compared to the others it was by far the worst.  The staff was nice and helpful.  The location isn't too bad.  It's basically at the end of O'Connell St.  This can be a far walk back to the hotel if you plan on doing a lot of drinking in the Temple Bar area.  The walls are paper thin.  I could literally here the people on both side of me using the restroom.  BAD!  I guess I'm just thankful that and mumbled conversations is all I had to listen too.  There are much better places to stay in Dublin.  Look around and use this as a last resort. ,2,2004,06,18

Both bathrooms, however, were modern with discreetly large showers. There are two breakfast rooms: one dedicated to freshly made Irish breakfast, the other with continental breakfast buffet.

229,Hotel close to the city!,"Very nice, cozy hotel near the city! Traditionally furnished for Ireland!
Good breakfast and friendly staff.
Unfortunately, the access to the rooms and other rooms is very narrow.
Rooms facing the street should be avoided.
Unfortunately, the rooms facing the courtyard/parking lot are not always quiet either, as in the evenings and at night (at 4 a.m.) the staff stand in the courtyard, smoking and having loud conversations!
Hence only 3 stars!",3,2024,05,19
229,Super mini holiday,"Stayed for 3 nights at this fantastic hotel. Very close to the center and bus and tram stops. Top breakfast. Young, kind and super helpful staff to our requests. Stayed with family in a spacious and bright family room (426). If I ever return to Dublin (I hope so) it will be the first place to book.",5,2024,05,06
229,Quaint hotel in a central location,"The Castle Hotel is centrally located and is a great starting point for sightseeing in Dublin. Its quaintness is immediately apparent: lots of steps and corners, tried-and-tested carpets, breakfast and dinner in the windowless basement with dim lighting. The staff are unconditionally friendly and attentive. The food is of good, but not outstanding quality.",4,2024,05,04
229,Top!!,"This is the oldest hotel in the Irish capital Baile Àtha Cliath, and it is simply wow - from the furnishings to the services, but also the creaking noise you hear walking down the corridors and in the room - it immerses you in the authentic atmosphere of Georgian Dublin! (I don't know why almost all the paintings are crooked, but it's part of the overall charm.)

The reception staff, extremely helpful and kind 24 hours a day, and the guys on duty at the bars/restaurants provided us with further comfort and satisfaction, for which I should only congratulate! I can't say the same for those who looked after our room every day, perhaps they don't know they work in a 4* place, but that's not a complaint - we still had a great time.

The strategic position allowed us to explore all the sites of interest strictly on foot (it should be noted that the stop of some buses is just a stone's throw away), and to appreciate the absolute tranquility. Just know that the seagulls in Dublin are already hovering at 4am - guaranteed wake-up call for those with hyperacusis 😅, I'm being ironic!

Worth noting are the breakfasts for all tastes, choices, nutritional disorders and allergies, the abundant dinners (the seafood chowder must be tried over and over again), and even the packed lunch for those who are leaving early.
An obligatory stop after a day out is The Castel Vaults, where over a pint or two of Guinness you learn to hum typical Irish music and more!!!

PS: for those arriving without an adapter, or for those who need a bottle of water to take in their pajamas, a vending machine is available along the corridor adjacent to the front desk!",5,2024,02,29
229,finally a hotel worthy of the stars!!!,"really very very nice hotel! super staff!!! clean rooms, bathroom a little small but with a large shower! Fantastic breakfast: Irish or continental or both!!! super abundant and with excellent quality.
highly recommended also for the location!!! very satisfied!!!",5,2023,11,27
229,Improve cleaning! We found the rooms dusty.,"It looks good but lacks cleanliness which is poor and insufficient for what we paid. Still quiet rooms, some renovated, some not. Excellent Irish and continental breakfast. Friendly and prepared staff. Hotel in strategic area.",3,2023,10,26
229,Cozy and traditional.,"We stayed at the hotel in a triple room (three single beds). Although the hotel shows that it is older, and in some elements it needs remodeling, this drawback is more than made up for by the warmth and good treatment of the staff, the traditional decoration and the location (10 minutes walk from Temple Bar). The room was spacious and the bathroom has been remodeled. You can choose between two breakfasts, the typical Irish and the continental. It has a luggage storage service for the day of departure and arrival (although we arrived at 1:00 p.m. and we were already able to access the room although in theory it was from 3:00 p.m.). It has many common rooms to spend some time. The day we arrived the owner was at reception and seeing how he treated us, it is perfectly understandable how comfortable we were: very friendly. The rooms faced the main street and you could hear the traffic, but the hotel is very quiet. We have been like at home.",4,2023,10,24
229,Nice hotel in Dublin!,"A nice 4-star hotel in the central area, a few minutes walk from the AirCoach stop. The main attractions of the center are within walking distance. Very well preserved historic building, both inside and outside, a little labyrinthine but pleasant. Beautiful and well-kept room, on the top floor at the end of the corridor, therefore quiet and with a beautiful view of the roofs of Dublin! Poorly soundproofed walls, one morning the neighbor's electric razor woke me up... Breakfasts served in two separate rooms, depending on whether you choose the Irish or Continental breakfast, wide choice and good quality products. I found the waitresses very courteous. Maybe a little expensive, but you are in the center of a 4-star hotel.",5,2023,09,11
229,"219, chamber of horrors","In Italy a similar hotel would have two stars. Dislike and coldness of the staff - who don't even bother to say hello - comparable only to the inconvenience caused by the dilapidation of the structure (and the room). The shower in particular has very little pressure and cold water; upon our second complaint, they told us to keep the water on for ten to fifteen minutes to heat it up - so much for ecology. We had to wash our hair over the sink.
It is unacceptable that they demanded the full amount as soon as we arrived at the hotel.
The ""Irish"" breakfast is slightly saved, plentiful.
The price is absolutely not worth the structure.",1,2023,08,24
229,3 star tourist hotel in very good location,"Hotel for nostalgics! The public areas are very classically furnished, actually elegant. The overnight area is more than spartan, a small room in the style of the 1980s and accordingly worn. The Castle Hotel is loud, thin-walled and has narrow corridors with stairs in between.

The choice between two types of breakfast is very nice, either a normal continental or a full Irish breakfast. In the evening there is live music in the bar by a solo entertainer. I was there once and it was quite nice.

Be careful if you have a room facing the inner courtyard, like the one I had: at around 9.30 p.m. the garbage truck comes and makes a lot of noise. At around 11 p.m. the bar staff dispose of their garbage, including the glass bottles. After that it gets quiet and you can't hear anything except the seagulls.

The super location right on Parnell Square and O'Connell Street is also worth mentioning. Public transport is just around the corner, the Aircoach is around 500 m away.
If you need a supermarket, Tesco and Lidl are a few streets away.",3,2023,08,16
229,"Ein angenehmes Hotel, dass jeden Cent wert ist","Das Hotel liegt am Rande der nördlichen Innenstadt, aber dennoch ausreichend zentral (15 Gehminuten zum Fluss) in einer ruhigen Straße. Das viktorianische Ambiente trägt sehr zum Wohlbehagen bei. Die Zimmer sind sauber und die Betten sind komfortabel. Die Dusche im Bad könnte etwas strammer sein. Es gab jeden Tag frische Handtücher! Der Service an der Rezeption war freundlich und behilflich bei allen Problemen und Wünschen. Die Managerin Yvonne O´Keefe war sich im Vorfeld nicht zu schade, Restaurants für uns zu buchen. Das Continental-Breakfast (Buffet) war okay, vom Irish Breakfast im Keller rate ich ab.",4,2023,07,23
229,Assolutamente da consigliare,"L'hotel gode di ottima posizione sia per il transfer dall'aeroporto che per girare la città. 
Il personale è stat molto disponibile, tanto alla reception che a colazione.
La struttura è molto curata, ci sono diversi salotti in tinta e l'arredamento è i  stile.
La camera - noi eravamo nella family suite - era spaziosa e pulita; il bagno era grande - aveva sia doccia che vasca. La biancheria veniva cambiata ogni giorno.
La colazione era ricca, sia quella servita al piano terra (colazione continentale) sia quella nel piano interrato (colazione irlandese).
",5,2023,07,10
229,Ottimo!,Grande eleganza di un posto molto confortevole. La doccia non funzionava bene ma siamo stati assistiti con grande solerzia da tutti. Imperdibile la cerimonia del the che va prenotata con anticipo. Un luogo sofisticato e curato nei dettagli.,5,2023,04,26
229,Capodanno a Dublino,"Hotel caratteristico in palazzo vittoriano, sembra di tornare nell'800. Camera spaziosa, letto comodo, bagno minuscolo e senza finestra (tipico di questo tipo di hotel). Pulizia eccellente con cambio giornaliero di asciugamani. Location perfetta a due passi da fermata bus o tram, anche a piedi si raggiunge il centro in un attimo. Colazione abbondante, servizio e staff ottimi. Tutto perfetto.",5,2023,02,22

229,Buono per una vacanza di quattro giorni ,"Cosa mi è piaciuto · Posizione ottima, centro raggiungibile in massimo 10 minuti a piedi e comunque con autobus con fermate sotto l'hotel. Colazione ricca con possibilità di farla continentale o irlandese. Bella la location, curata anche nei dettagli nelle aree comuni. Ottimo il wi-fi. Comunque tutto molto pulito. Musica la sera nel bar ristorante dell'hotel e vasta selezione di whisky e gin irlandesi.

Cosa non mi è piaciuto ·  Sicuramente da rivedere i bagni, ingrandire le docce e mettere miscelatore nel lavandino. Finestre impossibili da aprire per arieggiare la stanza. Pavimento molto rumoroso e non proprio piatto. Molto calde le stanze, non è possibile regolare il riscaldamento. Bene la reception, ma non vengono date molte informazioni in più.",3,2023,01,29
229,Von außen ein normales Gebäude… Innen eine Zeitreise..,"Angenehmes Hotel, etwas außerhalb des Trubels.Die Angestellten waren sehr freundlich und das einchecken verlief reibungslos.

Das Frühstück war für ein Stadthotel durchaus in Ordnung und die Lage super, das man alles zu Fuß erreichen kann. Dafür die zwei Sterne.",2,2022,10,20
229,Estancia 5 noches,"Hotel georgiano con más de 200 años que habrán intentado restaurar en el tiempo pero que sigue necesitando reformas urgentes. Al llegar, lo primero que hacen es cobrar por adelantado tu estancia para que, cuando veas tu habitación, no salgas corriendo de lo mal que lo tienen todo. El personal de recepción no habla ni una sola palabra en español, por lo que si tu inglés es flojo o nulo ni siquiera van a hacer el esfuerzo por lograr entenderte. Y, además, si tú no pides ayuda con el equipaje, ellos tampoco te la ofrecen. El suelo es de madera cubierto por una moqueta para disimular los agujeros y el gran desnivel que hay por todos sitios, como no vayas un poco atento/a te puedes romper cualquier hueso. Con respecto al desayuno, nosotras elegimos el continental, es simple pero aceptable. La habitación que nos dieron al llegar tuvimos que cambiarla por otra, ya que el suelo que tenía era para matarse. En la nueva, observamos una serie de inconvenientes. En el baño no había ni un solo enchufe, solo habían dos en toda la habitación. La calefacción no funcionaba, nos tuvieron que traer dos calefactores improvisados. La ducha era fija en la pared y había que hacer malabares para poder entrar dentro, la puerta era SUPER estrecha, horroroso. Todo el hotel en general huele fatal, incluso en la habitación, hay poca ventilación. Las camas más o menos aceptables. El restaurante es acogedor con música en vivo todos los días pero los lavabos muy sucios y el suelo resbaladizo, los pies se resbalan como si estuvieras pisando grasa, por lo que si no entras poco a poco te rompes la crisma ahí también. Estuvimos 5 noches pero al segundo día ya nos queríamos ir. NADA RECOMENDABLE.",1,2022,10,19
229,Tolles Hotel,"Macht seinem Namen alle Ehre, sieht von innen aus wie ein Schloss. Sehr sauber und gepflegt, die Zimmer sind alle verschieden da diese in das bestehende Gebäude integriert werden mussten. Sehr freundliches Personal, jederzeit wieder zu empfehlen.",4,2022,08,28

Das gesamte Team ist super freundlich, hilfsbereit und hat immer einen netten Gruß für die Gäste.  Das Frühstück ist mehr als ausreichend und  das Abendessen richtig gut.  Ganz toll ist die Atmosphäre, wenn ab 8pm die Livemusik spielt.  Die Zimmer sind völlig ok.  Leider gab es keinen Zimmer Safe. 
Das Hotel achtet auf viele Kleinigkeiten und man kann am Abreisetag bis 12 Uhr das Zimmer nutzen. Die Lage ist perfekt. Viele Busse sind schnell zu erreichen. Die grüne Stadtbahn hält fast vor der Tür sowie auch der Bus zum Flughafen. Ich würde jederzeit wieder buchen.",4,2022,08,20
229,Tornerò!,"Sono rimasta molto soddisfatta! L'albergo è proprio come lo immaginavo (una dimora d'epoca molto elegante) e la posizione permette di muoversi facilmente a piedi.

La sera abbiamo seguito un bello spettacolo di musica dal vivo (un signore con la chitarra) e una bravissima ballerina di River Dance.",4,2022,04,21
229,Buona posizione,"OTTIMA POSIZIONE, PERSONALE GENTILE E DISPONIBILE, colazione e cibo accettabili, ottimo letto, comodo, silenzioso di notte ma la TV non funzionava e nel bagno c'era odore di fogna...io non mi sono mai lamentata e lo consiglierei",3,2022,01,01
229,Non ci siamo !,"Sono stato in questo Hotel per la quinta volta dal 2019 a oggi, le altre volte sono stato soddisfatto, ma questa volta proprio NO ! All'arrivo ci assegnano una stanza, al 4° piano, spaziosa e con un bel panorama, un pò freddina, ma forse si scalda... nel frattempo andiamo in bagno, tirato lo sciaquone il water si riempie e non scarica. Avvisiamo la reception che prontamente ci cambia stanza. La seconda stanza è decisamente fredda, infatti ha il riscaldamento rotto ed è fornita di stufetta elettrica (...). Altro giro in reception e altro cambio di stanza, questa volta al 3° piano, finalmente calda, spaziosa e tranquilla, beh, non funziona l'aspiratore del bagno ( ceco) ma non mi và di cambiare ancora. Il secondo giorno, al rientro serale, scopriamo che la stanza e il bagno non sono stati puliti e non hanno cambiato gli asciugamani !!! Altro giro in reception dove si scusano, ci dicono che avevano dimenticato di segnare il cambio stanza e ci consegnano un cambio di asciugamani puliti. Per concludere in bellezza, il penultimo giorno, scendiamo per la colazione e troviamo mezza sala allagata perché c'è un pozzetto che porta l'acqua piovana in sala..... Mi dispiace, ma se queste cose sono fastidiose in un Hotel a tre stelle, sono INACCETTABILI in un Hotel a quattro stelle ! Oltretutto dal 2019  ad oggi, non abbiamo visto cambiamenti che giustifichino la stella in più. Unica cosa positiva, il personale, sempre gentile, sollecito e cortese in tutte le situazioni.",2,2021,12,10
229,"Too shabby, not so chic","Hotel antiguo, alfombras, paredes e instalaciones anticuadas. Limpieza limitada. Baño con cortinilla de tela no muy limpia. Moquetas que han visto tiempos mejores. Olor a cañerías, de ahí que el extractor de baño lo dejen encendido. No hay tarjeta de ""no molestar"", por lo que llamaron a la puerta para limpiar la habitación. Desayuno muy regular en calidad (fruta pasada y café quemado).",2,2021,10,08
229,Kurztrip nach Dublin - perfekter Aufenthalt im The Castle Hotel!,"Das Castle Hotel ist einfach perfekt für einen Kurztrip nach Dublin.

229,Bien situado pero necesita reforma,"Céntrico, con buen precio pero necesita una reforma urgente. Las puertas tendrán 30 años, el baño pocos menos.

camere classiche ben insonorizzate e pulite. servizio di colazione buono e bel ristorante bar dove la sera si puo ascoltare anche un po di musica. Piccolo inconveniente alla prenotazione fatta di persona alla reception, hanno richiesto la carta di credito. al termine del soggiorno ho pagato con bancomat e dopo due mesi ho ricevuto anche l'addebito della prima notte sulla carta di credito. Contattati e scritto  più volte, inizialmente hanno negato l'operazione, dopo un altro mese quando gli ho inviato l'estratto conto hanno ammesso l'errore, facendo nome e cognome di chi aveva sbagliato, ma richiedendomi nuovamente i dati completi della carta di credito per il riaccredito che ovviamente non ho fornito per non incappare nella stessa rete. ho inviato invece l'iban chiedendo il riaccredito, ma a oggi si sono dileguati. professionalità pari allo 0 kelvin",3,2020,03,27

229,Posizione Eccellente ,"Sono stato per 4 notti in questo hotel con mia moglie per la nostra vacanza a Dublino... La posizione é davvero fantastica vicino a tutto...la fermata del bus é proprio ad 1 minuto a piedi... Per quanto riguarda l'hotel ci hanno assegnato una camera tripla abbastanza grande... Ma la pulizia é un pó da rivedere poiché al nostro arrivo abbiamo trovato dei peli nella vasca da bagno e quando abbiamo fatto presente la cosa alla reception ci hanno detto che la cameriera non c'era e che avremmo dovuto aspettare l'indomani per farci pulire il bagno...comunque la ragazza alla reception é stata gentile facendo lei stessa una lavata alla vasca..... Inoltre la sera avevamo freddo poiché una finestra non chiudeva bene ed abbiamo chiesto una seconda coperta e quella che ci hanno portata era macchiata di sangue... Ma hanno provveduto immediatamente a portarcene un'altra.
La colazione é solo in stile Irlandese non hanno quasi nulla di dolce... Solo le classiche bustine di Nutella (che sono finite il secondo giorno e non le hanno mai rimesse) e se vuoi un cappuccino lo devi pagare extra ma questo é stato un mio errore e devo ammettere che al momento della prenotazione non ho controllato perfettamente cosa offrissero per colazione.
In conclusione un hotel ben posizionato ed elegante ma con qualche piccola pecca da rivedere. ",4,2020,02,15
229,Nel complesso buono ,"Abbiamo alloggiato 3 notti in questo hotel durante la nostra vacanza a Dublino, e complessivamente ci siamo trovati bene.La struttura si trova in pieno centro, ma leggermente defilata dalla Connell street.

Pavimentazione in legno con moquette un po' rumorosa. La colazione era ottima e abbondante, il personale sempre gentile e sorridente,tenete presente che nessuno parla italiano.

Wir hatten sogar einen sehr netten Plausch mit dem Hoteleigentümer Fion  MacCumhail, der uns liebevoll mit Ausflugstipss versorgt hat. Bei der Zimmerwahl gab es Unterschiede, es gibt Zimmer da kann das Handy per USB Port direkt an Steckdose geladen werden, dann gibt es auch Zimmer mit den normalen Steckdosen für die es ein Adapter braucht. Toll waren die Wasserkocher und die Auswahl an Instantkaffee und Tee um sich auf dem Zimmer zu versorgen.Der Roomservice war toll und jeden Tag lagen nett Schokotäfelchen auf dem Bett. Das morgentliche Frühstück war nicht übppig an Auswahl , wohl aber sehr lecker. Irish Breakfast - frisch auf den Teller. An der Bar / im Restaurant waren die Preise im üblichen Dublin Niveau, es gab jeden Abend live Musik.  Es lohnt sich, an der Rezeption nach dem 20 € Dinner zufragen ( 3 Gänge ) so spart ihr hier schon etwas Geld ein zu der normalen Karte ( 30€) . Alles in allem würden wir immer wieder kommen .",5,2020,01,25

229,Tre giorni a Dublino ,"Cercando sui vari motori di ricerca un hotel a Dublino, ci siamo innamorati di questa graziosissima struttura.
L' hotel è piuttosto centrale e comodo per raggiungere i punti più importanti da visitare in città. Facile muoversi anche con i mezzi pubblici perché vicinissime diverse fermate autobus.
Il personale è molto cordiale e gentile, disponibile a dare suggerimenti ed informazioni. Celeri anche a rispondere alle e- mail.
La struttura è grande e su più livelli.
Per una sola notte abbiamo alloggiato in delle stanze mansardate molto carine ed accoglienti, poi abbiamo occupato altre camere altrettanto carine.
La colazione è ricca e ben preparata. 
A rendere piacevole il nostro breve soggiorno in questo hotel è stato l' allestimento natalizio che rendeva il luogo ancora più magico ed accogliente. 
Struttura consigliata!!

Peccato che le camere siano davvero fredde perché il riscaldamento non è sufficiente con i soffitti così alti. O magari dovrebbero esserci i doppi vetri che diminuirebbero anche il rumore che viene dalla strada. Al bagno non c’è proprio il riscaldamento. Inoltre, in un 4 stelle dovrebbe esserci anche il frigo in camera. 
La colazione è ottima, più salata che dolce, ed il personale molto cordiale. Pulito. Bello anche il bar con musica live.",4,2019,11,17
229,In stile ma non con stile,"La posizione è buona per evitare il chiasso delle zone più vicine ai pub e la famosa Zona Temple Bar si raggiunge in dieci minuti a piedi; arredamento in stile georgiano e camere accoglienti ben tenute. La nota dolente per la nostra esperienza è stata il momento della colazione decisamente poco british e molto caotica tant'è che per le mattine successive siamo andati a fare colazione nel locale adiacente nonostante avessimo colazione inclusa. Per compensare riferisco che abbiamo usufruito del servizio bagagli offerto dall'hotel dopo il checkout della stanza, molto utile così abbiamo potuto godere delle ultime ore della vacanza senza il peso delle valigie.",3,2019,11,09

Bei der Anreise aber ein Doppelzimmer mit einem Doppelbett bekommen. Nach Reklamation wurde uns ein Doppelzimmer mit 2 Einzelbetten im 4.Stock gegeben. Das Zimmer war Sauber aber es entsprach nicht meinen Erwartungen. Um einen Frühstücksplatz zubekommen mußten wir lange Wartezeiten einrechnen. An 2Tagen gab es keinen Käse und die gebrauchte Teller wurden während des Essens nicht abgeräumt.Das Hotel ist ansonsten sehr schön und das Personal sehr freundlich.,3,2019,11,06

Auch an der Hotelbar gab es viel Auswahl und Live-Musik. Das Personal ist sehr bemüht und freundlich.

229,Gut untergebracht in ruhiger City-Lage,"Direkt gegenüber des Garden of Remembrance, in der Verlängerung der O’Connell Street Richtung Norden (Frederick Street N, Ecke Gardiner Row) liegt das „Castle Hotel“. Eine perfekte Lage in Dublin City! Schon in einem etwas ruhigeren Teil der Metropole, aber doch nur etwa 15 fußläufige Minuten von den zentralen Orten wie Molly Malone, Trinity College oder Temple Bar entfernt.
Das Hotelgebäude besteht aus unterschiedlichen, ineinander verschachtelten Komplexen, so dass sich sehr unterschiedliche Lagen in Bezug auf die Zimmer ergeben. Ich hatte mit Zimmer 328 ein sehr ruhiges, zum Innenhof gelegenes, Zimmer, das erst nach einem beinahe endlosen Marsch durch drei Feuerschutztüren und lange Flure zu erreichen war. Letztlich kein Problem, denn die Ruhe und die etwas isolierte Lage waren ein deutlicher Gewinn an Wohn- und Schlafqualität. Die Zimmer sind zweckmäßig und mit allen üblichen Notwendigkeiten ausgestattet – ein Wasserkocher steht ebenso zur Verfügung, wie ein Flachbild-TV und ein Fön. Das Bett verfügt über eine gute Matratze – für mich immer ein sehr wichtiges Kriterium! Zimmerreinigung, Sauberkeit, Handtuchwechsel – alles professionell und auf gutem Niveau.
Der Checkin vom freundlichen Personal an der Rezeption verlief zügig und komplikationslos, die WiFi-Abdeckung im gesamten Hotelbereich ist hervorragend.
Das Frühstücksangebot am Morgen ist durchaus abwechslungsreich – die obligatorischen Eierspeisen, Würste, Speck usw. werten an einer Theke nach Wunsch aufgefüllt, hier erfolgt keine Selbstbedienung. Löblich! Ansonsten gibt es etwas Müsli, verschiedene Melonensorten, Joghurt und eine kleine Auswahl an Brötchen und Brot. Das fleißige Personal ist immer bemüht, den großen Besucherströmen gerecht zu werden. Das gelingt auch zumeist. Der gereichte Kaffee hat durchaus Potenzial nach oben – wenn Cappuccino oder Espresso gewünscht wird, ist dies gegen Bezahlung an der Bar möglich.
Im hauseigenen Pubbereich „Old music shop“ wird allabendlich gut gemachte Live-Musik präsentiert, am Wochenende auch mit Irish-Dance-Einlagen. Auch die Leistung der Restaurant-Küche bewegt sich im positiven Bereich – das Rib-Ey-Steak exzellent und auch das georderte Pasta-Gericht auf anständigem Niveau.
Das „The Castle Hotel“ ist auf jeden Fall eine echte Empfehlung für Reisende, die keine Billigabsteige im Zentrum bevorzugen, sondern einem soliden, klassischen Hotel den Vorzug geben. Die Übernachtung ist mit ca. 140 EURO für die Nacht nicht gerade preiswert, kann aber mit den gebotenen Leistungen noch als angemessen bezeichnet werden.",4,2019,10,08
229,Falta limpieza,"Es un hotel bastante centrico, y es un edificio tipo victoriano que tiene su encanto, hadta aqui todo bien. El problems es sobretdo de limpieza, aparte de tener moqueta (que personalmente me parece una superficie que no da sensacion de limpio), el servicio de limpieza diario fue mas bien malo, incluso un dia no nos limpiaron la habitacion, nos fuimos a quejar a recepción, y no volvió a suceder, de todas formas, tampoco limpiaban muchi. El desayuno bien, puedes hacer in Irish Breakfast, y es bastante completo, servido en unas salas que estan decoradas tambien con estilo Victoriano, el restaurante esta en un sotano y tocan musica en vivo, se como bien y es curioso visitarlo.

Lo mejor la cama y lo grande que era la habitación y el desayuno lo peor la limpieza y la relación calidad-precio",3,2019,09,23
229,Schöne Lage Zimmer nur ok,"Hatten dieses Hotel wegen der Lage ausgesucht.

Diese ist wirklich gut.

Das Personal gibt sich Mühe.

Das Zimmer ist ok. Wir mögen keinen Teppich, weil man ja nicht weiss was da sich alles drin sammelt. Und vor allem wann auch jemand sauber gemacht hat.

Leider hingen verschiedene Lampen siehe Bilder nur noch am seidenen Faden und die Dusche war auch bissel ramponiert.

Die Leselampen fehlten komplett.

Schade.

Das Frühstück war ok, aber die Lautstärke nicht zu ertragen. Schlechte Kulisse.
Für uns kein guter Start in den Tag.",3,2019,09,07
229,empfehlenswert ,"lustige Einrichtung, freundliches Personal, gutes Frühstück, Bar für tollen Abend (inkl. gutem Essen), schönes Zimmer ... nur sollte man nie versuchen, Zimmer 302 über die Treppe zu erreichen. Wir sind überzeugt, da gingen schon Leute verloren ;-)",5,2019,08,31
229,Ottimo hotel ,"Siamo stati a Dublino a giugno e abbiamo soggiornato in questo albergo carinissimo situato proprio alla fine di O'Connell Street, all'angolo opposto del Garden of Remembrance.
Un posto strategico perché vicino al centro ma allo stesso tempo al riparo dalla confusione che lo caratterizza. 
Gli ambienti comuni, reception e salottino, sono arredati con gusto in stile georgiano.
La camera che ci hanno assegnato, dopo un piccolo problema, risolto subito e con la massima disponibilità, era grande e comoda, dotata di bagno con vasca e doccia, termoarredo acceso di sera (e, credetemi, utilissimo per far asciugare giubbini e scarpe bagnati dalla pioggia...), letti singoli a una piazza e mezzo e matrimoniale morbidi come nuvole.
La colazione, servita nel ristorantino a piano terra, era ricca e varia, e comprendeva sia portate dolci che salate.
Una chicca poi il pub ubicato sotto l'albergo, dove ogni sera suonavano musica dal vivo e dove c'era la possibilità di cenare (abbiamo mangiato divinamente!!) oltre che di gustare i tipici whiskey e birre irlandesi.
Wi-Fi gratuito in camera. 
Personale cortese e disponibile. 
Assolutamente consigliato. 
",5,2019,08,30
229,Ideal für Stadtbesichtigungen,"Den Charme dieses Hotels, in einer sehr verkehrsarmen Strasse gelegen, macht die Verbindung aus gut organisiertem Hotelbetrieb und B&B-Ambiente aus. Dass mehrere nebeneinanderliegende Häuser miteinander verbunden wurden, läßt die Wege zuweilen labyrinthisch anmuten. Die Einrichtung ist ""old-fashioned"" wohnlich  und versetzt einen unwillkürlich um 100 Jahre zurück. Der Service aber entspricht heutigen Anforderungen: Zimmer und Bad sind sauber, es gibt einen Gepäckaufbewahrungsraum und einen PC mit Drucker, um z.B. online einzuchecken u.ä., das Personal ist freundlich und hilfsbereit. 
Bei der Größe und der Anzahl Gäste verwundert es daher wenig, dass der Frühstücksraum vergleichsweise klein und eng bestückt ist. Das Frühstück selbst ist reichhaltig und gut, aber wirklich gemütlich ist es nicht.
Dafür ist man aber in 10-15 Minuten zu Fuß in der Innenstadt und in Temple Bar und der Zubringer zum Flughafen fährt fast vor der Haustür.",4,2019,08,29
229,Ottimo hotel a 10 minuti a piedi dal centro,"L'hotel si trova a 10 minuti a piedi dal centro ed è in una zona tranquilla dove si può dormire serenamente e godersi una bella colazione al risveglio. La colazione è abbondante per la parte ""irish breakfast"" ma un po' carente sulla parte dolce (incredibilmente non ci sono croissants e torte). Il personale è disponibile anche ad offrire una colazione in anticipo rispetto all'orario indicato di inizio (7.00) sotto forma di panino da asporto o colazione ""fredda"" in sala. La camera era spaziosa e pulita, la doccia nella norma (acqua calda in pochi secondi); forsenerano solo un po' piccoli i letti ma penso sia uno standard irlandese. Soddisfatto della scelta, ci tornerei.",4,2019,08,17
229,Empfehlenswert,"Superfreundliche Mitarbeiter, gutes Frühstück, gute Lage, Zimmer war etwas abgewohnt aber ruhig und sauber, sehr schöne Einrichtung, schöne Bar im Keller, das Essen dort war sehr lecker, das Bier sowieso. 
Alles gut, nächstes Mal gerne wieder.",4,2019,08,14
229,Impeccabile,"Leggendo le recensioni precedenti, sono partita con molte perplessità su questo hotel, scelto principalmente per la posizione centrale. In realtà la struttura è in stile georgiano, con dei bellissimi mobili d'epoca nelle sale comuni.
La stanza era pulitissima e molto confortevole, bello anche il bagno (finestrato, doccia con pareti in vetro).
L'hotel dispone anche di una spaziosissima stanza in cui depositare i bagagli in attesa del check in o del volo di ritorno.
Confermo che la posizione è perfetta per raggiungere comodamente a piedi tutti i luoghi più interessanti della città: 15 minuti da Temple Bar, 20 dal Trinity College, 30 dalla cattedrale di San Patrizio. La zona è inoltre servitissima dai mezzi pubblici; a pochi metri c'è la fermata dell'autobus Airlink Express 747 per l'aeroporto.
Consigliatissimo!",4,2019,08,13
229,"Gute Lage, leider sehr laut!","Das Personal ist sehr nett, das Frühstück auch sehr vielfältig, leider sind die Zimmer etwas einfach und sehr hellhörig, man glaubt, wenn der Zimmernachbar am WC ist, dass er sich im selben Zimmer befindet. Wir hatten einen Nachbarn, der mit seinen Kindern viel schimpfen musste, das war sehr mühsam. Auch die Straßenseite unserer Fenster hat nachts sehr gestört.",2,2019,07,24

229,A place to choose,"Ich war im April mit 2 Kolleginnen für 10 Tage Gast im Castle Hotel: Ein familiäres, gut ausgestattetes und nicht zu teures Hotel, das alles für Businessleute aber auch Touristen bietet, was man so braucht: kompetentes Personal, gute Ausstattung, eine Lobby mit vielen gemütlichen Sofas, 2 Restaurants, die ehrliche irische Küche bieten, sehr reichhaltiges Frühstück und eine Lage, die einerseits für eine Großstadt ruhig ist und andrerseits bestens angebunden in das öffentliche Verkehrsnetz. Viele Sehenswürdigkeiten und Theater und Kinos vor der Haustüre!",4,2019,07,05
229,"Lage Top, Zimmer etwas abgewohnt","Die Lage vom Hotel ist super. Ca 15 Minuten von Temple Bar und viele Pubs in der Nähe. Es ist ein altes Haus, hat auf jeden Fall Charissma. Allerdings hat es auch einige Mängel. Die Wände sind hauchdünn. Im Waschbecken lief das Wasser sehr schlecht ab und die Fenster zur Straße waren undicht. Dadurch zog es im Zimmer und es war sehr laut. Aber das Frühstück macht das alles wieder wett. Sehr reichhaltig. Und im Keller ist eine Bar und ein Restaurant. Für ein bis zwei Tage absolut in Ordnung wenn man nicht das Zimmer zur Straße hat",4,2019,06,14
229,Vacanza a Dublino,"L' hotel è tipico: legno, moquette, camini, mobili antichi e tapezzeria alle pareti.
Pulito, personale cortese. Colazione buona. La camera era luminosa e silenziosa. Il letto comodo.
Niente frigo bar (e ad una certa ora il bar dell' hotel chiude) e niente cassetta di sicurezza. Il bagno assolutamente insoddisfacente!!
Ovviamente niente bidet e la doccia ha il soffione fisdo in alto e la pressione dell' acqua scarsa. Il lavello è molto piccolo e senza miscelatore. C' è il rubinetto dell' acqua fredda e quello dell' acqua calda. Kit di cortesia ridotto all' osso (stampo, doccia schiuma e saponetta). Ho dovuto chiedere la cuffia per doccia in reception. Il bagno ha teso il rapporto qualità prezzo assolutamente insufficiente.",3,2019,05,25
229,Gute Wahl - zentral gelegen - Zimmer recht zugig,"Das Castle Hotel hatte viele Vorteile für uns. Es war sehr zentral gelegen. Typisch irisch eingerichtet, vor allem beim Eingangsbereich / Rezeption. Das Personal war aufmerksam. Auch das Restaurant und das Pub mit irischer Live Musik im Hotel gefiel uns sehr gut. Bei den angebotenen Speisen (vor allem im Restaurant) und beim Frühstück war für jeden Geschmack etwas dabei. Es war sehr viel los zur Frühstückszeit.

Man brauchte abends nicht ungedingt aus dem Haus, sondern konnte einfach mit dem Aufzug oder die Treppe runter ins Restaurant / Pub und den Abend musikalisch genießen. Sehr bequem und die Atmoshpäre war sehr angenehm. Die Bushaltestelle (für viele Busse) lag nur wenige Schritte vom Hotel entfernt  (Parnell Square E) sowie das Dublin Writers Museum (Parnell Square N). Die Bushaltestelle für die ankommenden Busse aus der Stadtmitte war etwas weiter entfernt. Man gelangte vom Hotel aus auf jeden Fall recht schnell zur Innenstadt und dem Temple Bar Viertel.

Mehrere Häuser  des Hotels  (ältestes Hotel in Dublin, las ich) waren zusammengelegt. Es gab extrem dicke lärmdämmende Teppichböden in den Fluren und Treppenhaus inkl. Lift, Safe, Wasserkocher, Wlan. 

Unser Hotelzimmer war einfach eingerichtet und es lag direkt an der Straße / Frederic Street B. Der Lärmpegel  des Straßenverkehrs war für uns ok. Direkt gegenüber war die Abbey Presbyterian Church. 

Die alten Fenster des Hotelzimmers konnte man nicht richtig schließen und es hat heftig gezogen. Normalerweise freue ich mich, wenn man Hotelfenster öffnen kann. Die Heizung fiel öfters aus und wir mussten dann bei der Rezeption telefonisch oder persönlich mehrmals darum bitten, die Heizung wieder anzustellen. Wie es in den Zimmer bei recht heißen Sommer-Temperaturen sein wird, kann ich nicht einschätzen. 

Wir besuchten in Dublin ein Konzert im Bord Gáis Energy Theatre. Dorthin gelangen wir mit Bussen, auf dem Rückweg nahmen wir ein Taxi (bei heftigen Regen) zum Castle Hotel. Anmerkung: Man musste beim Theater sehr lange auf ein Taxi warten. Das freundliche Hotelpersonal von gegenüber half den vielen wartenden Konzertbesuchern und forderte mehr Taxis an.

Insgesamt fühlten wir uns sehr wohl und würden gerne wieder dort wohnen.",4,2019,05,19
229,Alt und schön,"Altes, knorriges, verwinkeltes und gemütliches Haus. Recht gute Lage im Norden der Stadt. Zimmer zum Hinterhof sind ruhig, aber recht ringhörig. Beim Frühstück wird's manchmal eng. Freundliches und kompetentes Personal.",4,2019,05,13
229,Quattro giorni a Dublino ,"Abbiamo alloggiato in questo hotel, l abbiamo scelto per posizione e per il prezzo... però devo dire che la struttura carina per fuori e nelle aeree comuni... ma le stanze almeno quello che eravamo alloggiati noi era parecchio datata con finestre che nn si chiudevano bene.. la stanza molto rumorosa e poco confortevole.. lo staff molto gentile e anche la colazione nn male. A Dublino ci tornerò.. ma cambierei location..",3,2019,05,01
229,Esperienza positiva,"Le stanze sono spaziose e pulite.

Molto comodo al centro e vicino alla fermata della linea che porta in aeroporto.",5,2019,04,30
229,Fotos engañosas y limpieza desastrosa. Relacion calidad/precio: carísimo,"Las fotos del hotel aparentan mas calidad de la real. Al llegar, lo primero que hacen es cobrarte la estancia total, seguramente para que cuando veas qué habitaciones has pagado, no salgas corriendo a buscar otro hotel.
Los baños no salen en las fotos del hotel, porque son muy flojos, y antiguos. La bañera es de ducha fija y cortina
El wifi es bastante malo.
Las personas de recepción poco simpáticas y la limpieza es un desastre. 
Encontramos la habitación con una botella usada y un calcetín usado dentro del armario, que no se llevaron aunque lo avisamos en recepción todos los días.
Las camas solo hacen lo que se vé, las sábanas interiores no las estiran quedando a la vista el colchón. Los pijamas los arrugan y los dejan hechos una bola en cualquier sitio, como si molestaran.
Y se empeñaban en sacar del armario cada día los cojines de la cama y las colchas, que dejábamos guardados por alergia, seguramente no los habían lavado nunca.
El hotel no dispone de habitaciones sin moqueta para los alérgicos.
El hotel no dispone de personal en recepción que hable español, aunque vimos 5 personas distintas durante la estancia. Muy poca visión turística.
No volveremos
La parte positiva: El trato con Ana, (restaurante del desayuno) y Molly (restaurante de la noche y del desayuno). Las personas que atendían el desayuno son muy agradables y atentas. El restaurante de la bodega, con música en vivo, muy agradable. Aunque antes de cerrar la cocina no avisan y te dejan sin postre.",1,2019,04,22

229,Ottima posizione per alloggiare a Dublino!,"L'hotel è facilmente raggiungibile a piedi dal centro e molto vicino alle fermate dei bus per l'aeroporto e dei bus per le escursioni fuori Dublino. 
Le camere sono un po' vecchiotte e la mia era particolarmente piccola, ma confortevole e non mancava nulla per un buon riposo. 
Personale super gentile e disponibile!
Colazione ok, non mancava nulla. Sono stati gentili ad aprire il buffet ""freddo"" (croissant, pane, affettati e formaggi) 15 minuti prima dell'orario ufficiale di apertura perché quel giorno dovevo partire presto per un'escursione! Possibile anche avere la colazione al sacco. 
Il ristorante dell'hotel è molto buono e caratteristico con musica dal vivo irlandese. Prezzi forse un po' alti, ma Dublino è generalmente cara.",4,2019,04,17
229,Zugig,"Die Lage am Parnell Square ist nicht schlecht (hier hält auch der AirLink, also der Flughafenbus), allerdings ist die Gegend abends nicht unbedingt vertrauenerweckend. Das Personal ist zwar freundlich, aber nicht zuvorkommend. Der Frühstückskaffee war fürchterlich ( mittlerweile eine Ausnahme in Dublin), die scrambled eggs waren wässrig und in meinem Zimmer hat es trotz zugemachtem Fenster sehr stark gezogen (Einfachverglasung und Spalt unter der Tür). Die Kellerbar ist nett, die Speisenauswahl für Vegetarier allerdings sehr eingeschränkt.",3,2019,03,17
229,soggiorno a dublino,"sono stato 5 notti al castle hotel con moglie e figlio e sua consorte, l'hotel e' sistemato in zona vicina al centro ,( 10 minuti a piedi ), e'un po' datato  (moquette anni 70 ) ma pulito,  comprese le camere, il bar che fa' anche da ristorante a pranzo e' efficiente e  la colazione ed il pranzo sono buoni ma no da 4 stelle, in alcuni siti indicano che sono poliglotta , nessuno li parla italiano nel senso che nemmeno si sforzano, in particolare una signora bionda anche molto impertinente alla reception, invece un suo collega di colore e' stato l'unico molto disponibile sopratutto perche' ,per 3 giorni,abbiamo avuto la stanza con il termosifone spento, tenete presente che a dublino quando fa' freddo lo fa' davvero, credo che in generale con gli italiani non posso dire che li odiano ma se non ci vanno non si strappano i capelli",3,2019,03,05

Habitaciones muy acogedoras y de tamaño normal. Muy limpio y con buen servicio de habitaciones. Es como un palacete con muchos salones y habitaciones, y todo enmoquetado de rojo , en definitiva con mucho encanto. El personal excelente. Si volviese a Dublin volvería a este hotel. ",4,2019,02,18
229,Charme mit Abstrichen,"Das hotel hat eine ansprechende Optik. Die Innenausstattung ist sehr gemütlich und so typisch Irish / English. Ganz viele Polstermöbel und Schränke aus vergangenen Tagen. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Die Zimmer schön eingerichtet, ein bisschen verstaubt, aber mit Liebe zum Detail. Großes Manko ist allerdings die Heizung. Die Heizkörper werden abends um 17:30 angestellt, laufen die ganze Nacht und werden morgens nach der Zimmerreinigung wieder abgestellt. Tagsüber ist es eiskalt. Nachts schwitzt man total. Badezimmer sind komplett ungeheizt. Die Fenster stammen wahrscheinlich noch aus dem vorigen Jahrhundert. Die Spalten sind so groß, dass man mit der Hand durchgreifen kann. Wir waren 4 Tage dort, waren gezwungener Maßen den ganzen Tag unterwegs und sind erst abends wieder zurück ins hotel gekommen, weil ein Aufenthalt tagsüber unmöglich war. Es waren 2 Grad Celsius Außentemperatur und drinnen ca. 12 Grad Celsius. Ein Mitarbeiter hat uns am 2. Tag einen Radiator ins Zimmer gestellt, der aber nach kurzer Zeit von alleine wieder ausging. Das Frühstück war nichts besonderes, hat aber gereicht. Die Lage ist sehr gut, 10 Minuten bis zur Innenstadt. Ich denke, im Sommer ist dieses Hotel wirklich zu empfehlen. ",3,2019,02,15

Es sollte für jeden etwas dabei sein.
Wir werden beim nächsten Dublinbesuch gerne wieder kommen.",5,2019,02,10
229,Pro e contro,"Note positive:

- ottima posizione, cinque minuti dalla fermata del bus per aeroporto (Aircoach e Airlink), anche meno dal capolinea Parnell della Luas Line. Attraversando la strada si trova la Hugh Lane Gallery.

- ottimi alla reception, professionali, precisi e rapidi. Nulla da dire sulla pulizia in camera

- bella la sala della reception, bellissimo il locale adiacente, puro stile georgiano

- tutte le sere, nel ristorante al piano sotterraneo (dove si mangia bene a prezzi corretti) musica dalle 9 alle 11. Piacevole

- bella atmosfera in generale, per un hotel che - sta scritto - ""established"" da piu' di 200 anni

Cosi' e cosi:

- si fanno pagare: hotel a 3 stelle, ma prezzi di categoria superiore, ho capito che c'era la concomitanza di Irlanda Inghilterra al Six Nations, pero' ...insomma...non costava poco

- forse è colpa mia, ma faceva un caldo notevole in camera e non stato capace di regolare la temperatura

- bagno, diciamo un po' ""datato"" , dotazione di cortesia al minimo indispensabile

Note negative:

- la colazione. Mi aspettavo molto di piu', siamo in Irlanda, da queste parti il breakfast è un punto forte. E cosa mi trovo? Un solo tipo di formaggio, un solo tipo di prosciutto, totalmente impersonali, stile pensione italiana in riviera romagnola (senza offesa per la categoria). Certo, si trova anche bacon, salsicce e uova (non a buffet, ma servite dal personale), e ci mancherebbe pero' la sensazione è decisamente modesta. Non parliamo poi della parte dolce, che definirei semplicemente triste. Da queste parti, anche a livello inferiore, si è visto di molto meglio

- insonorizzazione delle camere. Si sente tutto, ma proprio tutto, dalle camere vicine e da chi cammina nei corridoi.

Pro e contro di un hotel comunque che rimane una buona soluzione con la sua posizione strategica",3,2019,02,04
229,"Buono, con qualcosa da migliorare","Siamo stati al Castle Hotel in 13 nel mese di gennaio e tutto sommato siamo stati bene, se non fosse per alcune piccole cose. Il personale è molto professionale e gentile e gli ambienti sono molto accoglienti. La.colazione è ottima sia per quanto riguarda il salato (Irish Breakfast) che il dolce. La pulizia delle stanze è buona ma nella nostra stanza non funzionava il rubinetto dell'acqua calda del lavandino (non c'era il miscelatore). Dopo le nostre lamentele ci hanno subito cambiato la stanza dove c'era il miscelatore ma non funzionava il riscaldamento (hanno risolto il problema con una stufa elettrica). Comunque devo dire che a tutti i miei amici tutto ciò non è successo e le cose sono andate abbastanza bene: una coppia ha addirittura avuto una stanza col letto a baldacchino! 
In fin dei conti sento di consigliarvi questo albergo, anche perché si trova a 10 minuti a piedi dal centro e a 100 metri dalla fermata del tram che vi porta direttamente in aeroporto.",4,2019,02,03

Posizione ideale: è centrale, ma defilato. In pochi minuti ci si trova sul viale principale, una decina di minuti dallo Spire. 
Le camere sono ben organizzate e pulite per lo standard del posto. Nota per chi necessita dell'asciugacapelli: ha una buona potenza, non è il tipico phon senza brio.
Ho apprezzato molto anche la colazione, servita nel Bar dell'hotel: ragazzi giovani e gentili servono le bevande e a buffet si trova sia dolce che salato. La varietà non è esagerata, ma si trova tutto quello che serve! 
Lo Staff è premuroso e cordiale.

Il soggiorno al Castle Hotel è stato perfetto. L’hotel è in posizione ottimale: praticamente centrale e strategico per tutte le principali attrazioni che, da qui, sono raggiungibili facilmente a piedi.
L’hotel è enorme, in stile georgiano, con tante graziose sale per intrattenersi (peraltro ben addobbate per le festività natalizie). La reception - che avevamo contattato prima dell’arrivo - ci ha riservato una camera molto spaziosa e molto ben tenuta, sempre fornita di the e caffè da potersi preparare con il bollitore, biscottini e cioccolatini.
La colazione inclusa nella nostra prenotazione è stata davvero buona, con buffet che include dolce e salato.
Il personale al buffet, in sala ed in reception è estremamente cortese, disponibile e sorridente: un dettaglio che rende il soggiorno qui tanto piacevole.
Siamo stati davvero bene al Castle Hotel e, per questo, lo consigliamo a tutti!",5,2018,12,15

229,Un tuffo nello stile georgiano.,"Il Castel Hotel è stato proprio una piacevolissima sorpresa anche se avevamo letto delle tante positive recensioni fatte dagli ospiti. Subito, appena entrati nella hall dell'Hotel,  si è avvolti dall'atmosfera e dallo stile delle case anglosassoni. Lo stesso vale per le camere, abbastanza spaziose e molto confortevoli. Anche se, nella nostra camera, quando siamo entrati, forse c'erano 40° ed abbiamo subito spento il termosifone ed aperto l'angusta finestrella per far entrare un po' di aria fresca. 
La colazione è sicuramente abbondante anche se prettamente ""Irish"". Per chi non gradisce appesantirsi lo stomaco a prima mattina, comunque ci sono yogurt, croissant ed altra roba più ""leggere"" (pane tostato, confetture di frutta, miele, ecc. ecc.). Purtroppo il terzo giorno, tutta la pasticceria era già finita (...eppure erano appena le 8:50) e ci è voluto un po' di tempo perché la rifornissero. Ovviamente il ""caffè"" non è lontanamente paragonabile a quello italiano… :(",5,2018,12,06
229,Posizione ottima,"Posizione a due passi da O’Connel Street, zona molto tranquilla. 
La colazione è molto fornita, sia di dolce che di salato, e la sala colazione è ben organizzata. 
Il bagno è un pochino fatiscente, vasca da bagno con tenda sporca, rubinetti del lavandino traballanti, barra portasciugamani rotta. Tuttavia queste piccole pecche si fanno perdonare dalla comodità della struttura e dalla colazione abbondante. ",3,2018,11,25

Consiglio vivamente una sosta ad entrambi i ristoranti dell’hotel: the Old Music Shop, dove vengono servite le colazioni, ma anche pranzo e cene con proposta di piatti irlandesi molto ben cucinati, e the Castle Vaults, un ristorante bar situato nelle cantine, ristrutturate a creare un ambiente di atmosfera, con spettacoli di musica irlandese dal vivo tutte le sere. Ubicato a due passi da O’Connell Street, non vi servirà altro per rendere indimenticabile il vostro soggiorno dublinese. Vivamente consigliato!",5,2018,10,21
229,Ottimo!!,"Ho alloggiato in questo hotel per 3 notti da sola e mi son trovata benissimo.

Das Haus ist zwar gregorianischen Ursprungs und in seinen Gemeinschaftsräumen entsprechend eingerichtet, die Ausstattung der Zimmer ist jedoch modern.
Zum Frühstück gibt es eine reiche Auswahl an Speisen u.A. Ist ein Full Irish Breakfast erhältlich.
In den Kellergewölben ist eine Bar untergebracht, ein Künstler spielte an beiden Abenden irische Songs. Bemerkung am Rande: der Bierpreis dort war günstiger als in Temple Bar...",5,2018,10,03

229,Okay,"Das Hotel liegt ziemlich zentral was sehr positiv ist. Was ich zu bemängeln habe ist das das Hotel ziemlich hellhörig ist. Was uns nicht wirklich störte, aber unsere Nachbarin die uns mehrfach zusammenstauchte, anscheinend schon. ",3,2018,09,16
229,Sono sempre titubante nel preferire grandi hotel.ma devo esprimere la mia soddisfazione nell aver trovato in hotel eduar,"Sono valeri gian paolo. Sono solo.sono stato titubante nel decidere su quale albergo potessi trovare. Arrivato al hotel eduard di igea marina mi sono ricreduto. Ho trovato amici, una splendida vacanza di divertimento e riposo. A pranzo e cena hanno preparato piatti buonissimi. Mamma elvira cura con tanto amore I suoi piatti. Ho trovato piena accoglienza con tutti, dalla cucina alle camere. Le ragazze di sala mi hanno accolto in modo splendido. Non mi sono solo divertito.. I titolari dell hotel mi hanno fatto sentire bene come puo fare un amico. Ho gia prenotato per le vacanze di pasqua e tornero anche la prossima estate con altri amici. Grazie tutto il personale dell hotel eduard",5,2018,09,14
229,Zentral und gutes Hotel in Dublin,"Von hier kann man Dublin sehr gut zu Fuss erkunden. Es gibt Parkplätze im Hof und damit ist das Auto gut verstaut. Das Frühstück ist ok, aber könnte besser und umfangreicher sein. Wartezeiten, weil keine Plätze frei sind, sind sehr bedauerlich und trüben den Start in den Tag. Die Zimmer sind charmant und in altem Stil. Man schläft gut und das Personal ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit.",4,2018,09,06
229,"Centralissimo, buon rapporto qualità/prezzo","Hotel tradizionale (le camere si aprono ancora con la chiave ), pulito ed elegante ; camere familiari un po' piccole, ma ci si sta senza problemi, con letto matrimoniale, letto singolo e lettino aggiuntivo.

Dall'istante in cui ho prenotato (mesi e mesi prima) hanno costantemente risposto alle mie e-mail, cosa che per me è fondamentale! In alcuni giorni ho avuto necessità di anticipare di molto l'orario della colazione e mi hanno sempre accontentata! Gentilissime le ragazze a colazione e l'addetto alla reception di notte!!",5,2018,08,27
229,Da rivedere,"L'Hotel è posizionato nella parte Nord di O'Connel Street ma è abbastanza centrale e comunque ben servito dai mezzi pubblici. L'interno mi ha lasciato qualche dubbio sia per la presenza della moquette ovunque che per l'utilizzo di un arredo molto vecchio e usurato in camera. Stanza ampia ma priva di frigo bar, aria condizionata e cassaforte e con bagno piccolo e lavandino senza miscelatore. Buona la pulizia della camera e del bagno con cambio asciugamani giornaliero.

229,Un gioiello,"Siamo arrivati in albergo di notte e non ci è stato fatto alcun problema per il ritardo del check in, il night manager è veramente gentilissimo. L’albergo aveva tutte le comodità del mondo, a parte essere veramente stupendo all’interno. Il riscaldamento funziona veramente benissimo, ed è importante perché a Dublino di inverno si gela. Non fanno problemi riguardo al portare cibo all’interno, nonostante abbiano un ristorante, più volte abbiamo preso panini da subway e mangiato in camera. Camera molto comoda, spazi bene organizzati. L’hotel offre un enorme bagaglio di altri servizi un supplemento come fitto di attrezzature, servizio lavanderia o addirittura baby sitter. L’unica pecca è la colazione veramente poco ricca ma è tutto buonissimo lo stesso (mangiate le patate!). Il ristorante e tra i più economici di Dublino anche se per lo standard italiano siamo già sopra la media, ma si mangia benissimo. Le aree comuni sono tantissime è davvero belle e comode. C’è anche un internet point gratuito.",5,2018,07,31
229,"Bueno, pero lee los comentarios","El hotel este limpio, cerca de O`coonel Street, bien comunicado con el bus del aeropuerto, decorado antigo irlandés, PERO: nohablan ni jota de español, tuvimos nosotros que esforzarnos en hablar en ngles que ellos hablar una sola palabra en castellano.
Es un buen hotel para dormir, comodo y limpio, bien comujnicado pero eso, ni papa de españaol, moivo por el qe le pongo NORMAL, anque se merecería una MEJOR PUNTUACIÓN. 
Tuvieron el detalle de hacernos unos sandwiches porque nos ibamos de excursion y no nos daba tiempo a desayunar, se lo comentamos la noche de antes y sin problema.
Ah, un  caos internos param llegar hasta las habitaciones, a tene en cuenta que han unido varios edificios y cada uno tiene una distribucion diferente y eso hace que subas, bajes y llegues loco hasta la habitacion.",3,2018,07,30

Es una casa señorial convertida en hotel, que combina lo vintage con zonas confortables y actuales como el restaurante-cafetería. Personalmente me ha encantado y aunque la habitación no tenía la decoración coordinada de la foto que se ve aquí, recordaba a Ágata Cristie, con su chimenea cegada, su papel de flores y su moqueta decorada.

Las habitaciones, al pertenecer a diferentes edificios colindantes, son muy dispares. Eramos un grupo y sorprendía la diferencia entre unas y otras, todas al mismo precio. Dispone de acogedores salones, muy bien decorados. Muy cerca a unos tres minutos, en dirección al centro, está el Pub Murray, totalmente aconsejable, con muy buena comida, buen ambiente y música en directo. Y un poquito más abajo, el restaurante del hotel Gresham, de la cadena Riu, ofrece variados sandwich, para descansar un poco de la comida irlandesa. Además, está abierto hasta una hora más tarde que los pub, que cierran la cocina muy pronto.",4,2018,06,24
229,Castle Hotel non delude le aspettative,Abbiamo pianificato a lungo il ritorno in Irlanda e abbiamo deciso ancora a settembre dell’anno scorso di tornare a soggiornare in questo hotel come nel 2016. Abbiamo soggiornato così dal 9 al 19 giugno. Come ho espresso nel titolo Castle Hotel non delude le aspettative. Posizione strategica a 2 passi dal centro (O’Connel Street). Personale estremamente gentile e davvero disponibile. A ogni nostra richiesta hanno cercato di aiutarci/risolvere nel miglior modo possibile. Tipico stile Georgiano delle camere. Pulito e accogliente. Era bello tornare sfiniti la sera e goderci la tranquillità di questo hotel. Nota dolente la mancanza del bidè in camera ma non è un difetto di questo hotel in se ma una prerogativa (purtroppo) della maggior parte degli hotel all’estero. La doccia aveva qualche piccolo problema con la regolazione dell’acqua calda/fredda ma niente di grave. Colazione stile Irlandesee discreta varietà. Se dovessimo tornare una terza volta in Irlanda probabilmente sceglieremmo ancora questo hotel. CONSIGLIATO. A+,4,2018,06,22
229,Zentrales Hotel mit einigen Macken,"Unser Aufenthalt im Castle Hotel war durchwachsen. 
Auf der einen Seite war das Hotelpersonal stets freundlich und sehr bemüht, auf der anderen Seite stimmte das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis einfach nicht.
Zunächst sei angemerkt, dass es sich hier um ein wirklich altes, zusammengelegtes Gebäude handelt (hat definitiv seinen eigenen Charme) und daher hatten wir uns schon vorab auf knarrende Böden und nicht modernstes Interieur eingestellt. 
Das Hotel liegt schön zentral und bietet somit einen super Ausgangspunkt für unterschiedlichste Unternehmungen. 
Unser Zimmer war insgesamt in Ordnung und sauber, allerdings roch es im Bad zeitweise unerträglich, besonders abends und morgens nach dem Aufstehen kam uns ein äußerst unangenehmer Gestank aus den Abflüssen und der Toilette entgegen.
Das Mobiliar sollte an einigen Stellen lieber erneuert werden, da es teilweise einfach nur abgenutzt ist. 
Das gesamte Gebäude, einschließlich der Zimmer ist extrem hellhörig und man  kriegt jede Bewegung der Nachbarn mit.
Die Zimmertüren lassen sich leider nicht von innen abschließen, was ich als sehr störend empfunden habe.
Mit dem oben genannten konnten wir uns noch ganz gut arrangieren, aber das angebotene Frühstück ist einfach eine bodenlose Frechheit. 
Man kann sich zum einen für ein full Irish breakfast entscheiden (dieses wird wie in einer Kantine ausgegeben und besteht aus wässrigen Pilzen, pampigen Bohnen, geschmacklosem Fertigrührei !!, öligem Spiegelei und Speck niedrigster Qualität), zum anderen wird Toast (wenn nicht gerade vergriffen) mit Käse oder Marmelade angeboten. 
Für 210€ die Nacht erwarte ich insgesamt einfach deutlich mehr und schon gar nicht ein solches Frühstück. Das ist frech und kann auch nicht mit einer zentralen Lage innerhalb der Hauptstadt Irlands gerechtfertigt werden.",3,2018,06,18
229,Ottimo e abbondante...piacevole scoperta,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel dall'11 Giugno al 15 Giugno in una matrimoniale. A parte la posizione strategica ho apprezzato la pulizia, il silenzio, l'ottima colazione sia irlandese che continentale, la cortesia e la discrezione del personale. La camera ottima e silenziosa e l'arredamento in perfetto stile georgiano....veramente una piacevole scoperta ...lo consiglio vivamente per qualsiasi tipo di viaggio sia di affari che di piacere....",5,2018,06,18
229,Vacanze,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel per cinque giorni.hotel delizioso e l arredamento rispetta il periodo storico della edificio.la stanza piccola ma ben ordinata e tenuta pulita.personale cortese e gentile. hotel piacevolmente tranquillo e in un ottima posizione : 15 minuti a piedi per arrivare a Temple bar.

Che dire, soddisfatti!

229,"Viel Charme, gute Bar, die Zimmer nicht alle in Ordnung","Der erste Eindruck war durchaus positiv. Die Fassade und die öffentlichen Räume sind wirklich charmant. Zumindest unser Zimmer (201) hielt nicht, was der erste Eindruck versprach. Die Einrichtung, der Teppichboden und vor allem das Badezimmer waren zerschlissen, insgesamt vermittelte das Zimmer den Eindruck einer Kammer für mitreisende Dienstboden. Dieser Eindruck wurde durch den an einem billigen Plastikanhänger befestigten Schlüssel noch verstärkt. Immerhin waren die Betten bequem und gutem Zustand, das nur einen Spalt zu öffnende Fenster und die die ganze Nacht laufende Toilettenspülung haben den Schlafkomfort allerdings reduziert. Trotz des ordentlichen Frühstücks und der Bar mit super Live-Musik werde ich das Castle Hotel bei einem weiteren Aufenthalt in Dublin nicht in Betracht ziehen.",3,2018,06,14

229,Bellissima esperienza,"L'hotel si trova in una posizione ottima, a pochi minuti da The Spire e a 10/15 dal quartiere Temple Bar. Grazie alla sua posizione, abbiamo potuto vedere tutte le attrazioni principali senza prendere mezzi di trasporto (eccezion fatta per quelle situate più fuori mano).

229,Wenn 9 historische Gebäude schon seit 1809 zum hotel zusammengelegt wurden...,"...dann muss man als Gast natürlich mit verwinkelten Gängen, phantasievoll integrierten Bädern, Stufen und nostalgischem Charme rechnen. All das bietet Castle Hotel! Wir mochten es, mitsamt dem plüschigen Ambiente und den kleinen Einschränkungen, die man für solch einen stilvollen Aufenthalt erwartet und toleriert. 
Sehr freundliches, hilfsbereites Personal, die Lieblingsvokabel ist ""lovely"". Das gilt genau so für das angeschlossene Restaurant im ehemaligen Weinkeller: Spätestens beim zweiten Besuch wird man wieder erkannt und wie ein alter Freund begrüßt-man ist in Irland! :-)",4,2018,03,17
229,Das Hotel ist zentral aber relativ alt und hellhörig,"Positiv war, dass das Hotel sehr zentral gelegen ist und die Zimmer sind sehr sauber. Es hat eine 24h Reception, dadurch kann man um jede Uhrzeit etwas fragen etc. 

Negativ war, dass die Zimmer relativ alt sind, bei einem unserer Betten war der Fuss abgebrochen, dadurch war das Bett schräg. Ein weiterer leider negativer Punkt, ist die hellhörigkeit der Zimmer, so hatten wir neben uns jemand der geschnarcht hat, dies hat man so gehört, als würde die Person fast im gleichen Zimmer schlafen. Leider sind die Mitarbeiter am Empfang nicht wirklich sehr höflich, es wird nicht gegrüsst und man wird einwenig bevormundet behandelt.",3,2018,03,14

Das Einzelzimmer war sehr gut ausgestattet, mit TV, Telefon, Wasserkocher, Tee und Fön. Die Wasserhähne für Warm- und Kaltwasser waren etwas umständlich zu benutzen, das Bad an sich war in gutem Zustand. Die über die website gebuchte Bustour in den Nationalpark Wicklow Mountains wurde abgesagt, da sie im Winter nur am Wochenende stattfindet, konnte aber durch das freundliche Personal über einen anderen Anbieter ohne zusätzliche Kosten noch am selben Tag ermöglicht werden. Das Frühstück bietet eine Auswahl an verschiedenen europäischem und irischen Speisen. Die KellnerInnen sind ausgesprochen höflich und zuvorkommend.

Abbiamo chiesto per due sere consecutive una bottiglia d’acqua che non ci hanno fatto pagare. Inoltre è possibile avere l’adattatore per le prese di corrente in comodato d’uso pagando 10€. Non abbiamo pagato il deposito bagagli.

Stanze di buone dimensioni, ordinate e pulite. Personale cortese e disponibile. Ottimo sistema WiFi disponibile in tutte le aree della struttura. Buona colazione internazionale tipica dei paesi nordici.  Il locale dispone anche di un comodo e accogliente pub/ristorante per degustare tipici piatti locali e la mitica birra Guinnes, ascoltando musica locale dal vivo. 
La posizione della struttura è veramente comoda sia per la vicinanza alle fermate del Bus Airlink, che collegano Dublino all'aeroporto, sia per la disponibilità di diverse fermate dei vari mezzi di trasporto pubblici della città. A tal proposito consiglio a tutti di acquistare le Leap Card che consente di viaggiare in liberta su tutti i mezzi per 1, 3 o 7 giorni.",4,2018,02,04

Seconda camera con bagni freddissimo peggio della prima serramenti con spifferi in cui sarebbero passati piaccioni

Unica pecca, ma magari è stato solo un caso, la camera non era particolarmente calda, soprattutto il bagno ( e considerato che ci sono stata a dicembre non è stato così piacevole fare la doccia).
In ogni caso lo consiglierei.",4,2018,01,17
229,Ottimo e a pochi metri dal centro,"Albergo molto stile british, con i caratteristici pavimenti e scale in legno che scricchiolano ad ogni passaggio (come nei famosi telefilm dell'Ispettore Barnaby) e le volte basse. Gli addetti sono tutti molto cordiali e ben disposti. I locali sono ben tenuti e puliti, pur se tutto ""moquettato"". Accettabili anche se piccole le stanze, con letti che conciliano il sonno. Mancano le prese di corrente in vicinanza dei comodini (se dovete ricaricare i cellulari). Piccolo ma funzionale il bagno. Il wi-fi è ottimo in tutta la struttura. Buona la prima colazione, anche se senza lodi particolari. La parte migliore però è il ristorante, situato negli scantinati ben tenuti e molto belli. Buona la carta con le sue varie proposte. Inoltre nei fine settimana c'è musica live non invasiva. Consiglio di passarci almeno una serata.",4,2018,01,16

229,Un viaggio nel periodo Georgiano,"Albergo caratteristico diverso dai soliti moderni, qui si vive nel passato.

La posizione è strategica perchè con una passeggiata di 15 minuti si arriva a Grafton Street in pieno centro. In alternativa, la fermata dell'autobus è a pochi passi. L'arredamento Georgiano che lo caratterizza crea una piacevole atmosfera e il personale è gentile. La mia stanza (singola) era abbastanza spaziosa e il bagno appena rinnovato. Le stanze, comunque, non hanno tutte le stesse caratteristiche anche perchè l'hotel ha più piani e blocchi abitativi e potreste trovarne qualcuna più datata. L'hotel offre una colazione molto abbondante tutti i giorni e c'è un gradevole ristorante nel seminterrato dove si ascolta anche buona musica dal vivo.",4,2017,10,30
229,Gute Lage - recht alte Zimmer,"Lage: Das Hotel liegt recht zentral, sodass wir alle unsere Ziele zu Fuß erreichen konnten.  

Zimmer: Unser Zimmer war bereits recht alt und teilweise ging die Tapete von den Wänden ab. Zudem empfand ich das Zimmer als recht hellhörig, sodass man auch viele Geräusche aus den Nebenzimmern hörte.

Sauberkeit: Ich persönlich empfand die Sauberkeit als in Ordnung und konnte keine größeren Mängel feststellen.

Frühstück: Das Frühstück war typisch irisch mit vielen warmen Lebensmitteln. Trifft nicht meinen persönlichen Geschmack, war aber in Ordnung.

Service: Das Personal war meiner Meinung nach etwas kühl – ich bin es gewohnt, dass gegrüßt wird, wenn man ein Hotel betritt, was hier nicht der Fall war.",3,2017,10,30
229,Super Lage - Schönes Haus,"Das Castle liegt kurz oberhalb der O'Connell Street und damit mitten in der Stadt. Alle wichtigen Sehenswürdigkeiten sind bequem zu Fuß zu erreichen. Dank mehrerer Bushaltestellen in unmittelbarer Nähe und dem hervorragenden Dubliner öffentlichen Nahverkehr lässt auch dies keine Wünsche offen.

Bereits der Eingangsbereich versprüht einen gemütlich-altmodischen Charme mit dicken Teppichen und bequemen Sitzgelegenheiten. Die Zimmer sind zweckmäßig eingerichtet und bieten bequeme Betten für einen erholsamen Schlaf. Leider sind die Wände ziemlich hellhörig, so dass empfindliche Ohren durchaus mal lauterer Gespräche in den Nachbarzimmern mithören können. Unser Zimmer im dritten Stock lag zum Hinterhof und war, was Straßenlärm anging, angenehm ruhig. Das Badezimmer war zweckmäßig, der Wasserdruck der Dusche optimal.  

Der Frühstücksbereich im Restaurant des Hotels war relativ eng gestellt, bei der Anzahl der Gäste allerdings auch kein Wunder. Das Frühstück selber war sehr gut. Am warmen Buffet gab es alles was das Herz begehrte von Eiern in verschiedenen Varianten über Bohnen bis zu gebratenen Pilzen blieben keine Wünsche offen. Für Freunde eines eher kontinentalen Frühstücks war mit Schinken, Käse, Brötchen und verschiedenen Marmeladen ebenfalls gesorgt. Außerdem wurde frisches Gebäck und auf Wunsch auch ein hervorragender Porridge serviert. Alles in allem ein perfekter Start in den Tag.

Das Personal war im gesamten Hotel sehr freundlich und auskunftsbereit und konnten mit allerhand Tipps für eine tolle Zeit in Dublin aufwarten. 

Das Castle ist nur zu empfehlen und unser Hotel für den nächsten Aufenthalt in Dublin steht garantiert schon fest.",5,2017,10,27
229,Centralissimo !,"Hotel in posizione strategica per visitare Dublino, lo Spire è a 200 mt, mezzi, pub e ristoranti a pochi passi;
L'Hotel è abbastanza ""vecchiotto"" e necessiterebbe di un bel restauro !!!
Le camere discrete e funzionali, arredate in modo semplice, necessiterebbero della sostituzione della vecchia e sporca ""moquette""; mancano il frigobar e la cassaforte;  il bagno piccolo e poco funzionale andrebbe ""rivisto"" con schemi più attuali; Riscaldamento carente e Wi-Fi ottimo completano il quadro della stanza;
La colazione viene servita in modo disorganizzato in salette stracolme di clienti con tavolini vicinissimi. L'assortimento non è troppo vario vario, la qualità è mediocre e spesso gli espositori ed i vassoi rimangono vuoti.
Discreto ed economico il ristorante, ottima la zuppa.
Personale cortese e disponibile, ottimo rapporto qualità/prezzo.",3,2017,10,23
229,Si viviera en los 80 mi opinión sería muy buena,Primero diré que el personal muy atento y muy amable ( no hablan español). Todo muy  limpio. Hotel estilo tradicional lo mejor muy céntrico. Decoración estilo años 80.  Moqueta en todas partes menos en el baño. Los pasillos muy estrechos tanto que el personal de limpieza no disponen de carros para llevar toallas y productos . El baño correcto no muy moderno pero limpio. El desayuno muy mejorable. Algo inesperado me dieron una llave para la habitación en vez de una tarjeta.,3,2017,10,17
229,Gute Lage - aber sonst nicht viel Gutes.,"Das Hotel liegt direkt am Rande des Zentrums. 
Die Zimmer waren sauber.
Im Bad war keine Heizung.
Aus der Dusche kam nur ein dünnes Rinnsal.
Der Frühstücksraum ist ungemütlich und eng.
An einem Morgen haben wir rund 10 Minuten auf einen Frühstückstisch warten müssen. Anschließend gab es Wartezeiten am Buffet. Zu wenig Personal für die Zahl der Gäste.
Es fehlten Marmelade und Brot, es wurde nichts nachgelegt.
Obst war nicht frisch, frischen Saft gab es ebenfalls nicht.",2,2017,10,05
229,"Molto carino, ci torneremo volentieri","Sono stata in questo hotel a setttembre con la mia famiglia (2 bimbe di 5 e 9 anni) ci siamo trovati molto bene.
La posizione è ottima, appena si esce ci si trova sulla strada principale piena di negozi, supermercati, ristoranti di tutti i tipi.
Il personale è giovane, carino e davvero molto cortese, sempre disponibile a dare informazioni e a realizzare ogni richiesta.
L'albergo è ben curato e pulito, negli spazi comuni ci sono diversi salottini che le mie bimbe adoravano e in cui abbiamo passato alcune ore leggendo e giocando.
La camera era abbastanza spaziosa per 4 persone, niente letto a castello, ma due comodi letti per le bimbe, no piccole brande aggiunte. Era molto pulita e anche il bagno non era male, con i necessari accessori come cuffie, sapone ecc.
Unica pecca il lavandino con i due rubinetti acqua calda e fredda, ma ci si adatta bene ...
Buona la colazione, con molta varietà salata e anche dolce.
Il vero punto di forza sono i due risotranti, in cui si mangia bene, il personale è cortese e gentile ma soprattutto il pub in cui si può mangiare o solo bere e dalle 21 fanno musica dal vivo. Una sera essendo stanchi siamo rimasti in hotel e ci è molto piaciuto, anche alle bimbe.
Lo consiglio davvero.",4,2017,10,05
229,Kleines Zimmer,"Das Hotel liegt nah an Zentrum. Schöne Möbel, dicke Teppiche, aber die besten Zeiten sind vorbei. Unser Zimmer war sehr sehr klein, die Möbel alt, das Bad ohne Fenster. Die Fenster im Zimmer waren nur schwer zu öffnen, der Blick ging zum Innenhof, wodurch es auch zu Lärmbelästigung am späten Abend und am frühen Morgen kam. Die Lärmbelästigung vom Zimmer über uns war auch nervend. Dublin ist wirklich schön, das Wetter war prima, so dass wir uns im Zimmer nicht mehr als notwendig aufhielten mussten.
Das Frühstück war okay, in der Bar war der Service sehr unterschiedlich. Aber die Live Musik war gut.

Alle Räume sind schön eingerichtet, die Betten sind gut und es gibt ein reichhaltiges Frühstücksbuffet bei dem für jeden etwas dabei ist. 
Auch Mittag- und Abendessen ist im Hotel sehr empfehlenswert! Sie haben eine sehr gute Küche und die Bar/Restaurant im Untergeschoss ist sehr gemütlich mit stimmungsvoller Live-Musik jeden Abend!
Das Personal ist sehr sehr freundlich und bemüht einem jeden Wunsch zu erfüllen!
Man fühlt sich gleich von Beginn an sehr willkommen!
Von der Lage her liegt das Hotel optimal an einem Platz gelegen von dem aus in wenigen Metern Entfernung öffentliche Busse und auch Hop-on Hop-off Busse in alle Richtungen, ebenso zum Flughafen, abfahren.

229,Nettes Hotel in alten Gebäuden,"Das Hotel befindet sich in insgesamt 9 Häusern aus der georganischen Zeit (18. Jh). Die Zugänge zu den Zimmern sind daher teilweise lang und verwinkelt. Die Zimmer sind groß, erfreulicherweise hatten wir im Doppelzimmer auch 2 getrennten Decken, was wir sehr schätzen. Was uns noch nie passiert ist: Der Besitzer des Hotels hat sich uns persönlich vorgestellt und ein wenig mit uns geplaudert und uns über das Hotel erzählt. Das Personal war freundlich und zuvorkommend.

Leider war das Badezimmer noch etwas älter und verfügte nur über eine Regendusche hinter einem Vorhang. Eine Handbrause wäre schön gewesen.
Abens konnten wir noch in der Bar von 21.00 - 23.00 Livemusic genießen.",4,2017,08,12

el desayuno muy basico pedi yogurt con frutas  y me dijeron que utilizan solo comun tampoco hay descremado no me gusto
 los dias sabados en el sotano dan un pequeño espectaculo musical no es gran cosa pero lo mas molesto de todo adjunto las fotos es la claridad que entra por la ventana a las 5y 30 am no te deja dormir lo demas esta bien el mobiliario de epoca encaja bien",4,2017,07,23
229,Altes Stadthotel an guter Lage,"Altes Hotel an guter Lage, 5-10 Minuten zur Bushaltestelle an der O'Connellstreet. Der Empfang und der Check-in, bzw. out war freundlich. Das Servicepersonal beim Frühstück war ebenfalls freundlich. Dass man jeden Morgen einen anderen Platz zugewiesen bekommt, ist etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig. Der Platz im Frühstücksraum ist beschränkt und zum Teil sind die Tische sehr klein und man sitzt Tisch an Tisch. Auch wäre es angenehm einen Behälter für die Abfälle auf dem Tisch zu haben. Das Frühstücksbuffet war ausreichend und gut, wem das irische Frühstück nicht schmeckt kann auf Cereals mit Joghurt und Früchte, Brot mit Konfitüre und Käse ausweichen. Das Hotel hat seine besten Zeiten hinter sich, die Teppiche müssten dringend einmal erneuert oder mindestens gereinigt werden. Das Bad in unserem Zimmer ist dringend renovierungsbedürftig, an den Kacheln befand sich roter Schimmel. Das Bad unserer Töchter war renoviert, der defekte Duschkopfhalter wurde jedoch umgehend geflickt. Die Fenster lassen sich nicht mehr richtig öffnen oder schliessen. Wir hatten die Zimmer auf die Strasse und es war sehr laut. Das Hotel ist okay für 2-3 Tage Städtebummel, etwas überteuert für den sich bietenden Komfort.",3,2017,06,27
229,Antiguo ,"Estuvimos 2 noches y la verdad q todo el día fuera visitando la ciudad.La atención  de los empleados es excelente y cordial. Nos ayudaron a hacer por internet el check in de un vuelo de Ryan Air  y ahorrarnos €100.-  
A su vez partíamos muy temprano y estamos muy agradecidos al sr de la noche de recepción que nos alertó que el bus que habíamos contratado previamente no pasaba hasta las 5AM y no llegaríamos en tiempo al aeropuerto. En instantes resolvió con un taxista.
Q no nos gustó? Q el hotel tiene muchos pasadizos y puertas y es un incordio si vas con mucho equipaje como nosotros. El desayuno. Muy limitado y muy típico irlandés (abstenerse quienes quieren comer sano o tienem problemas de colesterol) ",2,2017,06,20
229,Nur der Preis erinnert an ein Schloss,"Vieles passt oder ist zumindest OK: Lage (keine Aussicht/Idylle aber ruhig, kurzer Fussmarsch ins Zentrum), Reception (unterkühlt, aber freundlich/zuvorkommend), Check-in/out (effizient), Zimmer (sauber, eher spartanisch, zu warm) und Bad/WC (keine Dusche, veraltet, viel zu warm, keine Lüftung). Aber niemals zu solch hohem Preis! Dieser passt wohl zum Namen des Hotels, die erhaltene Dienstleistung jedoch lag mind. 60% darunter und hätte dementsprechend günstiger sein müssen.",2,2017,06,18

Sin embargo, para lo que cobra el hotel (mucho), falta: 
1. Nevera en la habitación.
2. Caja fuerte en la habitación.

Además hacia frío porque no prenden la calefacción todo el día, pero cuando me quejé del frío ( era primavera teóricamente) me dieron un radiador.
El colchón estaba un poco vencido.

Auf Wunsch auch Porridge, extra Brötchen sowie Käse und Marmelade sind auch vorhanden. Sehr aufmerksames, freundliches Personal, immer hilfsbereit. Das Hotel liegt City nah, aber nicht mittendrin. Alle Busverbindungen (Flughafentransfer, Hop on-Hop off, Stadtbusse) sind nach 5 Minuten Fußweg erreichbar. Im Untergeschoss befindet sich die Bar mit abendlicher One-Man-Live-Musik, die man auf dem Zimmer jedoch nicht hört. Nett: der ""Owner"" begrüßte Gäste beim Frühstück und erkundigte sich nach dem Befinden.",5,2017,06,09
229,Unfreundliches altes Hotel,"Die Zimmer sind so klein, dass man sich kaum bewegen kann. Ein Irrgarten von Gängen in diesem alten Haus. Das Frühstück war Massenabfertigung und sehr enttäuschend.

Hotel promosso a pieni voti e sicuramente da consigliare.",4,2017,05,22

229,Nicht zu empfehlen!,Dieses Hotel ist nicht zu empfehlen! Einziger positiver Punkt kann das Hotel mit den Bar-Angestellten machen und das Frühstück ist auch o.k.. Ansonsten sind die Mitarbeiter im Hotel und Restaurant sehr unfreundlich. Man fühlt sich nicht willkommen! Dieses Hotel braucht eine ganzheitliche Renovation! Alles ist sehr verwinkelt und mein Leintuch war schmutzig. Es war sehr ringhörig!

229,Tolles Hotel mitten in Dublin,"Das Castle Hotel ist eine super Anlaufstelle für einen Aufenthalt in Dublin! 
Es ist zwar ein recht altes Gebäude, was jedoch einen besonderen Charme hat. Die Zimmer sind gemütlich eingerichtet und sehr sauber. 
Das gebotene Frühstück ist ausreichend, nichts was man länger als 1 Woche braucht, aber für einen Kurzaufenthalt durchaus okay. 
Das Personal ist überaus freundlich und kümmert sich sehr sorgsam um die Gäste. 
Im Keller des Hotels ist eine kleine Bar, wo man am Abend sehr leckeres Essen, ein gutes Bier und Live Musik geboten bekommt. 
Die Lage des Castle Hotels ist (fast) nicht zu übertreffen. Nach ca. 10 Minuten Fußweg ist man mitten im Stadtzentrum an der Liffey und hat alle Möglichkeiten offen (Tempelbar, Grafton Street, Henry Street, Trinity College,...). 
Auch Dublin Castle, St. Patrick's Church oder vieles mehr ist zu Fuß zu erreichen. 
Alternativ ist quasi direkt vor dem Hotel eine Bushaltestelle, von welcher man in die ganze Stadt fahren kann.

Sollten wir wieder nach Dublin reisen, kommen wir auf jeden Fall wieder ins Castle Hotel zurück! ",5,2017,03,27
229,Ottima Posizione - Irish Breakfast TOP!,"Prenotato con largo anticipo per la settimana di San Patrizio, il Castle Hotel era tra quelli consigliati dalla guida, il primo per rapporto qualità/prezzo.

Posizione perfetta: affacciato su O'Connell Street, comodo a diverse fermate di autobus e/o partenze per i tour guidati e, anche (e soprattutto), per raggiungere tranquillamente a piedi tutti i punti di interesse della città.

Ottima la colazione irlandese: uova (scrambled o al tegamino), bacon, salsicce, sanguinaccio, fagioli, pomodoro, funghi ecc. ecc. nel pieno rispetto della tradizione. Il tutto disponibile per innumerevoli ""bis"".. 
Non ho provato la parte dedicata alla tradizione continentale (probabilmente un pò scarsa).. Ma d'altronde siamo in Irlanda!

Personale disponibilissimo (qualcuno parla anche italiano): ci hanno tenuto le valigie una giornata intera dopo che abbiamo lasciato la stanza.

Unica pecca la coperta del letto: effettivamente troppo corta (almeno per il mio ragazzo di 1,90).

Consigliato.",4,2017,03,26
229,Céntrico y recomendable.,"El hotel está muy bien a pesar de ser un poco laberinto para encontrar las habitaciones.

229,Posizione strategica,"Parliamo di comodità, l'Hotel è vicinissimo alla fermate O'Connell Street del pulman Aircoach che arriva dall'aerporto, è in posizione strategica e ben servito. Il personale è gentile , parla solo inglese . L'albergo è datato con tutto un sali scendi di livelli, moquette dappertutto e camere moloto sobrie, piccola TV con canali solo in inglese, bagno piccolo, gelido e ovviamente senza bidet. Comunque per starci per una breve vacanza va benissimo.",3,2017,02,12
229,ottima posizione !,"è un hotel grazioso in posizione strategica a pochi minuti a piedi dalla zona centrale. Non lo ritengo adatto ad anziani o portatori di handicap perchè ci sono livelli multipli da superare attaverso 2-3 scalini o discese poco rassicuranti. Se fossi il proprietario gli darei una sistematina ...per sentirmi veramente un 3 stelle...  simpatico l'inserimento di qualche mobile in arte povera, non altrettanto direi di tutta la moquette presente.",2,2017,02,10
229,Una estancia fantástica,"Hotel de carácter tradicional, ubicado a 5 minutos de la zona comercial de O'Connell Street. 
Hemos distrutado de nuestra estancia durante 5 días. Nos alojamos en 2 habitaciones de la segunda planta. Las habitaciones son ámplias, con una decoración tradicional pero con todas las comodidades (televisión, hervidor eléctrico y té, secador,etc.). El baño no es muy ámplio, sigue los estandares ingleses, pero uno puede moverse sin problema. 
El desayuno lo teníamos incluido en el precio de la habitación, con lo que cada mañana pudímos disfrutar de un desayuno irlandes completo y un pequeño buffet con cereales, fruta, zumos, bolleria y queso. 
El hotel dispone de dos restaurantes propios, The Old Music Shop donde se sirve el desayuno cada mañana y The Cave en la planta inferior.
Sin dudarelo repetiríamos nuestra estancia en el Castle Hotel en caso de volver a Dublín.",5,2017,01,28
229,Tappa finale e scelta strategica.,"Per la tappa finale del nostro giro nell'Irlanda del Sud, abbiamo soggiornato in questo comodo ed elegante Hotel posto in una posizione strategica per visitare a piedi il centro di Dublino, splendida città, piena di vita e di gioventù, nonché ricca di storia e di glorie della letteratura. La sua vicinanza alle strade più vivaci e ricche di monumenti è stata di grande comodità. L'hotel ha un pub interno molto accogliente ed una sala colazione a piano terra, dove si può fare una colazione ottima e varia, per tutti i gusti. Il personale era gentile e discreto. le stanze austere ma calde per atmosfera davano il senso dell'antico vissuto appieno. Ampio bagno in camera con vasca e soffione. La nostra camera dava sul cortile interno, dunque poco rumore, ma credo che anche quelle sulla strada siano tranquille. Per quanto mi riguarda, ci ritornerei volentieri e lo consiglio senza remore. Ci siamo stati veramente bene👍🏼",4,2017,01,24
229,Gerne wieder!,"Super gemütliches schnuckeliges Hotel!
Die Zimmer sind sauber und das Bad sehr groß. Das Frühstück ist in Ordnung und das Restaurant unten im Keller sehr gut (Chicken Wings mit Blue Cheese Dip, sehr zu empfehlen ;-)
Habe schon zwei Mal dort gebucht und bin sehr zufrieden. Zentrale Lage, sowohl um in die Innenstadt zu kommen als auch für die Bushaltestelle zum Flughafen. Writers Museum direkt nebenan.",4,2017,01,12
229,Un hotel confortevole e sobrio,"Appena rientrato e con il ricordo del viaggio ben chiaro, posso dire che il Castle Hotel di Dublino è un hotel confortevole, rilassante e sobrio in stile georgiano, poco distante da O'Connel Streeet, dal bus 747 da e per l'aeroporto che mi sento di consigliare per comodità e regolarità dei passaggi, poco distante dai bus hop on hop off per chi vuole fare un giro orientativo in città, a poche centinaia di metri dal Museo degli Scrittori, ben servito dai Dublin Bus che invece non consiglio per il loro macchinoso sistema di acquisto dei biglietti (unica soluzione le tessere giornaliere o pluri). iniziamo dalla camera: letto sufficientemente comodo, mediamente rigido, coperta piumone troppo corta (ti arriva a metà torace per un ospite alto 180 cm), riscaldamento gestito in maniera anomala, alle 17 si scaldano i radiatori fino a rendere la temperatura in camera di 26/27°, va avanti su questo livello fino alle 2 ed anche più, poi si spegne tutto ed al mattino alle 8 quando normalmente ci si alza è freddo... Le finestre esterne a ghigliottina si aprono soltanto una spanna e per aerare la camera sono insufficienti. Pulizia a buon livello, doccia grande senza tubo flessibile, lavabo con i vecchi rubinetti caldo e freddo che non danno possibilità di miscelare, ma ci passiamo sopra. Abbiamo preso nel pacchetto la colazione, tipicamente britannica, con qualche eccezione italiana: discreto cappuccino, croissant mignon e yoghurt un po' acido, ma niente di che... Tutto sommato una bella vacanza per festeggiare il mio compleanno...",3,2017,01,10
229,Halloween ,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel per il periodo di Halloween posizione strategica 10minuti a piedi e ti ritrovi in centro, ottima colazione continentale personale cordiale e le stanze pulite e confortevoli. Lo consiglio vivamente ",5,2017,01,07
229,Una sorpresa in stile georgiano,"Il viaggio a Dublino per il capodanno è stato un regalo perciò per me tutto sarebbe stato una sorpresa, mentre raggiungevamo l'hotel vedevo passare le varie catene alberghiere e saliva l'ansia perché non ci fermavamo davanti a nessuno di questi.
Finalmente eccolo! Un bellissimo albergo georgiano in mezzo a tutta la modernità, decorato già dall'esterno con ghirlande natalizie; varcata la soglia la magia si è sprigionata! Un ambiente caldo, con una moquette bellissima, salottini dove poter leggere e riposarsi e addirittura un internet point a libero accesso dotato di stampante, alberi di natale in ogni sala e decorazioni natalizie.
Il receptionist davvero gentile e le pratiche di check-in davvero facili e veloci.
La camera pulita, ordinata, spaziosa con un bagno bellissimo e pulito e la doccia con  porta in vetro (la tendina ha il rischio di bagnare ovunque).In dotazione c'era un bollitore con il the, davvero riscaldante e ristoratore dopo le passeggiate in città.
La colazione servita nell'Old Music Shop (uno dei due ristoranti annessi all'hotel) era a buffet dolce e salato con toast  e piatti fatti al momento e bioches calde. Sebbene fosse un buffet era servito però da una cameriera (fatto che ho apprezzato perchè evitava che tutti potessero toccare il cibo creando casino e usando lo stesso cucchiaio per servirsi da piatti diversi); L'altro ristorante, il Vault restaurant dove abbiamo mangiato per il cenone e in un'altra serata di soggiorno, serve piatti deliziosi e dalle 21 c'era anche un intrattenimento musicale e servizio bar (abbiamo preso in Irish coffee delizioso).
La posizione era perfetta vicino al centro e a luoghi di interesse come il Giardino della memoria, ma al contempo in una posizione tranquilla per il riposo notturno.

Un hotel davvero particolare che ti fa sembrare di vivere in una tipica casa irlandese per come è strutturato, indescrivibile solo a parole bisogna vederlo per capire!",5,2017,01,06
229,Un salto nel passato☘️,"Hotel centrale, comodo, elegante e antico!! Veramente un tuffo nel passato! Personale garbato è disponibile. Molto carina anche la sala colazione. Punto di partenza per visita della città è dotato di parcheggio per gite nei luoghi famosi, noi per esempio siamo andati alle meravigliose Cliffs of Moher e Galway. La mia famiglia ed io siamo stati benissimo, sinceramente lo consigliamo molto!☘️",5,2017,01,05
229,Hotel fascinoso tipicamente georgiano,"Un hotel in un edificio georgiano storico, che ha mantenuto l'atmosfera è l'ambiente dell'epoca. Belli i vari salotti dislocati al piano terra, molto comodi per pause relax o lettura. C'è anche un po' con stampante a disposizione degli ospiti. La camera era confortevole, con il letto comodo e un bagno moderno, con una buona doccia e i miscelatori. I servizi infatti sono nuovi e moderni. Ottima pulizia. Ottima colazione. Buona musica irlandese al pub dell'hotel. La posizione e' molto comoda per i giri turistici (noi ci siamo sempre spostati a piedi), centrale ma in una strada tranquilla e silenziosa. Un soggiorno davvero piacevole in una bella e accogliente struttura, che da' la sensazione proprio di stare in una casa invece che in un hotel. L'unico inconveniente che abbiamo riscontrato riguarda l'organizzazione della cena di fine anno nel ristorante dell'hotel: infatti,nonostante avessimo prenotato per tempo come ospiti dell'hotel, abbiamo aspettato un'ora prima di avere il tavolo e al momento dell'ordine il piatto che volevamo ordinare era finito. Dato che si trattava di una cena speciale con menù di gala predisposto, ci siamo rimasti un po' male. Sè non ci fosse stato questo disguido, non in linea con gli standards dell'hotel, avrei dato 5 stelle perché l'hotel è davvero bello e il nostro soggiorno è stato molto piacevole e confortevole.",4,2017,01,04
229,Accoglienza,"L'hotel è molto accogliente si respira aria di antica Dublino. Camere calde e accoglienti e pulite. L'unico neo la moquette ovunque!

229,Piccola delusione ,"L'hotel si trova in una buona posizione per raggiungere il centro ed è vicino alla fermata degli autobus da e per l'aeroporto.
È una vecchia struttura che mantiene un arredamento datato ma in ogni caso piacevole, con tanto legno e tanta moquette. La mia camera per 3 persone era molto piccola e il letto matrimoniale in realtà era ad una piazza e mezza. La temperatura della stanza era molto alta e non era possibile regolarla. La colazione è di basso livello non adatta ad un hotel. Necessario conoscere un po' di inglese per poter parlare con le persone alla reception.",3,2016,12,19

Carina la struttura, ambienti eleganti dall'aria un po' retrò, la nostra camera, ampia ed accogliente, era tranquilla ed affacciata sul cortile interno, unica pecca la mancanza del miscelatore in bagno, quindi o ci si ustiona con l'acqua calda o si sceglie  l'acqua gelida....ma visto che altri bagni sono stati modernizzati, probabilmente il problema verrà risolto. Personale molto gentile ed accogliente, pronto ad aiutarti per qualsiasi problema. Colazione ottima, abbondante e varia, servita in una deliziosa sala. Comodo il ristorante e il pub sottostante da sfruttare nelle serate in cui sei distrutto ma vuoi mangiare qualcosa ascoltando vera musica irlandese. Ottima esperienza, la consiglio vivamente.",4,2016,11,18
229,Molto buono,"Molto buono elegante e  pulito ottima colazione e soprattutto ottima compagnia..All insegna del divertimento un hotel centrale così riesci ad arrivare al centro della città in pochi minuti...
Offre un arredamento molto curato e classico con divani comodi molto ampio con varie scale dappertutto.
",4,2016,11,02
229,Lo consiglio...,"Sono stata ospite di questa struttura con la famiglia proprio in questa settimana. L'hotel e' situato in una zona dalla quale si raggiunge il centro in pochi minuti a piedi ed ha a pochi metri una fermata di autobus. hotel molto accogliente, curato nei particolari, camera molto grande per 3 persone, pulizia giornaliera piu' che soddisfacente, ottima la colazione e bellissime le salette dove veniva servita. Le uniche cose da segnalare sono il fatto che probabilmente avevano ridipinto le porte e quindi nel corridoio che conduceva alla mia camera c'era un forte odore di vernice (ma e' sono un problema temporaneo), il fatto che avevamo il bagno senza finestra e senza nessuna ventola, e il fatto che nessuno del personale conoscesse una parola di italiano....e che non facesse nulla per farsi capire (tipo parlare un po piu' lentamente)...",4,2016,10,14
229,Hotel poco pulito,"Ho trovato la mia camera parecchio sporca e vecchia: capelli sul cuscino, batuffoli di polvere, moquette macchiata, bollitore ingiallito. Il lavandino non presenta il miscelatore ma ha ancora due rubinetti, il che lo rende abbastanza scomodo; il piumone era troppo corto. La colazione era veramente povera, caffè diluito, marmellate confezionate, frutta sciroppata immangiabile. Almeno è relativamente vicino al centro, in dieci minuti a piedi si raggiunge la zona di Temple. Non lo consiglio.",2,2016,10,10
229,Excelente ubicación,"A un paso de O'Connell, la calle principal de Dublin y a 10' andando de Temple Bar, la zona de disfrute total de la ciudad.
El hotel está bien atendido, con buen desayuno irlandés. No es moderno, pero es curioso y limpio.Tiene un pub con música en directo.
Hotel altamente recomendable.",4,2016,10,07
229,"Una settimana in un ambiente pulito e tranquillo, vicino al centro","In quattro nella stessa stanza; sempre pulita e ordinata, compreso il bagno. La vista non era delle migliori. Poco dialogo con il personale della reception, solo buongiorno, buonasera, grazie... L'albergo è comunque in buona posizione: il centro è facilmente raggiungibile. Anche la colazione è buona, non molto ricca. Abbiamo cenato in albergo una sera, ottima la cucina.",4,2016,10,03
229,Muy agradable y céntrico ,"Es un hotel, que para el precio que tiene, esta muy bien y muy bien situado. Sus empleados, encantadores y muy serviciales. Habitación amplia y cuarto de baño renovado. Totalmente recomendable. Espero volver ",4,2016,09,25
229,Nulla di che; solo vicino al centro città,"4 notti in quest'albergo sul quale c'è da dire subito che è molto vecchio anche nell'arredamento (moquette e parato dappertutto!) e, almeno x quanto ci riguarda, vecchio anche nelle forme del letto: un matrimoniale alto altissimo (con baldacchino annesso 😨) che però, se riuscivi a salirci, era comodissimo e riposante (aveva due materassi uno sull'altro, credo...).
Colazione non eccezionale (parlo della colazione classica di noi italiani): cornetti piccoli piccoli che finivano subito; pane tostato NON TOSTATO; e nient'altro 😕
Lato positivo è che si trova a due passi da... tutto ciò che c'è da vedere a Dublino città! ",3,2016,09,23
229,Super für einen Dublin-Trip!,"Man kann das Hotel sehr empfehlen unter der Bedingung, dass man sich an dem irisch/britischen Charme des Hotels erfreuen kann. Aufgrund der zentralen Lage erreicht man sowohl Bus als auch Bahn in wenigen Minuten. Das Personal ist ausgesprochen freundlich und hilfsbereit. Unser Zimmer war sehr großzügig geschnitten (das Bad mag dem einen oder anderen zu klein sein) und auch sehr sauber. Beim Frühstücksbuffet hätte ich mir eine größere Auswahl gewünscht aber das was angeboten wurde hat geschmeckt. Hervorzuheben ist noch das Restaurant im Keller mit täglicher Livemusik. Das Essen schmeckt ausgezeichnet und auch das Etablissement ist sehr ansprechend. Mit wenigen Abstrichen ein sehr gutes Hotel mit einem ebenfalls guten Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis (für irische Verhältnisse).",4,2016,09,17
229,3 giorni a dublino,"A febbraio abbiamo soggiornato al castle hotel, ristrutturato, pulito,molto stile Irish,colazione abbondante sia italiana che inglese,in un ambiente piacevole. Ha anche il ristorante,che non abbiamo provato e un pub per rilassarsi e bere qualcosa. Lo consiglio. Comodo dall aeroporto e per il centro, che si può raggiungere a piedi o con i numerosi autobus.",4,2016,09,04
229,Buena y cómoda opción céntrica,"Está ubicado en una zona cómoda desde la que se puede ir andando a cualquier sitio. Es el típico hotel de pasillos largos enmoquetados y gusto anglosajón en cuanto a ""decoración"". El desayuno irlandés está muy bien. Cerca de los autobuses del aeropuerto.",3,2016,09,02
229,Ben trovato ,"Posizione centrale.  Comoda per trasferimento aeroporto o per i bus che vanno in qualsiasi posto dentro o fuori Dublino. Alla reception l'accoglienza é discreta.

229,Comodo albergo in centro,"Comoda struttura a 15 minuti di passeggiata dal centro, posteggio privato a pagamento, camere piccole ma funzionali e pulite.

229,Ottima posizione e struttura,"Reception H24. Camere pulite e letto comodissimo. La camera era al primo piano e proprio volendo si puo usare l'ascensore

229,Ottimo!!," Siamo rimasti veramente soddisfatti dalla nostra permanenza in questo Hotel. Posizione strategica a pochi minuti dal centro di Dublino, personale cortese e sempre disponibile. La camera accogliente e discretamente grande. Linea Wi-fi in camera ottima e servizio di pulizie delle stanze sempre efficiente. Posso solo che consigliarlo vivamente a tutti i viaggiatori.
PROMOSSO A PIENI VOTI!!!",5,2016,08,09
229,Per visitare l'irlanda,"Ottimo hotel situato a 2 minuti dal centro di Dublino.Servito in modo eccellete dai mezzi di trasporto cittadini che sono tantissimi.Il personale e' cordialissimo e molto educato.Sono collegati con i maggiori tour operator  per spettacolari visite nei posti piu belli d'irlanda,",4,2016,07,26
229,Impeccabile!!!!!!,"L hotel è in una struttura tipica georgiana sia a livello architettonico che di arredamento interno, dispone di tre ampie sale vicino alla reception, un pub e ristorante sotterraneo dove alla sera si può cenare o prendere un drink e dal giovedi ascoltare buona musica irlandese. La nostra stanza era galattica, avevamo chiesto una quadrupla e ci siamo ritrovati in una mega stanza con 5 letti con un infinità di spazio e camino! poi un 'altra stanza con salottino divano e due poltrone e tv a schermo piatto, un altra stanza ancora con un bagno che forse a confronto a tutto il resto era piccolo ma confortevole. Pulizia ottima pur essendoci la moquette che non amo molto....la colazione viene servita al piano terra, le bevande al tavolo mentre il resto bisogna andare a prenderlo ...i'irish breakfast viene però servita....il resto non è abbondantissimo e vario...frutta fresca, formggio, cereali, yogurt, croissants.....il ricevimento è cordiale e cortese e molto disponibile. L hotel tra l'altro si trova in una posizione centrale ma non trafficata..in 5 minuti si è in O' Connel street.......valido punto di partenza per ogni giro!!!",4,2016,07,25
229,Völlig in Ordnung,"Zimmer sind total in Ordnung und dem Preis (Dublin´s Hotels sind nun mal teuer) angemessen. Sehr freundliches Personal, die meinem betagten Vater ein Zimmer in Liftnähe gaben. Gutes Frühstück, nette Lobby und eine Bar im Keller, die auch prima ist, wenn man nicht mehr laufen will.",4,2016,07,24
229,Settimana a Dublino,"Abbiamo soggiornato una settimana in questo hotel e ci siamo trovati benissimo! Tutto molto caratteristico con colazione abbondante.
A due minuti da O Connell Street, posizione strategica, personale gentilissimo!Consigliato!!",4,2016,07,18
229,Un viaje en el tiempo,"Muy bien situado, cerca del centro, pero en una zona tranquila. Un ambiente clásico, que te transporta a la época victoriana. Preciosas habitaciones. Desayuno maravilloso. Una pena que las tapicerías acumulen tanto polvo. A los 2 minutos de entrar al lobby notaba el asma.",4,2016,07,17
229,MUY BUENA OPCION Y BIEN UBICADO,"Estando en Dublin primero fui a otro hotel (que queda a la vuelta de este) y tras hacer la zona de los acantilados, volví al Castle hotel y por solo 30 dolares más al que habia estado antes encontré un muy buen hotel, cuidado, bien atendido, que me permitio dejarles las valijas ANTES de entrar cuando me fui a Galway. Es un poco confusa la distribución de las habitaciones y varios volviamos a la recepción porque no podiamos encontrar el número.... tiene ascensor. Muy bueno el desayuno y la dinamica que le dan. La parte caliente uno la pide como si estuviera en un shopping (de hecho, durante el día es una cafeteria a la calle). Excelentes! Espectaculares! las papas en cuadraditos que sirven en el desayuno junto con la salchichas, beans y demás. Seguiría comiendo esas papas toda mi vida!. Mi unica critica es que queria ver el espectaculo de  musica en vivo que ofrecen los viernes y sabados, pero cuando baje al salon habian puesto una pantalla enorme con la EUROCOPA!!. El musico estaba preparandose .... pero me rompieron el ambiente con la pantalla para el futbol!. Muy bien ubicado y a media cuadra tiene la parada de salida de los buses hop on/off. Tambien tiene a dos cuadras las paradas de salida y llegada del bus del aeropuerto.  Volveria y lo recomiendo pero tengan en cuenta que por la zona están haciendo la extensión de un tram (LUAS) que la hace incómoda y afea la vista. Creo que estarán de arreglos hasta el 2017. Como todos los hoteles de Irlanda e Inglaterra, tiene en la habitacion su cafetera con cafe o te para prepararse.",4,2016,07,16
229,"Centrico, acogedor y genuino","Me aloje sola y buscaba un sitio agradable y céntrico, evitando el bullicio que es característico de esta ciudad. Y este hotel cumple todos los requisitos: puedes ir al centro mismo de la ciudad dando un paseo por O'Conell St. disfrutando del buen ambiente. El Airlink (autobús que te acerca a la ciudad desde el aeropuerto) esta a 5minutos. La atención del personal es amable y sonriente-siempre en ingles, eso si-. La habitación limpia y confortable, cada día toallas limpias (o al menos colocadas debidamente) y dos chocolates sobre la cama cuando arreglan la habitación. 
En el restaurante del hotel -un pub-la comida esta buena y tocan todas las noches a partir de las nueve. El desayuno es muy completo y muy anglosajon y los camareros se esfuerzan por darte lo que necesitas. Es cierto que el hotel es irregular-Habitaciones por aquí y por allá, escaleras, pasillos...- pero en mi opinión esto le añade encanto y lo distingue del típico aburrido hotel de ciudad.",5,2016,07,14
229,Un sogno che si realizza!,"Il titolo rispecchia esattamente il mio stato d'animo. È stato il viaggio che volevo fare da una vita! Sono un amante dell'Irlanda, di Dublino, dei suoi paesaggi, del suo vivere e non vedevo l'ora di fare questo viaggio. Il Castle Hotel è stata una scelta perfetta, scelto da mia moglie. Situato in posizione strategica, praticamente al centro. Consigliamo di prendere il bus turistico, quello a due piani, che vi fa fare il giro delle principali attrazioni della città di Dublino. Fatelo tutto! Poi, una alla volta, visitate tutti i luoghi mostrati. Non tralasciate l'esperienza alla Guinness Storehouse: indimenticabile! Dublino è tutta bella. Prendete i piatti unici di carne e di pesce. A pranzo arrangiatevi con un panino, magari fatto in albergo al mattino a colazione. Ma se in albergo fate colazione con la Irish Breakfast allora siete a posto, potete resistere fino al pomeriggio: una colazione ricchissima che vi sostiene e vi da la forza per poter ammirare le meraviglie di Dublino. Un'ultima cosa: fate un viaggio in treno sulla costa e magari arrivate anche a Belfast: magnifica esperienza, un'altra cultura! Ma forse sono di parte...",4,2016,06,27
229,Buon punto di partenza,"L'hotel è ricavato in una tipica costruzione georgiana.
La camera nella quale abbiamo soggiornato era di buone dimensioni e ben pulita.
Bagno pulito e funzionale.
La colazione viene servita nel ristorante ""Old shop music"". Si può scegliere se attenersi alla classica colazione italiana con mini-broches, yogurt, pane e marmellata o gustare la tipica colazione irlandese.
L'hotel si trova a 10 minuti a piedi dalla zona centrale OConnel Street, Tample bar e 15720 minuti da Grafton Street e St. Stephen Green.
Il personale è molto disponibile e gentile.
wi-fi gratuito e con ottima ricezione nelle camere.",4,2016,06,13
229,Besser als erwartet,"Angesichts der teilweise wirklich schlechten Bewertungen habe ich mich schon auf das schlimmste gefasst gemacht, doch es kam ganz anders.

Bei Ankunft im Hotel wurden wir gleich von den durchwegs freundlichen Damen an der Rezeption empfangen und konnten sehr schnell einchecken.
Im ganzen Hotel ist sehr weicher Teppich ausgelegt und alles wirkt zwar etwas vollgestellt aber doch charmant.
Wir hatten ein Zimmer im 4. Stock, welcher sich bequem per Fahrstuhl erreichen ließ.
Das Zimmer selbst war sehr schön eingerichtet, war relativ groß und hatte ein neues sauberes Badezimmer. Das Bett war sehr weich aber bequem (obwohl ich eigentlich harte Matratzen bevorzuge). 
Der Wasserdruck im Bad war nicht besonders groß aber reichte trotzdem aus. Da wir zu dem Zeitpunkt schon zwei Wochen in Irland unterwegs waren, war das auch nichts neues für uns.

Das Frühstück war eher durchschnittlich. Würstchen und BlackPudding haben leider gar nicht geschmeckt obwohl ich die normal sehr gerne esse. Speck und Eier waren aber lecker. Es gab auch die Möglichkeit diverse Müslis und Obst zum Frühstück zu essen. Tee bzw. Kaffee wurde direkt zum Tisch gebracht.
Leider sind im Speisesaal die Tische sehr eng zusammengestellt aber für ein schnelles Frühstück war es trotzdem ok.",4,2016,06,08
229,Schönes sauberes Zimmer mit bequemen Betten,"die 130€ für eine Nacht im Doppelzimmer incl. Frühstück haben uns erst schon ein wenig abgeschreckt. Dennoch wurden wir von diesem Hotel nicht enttäuscht. 
Das Hotel hat einen wunderbar alten Charm. Dennoch sind die Zimmer ordentlich sauber und riechen angenehm.
Wir hatten ein relativ ruhiges Zimmer zum Hinterhof raus. Ich kann mir vorstellen, dass es auch lautere Zimmer gibt. 
Das Bad ist äußerst geräumig und war ebenfalls sehr sauber.. 
Das Frühstück war sehr reichhaltig. Aber nunmal typisch Irisch. Den Kaffee und Tee bekommt man gebracht. Es gab aber auch Obst.
Der Service war insgesamt sehr gut und stets freundlich. Die Lage des Hotels ist wirklich klasse, da es Fußläufig zur Stadmitte liegt.
Besonders gut hat mir gefallen, dass man sein Gepäck auch nach dem Auschecken parken kann. 
Wirklich tolles Hotel",5,2016,06,06
229,Cómodo y cerca del centro,"Un hotel muy bonito con una decoración muy especial y cuidada. La habitación era amplia y la cama muy  cómoda. Buen secador y buena ducha. Cerca del centro andando pero la calle es muy tranquila. El desayuno incluido en el precio es un buffet servido típico irlandés. Por el capuchino (muy bueno) nos cobraron 1,20€ pero merecía la pena
",4,2016,06,04
229,AFFIDABILE,"l'hotel è ricavato in una casa Giorgiana e ne conserva ancora la struttura con arredamenti molto belli , la camera in cui ho alloggiato era medio grande silenziosa con moquette  e i letti comodi , il bagno era pulito con la doccia, unica pecca il lavandino senza il miscelatore un po' scomodo . La colazione, compresa nel prezzo, viene servita direttamente dal personale, cosa che ho apprezzato molto in quanto sicuramente più  igienico. Colazione   prettamente stile inglese  con  uova cucinate in vari modi, pancetta, salsicce, fagioli stufati, funghi, patate, pane tostato, frutta  e perfino dei piccoli croissant per la gioia di noi Italiani. Posizione ottima sia per raggiungere il centro sia per le fermate dei bus -Altra nota positiva dell'hotel e' il pub.. Nel piano interrato della struttura si accede direttamente al pub che prepara ottimi piatti tradizionali e  dalle 21, ospita cantanti irlandesi -Rapporto qualità prezzo ottimo.-Consigliato",4,2016,05,22
229,Klasse! ,"Richtig schön Urig. So wie man sich Irland vorstellt! Von der Aufmachung des Hotels, bis hin zum Essen! Saubere Zimmer, freundliches Personal. Für einen kurz Trip absolut weiter zu empfehlen. Da es relativ zentral liegt, sind die meisten Sehenswürdigkeiten maximal in 30 min zu Fuß zu erreichen.",4,2016,05,15
229,Alt & urig,"Wir verbrachten zwei Nächte im Castle Hotel. Das Hotel ist sehr alt und erstreckt sich über mehrere alte Stadthäuser. Die Böden knarren teilweise, der Weg zu unserem Zimmer ging durch viele kleine Gänge was uns jedoch nicht gestört hat. Es ist urig eingerichtet im Foyer. Wer modern möchte ist hier falsch! Unser Zimmer mit Bad war auch völlig ok. Was etwas stört ist die extreme Hellhörigkeit.  Das Frühstück war leider auch eher schlecht. Geringe Auswahl und geschmacklich mäßig.  Lage super,  15min bis Temple Bar ",3,2016,05,12
229,Urlaub,"Sehr schönes gepflegtes Hotel. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und immer darauf bedacht einem zu helfen.Die Zimmer sind sauber und mit allem ausgestattet was man braucht.Alls Highlight ist der Wasserkocher mit Tee und Kaffe sowie Milch, Zucker und Kekse😃Das Bett war leider etwas durchgelegen und im Bad hätte ich gerne mehr Ablagefläche gehabt.Ansonsten auch sauber und eine etwas größere Dusche mit einstellbarer Temperatur😃Das Hotel selber ist sehr verwinkelt und bereitet mit schönen Räumen immer mal zum schauen und Verweilen ein.Alles hat seinen alten irischen Charme behalten😃Der Keller mit Restaurant und Bar ist ein Traum!Die Bar ab 21 Uhr mit Live-Musik ein Muss!!Bitte darauf achten das das Hotel für den Strom( Handy ect.) einen Adapter braucht-wir haben uns diesen an der Lobby für 10 Euro Leihgebühr besorgt. Alles zusammen ist das Hotel SEHR zu empfehlen👍",4,2016,05,06
229,Laberíntico,"Como otros muchos visitantes han comentado, uno de los rasgos de este hotel es su diseño laberíntico. Cuando te dan la llave en recepción y te indican la planta en que está tu habitación comienza una auténtica aventura hasta encontrarla, aventura que se repite sucesivamente hasta que te aprendes el recorrido. La habitación estuvo correcta, si bien las vistas traseras deslucían un poco. En cuanto al desayuno en modo buffet, estuvo muy completo y la única pega que puedo poner es que eran los camareros los que se acercaban a ti para preguntar si faltaba algo, no tenías opción de ir personalmente a buscar lo que te apeteciera.",3,2016,05,02
229,Consigliatissimo!,"Posizione eccezionale per il centro, circa ad 1 km dal Liffey e dal centro città. Fermate dei pullman nelle vicinanze, ottimi collegamenti con la città e il fuori città.
Il personale molto solare, sempre simpatico e cortese! 
Cucina molto buona e gradevolissima la musica irish folk suonata in live (ho avuto il piacere di ascoltare il sig. Ray Cox, davvero bravissimo).
La camera era un po' fresca, ma era attrezzata con coperte in più per ogni evenienza. Il bagno un po' piccolo, ma per una singola direi sufficiente considerando anche le buone dimensioni della doccia.
In generale il posto molto bello, assolutamente consigliatissimo!",5,2016,04,28
229,Top für die Stadttour,"Das sehr verwinkelte Hotel liegt im Stadtzentrum von Dublin. Vom Flughafen ist es super erreichbar, da der Airliner-Bus fast vor der Tür hält. Die Parkplätze kosten pro Tag 15 €. Man kann aber, wenn man Glück hat, in der Rutland Pl einen Parkplatz ergattern. 
Das Hotel ist wunderschön eingerichtet. Alte Möbel und dicke Teppichböden vermitteln einen typischen Schloss-Look. 
Die Lage ist super für die Stadttouren. Den Temple Bar Bezirk erreicht man in 15 Minuten zu Fuß. 
Im Pub im Keller wird am Wochenende live Musik gespielt. Keine Angst, die hört man oben nicht. 
Das Frühstück ist sehr lecker. Es gibt die typischen Eierspeisen, Obst und Cornflakes sowie Toast und Wurst/Käse. 
Das Hotel ist wirklich sehr verwinkelt. Man geht hier eine Treppe hoch, dass eine andere wieder runter und um die Ecke und ist im Zimmer. Das ist am Anfang verwirrend, macht aber auch den Charme des Hotels aus.
Die Zimmer sind ein wenig hellhörig, aber das stört nicht besonders.",4,2016,04,25
229,Preis-Leistung  und Lage hervorragend,"Das Hotel liegt einen Spaziergang entlang der Hauptgeschäftsstraße von Dublin mit Hotels, Gaststätten und Geschäften  ca. 10-15 Minuten vom Zentrum um die Partymeile Temple Bar entfernt und somit sehr zentral. Obwohl zentral liegend sind die umliegenden Straßen zumindest nachts nicht zu stark befahren. Bei einem Zimmer Richtung Innenhof  ist ein Schlafen mit offenem Fenster problemlos möglich (sofern einen die Schreie der Möwen nicht stören :-)!). Hellhörigkeit des älteren Hauses könnte in den zur Treppe / Aufzug hin liegenden Zimmern von Nachteil sein (unser Zimmer war im hinteren Bereich und somit absolut leise!).

Die Zimmer selbst sind zweckmäßig eingerichtet und sauber. Handtücher werden täglich gewechselt.

Restaurant (mit Frühstück) und Bar im Haus sind ebenfalls in Ordnung, die Preise für ein Hotel normal. In der Bar wird irische Livemusik angeboten. Gerade bei späterer Ankunft am Abend oder bei Regenwetter ist ein Besuch des Hotelrestaurants oder der Bar eine Alternative zum Weg in die Innenstadt.

Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Alle Anfragen konnten umgehend geklärt werden. Inwiefern das Personal allerdings Deutsch spricht haben wir nicht getestet, da wir unsere Anfragen gleich immer in Englisch formuliert haben.

",4,2016,04,23
229,Aceptable!,"Apenas vi la fachada del hotel, me asusté. Es un poco viejo, ya que antes solía ser castillo. Nosotros tuvimos la suerte de quedarnos en la parte que era castillo, ya que el resto del hotel son como casas anexadas. Para llegar a la habitación tuvimos que pasar por distintos túneles, tiene su encanto. El miedo lo perdí cuando vimos la habitación, súper moderna!
Debajo tiene un restaurant en el que algunas veces tocan música local en vivo.",3,2016,04,14
229,"Muy buen hotel, aunque precio algo elevado","Mi sensación tras pasar 4 días en el Hotel Castle ha sido muy positiva. El hotel es bastante agradable, las habitaciones están bien, personal amable y el desayuno muy bueno.
Aunque si que es verdad que acostumbrado a los hoteles de otras ciudades, el precio me parece algo elevado para un hotel normal. No obstante, si tuviera que volver a Dublín posiblemente optaría de nuevo por este hotel ya que la relación calidad precio que hay en esta ciudad hace que el Castle Hotel sea una buena opción.
La conexión wifi de la habitación era mejorable.",3,2016,04,13
229,Nos mandaron aquí desde el St. George,"La reserva la teníamos en el St. George; como llegamos a las 23:00, a pesar que habíamos avisado, nos dijeron que tenían overbooking. Y nos enviaron al Castle. Deben pertenecer a los mismos propietarios.
El edificio antiguo. Lo de Castillo le viene al pelo, porque está competente atravesado por pasillos zigzagueantes y con recovecos. Muy limpio. Mi habitación muy tranquila, porque la estaba alejada de todo.
El desayuno muy organizado, aunque todos los días es lo mismo: la calidad regular.
El personal del hotel del turno de mañana, antipático y escasamente accesible.",3,2016,04,12
229,Me volvería a quedar.,"Mi mejor nota para la limpieza. Es curioso pero en los dos días que estuve me encontré la habitación impoluta. El tema moqueta no me molesta. 
Los baños recién reformados y habitaciones confortables. Dormí bastante bien en cuanto a ruidos y cama cómoda y grande para ser individual. 
El personal en ocasiones algo serio pero siempre dispuesto a ayudar cuando lo necesitas. 
Es céntrico, en apenas 5 minutos estás en la calle principal de Dublín, y en 10 en Temple Bar. Se llega bien desde el aeropuerto. Aunque por la noche queda algo lejos de la zona de ambiente y la vuelta es algo solitaria dependiendo de la hora. Pero nada preocupante.",4,2016,04,11
229,Thanks a Lot,"Se venite a Dublino per rientrare in camera e finire la serata con la TV accesa avete sbagliato hotel,  la città offre divertimento e svago dalla mattina fino a mezzanotte minimo. Torno a parlare del Castle : moquette come di prassi,  pulizia e cordialità  in mezzo a corridoi labirintuosi che ti introducono in stanze il doppio delle francesi ma con un sorriso al pian terreno.  Sopra il 3 ° piano non si sentono gli avventori del pub che se siete stanchi della giornata vale la pena visitare. Lasciate la finestra aperta,  di notte fa caldo",4,2016,03,30
229,Castlevania,"El hotel está en el centro de Dublín (en el caso de que Dublín tenga centro). De castillo solo tiene el nombre, ya que es más parecido a una mansión victoriana en plena decadencia, con suelos enmoquetados anti gravitacionales y chimeneas que se mantienen en pie contra toda ley física. Tiene varios salones repartidos por la planta baja del hotel, con grandes sofás con acolchados XXL y con polvo acumulado desde el tan aclamado 1916 (pero está de moda recuperar esa época). Además de puertas que no cierran, radiadores que no funcionan, ruidos extraños y un desayuno fat size que no hay español vivo que se lo coma (a entender, alubias, patatas fritas, salchichas y todo un combinado de productos hiper grasientos y súper calóricos para aguantar bien el frío) por no hablar de aquello que en gaélico llaman café y que en mi casa se ha llamado de toda la vida agua de fregar. ",2,2016,03,24
229,Hübsches Hotel mit Charme,"Das Hotel verbirgt sich hinter einer georgianischen Fassade, erstreckt sich offensichtlich über mehrere Häuser und ist dadurch recht verwinkelt. Die Zimmer sind klein, aber zweckmäßig ausgestattet. WLAN ist kostenfrei. Alles sehr sauber.
Das Personal insgesamt ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. An der Rezeption wurden alle Vorgänge zügig bearbeitet und Fragen freundlich und ausführlich beantwortet.
Das Frühstücksbuffet ist überschaubar, insgesamt aber in Ordnung.
In der Kellerbar wird abends Livemusik gespielt (Irish Folk), dabei kann auch gegessen werden. Kleine Karte, aber für jeden etwas dabei. Gutes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis, aufmerksamer Service.
Alle Sehenswürdigkeiten der Stadt sind in fussläufiger Entfernung.
Der Bus vom/zum Flughafen hält ca. 300m entfernt.
",4,2016,03,02
229,Gut für ein paar Nächte,"Nettes Personal, gutes irisches Frühstück, hübsches, charmantes Zimmer. Allerdings ziemlich hellhörig, wir haben den ganzen Tag von frühmorgens an die Musik aus dem Restaurant/Frühstücksraum darunter gehört, außerdem schlagende Türen und Leute am Gang vor unserem Zimmer.",3,2016,02,11
229,Ubicación perfecta para visitar el centro de Dublín,"La ubicación a un paso del centro, y los salones y pub del hotel que invitaban a relajarse y disfrutar de un buen ambiente.

Las paredes son de papel por lo que a veces sientes a los demás huéspedes como si anduvieran por tu habitación.",4,2016,02,10
229,Raccomandabile!,Albergo molto pulito..personale molto gentile..sempre col sorriso molto disponibili..la colazione buona e abbondante..raggiungibile facilmente a piedi il centro della città..siamo stati bene..niente da dire..,4,2016,02,09
229,"Schönes Hotel, aber überteuert!","Wir waren Anfang Oktober von Freitag bis Montag im Castle Hotel. Die Angestellten an der Rezeption waren überaus hilfsbereit und freundlich. Das Hotel ist wirklich sehr schön, aber wir hatten ein entsetzlich kleines Zimmer. Also, schon das Bett war viel zu schmal, eher ein breites Einzelbett, wobei wir in Irland die Erfahrung gemacht haben, das dies öfters so ist. Ansonsten war es kaum möglich, um das Bett herum zu gehen. Das Badezimmer war auch klein, keine Ablagemöglichkeit für irgendwas. Aber wir hätten das alles noch hingenommen, man ist ja auch nicht soviel Zeit im Zimmer. Richtig schlimm war das Frühstück. Man steht erst ewig in der Warteschlange vor der Tür, bis man dann in einen völlig überfüllten Raum gebeten wird, in dem die Tische so eng aneinander stehen, dass es fast nicht möglich ist, seine Platz auf der Sitzbank einzunehmen und wieder zu verlassen, ohne dem Nachbarn das Essen vom Tisch zu fegen. Auf die Tische passt nicht wirklich viel Frühstück, was aber auch nicht schlimm ist, denn es ist äußerst schwierig, überhaupt was zu ergattern. Es gibt eine Art Theke, an der man sich so gut wie nichts selbst nehmen kann. Alles muss bei den äußerst gestressten unwilligen genervten Mitarbeitern angefordert werden - jede Scheibe Käse und jede Scheibe Toast. Die Warteschlange ist auch hier entsprechend lang. Ich weiß nicht, ob es möglich ist, das Zimmer ohne Frühstück zu buchen - falls ja, wäre dies empfehlenswert.",3,2015,12,19
229,Qualità prezzo ottima,"Dopo una lunga e difficile selezione abbiamo prenotato questo albergo, titubanti rispetto ad alcune recensioni non completamente positive. Le foto recenti di tripadvisor rappresentano però la nostra esperienza che è in generale positiva. 
La camera era in realtà leggermente piccola rispetto alle foto ma adatta alle nostre esigenze. Bagno pulito con box doccia (lo avevamo richiesto alla prenotazione, non so se poi sia presente in tutte le camere o meno). La colazione per lo più irlandese risulta forse poco varia, ma rimane un servizio che altri alberghi di questa fascia a Dublino fanno pagare come extra. Un po' rumorosi i passi al piano superiore e sulle scale, visto che avevamo una camera con una parete adiacente. La struttura è di legno e per sentire un'atmosfera domestica questo è il prezzo da pagare :) Nessun problema però a prender sonno.
Posizione molto buona sia per i mezzi da/per l'aeroporto sia per i bus urbani.",4,2015,12,13
229,Strategica location,"La posizione di questo albergo é ottima, centrale, si raggiungono a piedi le principali attrazioni della città ed é fuori dal caos di Temple Bar, tuttavia ha qualche pecca, essendo un edificio piuttosto vecchia gli infissi non sono ben coibentati, il riscaldamento non è ben regolato, le zone comuni sono molto meglio delle camere, l'arredamento é un po vecchiotto ma nel complesso ci tornerei!",4,2015,12,08
229,"Mickriges, trauriges Zimmer","Ich habe ein Einzelzimmer in der Comfort-Katerogie gebucht für 130 Euro pro Nacht (es war also nicht die günstigste Kategorie). Das Zimmer war ein Loch, traurig, dunkel, winzig. Alles sehr hellhörig, man hört jeden Schritt der Nachbarn über einen. Das Komfort-Zimmer entbehrte leider jeden Komforts, winziger Fernseher mit wenigen Programmen, kleines Bad nur mit Dusche. Das Gute am Hotel war die Lage.",2,2015,12,05
229,Muy buen hotel,"Me explico. Justo al final de o'conell street, por lo que caminando llega uno a cualquier sitio mas o menos a cinco cuadras del rio, asi que una ubicacion muy muy buena.  El hotel es en realidad estilo Gregoriano, muy bien conservado por lo que combina muy bien con la ciudad en general, desde que uno ingresa se siente Dublines.  Un dia salimos muy temprano6:30. Y el desayuno lo empiezan a servir hasta las ocho, pero hablamos y nos tenian algo sencillo listo alli, asi que muy atinados.  Proporcionan un mapa de la ciudad y lo ubicana. Uno en la misma, el desayuno es full irlandes, asi que preparese a comer rico y bastante, en la habitacion hay el tipico te con una mesita muy simpatica.  En fin una muy buena experiencia muy acogedor y muy irlandes, no se siente uno extranjero sino como de alla¡!",5,2015,11,17
229,Facinante,"Un hotel hermoso, un pequeño castillo...de madera...ubicación céntrica...excelentes servicios, muy buen comedor...y para finalizar, luego de la cena un espectacular momento con músicos locales, que con calidad y respeto logran un clima intimista y participativo entre todos los asistentes.   La ubicación es estratégica, se puede recorrer a pie el centro de Dublin, está a metros de OConnell St, de Henry St, la calle comercial y a 700 m. de Temple Bar...ideal...",5,2015,11,12
229,Überteuertes Stadthotel,"Positiv an diesem Hotel ist die zentrale Lage in Dublin. Leider war unser Zimmer eher eine Abstellkammer. Man merkt dem ganzen Hotel sein Alter ( 200 Jahre) überall an.
Die Mitarbeiter sind überwiegend freundlich, einige auch bemüht, hilfreich zu sein.
Das Frühstück bekommt man nur an einem Tresen; jeder Toast, jedes Spiegelei, jede Scheibe Käse muss man bei der jeweiligen Tresenkraft persönlich ordern. Meistens sind diese desinteressiert und unfreundlich.",2,2015,11,04
229,Hotel cómodo y bien situado,"El hotel está situado al final de O'Connell street, por lo que la ubicación es bastante céntrica y tranquila. El servicio es bueno, el desayuno completo (estilo irlandés), y un buen servicio de Wifi. En el aspecto negativo en mi caso el tamaño de la habitación, que era muy pequeña.",3,2015,11,03
229,Se puede volver,"Las habitaciones muy limpias.
Nosotros estuvimos en la 4° planta y era muy silenciosa. Las ventana pequeña pero daba a la iglesia.
No pusieron la calefacción, y se estaba bien, pero el baño frío.
Los baños remodelados, como la room. Pero la ducha no tenía presión y salía poca agua.
El desayuno bien organizado: te sientan ellos y te sirven el café( aguado) y la leche. Hay cereales, zumo, salchichas, huevos, revuelto, unas especies de embutidos y unos bollitos.
Se puede volver",4,2015,10,12
229,Un tuffo nel passato,"Hotel situato in una antica dimora di stile georgiano, con la facciata di mattoni rossi e le grandi finestre. Tutti gli interni sono in stile. Tutti gli ambienti hanno la moquette. Nella nostra camera avevo il letto a baldacchino. Tutti gli arredamenti molto belli. La colazione prettamente stile inglese, uova cucinate in vari modi, pancetta, salsicce, fagioli stufati, funghi, patate, porrige. L'hotel si trova a 300 metri dalla fermata del bus navetta che collega la città all'aeroporto.",4,2015,10,06
229,una buona soluzione per chi vuole alloggiare a Dublino,"l'hotel si trova in una zona centralissima facilmente raggiungibile da i bus per e dall'aeroporto e Dublino essendo una  capitale non molto grande la maggior parte delle attrazioni turisti sono facilmente raggiungibili a piedi dall'hotel, in caso contrario sono molte le fermate degli autobus nelle vicinanze. l'hotel è ricavato in una casa giorgiana e ne conserva ancora la struttura la camera in cui ho alloggiato era medio grande silenziosa e i letti comodi... la vista non era un gran che ma meglio così perché essendo sul retro non si sentiva il rumore della strada come mi era invece capitato in un altro hotel. il bagno era pulito con la doccia unica pecca il lavandino senza il miscelatore un po' scomodo ma ci si fa l'abitudine. la colazione compresa nel prezzo era abbondante e fresca forse fuori dai canoni italiani, ma una volta si può provare, comunque sono stati disponibili a portare pane tostato burro e marmellata in quantità per venire in contro alle nostre esigenze. si posso lasciare i bagagli in deposito",5,2015,10,06
229,speciale compleanno,"sono stato con mia sorella per festeggiare i suoi 40 anni e devo dire che mi è piaciuto molto,posto al centro sulla centrale o'connelly Street lato superiore.Stanza molto carina ed essenziale e aveva anche una bella veduta sulla chiesa difronte,pulita,e comoda,colazione molto irish e poco internazionale ma abbondante consigliatissimoo",5,2015,10,04
229,"Centrale e pulito, che altro serve?","Perfetto, essenziale, pulito, vicino al centro, prezzo adeguato. Che altro aggiungere?!? Mi sono trovato davvero bene, se proprio devo trovare qualcosa di negativo, la colazione, poco dolce e sempre le stesse cose, per il resto tutto ok!",4,2015,09,30
229,Schönes Hotel in Dublins Norden mit hilfsbereitem und nettem Personal,"Dieses Hotel ist sehr empfehlenswert. Sehr sauber, gutes Frühstück und nette Angestellte.
Es ist sehr groß und verwinkelt und alles in allem war es etwas laut, aber was kann man von einem größeren Hotel mitten in der Großstadt erwarten?
Ich würde jederzeit wieder hierher kommen!",5,2015,09,20
229,muy bueno,"En líneas generales muy contento en todos los aspectos.
      La atención muy buena. La habitación excelente. Para recomendar.
      La ubicación buena. El desayuno bastante bueno. Y por la noche en el restaurante se podía cenar y para un raro ageadable",4,2015,09,16
229,"Recomendable, buena relación calidad/precio","La única desventaja fue que la habitación que me tocó tenia el servicio fuera, mientras la ducha y lavabo dentro, igualmente estaba informada.
El hotel posee una muy buena ubicación, así como personal y servicios muy correctos.
Tiene una muy buena relación calidad/precio, es muy recomendable.",4,2015,09,09
229,Tolles Hotel,"Habe dieses Hotel schon zwei Mal besucht und würde es immer wieder tun. Preis/ Leistung stimmen.Sehr nettes Personal. Das Hotel wirkt verwunschen, gemütlich.  Für alle die ""Vintage"" und ""Sissi"" lieben ein tolles Hotel. Die Zimmer sind sehr klein, jedoch liebevoll eingerichtet mit dem Charme alter Zeiten.
Wifi-free schadet auch nicht :-) 
Einziger Kritikpunkt: 
Im Frühstücksraum ist es sehr laut und warm. Der Raum wurde vor kurzem renoviert und sieht toll aus. Leider ein sehr ungemütlicher Tagesbeginn.
Wer nach Irland reist, um den irischen Charme zu erleben ist in diesem Hotel genau richtig ♡
",4,2015,09,04
229,Buen hotel,"Lindo hotel, muy prolijo en una muy buena ubicación. La habitación era amplia y limpia, en la misma había una chocolates, jarra eléctrica, tazas y sobres de café y te invitación del hotel. 
El desayuno es genial si se gusta de los desayunos irlandeses. Pero si como en mi caso se prefiere algo menos pasado, es bastante básico: unas tostadas con mermelada, cereales y fruta. 
El staff es cordial y debajo hay un pub en el que se puede tomar y comer algo con música en vivo. No puedo decir mucho al respecto pues nunca comí allí.",4,2015,09,03
229,Angenehmer Aufenthalt im Castle Hotel,"Wir waren für eine Woche in dem Hotel untergebracht und haben uns rundum wohl gefühlt. Unser Zimmer war im zweiten Stock (224) und war tip top sauber, groß genug, weiche Betten und sah genauso aus wie die Bilder auf der Hotelwebsite. 
Das Zimmer lag zur Straße und war immer sehr schön hell aber dafür auch zu gewissen Uhrzeiten recht laut, da direkt an der Straße eine Ampel ist und die Busse dort halten und anfahren. Wer ein ruhigeres Zimmer möchte, sollte sich eines mit Blick auf den Hof wünschen. 

Das Frühstück war Irisch (Bacon, Eier, gebratene Pilze... eher sehr fettig) und wurde an einer Theke ausgegeben (kein Selbstbedienungs-Buffet, der Koch hat einem gegeben, was man möchte). Als Alternativen gab es Toast mit Käse und Marmelade, Joghurt, Müsli und kleine Croissants. Obst gab es leider nicht so viel und das, was es gab bestand aus Dosen-Mandarinen und Ananas. Für ein 3* Hotel ist die Auswahl aber dafür schon äußerst groß!
 
Generell hat uns der Aufenthalt sehr gut gefallen und da wir auch ein etwas traditionelleres Hotel und keine Hotelkette wollten haben wir uns rundum gut aufgehoben gefühlt. Das Personal war super freundlich und zuvorkommend. Abends gab es in der Bar unter dem Hotel Live-Musik aber davon haben wir auf dem Zimmern nichts mitbekommen. Zum Zentrum war es nicht weit und die Hop-on Hop-off Busse halten praktisch direkt vor der Haustür. 
Wir würden das Hotel weiterempfehlen.",4,2015,09,02
229,Lediglich Schlafstätte in City-Nähe,"Wer ganz nah an der City übernachten will ist hier richtig - sonst nicht.

Das frisch bezogene Bett wies einen großen Fleck auf, den auch der Zimmersercive der nächsten Tage wohl immer wieder ""übersah"".
Aus der Dusche kam kaum warmes Wasser. Es dauerte - nur zur besseren Vorstellung - geschlagene 12 Sekunden, um einen Zahnputzbecher mit warmen Wasser zu füllen.
Für 's Frühstück brauchte man Geduld - nein, nicht weil keine Plätze frei waren, sondern weil das ungeschulte Personal nicht in der Lage war freiwerdende Tische abzuräumen und neu einzudecken. Einmal saßen wir das ganze Frühstück über zwischen zwei nicht abgeräumten und neu eingedeckten Tischen und draußen standen die Leute Schlange!
Und hellhörig ist das Haus auch.

Und dran denken - Adapter für die Steckdose mitbringen, wenn man Foto oder Handy aufladen will.",2,2015,09,02
229,"Altes schönes Haus, Zimmer eher einfach, Frühstück sehr irisch","Das Hotel ist in sehr schönen alten Gebäuden. So ist es auch von innen. Das hat seinen Charme. Es ist aber eben auch etwas alt. Trotzdem gefallen die gemütlich alten Räume. Alles ist sehr sauber und gut gepflegt. Das Frühstück mit Bohnen, Würstel etc. ist nicht meine Sache. Ein klassisches Buffet Frühstück würde mir besser behagen. Aber wir sind in Irland also ist ein irisches Frühstück schon ok.",3,2015,08,28
229,Nella media ma ottima posizione,"Albergo in stile antico, i cui veri punti forti sono la posizione (eccellente per visitare dublino a piedi e per prendere i vari autobus o treni per le varie destinazioni) e la cortesia delle ragazze alla reception! Anche la colazione è molto ampia e consente vari tipi di scelta con ovvia prevalenza dei piatti tipici britannici (uova, pancetta, salsiccie, etc...) con un cuoco che cucina il tutto in diretta. Ciò che manca forse é la pulizia ( lenzuola e asciugamani non erano sempre perfetti anzi....) e l' ampiezza (molto molto piccolo) del bagno!!!
Comunque ci ritornerei e lo consiglierei!",3,2015,08,25
229,Hotel encantador,"Este hotel está situado al lado de la calle O'Connell, por lo tanto es muy céntrico. Es de estilo Georgiano decorado con muebles y objetos antiguos. Si buscas un hotel moderno y funcional seguramente no os gustará, pero si buscas un hotel con otro encanto este es vuestro sitio.
Las habitaciones no son muy grandes pero si muy acogedoras. la cama muy cómoda. Los baños si están reformados y son modernos y funcionales. El desayuno básico Irlandés, tienes que ir a pedirlo a una barra, pero no hay limitación, y tiene un horario muy amplio.
Dispone de parquing descubierto pero cerrado.
En los bajos del hotel hay un pub muy agradable con música todos los días y un restaurante donde puedes cenar hasta las 10 de la noche. La relación precio/calidad nos pareció muy adecuada y similar a los precios de los otros restaurantes.
El wifi funciona bastante bien, en los bajos un poco más lento.
El personal es muy agradable y atento, pero no hablan en español.",5,2015,08,24
229,"Ristrutturato, pulito e silenzioso","Ho soggiornato in questo albergo per 15 giorni a luglio. Sono rimasta piacevolmente colpita dalla pulizia degli ambienti che, tra l'altro, erano anche stati rinnovati. Il personale è sempre stato sollecito e disponibile. La colazione è discretamente buona: non ci sono dolci, tranne le marmellatine, ed è un po' monotona; comunque è ok.
Unica nota dolente: il WiFi. Altalenante più che mai! Ogni sera c'è musica dal vivo.",3,2015,08,19
229,Super Hotel für Städtereise ,"Das Hotel ist sehr zentral gelegen und ein paar Meter vom Hotel entfernt befindet sich auch gleich eine Bushaltestelle! Bis zum Flughafen sind es mit dem Bus nur ca. 30 Minuten.
Unser Zimmer war sehr sauber und gemütlich. Das Personal war sehr zuvorkommend und freundlich! Das Frühstück war gut und man hat eine große Auswahl! 
Ich kann das Hotel nur empfehlen!",5,2015,08,16
229,Correcto,"Un sitio correcto pero no se si merece ese precio. Las habitaciones estaban bastante bien, el personal correcto (excepto una de ellas que debe ser a la que todo el mundo le pone malas opiniones) y el desayuno aceptable (esto fue lo que menos me gustó).
Lo mejor? La ubicacion",3,2015,08,13
229,Charmantes Mittelklassehotel in recht guter Lage,"Uns hat es im Castle Hotel sehr gut gefallen. Unser Zimmer war sauber, das Bad war neu und als bei den Freunden im Badezimmer das Wasser nicht richtig abfloss, war der Schaden innerhalb kürzester Zeit behoben. Sehr entgegenkommend und freundlich war das Personal an der Rezeption. Als wir zeitig am Morgen zu einer Tagestour aufbrachen, bekamen wir sofort ein kleineres Frühstück angeboten (außerhalb der Frühstückszeit). Im Pub im Untergeschoss gab es im Juli öfters Live Musik. Die Lage ist an und für sich gut, bis zum Spire sind es ca.8 Gehminuten (= Ausgangspunkt vieler Touren) zum Temple Bar Viertel sind es kanpp 15 Minuten.",4,2015,08,12
229,Lo consiglio a chiunque voglia sentirsi a casa!,"Ho soggiornato insieme al mio ragazzo in questo hotel per 8 giorni e lo consiglierei davvero a chiunque, sicuramente nel caso tornerò a Dublino, prenoterò di nuovo in questa struttura. Il personale dell'hotel (soprattutto quello alla reception che è quello con cui si ha più modo di parlare e scambiare informazioni) e' molto competente d davvero amichevole (ogni giorno vi chiederanno come e' andata la giornata, vi chiederanno se vi state trovando bene.. Vi faranno sentire degli ospiti di prima categoria)! Le stanze dell'hotel sono molto carine e spaziose (non i soliti microscopici buchi), arredate con gusto (in stile vittoriano classico), e con dei bagni appena ristrutturati (unica pecca: L'assenza dei bidet .. Ma si sa che praticamente non esistono al di fuori dell'Italia). La stanza ottimamente pulita, veniva ogni giorno sistemata e ogni giorno lasciavano in omaggio sul letto cioccolatini e biscottini. Nella stanza e' possibile prepararsi un the caldo, una camomilla o un caffè con l'apposito bollitore.. E quotidianamente ti rimpiazzano ciò che si è usato. La colazione del mattino e' davvero abbondante .. Comprende (a scelta) fagioli, patate, pomodori, bacon, salsicce, funghi, White e black pudding, uova, purè, marmellate, miele, pane tostato, corn flakes, ogni tanto anche qualche sfoglia al cioccolato... Il tutto accompagnato da the, caffè, succo di frutta o latte. Altra nota positiva dell'hotel e' il pub.. Nel piano interrato della struttura si accede direttamente al pub che prepara ottimi piatti tradizionali e che ogni giorno, dalle 21, ospita cantanti irlandesi bravissimi.. Che vi intratterranno fino a mezzanotte. Io mi sono trovata benissimo! Lo consiglio! 5 stelle meritatissime! Mi sono sentita a casa.. In Irlanda! :)",5,2015,08,12
229,Bett zu klein. Frühstück billige Massenabfertigung. Preis Leistung stimmt nicht!!!,"Kurz und knapp:

+ Zentrumnah gelegen (15min bis Temple Bar Viertel)
+ Busse zum Airport schnell erreichbar (Linie 16, 41, 41C...)
+ es ist zwar alt und plüschig eingerichtet aber nicht muffig 
+ gute Restaurants in Laufnähe, ebenfalls Supermärkte Starbucks und Co.

Und nun zum Grund für die schlechte Punktzahl:
- das Bett für 2 Erwachsene war gerade 140x190 cm. Damit war an erholsamen Schlaf nicht zu denken
- Decke ebenfalls zu klein für 2
- das Frühstück war langweilig, kaum Auswahl, konserviert, jeden Morgen dasselbe und definitiv nicht den Preis wert. Leider ist das Frühstück hier billig und funktional und hat nichts mit Wertschätzung dem zahlenden Kunden gegenüber zu tun 
- frisches Obst gab es nur gegen Aufpreis
- warum werden auch hier die Handtücher getauscht obwohl man sie aufhängt und sich das Hotel zum Wäschesparen bekennt? Das muss heutzutage nicht sein

Service war ok. Freundlich bis auf eine Dame. 
Ich kann das Hotel nur empfehlen wenn man auswärts frühstücken will und nur die Nähe zum Stadtzentrum wichtig ist.
PS gegen Möwen und Hellhörigkeit helfen oropax. In einem Altbau in der Preisklasse muss man nicht erwarten dass alles perfekt isoliert ist.

229,Gutes Mittelklassehotel,"Diese Bewertung ist für Zimmer 228! Unser Doppelbettzimmer lag zum Hof und daher in den ersten Nächten recht ruhig, jedoch bekamen wir dann neue Zimmernachbarn die ,laut waren (ab 1.00 Uhr nachts) und man jedes Wort mithören konnte. Ansonsten war das Zimmer geräumig, mit grossem Bad und einer Duschkabine (endlich mal kein Vorhang). Die Reinigung hätte etwas besser sein können.Unser Bett bestand leider aus zwei Teilen,so dass es die Tendenz hatte auseinander zu rutschen. Ansonsten ist alles etwas in die Jahre gekommen aber noch völlig O.K. Der Weg zum Zimmer ist sehr verwinkelt mit Treppen dazwischen (mit Gepäck sollte man gut zu Fuß sein). Zum Frühstück bleibt zu sagen ,dass es, wenn es voll ist, zwei Frühstücksräume gibt. Der eine befindet sich im Keller, in dem man das leckere irische Frühstück vom freundlichen Personal serviert bekommt. Im oberen Raum Selbstbedienung wobei das Personal die Teller befüllt (warmes Frühstück). Zu erwähnen ist noch, dass es eine Computerecke mit Drucker gibt, die man z.b. zum Drucken der Bordkarten nutzen kann. Bar und Restaurant sind vorhanden, wurden von uns aber nicht genutzt.In der Bar gibt es jeden Abend Live Musik.",3,2015,07,31
229,Desagradable recibimiento,"Llegué a Dublín con maravillosas expectativas y el recibimiento, la poca atención de las recepcionistas ante nuestras necesidades, opacó mi estadía, el hotel tiene su encanto, pero al ser de habla hispana, nadie se preocupó por darme información, no solo de la ciudad, de las atracciones ect, sino que se mostraron totalmente indiferente a las necesidades de mi marido y mias, no lo aconsejo y jamás volvería a ese hotel",2,2015,07,30

229,"Vicino al centro, pulito e confortevole","Hotel abbastanza centrale ( a piedi ci si impiega 15 minuti) , comodo e confortevole. Colazione piuttosto continentale ma comunque abbondante. Camere pulite silenziose e spaziose. Personale educato e cortese eccetto una signora dèlla reception che faceva finta di non capirci ed è stata arrogante e maleducata. Hotel provvisto anche di un ristorante in cui alle sera dopo le 21 suonano dal vivo musica tipica irlandese.",4,2015,07,16
229,Il fascino non basta,"Hotel storico situato in una zona abbastanza vicina al centro di Dublino.
Moquette spessa sui pavimenti di legno che cigolavano, ascensore guasto il giorno di arrivo con conseguente arrivo nelle stanze portando i bagagli (lo avrebbero fatto loro ma i tempi erano lunghi...). Stanza piccola con il doppio vetro della finestra rotto. I rumori della strada si sentivano tutti. Dormito veramente poco e male. Penso che a Dublino ci sia di meglio. Hotel scelto dall'agenzia di viaggio.",2,2015,07,08
229,Restaurant/Bar,"Das Hotel ist sehr hübsch eingerichtet, die Zimmer sind städtisch klein aber i.O. Was gar nicht geht ist das Restaurant/ die Bar.

Der Service war sehr gelangweilt und wollte eigentlich keine Gäste. Die Teller wollten wir schon selber in die Küchw bringen.., 
das Essen war sehr mäßig. Nudeln ungenießbar, mein Beef war aus der Mikrowelle und der Nachtisch wurde gleich ganz vergessen.

229,comodo e lontano dal caos urbano,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo simpatico hotel nella seconda settimana di giugno. Abbiamo chiesto una camera lontano dai rumori e siamo stati accontentati, ci hanno assegnato la 326 con due letti separati un armadio capiente e un bel bagno spazioso. La colazione viene servita a partire dalla 7 e offriva un po' di tutto, pane marmellate miele salsicce uova pesce fritto bacon cereali yogurt caffè e tè. A pagamento si poteva richiedere il cappuccino con caffè espresso e latte di soia. In alcune sere in taverna c'era il piano bar con le musiche irlandesi. L'hotel rimane vicino al parco delle rimembranze, a nord del fiume Liffey, uscendo a destra c'è O'Connell Street, proseguendo su questa via fino in fondo in 10 minuti si raggiungeva il centro. Ci siamo trovati bene, consigliato",4,2015,06,13
229,Excellent value in an excellent location,"L'hotel offre, oltre all'eleganza georgiana, un'ottima organizzazione a partire dall'arrivo in camera (cioccolatini sui cuscini ed arredamento confortevole) fino al cibo della colazione (full irish breakfast). In pieno centro, a due passi dalla via principale e dalle fermate degli autobus più utili (l'Airlink e il Bus Turistico Hop-on Hop-off). Camere pulite e soprattutto il bagno ristrutturato e confortevole. Wi Fi gratuito. Le ragazze al ricevimento sono molto gentili ed efficienti. La cosa interessante è il servizio colazione sempre ben organizzato fin dall'accoglienza. Ristorante/taverna  con musica dal vivo irlandese e menù interessante!

Corridoio in pendenza, sembra di essere sulla torre di Pisa ma non crea grandi problemi, alla fine. Nell'interrato c'è un pub di sitle tipico irlandese con musica dal vivo. Si può cenare a circa 20-25 euro a testa(ottimo il loro grande filetto servito con patate fritte e verdure miste + una birra guinness o altra marca a scelta). La colazione è solo irlandese, niente dolcetti ma appena fuori ci sono negozi che ne hanno di tutti i tipi. L'hotel è situato in zona centrale ed è facilmente raggiungibile con il bus dall'aeroporto; il bus turistico  staziona dall'altro lato della strada. A 10 minuti a piedi da Temple Bar, dove c'è la vita notturna. Se tornassi a Dublino ci tornerei senza dubbi.",4,2015,05,06

Con una cama comodísima, wi-fi decente, ducha con presión, desayuno irlandés estupendo y con un bar-restaurante con música irlandesa en directo. El edificio se alberga en 3 o 4 típicas casas georgianas. Sí! Las de las puertas de colores. Sin duda, es mi hotel elegido para siempre que visite esta bella ciudad. 
Por cierto, los dueños del hotel se nos presentaron amablemente a nuestra llegada, todo un detalle. Gente super simpática. 
Por decir algo menos positivo, el armario era un poco pequeño y para aquellos a los que no le guste  el desayuno irlandés, le puede resultar un poco escaso el resto de desayuno.",5,2015,05,01

E' sia facile che veloce fare colazione con i giovani camerieri che, organizzatissimi, ti fanno accomodare in uno splendido salotto dove si mangia. L'unica pecca potrebbe essere la musica la sera, che però smette verso le 23. Mai dormito così bene, mai stata così comoda. Inoltre per chi viene dall'aeroporto e non vuole spendere in airbus può prendere il bus 16 che si ferma a 2 min dall'hotel in Parnell Square.

Jedes mal wenn ich eine Frage zur Buchung hatte konnte ich Ihnen direkt eine E-Mail schreiben und Sie haben immer sehr freundlich und ein paar stunden später geantwortet.
Die Zimmer waren alle ordentlich, gemütlich und sauber. 
Einer der größten Vorteile war natürlich die zentrale Lage des Hotels. Wir mussten in der Woche kein einziges mal ein öffentliches Verkehrsmittel in Anspruch nehmen, da man so gut wie alle Sehenswürdigkeiten vom Hotel zu Fuß erreichen kann. 
Das einzige kleine Manko war vllt das Frühstück, da es keine ganz so große Auswahl hatte (eben ""nur"" die traditionellen irischen Sachen).
Wir alle sind der Meinung dass wir bei unserem nächsten Besuch auf jeden Fall wieder das Castle Hotel buchen würden!",5,2015,03,25
229,Agradable Vintage s.XIX,"Agradable estancia. Desayuno irlandés (salchichas, huevos, champiñones y bacon) café o té (yo pedí chocolate). Cerca de O'Connell Street para conectar con rutas urbanas y el centro de la ciudad. Zona tranquila para dormir con niños, aunque se pueden oir muchos ruídos si te tocan vecinos poco cívicos.",4,2015,03,23
229,Perfetto,"Non mi aspettavo nulla di simile: è davvero eccezionale! a partire dall'arrivo in camera (cioccolatini sui cuscini ed arredamento confortevole) fino al cibo della colazione (full irish breakfast). In pieno centro, a due passi dalla via principale e alle fermate degli autobus più utili. Servizio ottimo. Prezzo più che buono in rapporto con la qualità. Unica pecca è il fatto che spesso si sentono i rumori dei vicini. Voto 10+!",5,2015,03,14
229,Splendido!,Io e il mio ragazzo abbiamo alloggiato in questo hotel ad Ottobre 2014. Appena arrivati ci ha fatto molto piacere sapere che ci era stata affidata una tripla in un piano più esclusivo dell'hotel. La vista era spettacolare direttamente sulla chiesa! Lo consiglio vivamente!,5,2015,02,05
229,Semplice e carino,"Hotel nato dall'unione di due alberghi, una parte più moderna e una ""old Style"" che crea un'atmosfera particolare ...A pochi minuti a piedi si raggiunge il centro città (anche se nei pressi dell'hotel c'è una fermata di bus). Camere deliziose e silenziose.Buona colazione, personale molto gentile. Wi Fi gratuito. Ristorante/taverna ottimo con musica dal vivo irlandese. Se dovessi trovare dei difetti direi le camere particolarmente calde... Il bagno essenziale e con pochi accessori. Colazione buona ma con poca varietà di dolci. Ferma restando la qualità prezzo, e trattandosi di un tre stelle, sono dettagli comunque irrilevanti...!",4,2015,02,02
229,comodità ed eleganza,"l'hotel si trova in una posizione comoda e centrale, non nel caos ed è a 5' min a piedi dalla fermata dell'autobus per l'aeroporto, ci sono pub, centri commerciali e musei nelle vicinanze, inoltre la cucina è ottima e l'arredamento delle sezioni in comune è tranquillamente elegante, consiglio!",4,2015,01,14
229,Confort con estilo y buen servicio,"Fuimos con mi viejo,
Habitación: Largos corredores hacia la habitación, lo sufrimos un poco al tener las valijas pesadas, pero nos las arreglamos. La habitación tenía de todo: cafetera eléctrica, aire acondicionado central, camas confortables, baño inmenso y lleno de facilidades y productos. Contaba con caja de seguridad y un buen placard. 
Ubicación excelente, a 2 cuadras de O'Connel street, una ubicación soñada.
Desayuno y atención: para el desayuno hay un ""regimiento"" de personal esperando para atenderte, y ni hablar de la abudancia del desayuno: fría, caliente, panes de todo tipo, único, el mejor desayuno de europa. El dueño/administrador del lugar, fue muy simpático con nosotros. 
Tuvimos un único desencuentro con éste hotel, y fue que teníamos un plan de pasar el día en las Aran Islands (cosa que anhelábamos hacer), les pedimos ayuda a la recepción para lograrlo pero fue insuficiente y terminamos sin hacerlo. Pudo haber sido más eficiente si los turnos de recepción se hubieran comunicado mejor.
En conclusión fue un gran hotel, y volveríamos con seguridad.",5,2015,01,11
229,Ben posizionato,"Sono stata in questo albergo per 2 notti e mi sono trovata abbastanza bene, l'edificio è piuttosto vecchio ma ben tenuto ed il personale molto cortese. Purtroppo avevamo un solo termosifone in camera e non erano presenti riscaldamenti nel bagno, tutto sommato la camera risultava calda. La posizione è ottima, da o' connell street si può visitare a piedi tutta il centro città molto comodamente. Ah, le prese hanno l'attacco irlandese, ma chiedendo alla reception si ottiene un adattatore universale da restituire alla partenza.",3,2015,01,11
229,HOTEL NELLA MEDIA,"Io e la mia famiglia abbiamo alloggiato in questo hotel 4 notti. Arrivati il venerdì sera la camera non era delle più pulite ma fatto notare è stato subito risolto tutto. In bagno il fatto di avere due rubinetti, uno per acqua calda ed uno per quella fredda, ha dato dei problemi soprattutto alle bimbe che hanno rischiato di scottarsi con la prima. Decisamente da sostituire quel lavello perchè nel 2014 impossibile avere un bagno ancora così.
La camera comunque nel complesso ha soddisfatto le ns. esigenze che erano solo di starci per dormire e riposare una mezz'oretta prima di uscire a cena.
La colazione viene servita in un locale che è aperto anche per gli esterni e non ho trovato nulla da dire. Siamo in Irlanda... Certo la colazione dolce è quasi inesistente ma se richiesti brioches vengono dati anche più volte. la colazione non è un vero e proprio buffet ma c'è un cuoco che la serve. Il buffet è solo per yogurt e cereali, spremute ed acqua. Se richiesto a pagamento si possono avere caffè espresso e cappuccio (prezzi alti ma buona qualità)
Alla reception sono tutti molto sorridenti e cordiali e la presenza di Melissa di origine italiana ci ha garantito buone informazioni per goderci Dublino a pieno.
Melissa ci ha organizzato un taxi sia per l'arrivo che per il ritorno dall'aereporto all'hotel.
Nelle vicinanze dell'hotel (10minuti a piedi) abbiamo sempre trovato qualche locale per le cene.
il wifi gratuito non ha mai dato problemi ed anche nelle camere era veloce. Avrei apprezzato avere delle prese di corrente anche vicino ai comodini ma è un problema comune in tantissimi hotel anche più moderni e recenti.
Nel complesso hotel nella media che comunque consiglierei.",3,2014,12,26
229,Buon appoggio per visitare Dublino,"Hotel ben posizionato con parcheggio per auto interno a pagamento; stanze dislocate su vari piani comodamente servite da ascensore. Colazione ottima ed abbondante stile inglese. Personale molto cortese ovviamente parlare bene la lingua aiuta non poco. Moquette ovunque e sottofondi scricchiolanti old Style. Zone comuni molto calde.
Purtroppo ci è stata assegnata una stanza (222) con dei serramenti non proprio ottimi e risultava un po' freddina poco male visto che siamo sempre stati in giro.
Nel complesso una buona base di partenza per visitare Dublino.
",3,2014,12,14
229,Albergo a tre stelle niente di più,"Un albergo senza nessuna pretesa, la camera piuttosto piccola ed il letto veramente piccolo misura tipo una piazza e mezza. Colazione abbondante nel salato nulla nei dolci . Nessuna presa per collegare con presa italiana . Chiesta alla reception hanno voluto 10 euro fi cauzione !!! Hotel non troppo rumoroso bagno piccolo con phon in camera da letto invece che nel bagno. Stanza bella calda . 
Soggio",3,2014,12,12
229,Muy buena ubicacion,"Excelente ubicacion, puedes ir andando a todos los sitios del centro de la ciudad. Las habitaciones son amplias y comodas, y los desayunos muy buenos y abundantes. Un acierto de sitio. El personal muy atento.",4,2014,12,08
229,nella media,"ho recentemente soggiornato presso questo hotel (anche basandomi sulle recensioni di altri viaggiatori) ed ho trovato esattamente quello che mi aspettavo, in un palazzo in stile georgiano, quindi classico per Dublino,un hotel più che discreto. avevamo prenotato 2 camere matrimoniali, una, la 415, si trova al quarto piano: d'angolo, con 3 finestre che consentono una discreta vista, grande televisore con pochi canali sintonizzati, piccolo bagno, abbastanza spaziosa. l'altra, la 330, al terzo piano, vista sul cortile, bagno più grande, piccolo televisore sempre con pochi canali. in entrambe piumone abbastanza stretto e corto. buona pulizia. necessario per preparare te o caffè.in tutto l'albergo e nelle camere moquette che necessiterebbe di sostituzione. colazione abbondante all'irlandese, cioè solo salato, non aspettatevi brioche o dolcetti (per quello rivolgetevi al bar subito al lato all'hotel).possibilità di mangiare in albergo a prezzi accettabili, Dublino è cara, e di sentire musica dal vivo in alcune serate. l'albergo si trova a pochi minuti dal centro, ben raggiungibile a piedi e fornisce servizio taxi a prezzi ragionevoli da e per l'aeroporto. alla reception personale non molto cordiale (sembravano sempre molto impegnati) ad eccezione di Melissa, una gentile ragazza italiana che ci ha fornito molte informazioni utili. gentile invece il personale del ristorante/pub e della sala colazione. molto simpatico il taxista che ci ha riaccompagnato all'aeroporto. nel complesso un'esperienza positiva, ma se ritornassi a Dublino non necessariamente ritornerei in questo Hotel",3,2014,11,21
229,Excelente atención ,"Nuestra estadía en este hotel fue muy buena. 
En primer lugar, destacar al personal que es muy correcto y amable ya que te ayudan en todo lo que pueden con mucha paciencia. 
Nuestra habitación era bastante grande, con un sillón, escritorio y una cama muy cómoda para un descanso buenísimo luego de tanto caminar. 
Además el desayuno es muy completo y lo mejor... Se sirve hasta las 10. 
Un hotel muy recomendable y al que volvería de todas maneras. ",5,2014,10,16
229,Bello,"Sono stata con 4 amiche il 4 e 5 ottobre. L'Hotel è  veramente carino. Camere spaziose specialmente la tripla. La colazione ottima e abbondante.  Il prezzo veramente cheap (2 notti 120 euro inclusa colazione).
Posizione abbastanza centrale.  Noi ci siano spostate a piedi sia x visitare  Trinity College che tutto il resto. X visitare Guiness Storehouse consiglio il tram (linea rossa).",4,2014,10,08
229,zentral gelegen,"Es ist ein altes, ganz offensichtlich abgeliebtes Hotel. Sehr weitläufig und auf Halbetagen um hundert Ecken - very british. Plüsch. Kein Parkservice - wäre bei dem sehr sehr sehr engen Parkraum im Hof empfehlenswert. Netter Empfang und gute Tipps für die Umgebung. Wir hatten ein Familienzimmer. Ganz offensichtlich war dies früher ein Damenempfangssalon gwesen. Jetzt mit Plüschteppich, der verhinder, das wir durch den Dielenboden krachten. Wunderschöne Stuckdecken - leider grob übergepinselt, genau wie die früher sicher schönen Fensterholzklappläden. Die Fenster sehr hoch, einfach verglast und sicher aus Kaiserszeiten. Trotz Wärme draussen, schön kühl drinnen - im Winter nicht zu empfehlen. Bad grob abgeteilt ohne Klima nach draussen-Toilettengeruch nach Bohnenverdauung bleibt also im Raum erhalten.... . Frühstück frisch zubereitet, leckerer Kaffee satt und auch Aufschnitt und Käse gab es ganz rechts neben cdem Buffett auf Nachfrage. Standard einfach, abgeliebt, aber für Stadtbesuche wegen der Lage im Sommer zu empfehlen.",3,2014,10,03
229,Buen hotel en un lugar estratégico.,"Buen hotel en un lugar estratégico para explorar la ciudad. Eso si, algo alejado del temple bar. 
Hotel limpio y comfortable. 
Tiene un restaurante (Old music shop) donde se come muy bien.
Personal amable, especialmente en recepción. 
Lo negativo, el mobiliario. Pues en mi opinión se ve viejo. ",3,2014,09,29
229,"Buon hotel, staff gentilissimo","Un hotel abbastanza particolare, caratteristico e ben organizzato. 
La stanza era molto comoda, il bagno grosso anche se carente di luoghi dove appoggiare le cose... ma certo è un ""non-problema"". Piuttosto silenzioso. Forse poche prese elettriche.
La cosa che più ci ha colpito è stata la cortesia dello staff, sempre a disposizione per supportarci nelle nostre richieste che andavano dal suggerimento di posti dove mangiare (caratteristici o meno), alla prenotazione dei biglietti di ingresso per qualche spettacolo... insomma uno staff veramente preparato e pronto. Oltretutto una delle persone era di origine italiana.",4,2014,09,27
229,Ottimo!,"Ottimo hotel con fascino d'altri tempi, a pochi minuti dal centro; io e mia figlia ci siamo trovate benissimo!  il servizio è veramente ottimo e il personale molto cortese e disponibile, ci tornerei sicuramente se dovessi ritornare a Dublino",4,2014,09,17
229,Posizione perfetta!,"Abbiamo soggiornato tre giorni in questo hotel, residenza d'epoca da poco ristrutturata. L'esperienza è stata molto positiva sia per la posizione centrale ma esterna dai rumori del traffico che per la camera molto grande con un bagno non grande ma compreso di tutto recentemente rinnovato. La colazione irlandese abbondante.",4,2014,09,15
229,Ottima scelta,"Si tratta di un hotel molto carino in edificio vittoriano. Ho pernottato in 2 diverse occasioni nello stesso viaggio in Irlanda. La mia camera (viaggio con 2 bambini) è sempre stata molto grande, accogliente e spaziosa. Sul bagno niente da dire, ottimo. Alla reception le signore sono sempre molto disponibili. Per chi ha problemi di lingua segnalo la presenza di una gentilissima ragazza italiana che lì lavora. C'è poco da fare ma per chi non sa la lingua è una buona comodità. Colazione ottima. Parcheggio interno 10 euro al giorno. Il centro è 5 minuti a piedi. Consigliatissimo. NB: occhio alle stanze che danno sulla strada: le finestre non sono molto insonorizzate...anzi...",4,2014,08,31
229,"Zum ""nur-schlafen"" ok.","Größter Vorteil des Castle Hotels ist die Nähe zu Temple Bar, dem abendlichen Spaß-Viertel in Dublin. Von hier aus geht man gerade mal 10-15 Minuten, und selbst diese sind schön.

Gegenüber gleich eine schöne Kirche, daneben der ""Garden of remembrance"", auch an dem Spire kommt man direkt vorbei. Also kein langweiliger Weg, und auch keiner durch kleine, dunkle Gassen.

Das Hotel selbst ist erstmal alt. Von aussen sieht man gar nicht, wie viele Häuser hier dazu gehören - es ist innen recht weitläufig. Alles ist recht rot, viele Teppiche, dunkles Holz. Der Aufzug klein, funktioniert aber. Treppenstufen sind zum Teil abgelaufen, eine war schon sehr brüchig, wurde dann auf unseren Hinweis zumindest notdürftig repariert.

Das Zimmer ist zweckmäßig, nicht sonderlich groß, zwei Betten, ein Schrank, ein Mini-Röhren-TV. Kein Safe, immerhin ein Wasserkocher mit Tee/Kaffee und Milch.

Das Zimmer war sauber und wurde auch jeden Tag geputzt.

Wenig schön ist der Ausblick, direkt auf den Parkplatz im Hinterhof. Früh morgens nerven die Möwen ziemlich, das gehört aber wohl zu Dublin. Das Fenster ist leider so, dass es bei Regen stark auf das innenliegende Fensterbrett regnet, auch, wenn es nur auf Kipp steht.

Insgesamt sehr hellhörig, wenn draußen jemand vorbei ging, klang es, als ginge er an meinem Bett vorbei.

Das Frühstück ist erstmal in Ordnung. Marmeladen aus kleinen Hotel-Packungen, zwei Joghurts, dazu Mandarinen und noch eine Südfrucht aus der Dose, Toast und Röstbrot wird gemacht, dazu alles vom ""full english"" so, wie man es mag, vom Kellner auf den Teller.

Leider hat sich das Frühstück über die 4 Tage, die wir da waren, in keiner Kleinigkeit geändert - immer genau das gleiche - was dann schon keine große Freude mehr aufkommen ließ. Ein wenig Abwechslung, anderes Obst, ein Omelette, irgendwas, wäre schon toll.

WLAN ist gratis, im Zimmer nicht überall zu ""erwischen"", man musste schauen, wo es ging.

Fazit: Für ein Wochenende mit Ziel ""schlafen und raus"" völlig ok, für ein Paar etc., die auch Zeit im Hotel genießen wollen ein no-go.",3,2014,08,13
229,Zum Dublin entdecken-perfekt,"Als Alleinreisender war das Castle perfekt für mich.Das Einzelzimmer war für mich gerade richtig.Ich konnte alles zu Fuss erreichen und erkunden.Das Personal war freundlich und zuvorkommend.Das Frühstück war so wie ich es mir vorgestellt hatte.Ich bin im Ausland- also versorge ich mich wie die Einheimischen.
Das Zimmer war stets Ordentlich und sauber.",4,2014,07,28
229,Muy british,"Curioso hotel,con encanto,vetusto repleto de antiguedades(muebles,cuadros,porcelanas)que dan un bonito ambiente, desde luego si no te gustan los hoteles decadentes no vayas, si no es así es ideal. 
INCONVENIENTES
-Poca presión de agua
-Ni hablan español ni se preocupan de que  les entiendas
-incómodo para personas con movilidad limitada,escaleras por todas partes
-si no te gusta desayuno irlandés,pocas opciones
VENTAJAS
-céntrico
-muy limpio
-camas cómodas",3,2014,07,22
229,Settimana a Dublino,"Ho soggiornato la scorsa settimana al Castle Hotel di Dublino, l'esperienza è stata positiva. L'albergo è ""old style"" come tutti quelli nella zona più centrale della città; appare comunque ordinato e pulito nonostante la presenza della moquette che nelle camere e nei corridoi ricopre il parquet in legno. La camera ""singola"" era comunque con letto matrimoniale e adeguata come dimensioni alle esigenze di un viaggiatore singolo; il bagno (cieco) dotato di doccia all'interno della vasca da bagno. A finestre chiuse non si avvertono rumori esterni ma purtroppo le pareti e la porta di legno della camera non insonorizzano troppo i rumori provenienti dal corridoio e dalle camere adiacenti. La reception è presidiata 24 ore su 24; il personale giovane e disponibile nel rispondere alle necessità degli ospiti. Wi-Fi perfettamente funzionante nelle camere, c'è inoltre un PC disponibile nell'atrio del salottino d'ingresso, di fronte all'ascensore. La colazione migliore è quella ""english"" con uova, bacon e toast; non ci sono dolci (se non a pagamento), neanche cornetti o biscotti.  Disponibile un ""early breakfast"" per chi deve lasciare l'albergo entro le 8 del mattino, sebbene sia un pò improvvisata (e comunque solo ""continental""). La posizione dell'albergo consente di raggiungere facilmente il centro città e tutti i luoghi di interesse turistico.",3,2014,07,06
229,Speravo meglio,"Di solito quando vado in una città straniera cerco sempre un albergo di grandi catene (Radisson, Novotel, ecc.); ma a Dublino non sembrano esserci a meno che non ti allontani dal centro. Non è però conveniente perchè saresti legato ai mezzi (non proprio economici) quando la città è visitabile comodamente a piedi. Questo albergo non brilla certo per pulizia (ma non è una sorpresa per un paese del nord europa); nella colazione mancano dolci di qualsiasi tipo (ci sono ma a pagamento!): dal cornetto a dei semplici biscotti.  Nel pub al piano inferiore organizzano serate di ottima musica irlandese. Il personale è giovane, gentile e disponibile. Per un soggiorno di pochi giorni va benissimo! Mi raccomando non andate a mangiare nella zona di Temple Bar. E' molto caratteristica, ma potrete mangiare le stesse cose a minor prezzo allontanandovi un po'.
Buona vacanza",3,2014,07,05
229,Ottima posizione,"Abbiamo soggiornato in quattro persone in questo hotel, molto comodo per la vicinanza ai mezzi e al centro di Dublino. Gli interni sono vecchio stile ma sarebbero un po da ristrutturate, molto odore di magiare si sentiva ovunque per le scale in camera ecc... colazione un po scarsa la continentale mentre la colazione all'inglese era ottima. Gentilissime le ragazze della recention.
Da consigliare se si vuole spendere poco ma nel complesso non ci tornerei.",3,2014,07,03
229,carino!,"albergo semplice e centrale.
personale cortese. albergo old style. organizzano talvolta concerti di musica irlandese. silenzioso . camere non molto grandi essenziali ma pulite. accogliente. colazione semplice ma buona",4,2014,06,30
229,Bedingt empfehlenswert,"Die Einrichtung des Hotels ist alt, aber nicht zu beanstanden. Man fühlt sich wirklich wie in einem Castle. Die Zimmer waren groß und sauber, kostenloses W-Lan inklusive. Allerdings ist das Hotel sehr laut. Man hört jeden Toilettengang des Nachbars, inklusive Spülung, die ungefähr so laut ist wie ein vorbeifahrender LKW. Und zu diesem Thema ist zu sagen, dass die Busse direkt durch die Straße vor dem Hotel fahren und es sich anhört, als fahren sie durchs Zimmer - bei geschlossenem Fenster. Diese lassen sich nämlich auch nur ca. 10 cm weit öffnen. Das Personal war nett, konnte aber leider die Negativpunkte nicht ausgleichen. Das Frühstück war einfallslos und man musste lange warten.",2,2014,06,27
229,senza troppe pretese,L'albergo si trova a circa 15 minuti a piedi dal centro città. L'albergo è modesto molto OLD style con le scale in legno che emettono il classico scricchiolio quando le si salgono e scendono. Anche l'insonorizzazione delle stanze non lascia molto all'immaginazione. La colazione è nella media anche se le sale (sono più di una) sono relativamente piccole e si crea della confusione. L'albergo dispone di un PUB interno dove fanno musica dal vivo tutte le sere. cercate di non farvi dare stanze al piano terra in quanto fino alle 23:30/24:00 avrete le musica del PUB che Vi terrà compagnia o le macchine lato strada che faranno altrettanto,3,2014,06,06
229,Carino ma non eccezionale,"Sono stata a mangiare presso il ristorante del Castle Hotel con 11 amici. Il ristorante è sottoterra, nelle cantine, l'atmosfera è accogliente e mentre mangiate vi può capitare di ascoltare della buona musica irlandese da parte di artisti locali. I piatti erano buoni, senza troppe pretese, ci ha deluso il dolce che doveva essere un crumble di frutta ma in realtà era una crostata. Per antipasto, piatto principale, dolce e birra abbiamo speso circa 30 Euro a testa.
Al momento ci sono dei lavori in corso, qualche lenzuolo bianco intorno alle pareti spezza l'armonia della sala.",3,2014,06,03
229,soggiorno con amici al castle hotel,"ho soggiornato a maggio per 3 notti al castle hotel con alcuni amici.L'hotel in stile georgiano ha di positivo il silenzio e la vicinanza a tutte le principali attrazioni di dublino raggiungibili a piedi o con mezzi pubblici facilmente reperibili: colazione molto semplice e ripetitiva, personale disponibile,pulizia al minimo indispensabile,moquette datata e in tutte le aree , wifi ben servito ,camera grande ma poco insonorizzata(si sentono le persone che parlano nella stanza accanto),da sconsigliare il ristorante dell'hotel molto caro e non all'altezza di qualsiasi altro pub irlandese.",3,2014,05,21
229,Perfekt für Stadtbesichtigung,"Das Castle Hotel liegt perfekt um Dublin zu Fuss zu erkundigen. Die Zimmer sind zweckmässig und gemütlich eingerichtet und verfügen über sehr bequeme Betten und einen Wasserkocher für Tee- und Kaffezubereitung. 
Das Frühstück war ok, die Auswahl zufriedenstellend, Irish Breakfast sehr lecker. Das Restaurant überzeugte uns voll, qualitativ gute Nahrungsmittel und frisch verarbeitet. Die Bar lief gut, im Gegensatz zu den meisten Hotelbars. Livemusik (Do-So in der Hauptsaison), moderate Preise und sehr freundliches Personal, das uns auch gerne kleine irische Geschichten erzählte. Wenn sie ein Whiskeyfan sind, empfehle ich ihnen den Midleton, der ist zwar mit 16 Euro eher teuer, aber eine absolute Offenbarung.
Das Hotel ist sauber und gepflegt und verfügt über gratis W-Lan.
Das Spitzenrestaurant Chapter One befindet sich in unmittelbarer Nähe.
Bei meinen nächsten Besuchen in Dublin, werde ich bestimmt wieder hier einchecken.
",5,2014,05,20
229,Very old style!,"Hotel in stile georgiano, un pò datato, con moquette ovunque e scale e scalette!
Colazione scarsa, nel senso che da mangiare a parte prosciutto e formaggio, c'è pane burro e marmellata, yoghurt con cereali, e da bere, stop! Quindi dimenticatevi pancakes, muffins, plum cake, nothing!
La prima camera piccola e con bagno minuscolo e scomodo con vasca, mentre la secona camera la 103 meglio, con doccia e un pò + ampia. Anche se essendo al piano terra la sera fino ad una certa ora si sente la musica di qualche locale molto vicino.
Per quanto riguarda il transfer serale dall'aeroporto prenotato (€ 28) con hotel, un vero caos: ho aspettato mezzora al punto di incontro, dopo varie telefonate fatte in hotel e alla compagnia dei taxi (grazie a dei signori irlandesi che hanno chiamato dai loro cell), con quasi 1 ora di ritardo si è presentato il tassista con un furgoncino scalcagnato e che non sapeva bene nemmeno dive andare. Per fortuna che era simpatico! Insomma, non saprei se ci sono hotel anche più vicini alle zone di interesse e che costino meno o uguali. Da vedere...ma credo ci sia di meglio!",3,2014,05,20

L'albergo offre sia la colazione tipica irlandese che quella internazionale, ottime in entrambi i casi.

Lo consiglio vivamente a chi cerca una piacevole e confortevole sistemazione per godersi la citta ad un prezzo contenuto.",5,2014,02,13
229,Top in Preis und Leistung,"Das Hotel ist ein sehr gemütliches Hotel in City nähe. Mit dem Airport Link kommen Sie nur wenige Gehminuten direkt zum Hotel. Für Business Gäste aber auch für Städtereisende ist das Hotel ein guter Ausgangspunkt, da eine gute Verkehrsanbindung besteht als auch die Hop on Hop off Busse in 3 Minuten erreichbar sind. 

Die Zimmer sind in einer schönen Größe und Ausstattung. The Castle spiegelt sich aber nicht nur im Zimmer wieder, auch die öffentlichen Räume vermitteln das Gefühl in einem Schloss zu sein; keine moderne Einrichtung, aber dem Namen entsprechend gemütlich. Nur die Badezimmer-Kacheln bedürfen einer eingewöhnungsphase, es sei denn Sie mögen Orange :-)

Frühstück ist irisch / international und bietet in seiner Auswahl und Qualität einen guten Start in den Tag. Im Kellergeschoss ist zu dem eine Bar mit Live-Musik, die den irischen Flair auf den Gast überträgt. 

Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und sehr hilfsbereit. Ich habe wohl selten ein so zuvorkommendes Personal in einem Hotel vorgefunden.

Anche il ristorante dell'hotel è ottimo se non avete voglia di cercare posti in giro come noi la prima sera,arrivate dopo le 20,stanche ed affamate....tuto molto buono,io preso lo spezzatino alla guinness molto buono.
Qualità del sonno ottimo nonostante le tende oscuranti non siano poi così oscuranti,unica pecca il lavandino con l'impossibilità di miscelare l'acqua calda e fredda avendo 2 rubinetti separati..per fortuna la doccia usando la ""Canna mobile"" risolve il problema.",5,2013,11,20
229,Hotel stile georgiano,"Anche questa volta ho fatto centro. Il mio viaggio a Dublino e' stato favoloso. Fortunatamente ho trovato una settimana quasi calda (era settembre), non ha mai piovuto.

Tantissime cose da visitare  (Trinity College, o'connel street, favolosa, piena di negozi e pub, la vecchia prigione, la zona dei pub. Sinceramente ho visto talmente tante cose che in questo momento mi sfuggono i nomiOgni100 metri un punto informazione per i turisti. Appena fuori Dublino ho visitato due villaggi di pescatori. Erano presenti due castelli belli da togliere il fiato. Ho avuto la possibilità, pagando naturalmente,di visitarli all'interno. Roba da non credere dalla bellezza e la cura della conservazione. Non ho parole per descrivere i colori dell'autunno che erano presenti sulle numerosissime piante presenti fuori dalla città'. I prati curati a tal punto che sembravano di velluto.
Per quanto riguarda l'albergo Castle Hotel, in posizione centralissima, pulito, colazione ottima e personale gentilissimo. Nulla da dire sulla pulizia. Raccomando il tutto al 100%. Senza dimenticare che l'aereo porto è' vicino alla città raggiungibile con i bus pubblici, blu e gialli a due piani. A proposito su tutti i bus e' presente il wi-fi free. Incredibile!!",5,2013,11,13
229,hotel cómodo para familias,"Es un hotel muy cómodo para familias , la habitación para cuatro personas es espaciosa y confortable. Además está muy limpio todo y el baño también es espacioso. La ubicación también es cómoda al final de una avenida comercial , repleta de bares y restarantes. Para nuestra familia fue una muy buena opción relación calidad precio.",4,2013,11,12
229,"Ottima posizione, prezzo economico e personale cordiale","La struttura è accogliente, il personale cordiale e la posizione perfetta per visitare il centro. In due minuti si arriva a piedi a O'Connel street dove ci sono i mezzi per muoversi in tutta la città, a 10 minuti dalla zona dei Temple Bar. Le stanze sono nella media, curate, si dorme bene e la nostra doccia era praticamente nuova. La tariffa con colazione comprende l'Irish Breakfast con pancetta, uova strapazzate, pomodoro ecc. Abbiamo provato anche il ristorante dell'hotel per una cena e devo dire che abbiamo mangiato molto bene spendendo il giusto. Insomma, consiglio questo Hotel a tutti.",5,2013,11,11
229,"COMODO, COMODISSIMO","vecchi hotel con tutta l'atmosfers giusta. Arredi d'epoca ma in ottimo stato. Le camere sono ben messe. A 5 minuti a piedi dal centro città. In una via tranquilla. fermata bus aeroporto a 300 metri. Personale gentile e disponibilie. Colazione a buffet abbondante + Irish breakfast
Se viaggiate in due o più persone il taxi puo essere più conveniente del bus per raggiungere l'albergo.",5,2013,11,11
229,Gute Stadtunterkunft,"Gut gepflegtes Hotel mit freundlichem Personal, das sich gut auf die Touristen einstellt. Stadtzentrum zu Fuß gut zu erreichen, trotzdem einingermaßen ruhig gelegen. Schöne Bar im Keller, in der wir einen traumhaften Abend mit einem super LIve-Musik-Couple hatten! Frühstück gut, Restaurant sehr voll, das Personal hatte es aber gut im Griff. Uns hat es alles in Allem gut gefallen!",4,2013,11,04
229,Un buon hotel,"Bella struttura, camere pulite e confortevoli, colazione continentale ed irlandese (con possibilità di scegliere una ottima variante vegetariana) di buona qualità e decisamente abbondante.
L'hotel è a una quindicina di minuti a piedi dal centro. Buono il rapporto qualità/prezzo.",4,2013,10,04
229,hotel antiguo,"Habitaciones antiguas.En las camas, solo había una sábana y te cubrías con la colcha. Estuvimos toda la noche arrancándonos. Excesiva moqueta, no muy limpia. Comida normal. Baño regular.Lo mejor es su situación, muy céntrico. Estuvimos solo una noche.Las tres estrellas  es un decir.No volveremos.",2,2013,10,02
229,Gut für Städtereisen .,"Im Zentrum von Dublin in der Nähe von Bus und nur wenig Fußmarsch zu allen Attraktionen .
Sehr freundliches Personal im Hotel wie auch im Restaurant . Wir hatten ein sauberes und gutes Zimmer aber leider zum Parkplatz gelegen welcher auch als Raucherplatz benutzt wurde und daher bis ca. Mitternacht jedes Gespräch mittgehört , es war unerträglich laut .Auch sind die Betten etwas kurz für Leute über 180 cm .Aber im großen ganzen waren wir sehr zufrieden und können das Hotel nur weiterempfehlen aber mit einem Zimmer was nicht zum Parkplatz führt.",4,2013,10,02
229,Carino e non lontano dal centro,"Prima tappa del viaggio in Irlanda con la mia compagna, ci siamo fermati da loro per 3 pernottamenti con colazione inclusa.
L'hotel è posizionato in una buona posizione, a 5/7 minuti a piedi dall'imponente The Spire di Dublino e quindi dal centro.
L'hotel in se stesso è carino, in stile irish con la moquette sia nelle zone comuni che nelle camere, io la odio un po in quanto trattiene troppa polvere, ma d'altronde in buona parte delgli hotel è questo lo stile. La pulizia tutto sommato direi che è accettabile, la camera non è grandissima ma sufficente per soddisfare le necessità di due persone, letti comodi.
Bagno achesso piuttosto piccolo ma funzionale, logicamente il bidet qui non esiste, a Dublino e in Irlanda in generale credo che sarà difficile trovarne qualcuno.
Colazione Internazionale, ma logicamente io adottavo per una irish breakfast completa che è risultata buona e abbondante nelle porzioni.
Mi sentirei di consigliare questo hotel, buona qualità prezzo andando come noi agli inizi di Settembre.
Wifi gratuita per i clienti vi basta chiedere la password in reception",4,2013,09,25
229,OK für Städtereise,"Gute Lage nahe der O'Connell-Street, Zentrum zu Fuß oder mit dem Hop On-Hop Off-Bus perfekt erreichbar; das Frühstück war in Ordnung, das Familienzimmer groß, aber etwas laut (alte Fenster, Lage Richtung Straße). Insgesamt für einen Städtetrip in Ordnung. Altes Haus mit Flair, aber ein wenig abgewohnt.",3,2013,09,07
229,Semplicemente perfetto!,"Centralissimo, si raggiunge Temple Bar con una passeggiata di 10 minuti per O' Connel Street, 4 minuti dalla fermata del 747, il bus che collega all'aeroporto. Sono ormai di casa a Dublino e tra i vari hotels che ho provato, di questo sono entusiasta. L'edificio è vittoriano, molto caldo e accogliente, le stanze sono coccole e pulite, e anche il bagno. La pulizia è ben fatta, il personale è molto gentile, disponibile, sempre sorridente...Anche alle 5 di mattina, quando ci hanno risolto un problemino. Da provare anche il ristorante, dove si può scegliere la saletta dove fanno musica dal vivo, o quella espressamente ristorante. Prezzi buoni, cucina irlandese anche. Non prendete la pasta... Ma chi va in Irlanda e prende la pasta... Merita la giusta punizione :) La colazione è prettamente irlandese e vorrei fare una precisazione sulle recensioni che ho letto e che mi avevano fatto dubitare: a differenza di altri hotels locali, vedrete un buffet scarno perché c'è il trucco... Vi fanno al momento le scrambled eggs, bacon o salsicce, e questo a vantaggio del vostro palato!  Riassunto: provatelo, io ci torno e ne ho passati di hotels prima di essere così entusiasta",5,2013,08,29
229,Bellissima vacanza,"Albergo molto carino, vicinissimo a O'Connell Street, Henry Street, tutta la zona di Temple Bar e quindi a tutte le attrazioni più  importanti e assolutamente da vedere: Trinity College, St. Patrick's, Christ Church solo per citarne alcune. La nostra camera  confortevole e abbastanza grande per due persone. Peccato che non ci sia il frigobar!!!
Mi aspettavo qualcosa di più dalla prima colazione!!!
Buono il Ristorante con musica irlandese dal vivo. 
Consiglio assolutamente questo albergo.",4,2013,08,24
229,Ottimo punto di partenza per scoprire Dublino,"Ho soggiornato al castle per due notti. Stanza singola spaziosissima con letto a una piazza e mezza, bagno pulitissimo e attrezzato di ogni comodità. L'hotel si trova in un suggestivo palazzo del 1700 e ne mantiene l'atmosfera suggestiva. Al piano terra ci sono due vetrine con oggetti e gioielli vintage in vendita a prezzi ragionevoli. La colazione é buona e tradizionale. Non aspettatevi buffet faraonici!",4,2013,08,23
229,Camera 105 da evitare!,"Hotel carino, la camera 105 molto ampia ma puzzolente di polvere, rumorosa (piano terra) terzo letto di troppo. Musica del pub dell'albergo praticamente in camera.
Bagno in camera troppo piccolo ma pulito, camera piena di polvere, moquette sporca, sala per la colazione....troppo calda, tavoli nn pulitissimi. Colazione irlandese discreta ma quella continentale inesistente.Tostapane molto vecchio.
Personale molto disponibile e gentile, una nota di merito a Melissa, ragazza molto gentile della reception, è italiana.
Posizione nn centralissima ma molto comodo, vicino a numerosi negozi e alle fermate degli autobus.",3,2013,08,18
229,Gute Lage,"Das Hotel ist sehr verwinkelt und man läuft über lange Flure m. E. nicht für Personen mit Orientierungsschwierigkeiten geeignet. Mein Einzelzimmer war sehr klein, mit Blick in einen Hinterhof. Das Personal an der Rezeption war sehr nett, was leider nicht für das Servicepersonal beim Frühstück gilt. Die Abendessen waren ok.",3,2013,08,02
229,Da ristrutturare,"la posizione  e' molto buona e la camera in cui abbiamo soggiornato era molto grande. Quello che fa dell'hotel una scelta sbagliata e' la puzza che si avverte subito all'entrata, un misto di cucina e moquette. L'odore poco piacevole pervade tutti i locali camere incluse che sono inoltre inondate dalla polvere.
Colazione traditional irish breakfast accettabile.
Vista la posizione centrale, sarebbe necessaria una maggiore insonorizzazione.",2,2013,07,29
229,Soggiorno a Dublino,"Ottima posizione, in 15 min. a piedi si è nel cuore della città. Personale gentile e disponibile. Camera/bagno spaziosi e puliti. Colazione abbondante e personale sempre attento al suo rifornimento. A due passi da: Dublin Writers Museum e Dublin City Gallery. Una buona scelta per un soggiorno a Dublino. Possibilità di lasciare i bagagli per spostarsi per brevi periodi in altre città.",4,2013,07,28
229,einfach Toll !!,"Das Castle Hotel liegt nicht weit entfernt vom Zentrum der Stadt. Busverbindungen direkt vor der Tür. Preis/Leistung ist angemessen. Rezeptionisten, Barkeeper und Zimmermädchen sind zuvorkommend und stehen für alle Fragen zu Verfügung. Das Frühstücksbuffet ist ausreichend. Die Küche ist ausgezeichnet!! Livemusik in der Kellerbar ist großartig!! Immer wieder einen Besuch wert !!",4,2013,07,09
229,Gute Lage,"Das Hotel liegt zentral und nur ein paar Minuten vom Stadtzentrum entfernt. Es war sauber und das Preis/Leistungs Verhältnis stimmt auch. Typisch irisch plüschig eingerichtet und auch schon ein paar Jährchen alt, aber in Ordnung! Das Frühstück gibt's im Keller in einem Raum der auch als Abend Bar dient und ist nicht unbedingt das Beste, aber auch nicht das Schlechteste. Für Stadttouren durchaus zu empfehlen!",4,2013,07,05
229,"Datato, ma funzionale","Gli infissi da rifare e gli arredi sono orripilanti,ma e' senza dubbio pulitissimo. Il personale e' gentile, disponibile e svelto. A 5 min a piedi dal centro, facilissimo arrivare dalla navetta del bus 16 proveniente dall'aeroporto. Non lo consiglierei per un weekend romantico, pero' visto che esteticamente non e' entusiasmante(vecchissimo stile, anche se recentemente ristrutturato), ma per dormire e lavarsi va piu che bene;)",3,2013,07,03
229,Un po' datato...,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel per alcuni giorni ad agosto del 2012. La posizione è molto buona e consente di muoversi agevolmente. In generale l'albergo ci è sembrato un po' ""datato"", con moquette e parati vecchiotti, così come l'arredamento...la stanza era comunque pulita. Nella nostra c'era una grossa finestra sul tetto che ha dato abbastanza fastidio (non c'era modo di filtrare completamente la luce). Colazione nella media, anche se abbiamo dovuto richiedere diverse volte alcune cose al personale (ad es. pochi gusti disponibile di marmellate) : nelle sale allestite c'era anche molta confusione. Valutazione nella media.",3,2013,07,01
229,...in pieno centro....,"A circa cinque minuti da o'connell street, dove si trovano tanti negozi per lo shopping irlandese nonché le linee urbane più importanti per raggiungere vari punti di Dublino. Palazzo storico del centro. Le stanze non sono enormi. Colazione ottima e abbondante:sia essa continentale che irlandese. Wi fi ovunque gratuita, e se avete la macchina, c'è un parcheggio interno. Personale disponibile. Consigliato.",4,2013,06,30
229,"Hotel ""affascinante""","L'affascinante è per l'arredo... apprezzato da chi ama i tempi andati. Comunque l'hotel è buono, camera e bagno spaziosi, funzionali e puliti (anche se un piatto doccia non guasterebbe). La colazione abbondante, non offre scelta di dolci ma è ricca per quanto riguarda il salato. Personale disponibile sia in entrata (siamo arrivate a mezzanotte) sia in uscita (deposito bagaglio, chiamata del taxi, ecc.). Si consiglia anche per la centralità della posizione.",4,2013,06,10
229,"Otima accoglienza, parcheggio ok ma scomodo.",L'accoglienza è stata a dir poco PERFETTA. Check-in veloce e spiegazioni dettagliate. L'unica pecca il parcheggio e la vista dalla camera. Il centro città è a 10 minuti a piedi passando comunque da vie di grande comunicazione con negozi di ogni ordine e grado. Il silenzio per dormire in camera è perfetto. Il pub dell'hotel molto carino. Il wi-fi è perfetto. Credo che per un paio di notti sia l'hotel ideale.,4,2013,04,11
229,Ruhige Zentrumslage,"Das Castle Hotel liegt unweit der O'Connell Street, die die Hauptverkehrsstraße in Dublin ist. Früher eher etwas heruntergekommen, glänzt die O'Connell Street jetzt als großzügig angelegter Boulevard. Das Castle Hotel liegt direkt ""um die Ecke"", dadurch ist man vom Verkehrslärm gut abgeschirmt. Die Zimmer sind sehr ansprechend, die Badezimmer recht geräumig und gut ausgestattet. Wir hatten Zimmer in ruhiger Lage verlangt und diese auch bekommen. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich, auch die Bar und das Restaurant im Untergeschoss sind durchaus empfehlenswert, wenn man vor dem Schlafengehen noch einen Drink nehmen möchte. Ein paar Abstriche würde ich beim Frühstück machen. Hier habe ich in Irland schon sehr viel Besseres erlebt. Aber es gibt immerhin morgens die Tageszeitungen. 
Besonders angenehm fanden wir die Nähe zur Aircoach Station, die Verbindung zum Flughafen ist preiswert und schnell. 
Alles in Allem eine sehr empfehlenswerte Unterkunft in Dublins Zentrum. Das Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis stimmt hier!",5,2013,04,10
229,Buon hotel,"Buon hotel posizionato a due passi da O'Connell Street, quindi in pieno centro. Camera singola confortevole, forse con bagno un po'  piccolino (anche se rispetto le proporzioni, la doccia risultava piuttosto grande). Unica pecca dell'hotel è stata la colazione; infatti a parte l'irish breakfast (foto), non c'era grande scelta per chi è abituato a qualcosa di dolce.
Nel complesso una buona scelta.",4,2013,04,06
229,Perfekt für Stadtentdecker,"Das Hotel liegt super- direkt am nördlichen Ende der O'Connel St.- zentral, aber trotzdem weit genug vom Trubel der Hauptverkehrsstrasse entfernt. Besonders die Zimmer zum Innenhof sind zu empfehlen, weil dort selbst am Morgen kaum Verkehrslärm stört. Wohlgemerkt, man ist in der Innenstadt, daher wird man nie idyllische Ruhe haben, aber das bestehende Level ist mehr als erträglich.
Das Hotel hat ein leicht plüschiges Ambiente, das aber zum Haus an sich gut passt. Es scheint im Laufe der Jahre Erweiterungen des urspünglichen Hotels über die angrenzenden Häuser gegeben zu haben, die Gänge sind teilweise sehr verwinkelt. Wir hatten- wohl wegen unserer sieben Nächte vor Ort- ein großes Zimmer mit 6 Betten, die allesamt bequem waren. Das Badezimmer war recht groß und mit getrennter Wanne und Dusche komfortabel ausgestattet. 
Die Sauberkeit in allen Bereichen des Hotels war sehr gut. Das Frühstück wurde teils als Buffet (Brot, Marmelade, Käse, Müsli, Milch, Saft) und teils als bestellbares Angebot (irisches Frühstück, Rührei) gestaltet, dazu gab es Kaffee und Tee. Das Personal im Frühstücksraum wirkte teilweise überfordert, wenn mehr als zwei Personen gleichzeitig ihre Wünsche äußerten. Hier wäre ein wenig mehr Übersicht und vielleicht das Notieren der Bestellungen hilfreich.
Insgesamt ist das Hotel sehr empfehlenswert- innerhalb kürzester Zeit sind die wichtigen Knotenpunkte für die Stadtbesichtigung erreicht (Einkaufsmöglichkeiten, General Post Office, Abfahrt der Tourbusse, Straßenbahn, Buslinien), man kann ohne weiteres bis zum Trinity College laufen, auch die Jameson Distillery ist einen Spaziergang von ca. 30 min. entfernt. Zudem hält der Zubringerbus zum Flughafen nur zwei Straßenecken weiter.",4,2013,03,19
229,"Centrale, pulito, e con un certo fascino.","L'hotel è in posizione davvero centrale, a due minuti da O'Connell Street.
Il personale alla reception è sempre molto gentile (avevamo bisogno di far arrivare un pacco in hotel e si sono dimostrati veramente disponibili e professionali), e abbiamo particolarmente apprezzato la sala con poltrone, libri e DVD a disposizione degli ospiti, diciamo che aggiungeva un tocco in più.

In camera infatti c'era a disposizione una TV a schermo piatto con lettore CD/DVD integrato, e anche se ovviamente ci trovavamo in vacanza per esplorare Dublino, un po' di musica ci ha fatto da sottofondo mentre ci preparavamo per uscire.
Per quanto riguarda le stanze, devo dire che la nostra (la 222, una doppia al secondo piano) era molto spaziosa, viaggiavamo con valigie piuttosto grandi e c'era spazio per aprirle e muoversi comodamente.
I mobili erano di legno 'vero', non in stile Ikea... Sì, a volte cigolavano un po', ma questo contribuiva a dare un certo fascino alla stanza.
Oltre al letto (e alla TV), c'erano un cassettone, un piccolo armadio a due ante, una scrivania, un tavolino e un divano... Veniva voglia di non uscire!!
Anche il bagno era spazioso, con vasca, l'unico problema era che la porta non chiudeva bene, ma l'abbiamo risolto fermandola con un peso.
Il tutto, devo dire, era pulitissimo, il Castle è uno degli hotel più puliti in cui io abbia soggiornato (nonostante la moquette).  
L'unica pecca era forse il rumore: data l'età dell'edificio le pareti sono molto sottili, per cui potevamo sentire sia chi passava nel corridoio che gli ospiti delle stanze a fianco. Inoltre la nostra stanza dava sulla strada, e dalle finestre potevamo sentire i gabbiani già al mattino presto. Questo comunque non ci ha impedito di dormire tranquillamente.

Buona e ricca anche la colazione (da provare la Full Irish... La sogno ancora!!), i tavoli erano distribuiti in tre sale, quindi c'era sempre posto. Solo una volta abbiamo trovato il tavolo un po' appiccicoso.

Se dovessi tornare a Dublino, alloggerei di nuovo senza dubbio al Castle Hotel!",5,2013,02,03
229,ein klasse wochenende,"ich habe mir jetzt ein paar bewertungen durchgelesen und habe mich gefragt ob ich in einem anderen hotel war..?! 
also so ein tolles verlängertes wochenende hatte ich noch nie! sobald man ins hotel reinkommt fühlt man sich sofort wohl. das personal ist super freundlich und der preis ist top! 
außerdem bekommt man morgens ein echt leckeres irisches frühstück und die lage des hotel ist klasse! 
beim frühstück am sonntag kam der hotelbesitzer und gab jedem gast die hand und redete mit jedem kurz - als meine mutter und ich dann heute losgefahren sind hat und jener hotelbesitzer uns noch einmal das komplette hotel gezeigt und erzählte uns die geschichte über das hotel (nebenbei das älteste hotel dublins).
außerdem ist das hotel perfekt neu renoviert . ich werde aufjedenfall wieder in das hotel kommem ,",5,2013,01,28
229,Pratico e pulito,"Hotel su 4 piani (con ascensore) ricavato in un palazzo georgiano ben tenuto, l'età dell'edificio si avverte ad ogni passo, infatti i pavimenti scricchiolano sotto la moquette. E' situato sulla riva nord del Liffey all'angolo con Parnell Square di fronte al Garden of Remembrance e a due minuti da O'Connel Street. Comodo per il centro (Ha'Penny Bridge,riva sud,Temple Bar, Trinity College) raggiungibile in 10/15 minuti a piedi. Zona sicura e sempre affollata. 
Il personale è molto gentile, sempre pronto a dare indicazioni e suggerimenti, Colazione abbondante sia dolce che salata. Wifi a disposizione gratuitamente e funzionante anche in camera. 
Pratico il collegamento anche con l'aeroporto, la fermata del 16 in O'Connell Street si raggiunge in cinque minuti (2,80 € a testa da consegnare precisi al centesimo all'autista quando si sale). Il viaggio dura circa 35/40 minuti.",4,2013,01,07
229,Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo.,"Dall'aeroporto ci si arriva facilmente col bus n°16 e circa €2,50 di spesa, la fermata è a pochi passi dall'hotel: questo è già un buon motivo per sceglierlo. E' situato in zona molto centrale dall'altro lato del fiume rispetto a Temple Bar (la zona dei pubs) che si raggiunge in meno di un quarto d'ora di passeggiata. L'hotel è antico ma è stato rimodernato di recente, in alcuni piani stanno terminando ancora i lavori ma non recano alcun disturbo agli ospiti. Le stanze sono molto confortevoli e alcune arredate in stile antico molto carine.A noi è capitata una stanza un po' fredda al terzo piano della parte più vecchia ma devo dire che il personale dell'hotel ha fatto di tutto per sistemare il termosifone e alla fine ci ha cambiato camera dove siamo stati benissimo. Alle reception si sono sempre mostrati tutti molto cordiali e desiderosi di aiutare, il proprietario, un signore simpatico, passava la mattina nella sala della colazione ad augurare il buongiorno a tutti e a controllare che tutto andasse bene. La colazione è essenzialmente tipica irlandese più un buffet, non aspettatevi troppi dolci, ma sono disposti a venire incontro alle varie esigenze. Il ristorante è ricavato nelle cantine ed è un ambiente molto gradevole dove al weekend si può ascoltare tipica musica irlandese mentre si gusta un ottima cena magari a base di salmone affumicato...ovviamente irlandese!",4,2013,01,01
229,Ein guter Griff,"Ein sehr ansprechendes Haus mit typischem Flair. Für ein kurzes Vorweihnachtswochenende war das sehr günstig gelegene Hotel ein toller Fang! Eine sehr traditionelle Einrichtung macht das Haus zu einem echten Hingucker. Nicht ganz so berauschend war das Frühstück, nichtsdestotrotz aber ok.",4,2012,12,20
229,Ottimo hotel in zona molto centrale con un ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo,"Sono stato loro ospite per una notte ma devo dire che è un hotel molto accogliente in zona molto centrale, ed è molto pulito. La camera singola è forse un po piccola ma è nello stile British, in compenso un bagno con una doccia che raramente si trova cosi bella in paesi anglosassoni. Poi in ogni camera hai a disposizione il wi-fi in modo gratuito. È come ultima cosa ma non meno importante anche se dovevo partire alla mattina alle 5 mi hanno offerto di poter fare la colazione lo stesso",4,2012,11,22
229,ottimo hotel,"siamo arrivati e sono stata accolta subito in maniera cordiale. l'hotel è molto particolare con una moquette stranissima, come se fossero stati sovrapposti diversi strati di moquette. bah. inoltre è pieno di volantini e offerte per diverse attività. c'è l'ascensore  e le scale scricchiolano in maniera un po inquietante. la stanza è molto confortevole e anche il letto. nell'insieme sembrava molto pulito. la colazione era spettacolare e veramente infinita, sia quella continentale che quella irlandese con anche la variante vegetariana. la sala da pranzo era molto molto bella stile quasi grotta, con archi bassi in mattoncini. abbiamo avuto un problema con la tv ma ce l'hanno risolto in fretta. è a una quindicina di minuti a piedi da qualunque cosa del centro di dublino..ma comunque non ci si può lamentare.",5,2012,11,02
229,Terribile,"Premetto di essere una persona che ha viaggiato sempre senza grosse pretese, ma arrivare alla reception alle 15 e non avere ancora la stanza disponibile, senza grosse scuse farci aspettare in una delle tante sale d'aspetto per poi dimenticarci lì e solo dopo 15 minuti, quando sono andata io a chiedere quanto ancora ci volesse, scoprire che la stanza era disponibile (mi chiedo se avessimo aspettato un'ora se si sarebbero degnati di avvisarci) mi è sembrato troppo dall'inizio. Arrivati in camera (pagata senza nemmeno vederla) la puzza del deodorante per ambienti era terribile e la pulizia non era il massimo, ma la cosa carina è stata andare in bagno e rimanere chiusi dentro perché la maniglia non andava giù fino in fondo e quindi la porta rimaneva bloccata. La mattina ci siamo svegliati alle 7, perché i bambini della stanza sopra erano contentissimi della loro vacanza, nulla da dire ai bambini, ma al solaio fatto di carta velina si. Colazione assolutamente nella media, nulla di che. Grazie a dio siamo rimasti solo una notte.",2,2012,11,01
229,HOTEL CORRECTO PARA VISITAR DUBLIN,"Estuvimos 3 noches en este hotel. Esta situado en la parte norte de Dublin al final de O’Connel Street. Realmente Dublin no es muy grande (al menos la parte turística) y del hotel al centro no serán más de 10-15 minutos andando, (de hecho a 3 minutos del hotel empiezan ya cosas que ver de las que recomiendan en las guías), lo que quiero decir, es que aunque no este en pleno centro, tampoco esta lejos para hacer turismo por la ciudad.

El hotel es bastante grande (mas de lo que parece por fuera) ya que son como 3 edificios unidos. Es de estilo clásico y si es verdad que se ha quedado algo antiguo, quizá necesite una reforma, pero no esta mal, las habitaciones son grandes, esta limpio, el mobiliario esta en buen estado, de hecho las camas son muy confortables, los baños también están bien… si no se busca lujo o modernidad, es perfecto.

La habitación era interior (vistas al parking del hotel, pero no son feas) y no era muy luminosa, a cambio era absolutamente silenciosa por la noche. Las habitaciones exteriores serán más luminosas pero imagino que más ruidosas, aunque por la noche no me pareció que hubiera mucho tráfico por allí. La habitación era grande, la pedimos con 2 camas. Eran de 90, pero muy cómodas. Tenía un silloncito con su mesita, una pequeña tele plana en la pared (con TVE internacional), un escritorio y un armario no muy grande pero suficiente y hay bastante espacio para dejar la maleta. El baño no es muy grande, tiene plato de ducha y la ducha sale bien. Lo único el lavabo tiene separados agua caliente y frío y no es muy práctico. Las toallas son muy pequeñas y si que tiene secador.

El desayuno esta incluido e incluye parte de buffet (con poco surtido: cereales, tostadas y algo de fruta en almíbar) y además si quieres un típico irish breakfast (beans, huevo, salchicha, tomate). No fue lo que más me gusto, me pareció que la calidad era floja aunque en cantidad era aceptable, pero bueno, siempre resulta muy cómodo ya salir desayunado del hotel.

Por lo demás, hay wifi gratuito en todo el hotel, un par de ordenadores de pago por recepción con impresora, tiene parking (10 euros la noche) pero se puede aparcar fácilmente en la calle alrededor (aunque es zona de pago por el día, excepto domingos). El personal era simpático en todo momento, y no me pareció que hablaran español.

Si que lo recomendaría, siempre que se encuentre una oferta de precio no muy elevado.",3,2012,10,25
229,Ottima posizione e ambiente confortevole,"Ho soggiornato 4 notti e mi sono trovata benissimo. Mi sembra strano sentire di stanze anguste e letti rotti. Io ho soggiornato in due stanze diverse, perché essendo fumatrice me la sono fatta cambiare e devo dire che ambedue erano comode, anche se la prima per non fumatori era ancora più spaziosa, con addirittura una sorta di salottino, mentre quella per fumatori era ubicata al quarto piano e un po' meno bella. Ma questo succede in tutti gli alberghi, anche se i fumatori pagano tanto quanto i non fumatori e devo dire che non è una cosa gradevole. La colazione e' abbondante.Comunque nell'insieme l'hotel e' bello, arredato con uno stile antico accogliente. È ubicato molto bene, vicino alla fermata del bus per l'aeroporto e a o' Connel Street. Ci tornerei volentieri.",4,2012,10,25
229,"Gute Lage, Hotel eher mittelmäßig","Die Lage des Hotels ist das Beste - nicht direkt im Zentrum, aber in 10 Minuten zu Fuß wunderbar zu erreichen - einfach die O Connell-Street hinunter. Zudem starten die Dublin Tour Buse praktischerweise in der Nähe, was einen guten Platz garantiert. Ansonsten sind die Zimmer eher mittelmäßig und wirken etwas heruntergekommen. Insbesondere im Bad waren viele Löcher in Ecken und Fugen, der Duschstrahl eher mäßig. Meine Matraze war auch bereits ziemlich durchgelegen.
Zimmer sind ausreichend groß. Nett war die Atmospäre durch einen Kamin im Zimmer. Das Frühstück ist ok, mehr aber auch nicht. In den Kellergewölben sind einige Räume sehr muffig, in denen morgens auch das Frühstück stattfindet.
Das Personal war teils nett, teils unfreundlich.

Preis-Leistung für die Lage und Dublin ok.",3,2012,08,26
229,"Buono, ma la reception....","Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel per 2 notti. Arrivando in auto, abbiamo riscontrato la buona la posizione dell'hotel (10 min. da Temple Bar a piedi!) e la comodità del parcheggio privato (a pagamento...). La camera era davvero molto spaziosa e luminosa, un po' calda di giorno. La struttura è parecchio datata, con corridoi che scricchiolano e moquette ovunque.
I nostri commenti negativi riguardano solo la disponibilità e cortesia delle persone alla reception: poco cordiali, ci hanno liquidato in due parole, non ci hanno informato dei vari servizi se non su nostra richiesta. Avevamo prenotato e pagato in anticipo una cena nel ristorante dell'hotel, ma abbiamo rischiato di perderla per le indicazioni errate sull'orario del ristorante. Consiglio: migliorare la famosa ""ospitalità irlandese"".",3,2012,08,26
229,stanza enorme!,"sono stata in questo hotel con mio marito 6 giorni a Pasqua, aprile 2012. Avevo chiesto una stanza non minuscola, con finestra o balcone (sono claustrofobica!). Sono stata accontentata, tutto era ok, anche la colazione era soddisfacente, pensate che quando alle 4 del mattino del giorno della partenza è venuto il taxi a prelevarci, ci hanno comunque preparato la colazione!
Staff molto gentile, pulizia buona.",4,2012,08,20
229,Più che sufficiente,"Hotel in posizione tranquilla ma vicinissimo a O'Connell Street e Henry Street (via dello shopping) e 10/15 minuti da Temple Bar. La struttura è piuttosto datata (moquette ovunque, nei corridoi odore di stantio e muffa, pavimenti scricchiolanti) ma la hall e la reception(in stile georgiano) sono davvero belle e accoglienti; le camere sono ampie e confortevoli anche se i letti e i cuscini sono troppo morbidi; la colazione è carente per quanto riguarda la parte dolce, invece chi vuole l'english breakfast può richiederla alle gentili cameriere;la pulizia della camera e della struttura in generale è molto buona (peccato la moquette); il personale alla reception è sempre gentile e disponibile per prenotazioni escursioni e informazioni varie.",3,2012,08,18
229,Puzza!,"Ho soggiornato per una sola notte per motivi di lavoro, ed è stata sufficiente. Ho avuto una camera all'ultimo piano, il bagno piccolo e scomodo, il materasso scomodissimo uscivano le molle di fuori. Ma la cosa davvero intollerabile era il cattivo odore di vecchio, di polvere di stantio ... di vernice ...  non so! Per fortuna non tanto in camera, ma nei corridoi e nelle scale. La colazione non male come anche la posizione, non centralissima ... ma comoda.",3,2012,07,23
229,Vacanze Dublino 2012 DD - Castle Hotel,"Il mio primo viaggio in Irlanda e la mia prima tappa del tour è stata Dublino! Il Castle Hotel è una struttura vecchia ma tenuta abbastanza bene...il servizio è nella media, la pulizia molto buona ed il personale è gentile e disponibile. Non si trova esattamente in centro città ma ci si arriva velocemente a piedi o con i mezzi pubblici. Il rapporto qualità prezzo è sodsisfacente...come inizio non è stato per niente male! ;) ",4,2012,06,18
229,in totale positivo!,"L' hotel è molto centrale e vicino all' aeroporto (una ventina di minuti). Il personale è gentile e le camere e il bagno sono pulite. c'è l' ascensore quindi è comodo anche per le famiglie con bimbi  piccoli. Davvero nulla da dire. Abbiamo avuto la fortuna di beccare delle giornate estive, il che è un miracolo a Dublino, e nella nostra camera batteva il sole tutto il giorno, quindi era un po' un forno al nostro rientro e non c'è l' aria condizionata.. ma come dicevo è stato un caso molto sporadico.. e la nostra camera era anche sulla strada, quindi era un po' rumoroso..soprattutto la notte e nel weekend..Ma i materassi sono il top! Il cibo è da evitare in albergo!!!!!!e la colazione non ha poi tutta questa varietà. Comunque un voto decisamente positivo!",4,2012,05,28
229,Perché no?,"Un hotel non nuovissimo, ma comodo al centro di Dublino: O'Connell Street si raggiunge facilmente a piedi o coi mezzi. 
Buona la colazione irlandese, ma, se non fosse gradita, c'è la possibilità di scegliere la colazione continentale.
La cortesia e l'ospitalità del personale sono eccezionali, di certo sono le caratteristiche che lo rendono un posto piacevole in cui alloggiare: se avrete la fortuna di incontrare il proprietario Finn nei corridoi, scambierà di certo due parole con voi!",3,2012,01,24
229,No comment,"io mi sono trovata non dico malissimo , ma nemmeno bene..
.
ho vissuto a dublino x 4 mesi nel 2007 quindi sapevo benissimo dell'esistenza della moquette .. ma  appena sono entrata in hotel... credetemi l'odore di stantio... ohhh mamma o come dicono loro OHHHH MY GOD una cosa terribile... va bhè...  stanza carina.. letto comdo.. va bhè lenzuala lise e copripiumone rotto ma passiamoci sopra.. alla fine dovevamo starci solo due notti.... ma  l'apoteosi è stata il riscaldamento rotto nella zona notte... non potete immaginare il freddo.... e soprattutto  l'assenza di una finestra o cmm presa d'aria in bagno e il calorifero in bagno.... uscire dalla doccia era congelarsi all'istante... per scaldare gli ambienti tenevamno la doccia calda accesa per creare vapore .....peccato che l'assenza di una finestra ripeto.... il vapore giustamente saliva al soffitto .. e ricadeva sottoforma di goccioloni ahahahahahahah va bhè ci siamo fatti due risate...

ottima posizione  in due minuti sei in centro nulla da dire..
ma nn credo che ci ritornero' poco ma sicuro...

enjoy",2,2011,12,04
229,Posizione stupenda,"Hotel pulito, posizione comodissima, vicino al centro ma anche all'aereoporto (23€ in taxi), personale gentilissimo, anche se chi non parla inglese può avere problemi. Camere pulite, bagni spaziosi. Bisogna lasciare la stanza alle 13, ma c'è la possibilità di lasciare gratis le valigie, se serve, fino alla partenza (non come a Londra!!). La colazione è molto buona, fornita sia di Irish breakfast che di qualcosa di dolce per gli italiani più restii ad esperimenti culinari! :)",4,2011,10,04
229,gutes hotel zum guten preis,"das hotel ist gut zu erreichen, wenn man mit dem airport shuttle in der o´connell street ankommt- nach einem kleinen fussmarsch von 10min ist man da. Ich habe mich fürs C.H. entschieden, weil es nicht dirkt im zentrum ist und es daher angeblich nicht so laut sein soll. leider gabs zur strasse raus doch ordentlich krach. zweitens waren die decken sehr dünn und die dielen oben drüber quietschen, wenn jmd drüber läuft - kann unangenehm sein, wenn die leute früh um 6 sachen packen. ansonsten waren die zimmer schön sauber, das bad hatte eine wanne und ein fenster. der eingangsbereich und die rezeption sind toll eingerichtet. Frühstück gibts etwas abgelegen im keller, aber das war immerhin gut. Für den Preis also eigendlich ein gutes hotel um dublin zu erkunden.",4,2011,09,13
229,cutre es poco,"Lo reservamos como un tres estrellas. 
Las habitaciones sin armario ( porque algo asi como un mueble de 1,50  por 1mtro no se puede llamar armario,  menos si encima te meten dentro una manta de matrimonio, en la seguna habitacion solo habia una barra y una zona de baldas, sin puertas. 
En el baño lo minimo, la ducha fija  sin opcion de usar el grifo de la bañera. 
El desayuno  si no pedias  el pesado desayuno irlandes,  escaso,  las tostadas revenidas,  te las traian a la mesa,  la mantequilla similiquida, 
La zona de garaje  era poco menos que una zona de almacenar escombros,   
El personal muy amable eso si, aunque  solo en ingles,  La limpieza aceptable, y bien situado. 
No lo recomiendo no por casualidad.",2,2011,08,25
229,Gratamente sorprendida,"No tenía muchas expectativas, ya que buscaba sobre todo un alojamiento céntrico y próximo a paradas de bus (aeropuerto y otras).Sin embargo me encuentro un hotelito encantador, limpio, y con una habitación con una cama  enorme a pesar de haber reservado una individual. Fue un acierto en todos los sentidos. 
¿Lo peor? Que las gaviotas me despertaban muy temprano, por lo demás no había apenas ruidos.",4,2011,08,05
229,Günstig & gutes Essen aber mehr auch nicht,"Ich stufe das Hotel preislich als günstig ein da es eine gute Behausung in Nähe der O'Connel Street bietet. Wer jedoch in mehr in der Temple Bar Area unterwegs sein möchte sollte sich ein näher gelegentes Hotel suchen da der Fußmarsch gute 15 Minuten ist.

Im eigenen Restaurant kann man sehr gut Essen und für das erste Dinner bekommt einen Bailey's Irish Cream Voucher. Am Wochenende gibt es am Abend irische Live Musik.
Frühstück ist inklusive und neben einem Irish Breakfast gibt es Toast mit Marmelade, Schinken oder Käse sowie Müsli und Joguhrt. Perfekt für einen guten Start in den Tag.

Was mich gestört hat waren die folgenden Dinge:

- zu hellhörige Zimmer (Straßengeräusche und Nachbarn haben in der ersten Nacht extrem gestört)
- Zimmer kann nicht voll verdunkelt werden. Es gibt zwar Gardinen aber der Stoff ist nicht sehr dicht und morgends kann die Sonne schon verdammt hell scheinen..
- Keine Klimaanlage .. kann bei einem sehr heißen Sommer zu Problemen führen.
- Kein Getränkeautomat im Hotel ..  aber es gibt einen Convenience Store einen Block weiter",3,2011,07,05
229,Muy recomendable,"A dos pasos de o'connell st. está esta encantadora casa georgiana, toda la decoración, excepto el comedor de desayunos, es tal cual la veis en la web, muy bonito todo. Todo estaba muy limpio y en el desayuno se podía tomar desayuno irlandés o continental. El personal era amable, pero en Dublín quién no lo es, la gente es encantadora. Tienen un restaurante al lado por si quereis probar la gastronomia local con música en directo. Vamos mi experiencia fue muy buena.",4,2011,02,14
229,Un buon Hotel in perfetto stile Irlandese,"L'hotel è abbastanza vicino al Viale principale di Dublino, con diverse fermate di autobus, in stile, le camere sono discrete, i bagni appena sufficienti, colazione così così
personale gentile ma se non parlate bene l'inglese ci sono parecchi problemi, buona qualità prezzo. Attenzione all'indirizzo ci sono due strade con lo stesso nome cambia solo Row o Street!!!!!!!",3,2010,09,02
229,Hotel a 2 stelle,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel di Dublino per 5 notti la settimana scorsa (agosto 2010). Francamente non so come siano gli altri hotel di Dublino, dato che i commenti che avevo letto su questo hotel erano molto positivi, ma francamente io non ne sono stata entusiasta. Buona la posizione, a nord di O’Connell street e abbastanza lontana dalla confusione di  Temple Bar (che cmq resta raggiungibile a piedi in 10/15 minuti).
Lo staff alla reception era abbastanza freddo e sembrava che gli dessimo fastidio quando gli rivolgevamo delle domande. Le stanze erano piccole, arredate in stile antico come tutto l’hotel, e davano l’aria di essere molto polverose (forse per via della moquette) ; erano inoltre rumorose (in pratica si sentiva tutto quello che dicevano i vicini di stanza, e quando quelli del piano superiore camminavano si sentiva scricchiolare il soffitto sotto ai loro passi – il che di notte era anche un po’ inquietante). 
Per la colazione bisognava armarsi di pazienza: a buffet c’è infatti poco o nulla (frutta, yoghurt, succo di frutta, burro e marmellata), e bisogna aspettare che i camerieri vengano al tavolo, prendano l’ordinazione e te la preparino. Le porzioni sono contate: 3 fette di toast a persona, 2 fette di bacon (che si sentiva che era riscaldato, si faceva fatica a tagliarlo), 2 uova, eventualmente anche i  fagioli (irish breakfast), thé o caffè americano. C’è anche la possibilità di cenare in hotel ma date queste premesse abbiamo ritenuto opportuno andare da un’altra parte.
Il prezzo è la cosa che ho apprezzato di più: 380€ per una doppia x 5 notti, che tutto sommato non è molto.
Nel complesso, per gli standard italiani potrebbe essere classificato come un buon hotel a 2 stelle, ma non di più. Se tornassi a Dublino, probabilmente cercherei un’altra sistemazione nelle vicinanze.",3,2010,08,20
229,ok per posizione e breakfast,"Per il prezzo  pagato e il tipo di servizi ricevuti, devo dire che sono un po' deluso
L' hotel e' molto  valido per la posizione
la struttura e' molto vecchia (niente di male potrebbe anche essere piacevole)
ma raggiungere la stanze è un po' scomodo (tanti saliscendi e varie porte)  
personale di ricevimento diurno direi ok
personale di ricevimento serale......... da sberle a 4 alla volta
la 1 sera scocciatissima, stava mangiando le patatine, per dare le chiavi si e' ciucciata le dita....!!!!!
la 2 sera (sempre lei) poi neanche aperto la bocca ... parlato con gesti della testa, come dire che cosa vuoi???? Inqualificabile!!!!
stanza molto grande....discretamente pulita, vista meno di zero letti comodi, bagno vecchiotto
Ok  invece la prima colazione sia per la quantita' e la varieta' che per la gentilezza del personale addetto",2,2010,06,28
229,Bello!,"Ottima posizione,non troppo rumoroso di notte.Ristorante un po' piccolo e affollato,ma con ottimo cibo.Camere grandi,spaziose e ben tenute.
Unico particolare negativo:corridoi un po' troppo a vicolo cieco.",4,2010,05,01
229,Rund um schönes Hotel,"Wir hatten uns das Hotel vorher im Netz angesehen um über Silvester in Dublin zu sein und waren bei der Ankunft sehr zufrieden. Die Lage ist unschlagbar nah und man ist in ca. 5 Minuten sofort im Zentrum. Trotzdem ist das Hotel weit genug weg von den wirklich lauten Straßen. Die meisten Zimmer sind vor kurzen erst renoviert worden und das Hotel ist sehr angenehm. Die Ausstattung der Zimmer ist Durchschnitt aber sehr schön. Frühstück und Abendessen sind durchaus zu genißen auch wenn man sich an die irishe Küche etwas gewöhnen muss. Es gibt sogar immer ein vegetarisches Menü in der Karte.
Ich würde das Hotel jeder Zeit wieder empfehlen da mir der Aufenthalt sehr gefallen hat. Wer schonmal da ist sollte auch einen Drink an der Bar nehmen. Der Bartender Jim ist ein sehr netter und angenehmer Zeitgenosse.",4,2010,03,12
229,Sauberes Hotel in zentraler Lage,Vom Hotel aus kann man viele der Sehenswürdigkeiten und Geschäftsstrassen bequem zu Fuß erreichen. Da wir um 4.00 Uhr in der Früh zum Flughafen mussten wurde eigens für uns ein Frühstück zubereitet. Das Personal ist höflich und hilfsbereit. Es ist wirklich zum Weiterempfehlen.,5,2009,09,28
229,Buon Hotel,"Un buon hotel in un palazzo georgiano ristrutturato, vicino il writer's museum e il centro james joice.Alla fine di o'connel street ben servito dai bus cittadini e da quelli turistici.
Dispone di un parcheggio interno al costo di 10 euro al giorno.
Le camere sono comode e pulite.
La colazione potrebbe essere migliorata specialmente la parte a buffet è un pò povera.
La irish breakfast si ordina.
L'ingresso dell'hotel è dalla strada ad angolo con la N.Frederick, e precisamente dal Castle hotel che include anche il walton's, visto che in questo periodo ci sono lavori di ristrutturazione in corso.",4,2009,06,09
229,indubbiamente in una buona posizione,"Indubbiamente il Walton's hotel si trova in una buona posizione: a due passi da O'connell street e a 600 max 700m dal centro di Dublino. Il personale non è il massimo della simpatia, le camere sono carine, pulite e hanno ognuna un'arredamento diverso.Consiglio però di prenotare una camera all'ultimo piano in quanto i pavimenti e di conseguenza i soffitti (tutti di legno)sono molto scricchiolanti e se vi capita di avere sopra di voi gente maleducata e nottambula rischiate di non dormire per i troppi scricchiolii !",3,2008,12,29
229,Tütensuppe ahoi,"Da das mein erster Hotelaufenthalt war kann ich nicht großartig vergleichen. Ich war aufjedenfall zufrieden! Das Zimmer war gemütlich und außer dem Bett noch mit Stühlen, Tischen, einem Fernseher und kleinigkeiten wie Föhn und Wasserkocher (praktisch für Tütensuppen in der Nacht) ausgestattet. Das beste war natürlich die Badewanne.
Das einzigste was störend war war der schlechte Empfang beim Fernseher. Das ist aber nicht weiter schlimm da man ja nicht nach Dublin fährt um TV zu schaun....oder??",3,2008,09,29
