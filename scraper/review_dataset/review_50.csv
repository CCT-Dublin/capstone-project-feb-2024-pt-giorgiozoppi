50,A very disappointing stay at the Hotel Mirlo.,"Boutique seems to be code for “ we owners know how a hotel should present itself, we have a style, and if the customers find things are not quite as they expect, well, they are philistines..” 
My wife and I recently stayed at Hotel Mirlo. Location is good, room a very decent size and the bed gigantic, but…..for a supposed 5* hotel there were a number of irritations which should not be occurring in such an establishment. 
The first night, we ate in the hotel and, returning to our room, thought we’d watch something on tv for a short while before going to sleep. Except…of the 100 or so channels, 99 were  broadcast in Spanish. The only exception being BBC World News which appears  to provide its content on a 20 minute loop. No Netflix, Amazon, no streaming services whatsoever. The tv remained unused for the rest of the stay.
Not that there were any chairs suitable for comfortably watching tv anyway. The only seating being a single, straight-backed, desk type chair. Very poor in a room set up for 2 people.
The room lighting system comprised a metal square, set into the wall, one either side of the bed. Press one side of the square, the bedside lamps lit. Press again to switch them off? No, the main light came on. Press the opposite side…and the hall lights came on. After a lot of random pressing of the square, we finally got all lights off, resolving not to put the lights on again unless absolutely essential. All was well until around 2 am when suddenly the room flooded with light. My wife had got up to use the toilet and the lights were motion activated… Keen to avoid this happening again, we took the room card out of its slot with the result, our devices stopped charging…
In the morning we thought we’d have a cup of the tea that the hotel  proudly advertises as part of the room facilities. Except,…we found that the only cups in the room were very small expresso coffee ones. The tea-bags were as big as the cups. And there wasn’t any milk provided anyway. So, we had 2 black coffees instead. Only 2 though since there were only 2 pods provided for the coffee machine. Later that day, I told the person on reception that our room did not have cups suitable for tea. He said that it was not the hotel’s policy to provide such items and that people were quite happy to use the expresso cups for tea. Disbelief from me. He then offered, if I insisted, to send up 2 mugs. I asked him if he would also arrange for some milk to be provided. This, apparently, was a step too far. He advised me that ( again) it was the hotel’s policy not to provide milk to guests. He then suggested that, if I were to go to the kitchen each morning, someone there would probably be able to provide me with milk. He seemed rather bemused when I suggested that it really shouldn’t be the responsibility of the guest to have to wander down to the kitchen in the hope that someone there would let me have some milk. Why this inconvenience was the hotel’s policy, I wasn’t able to establish. 
Other niggles were the fact that while the hotel offered room service, the room itself did not contain any information as to what might be available. Would the hotel much prefer guests not to use that service? Also, it seemed that room cleaning was only carried out in the afternoon/ early evening. A couple of times we returned to the room to rest after a morning out in Barcelona, only for the cleaner to walk in while we were there. This was made possible because the hotel did not provide a “ do not disturb “ notice for the door. Another inexplicable omission. 
All in all, we felt that the hotel attitude to guests  was along the lines of “ you’ve got complaints? Look, we operate this hotel in a way to suit us, you should just be grateful we let you stay here…”",3,2024,06,10
50,A small boutique hotel in Barcelona that is both quiet and elegant,"One of the loveliest hotels I have ever stayed at. Small, elegantly pointed with a caring and wonderful staff who serve delicious food all day and evening long in a beautiful and quiet part of Barcelona. We stayed here for my son and now daughter in law’s wedding at Torre Bellesgard. I cannot say enough about this exceptional property.",5,2023,10,08
50,A truly Wonderful Hotel,"We returned to Hotel Mirlo as we loved it last year and yet again we had a wonderful experience.  Our room was quiet, very clean and comfortable.  ALL the staff were so friendly and helpful.  Alberto and Alex at Reception, Marc and Rebecca at breakfast and Jon and Salvatorre at dinner. As well as all the people whose names we didn’t know.
   We will return again next year and couldn’t recommend it more.",5,2024,05,01
50,Simply amazing! Best hotel we've been!,"Most likely the best hotel we've been. The staff was simply amazing, everyone was super friendly and welcoming but not forced, we could notice the nicest vibes of the employees (Alberto, Salvatore and Rebeca were the ones we dealt the most but as we wrote before everyone was amazing!).
We had dinner in our second night and then we were sad not to had all our dinner meals at the hotel because it was simply divine. For sure the Chef is someone that puts his heart into the food he's cooking. Also a praise to the breakfast which we thought someone should've watched us in our daily life in the second they came with a bowl of fruit and yogurt because it's our daily breakfast at home... Then the poached eggs were simply perfect. 

We'll return for sure. And lastly a message for the administration, please keep it as it is, the people, the place, everything is amazing!

Kind regards from Fernando and Cláudia!",5,2024,03,20
50,Privacy is Questioned in this 5 star hotel,"A nice 14 rooms hotel, located in the higher part of Barcelona, on the way to the Tibidabo.
The Boutique hotel describes as a luxury hotel, unfortunately  pricing is accurate to the Stars they market for. Breakfast and restaurant facilities are good and in the range described. Rooms are spacious, with Jacuzzi, shower, Hammam and some fitted with a Sauna. Humidity in bathroom area is a matter to manage. The hotel describes himself as discreet, but the immediate proximity to the Chinese consulate, and all their security high definition cameras with face recognition, do not give any privacy at all, in terrace, pool, reataurant and some rooms.
The hotel may described as 5 star de luxe but, certain amenities as laundry bag, tissues, are missing. ",4,2024,03,19
50,Beautiful spa hotel,"A beautiful hotel with amazing “in room”spa facilities. Great staff and beautiful food. Lovely gardens and outdoor pool. A perfect location to explore Barcelona, close to the metro. One of the best hotels I’ve stayed in. Can’t rate it highly enough. A stand out winter break.",5,2024,01,06
50,Calm oasis in the city but expensive ,"Lovely oasis in the city.  Huge rooms with hammams.  Ours har a terrace.  Comfortable beds and luxury furnishings.  Beautiful gardens with outside restaurant and drinks area with pool.  Friendly welcoming staff and good food.  Downsides were bad soundproofing so we were woken by neighbouring guests.  We had half a loo roll in the room.  We had to pay 25 euros to park the car and over 20 euros per head for fruit, croissant and coffee for breakfast on top of an expensive room which was a bit much.  ",4,2023,09,13
50,Lovely place and private sauna in shower.,We stayed in a very nice room with a private sauna in shower which we throughly enjoyed after a long day of walking around Barcelona seeing the sights. A but far from the sights but walkable to a metro or easy to grab a taxi. The reception staff are very professional and polite as well. Did not enjoy the common areas but they looked very nice. ,5,2023,09,08
50,A jewel in Barcelona,"The rooms were fabulous, with the hammam and jacuzzi tub.  The gardens were lovely and the staff superb with every attention to detail. Room service very prompt and the food delicious. 

We will definitely be back again to stay at this lovely jewel.",5,2023,09,02
50,Heaven on earth!,"Absolutely amazing! You pay what you get for and more, posh and luxurious as expected for a 5 star hotel! We had a superb room with a sauna, steam room and a hot tub - all private and all in our own room! Great chill out pool outdoor too and fab top notch restaurant which has amazing food and is very popular among locals!
Service was brilliant, really can't find a fault with this place. The parking could have been free (rather than 25 euros) but one of those things you have to accept if you drive on holiday.... 100% recommended and can't wait to go back to my boutique room in this lovely location close to the Tibidabo mountain. ",5,2023,07,24
50,What a gem!,"So what a gem is this hotel. The service is best I've ever experienced. The hotel desk clerk insisted he go out in pouring rain to hail us a taxi. Everyone is so friendly and going out of their way to be helpful. The room with the whirlpool tub for two, steam shower and sauna right in the room is special. Four of the 16 rooms have beautiful private terraces. Finally, the restaurant… we spent 16 nights in Spain eating at top restaurants but then we accidentally decided to eat here for dinner. It was the best dinner we had the entire trip. So had lunch and breakfast there too and again-just the best. How is this place not packed?  I’m surprised it is not a Relais and Chateau property because it is as good, if not better, than the many we have stayed at including Hotel Neri in Barcelona. You will enjoy your stay here. It’s special. ",5,2023,05,03
50,A wonderful small hotel to stay in a quiet situation but also convenient for visiting everything in Barcelona.,"We have just had a wonderful stay here.  It’s very comfortable and charming staff who were so helpful.  Particularly Alejandro at reception, the morning person whose name I didn’t get, Julio and John in the Bar. The tapas were also excellent. We will return.",5,2023,04,25
50,Magical place to stay in Barcelona,"Exquisite Hotel, in a beautiful and historical neighborhood with great views. My friend and I stopped by Hotel Mirlo on our recent trip to Barcelona. This hotel, formerly a beautiful and historical home, is also the setting for a very special book that takes place in Barcelona, Shadow of the Wind. I happened to be reading this book and was curious to see the home. When we arrived at the hotel, my friend and I asked if we could eat breakfast at the hotel restaurant. The staff was so friendly and we enjoyed a lovely breakfast in the most beautiful setting. When were done, the owner heard we came to visit because of the book and so graciously gave us a tour of the hotel, highlighting various parts from the book. It was magical and so is the hotel. The renovation is beautiful and the rooms are luxurious and well appointed. It is family owned and operated and exquisitely done. This experience was one of the highlights of our trip. Next time we come to Barcelona, we will stay at Hotel Mirlo for sure. Bonus, it is walking distance to the funicular to Templo del Sagrado Corazon. Don't hesitate, book this hotel! You won't be disappointed.",5,2023,04,24
50,Splendid high end luxury hotel,"What an amazing hotel this gem is. My daughter and I stayed here for one night before meeting friends and it did not disappoint. The building is gorgeous, the reception staff were professional and pleasant. 

The room was beautifully appointed with a lovely king size bed. The shower/steam room was such a great touch. What a great point of difference. I loved that the included breakfast could be served in our room or the dining area with with no extra charge. I ordered a cheese platter in the evening and it was delicious. 

A beautiful high end hotel, with some really great personal touches. Highly recommend to stay here.",5,2022,12,30
50,Very nice stay in this upscale beautiful hotel ,The hotel is located in a residential area in a villa. The property is beautiful. Arrived around noon and the room was ready. The room was very nice and large. It was spotless. It also had a wet sauna and a jacuzzi bath so a real spa hotel. I didn't have breakfast there as I had an early meeting but the restaurant seems very posh. I had a late flight out of BCN so I asked for a late checkout. I had to pay a little more but was given acess to another room that was empty for the night (and was even larger and nicer than the original room I had) which was very nice of the management. The only reservation I have is that it takes a while for taxis to arrive there so I would recommend to use an app like free now or  ask the reception to book one for you. ,5,2022,12,17
50,Spectacular hotel - a home away from home,"I'd the pleasure of spending a few days here in September. What a magnificent hotel - it's more akin to a fine country house than a hotel, as with just 16 bedrooms, it feels very personal and intimate.
The rooms are nothing short of spectacular. High ceilings, huge bay window with views of the city and the mountains, large freestanding bathtub, a private sauna, and hamman shower, double sinks and king size bed - I've never been in the hotel room like it.
The staff were all very friendly and helpful, and made us feel very much at home. The hotel is in a lovely part of the city, its quite obvious a well-heeled area, as its located next to the Chinese consulate and there are lots of international schools nearby. It provided a welcome haven away from the noise and crowds of the city centre, yet was only 15 minutes drive away. There are lots of great restaurants, cafes and even a pretty little park in the neighbourhood.
The only downside was that the food wasn't amazing and befitting of the 5* standard of the hotel, which was a shame, but there are lots of excellent restaurants very nearby. While it's wasn't necessarily cheap, I think it actually provided pretty decent value for money, when considering the quality of the service and facilities. I would most definitely stay there again when returning to the city, and would highly recommend if you're looking for somewhere special to stay.",5,2022,09,27
50,A ,"We were looking for a pre cruise hotel for 2 nights. There are a huge number of hotels in Barcelona but this time we wanted to stay in a smaller boutique hotel. The Boutique hotel Mirlo was absolutely perfect. 
A wonderful historic building in a beautiful garden with a pool, easy chairs sunny and shady areas. 
There was a shaded area to eat outside in the garden in addition to a lovely conservatory dining room, bar and lounge.
The staff at the hotel are the real gem! From 1st arrival to departure we had wonderful service in all areas being addressed by name. Very friendly but not pretentious in any way. We ate dinner and breakfast and there was a good choice and the quality was excellent. Thoroughly enjoyed both meals. We loved the idea of the continental basket delivered to table followed by your hot choice. 
Our room was spotless. We had a junior suite, ground floor with garden patio. We used all the fantastic spa facilities hammam sauna and bathtub in our room...just great! Quiet at night so slept extremely well. Despite being a little out side the central area bus or taxi are easily available. Taxi to centre around 15 euros. Easy walk to Parc Guell.
Communication with the hotel pre stay was excellent professional quick and very helpful.

50,well deserved 5/5,"overall a great experience. the staff is really nice, big thanks to julio (i hope i spelled that right) for being who he is! the rooms are very clean, the food and deinks are great. it's not really in the center but you can easily get there by metro within 15 minutes. i'm definitely coming back!",5,2022,05,27
50,An oasis in a frenetic city,"The Mirlo is a beautiful rather stately Spanish villa in a quieter part of the city but conveniently located. It is just fifteen minutes from the airport, so a long weekend is very easy. The hotel offers such warm and genuine service, which felt to us almost like we were treasured guests at a private house, such was the level of care and thoughtful touches.

The garden is splendid full of blooming arrays of spring flowers, white roses  and lemon trees and birdsong, complete with a pool, relaxation area and pool bar. It looked especially lovely at night with the lighting.

The rooms are fabulous, spotlessly clean - crisp perfect bed linens, l’occitane toiletries and varying different private jacuzzis, steam and saunas - which in covid times was very nice to have. We enjoyed looking at the paintings, the library and the views which are lovely from some of the rooms. 

The restaurant was outstanding and a surprise - delicious intensely flavourful, modern, fresh and creative.Beautiful evenings -  laid back and so enjoyable. Juan was such an excellent host taking care of everyone - making it all look effortless, nothing was too much trouble. What a real asset he is.

Breakfast was very fresh and quickly delivered to the room or enjoyed outside/inside in the restaurant.

Relaxing by the pool made it very hard to leave and actually  see the sights! 

This boutique hotel was so quiet at night, in a leafy and safe area overlooking many beautiful churches and monuments is the perfect antidote - the perfect blend of fun in the city and calm downtime. 

We are very much looking forward to our return - what a find!",5,2022,05,17
50,Restorative weeklong Barcelona retreat done right!,"I stayed at Hotel Mirlo in January for a week long writing retreat and it was absolutely perfect. The staff were very attentive and friendly and just plain kind. I think their names were Julio and John but I might be wrong. One was from Colombia and one from Galicia and they made me feel right at home. I was able to work and write from the cafe all morning that got wonderful sunlight, and the food was really delicious. I liked that the hotel is away from the business. I lived in Barcelona several years ago and I’ve anted to experience it’s beauty without the crowdedness. You are surrounded by locals instead of tourists which feels nice. The ambiance is just relaxing quaint and very restorative. You’re still very close to the train to go downtown and explore all the fun. Also it’s close to casa Vicens and parc guell so that’s a plus. I can’t wait to go back! Thank you Hotel Mirlo for the perfect trip.",5,2022,03,30
50,Almost Perfecto!,"We stayed in the Mirlo Boutique Hotel in February,
It is a very charming and beautifully renovated hotel, in a quiet neighborhood.
We Booked the Mirlo Suite, for 3 people, and for 2 nights. 
The room is modern and spacious with good materials, the facilities are what you expect from a recently opened ""Spa Room"", the Jacuzzi, Sauna & Steam-room was very clean, and easy to use. very confortable king size bed and enjoyable complimentary L'occitane toiletries Products. You've got all you need in the room. 
The entire Staff was very kind and friendly, from the beginning to the end of our stay. 
The food from room service arrived quickly and was good, we also really enjoyed the breakfast in the quiet indoor veranda in the morning. 

We won't put 5 stars to this review, regarding the issues/surprises, we had at the check-in to our room, we found clothes from anterior guests in the dressing room and drawers, and hair-ball in the bathroom bucket, and more long hair in the bathrobe!... Mistake can happen, but not really what you expect from a 5 stars hotel, (when you pay 800,00€ per night). but have to mention the extra kindness and extra care with details we had from the staff throughout our stay, after we mention our dissatisfaction regarding theses points. 

Overall, we were very pleased with our stay, and definitely will come back at the Mirlo on our next trip to Barcelona. ",4,2022,03,10
50,Newcomer knocks the others out of the water!,"This newcomer hotel was a wonderful experience. Beautiful facilities, great location, welcoming staff. We stayed in a Mirlo suite and thoroughly enjoyed it: it was spotlessly clean (which isn’t often the case with spa and wet areas specifically), tastefully decorated and very spacious.
The staff did their absolutely best to make sure our stay was pleasant, including promptly resolving minor hiccups with professionalism when they presented themselves.
I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental and Soho House on the same trip and wished I had booked Mirlo for the entire duration of my time in bcna. It will now be our base whenever we visit.
If you like to spa, don’t miss this one!",5,2022,02,02
50,A must do in Barcelona,"I wanted to share our experience in this cute boutique hotel. We are used to travel a lot and discovered here a unique experience. A whole spa including steam room, sauna and hot tub in the room. 
Breakfast was very good with quality food and the garden quite cute.
The amenities were incredible and the service made us enjoy it more. Special thanks to Rebeca and Hubert who were kind and professional.
We will definitely come back.
Muchas gracias.

50,Classy stay in Barcelona,"We have stayed  at this gorgeous renovated mansion twice since it’s opening a month ago for a total of 6 days.
You can expect new everything, friendly and personal service, a superb breakfast with delicious coffee, warm rolls, croissants, fresh fruit, cereal, eggs, frisel (a tiny crunchy baguette filled with jamón ibérico) avocado salmon toast and everything is included on the breakfast price.
The rooms are decorated very warm and modern and the manicured gardens, are lovely to relax or take a dive at the pool. We felt like we were staying in a home. The service staff is very friendly, especially Bianca and Rebecca who served our breakfast and a few family lunches for 8.
The area is safe to walk around and you have a very good  Asador restaurant across the street too.  If you like unique and small boutique hotels with style, this is the hotel for you. They have a nice library where you can borrow a book and most rooms have bathtubs, sauna or a steam shower. The details are everywhere. Soft fluffy towels, crisp linens, L’Occitane products.
We will come back again for sure.

The rooms are loveli, the bed is very good with soft sheets and the suite with hottub, hamman shower and sauna is perfect. My stay here was perfect and relaxig and I will defenitly go here again, next time in Barcelona. 

The restaurant is good and the food is really great as well, for lunch and/or dinner.

The area is beautifull and if you want to go into city center, just take a taxi and you are there in no time. Or go for a walk around te corner in the hills and go for a view over Barcelona.

My new favorite hotel :) 
Thanks to the team for the great service and friendly moments and talks. ",5,2021,09,12
