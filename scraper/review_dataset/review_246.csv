246,Style and substance in the middle of Dublin,"Stylish, clean lines, brand new. Excellent rooms and overall ‚Äòvibes‚Äô. One to go back to, especially if they stop charging 4‚Ç¨ for a can of coke from the machine. Also, put a simple coffee machine in the room, and I‚Äôll be yours forever. It‚Äôs the small things‚Ä¶",5,2024,10,14
246,Great new Dublin hotel,"A lovely chic new hotel right in a super- exciting part of Dublin. 

Arina at the front desk was particularly helpful and welcoming.

The rooms were basic, but stylish. The hotel is a great base to use to get to know Dublin better. Everything is walking distance.",5,2024,10,13
246,LOVED OUR STAY AT THE RUBY MOLLY,We absolutely loved staying at this hotel. It‚Äôs a brand new hotel with modern styled rooms. The rainshower was wonderful. Beds super comfy. Quiet location  and continental breakfast was excellent. We were given the option of drink vouchers instead of daily room cleaning which was nice too. We would definitely book here again.,5,2024,10,09
246,SCAMMERS. AVOID!!!!,"SCAMMERS. This lot cancelled my booking 2 months after I made it. Conveniently oasis are playing the night I was cancelled. Should be ashamed. No response from the hotel. Only an email from booking, hotel doesn‚Äôt care they just want to charge more than the rate I had got it for.",1,2024,10,09
246,Weekend in Dublin,Just had a weekend at this hotel with some friends.  Thoroughly recommend it. Decor amazing throughout. Bedroo.s excellent. Breakfast plentiful. And a bar downstairs to top ot off. Staff friendly and very helpful. Most enjoyable weekend.,5,2024,10,06
246,Cancelled my room and uped the price!,"Booked this place for next August, for the oasis concert. Had it booked even before the band announced the concert for ¬£140. They cancelled my booking and put the room back up for 5/6 times the price I paid. Thanks for that üò° absolutely disgusting!",1,2024,10,06
246,Rip off,Booked hotel. Was cancelled a few weeks later as i was staying the same date as oasis concert. Can't get a hotel near the same price as I was paying for here. Obviously they have now put the price up due to the concert. Joke of a service. Ripping people off.,1,2024,10,05
246,Cancel your bookings without warning do not book at this hotel,"Cancelled our booking without warning and we cannot rebook, do not book with this hotel, they have no respect for guests and do not respond to messages
Used booking.com who have been useless in finding out what‚Äôs going on 
Warning to others avoid",1,2024,10,05
246,Price gouging,"Price gouging through booking.com
Booked for night of Oasis next year for circa 200 euro. Was subsequently cancelled by them weeks later due to technical difficulty. Other oasis nights now uk for 900 euro for a night.
Absolutely terrible carry on and a shocking way to run a business.",1,2024,10,05
246,Nice hotel,"Hotel is pretty and stylish. Rooms were very clean and quiet. Bed and linens were comfortable. Beside the lobby being very well decorated and fun, the galley and rooms were not extravagant but had what you needed for a comfortable. No regular coffee available that I saw, only instant. Staff was pleasant at registration.",4,2024,10,04
246,Chic & Cozy,"Super chic looking hotel. Very cozy atmosphere. Self service check in/out. Was pretty disappointed by the selection of food. When we inquired about one of the food items on the small menu we were informed the item was no longer served as if it was discontinued. Drinks were tasty. Rooms were fairly standard. Overall location was spot on. Walking distance to Grafton, many delicious pubs, Jameson Distillery and so much more.",4,2024,09,27
246,Bare frills,"Hotel looks beautiful but NOTHING is luxurious- bare min!!! No phone in room, no reception, no tea kettle nor one in the ‚Äú galley‚Äù, no one to help, hot water Luke warm and no one to call, street very dark and scary at night so must take a taxi, 15 min cab ride to Grafton street. There is a guitar amp in the room but no water to drink. Bed has half a comforter and then another half? Lobby is beautiful and bar but practicality-0",3,2024,09,25
246,WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE IN 50 YEARS OF TRAVEL - DO NOT STAY AT RUBY HOTELS,"DO NOT STAY at this hotel - there is no service or help during your stay or after.  There are NO STAFF.   Will not answer the phone & hang up on you if they do, rather than help.  No one in charge of the property.  Asked Michael, Emily and Kitty by telephone for help with precious lost items - they hung up on us and did not answer any emails.  Left items were patently kept by housekeeper because they were definitely left in the room.  Worst hotel experience in 50 years of travel - especially staff who (eventually) answer the phone.  I will never stay at any RUBY property, and I‚Äôll cancel the one we have booked in London.  We are still awaiting a reply from Michael who has hung up on us twice and refused to provide the name of the hotel manager on site - if there is one.  You are on your own if you stay at these hotels and need assistance.  They make no mistake nor delay when taking your money on the other hand.",1,2024,09,24
246,Lovely 2 night stay - great location!,"Stayed here for 2 nights whilst I was in Dublin to go to a concert. The location of the hotel is perfect, only a couple of minutes walk to the main area where Temple Bar is. 
The room was really modern and spacious and perfect for what we needed. 
The staff were friendly and helpeful upon check in. I would stay here again.",4,2024,09,18
246,"Happy, comfy and safe","I enjoyed my stay at Ruby Molly fully! I love how much the Irish like to joke and heckle, on the way to Ruby Molly from the airport my cab driver said they just went out of business :)

The staff is super friendly and easygoing, helpful all the way. The hotel itself was really pretty, stylish, clean and very comfortable. Also in great location as it's close but not in Temple Bar, much quieter and pretty easy to get everywhere around the city. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star is the lack of quick grab food options, there wasn't a vending machine or snack in my room and the buffet breakfast felt kind of limited (sausage, yogurts and bread).",4,2024,09,17
246,Very poor experience,"Nice decor and smart rooms, but that is all that was good.
Dreadful check-in process, (we were there 3 days and every time we passed reception there was a queue of customers looking fed up.)
Long waits for drinks at the bar - one was 30 minutes.
Breakfast is a shambles. No one clearing tables and no one refilling the buffet.
Half the chairs in the bar and lounge area have spot lights directed at your eyes.
Hotel is next to a fruit and veg market, so at 6am you are woken by the beeping of forklift trucks (we were on the 7th floor and still noisy)
The 'galley' on each floor that is supposed to have coffee etc was a depressing place.
They call it 'Lean Luxury' - they left out the luxury.",2,2024,09,17
246,Disappointing and not worth the cost,"We arrived with high expectations and were left disappointed. Good points - location and decor. Sadly we found the reception staff indifferent and not friendly, and the bar staff completely disorganised and clueless. 
Two single duvets on a double bed - what‚Äôs that about?
Guinness at the bar was from a can and nothing on tap. Come on guys, this is Dublin! No meal offerings only snacks. 
Breakfast- only hot offerings were hard boiled eggs, sausages and hash browns, the latter of which ran out at 8.30am and still not replaced 40 minutes later. 
Location is fantastic but there are cheaper hotels which offer much more.",3,2024,09,16
246,Nothing special!!!,"This was my first visit to Dublin.  I fully expected to be greeted with Irish hospitality.  All I can say is that wasn't my experience.  For starters, the check in process was super cumbersome.  I had to fill out all my information on a pad, and because Travelocity had listed 2 people for the stay, I had to repeat it again to fill in the slots for a second person.  Moreover, the staff was not what you call rude, but rather just going through the motions to get the job done.  No welcoming feeling whatsoever!! This carried over to the bartender post check in.  A young guy with literally no personality!  The room was okay. Not what I would call inviting--and somewhat industrial.  The hotel itself is nice and the location is excellent.  For future visits to Dublin, I would more than likely look elsewhere to stay.",3,2024,09,13
246,Amazing stay !!!,"Our stay was fantastic !!!Perfect location with a short walk into the heart of Temple bar,  excellent hotel  with a beautiful furniture &  lovely atmosphere  The room was  very modern, spacious and comfortable. The staff were super polite and nice all the time. Highly  recommend!!!!",5,2024,09,12
246,One to avoid fir sure,"As I sit here waiting 20 mins still no breakfast ready as they need to cook it.  It's buffet self serve but no hot food.  This after 25min wait yesterday for coffee as they were busy checking someone in.  Thankfully the 7qm fire alarm going off got me up early I can go to the hotel around the corner and pay for their breakfast.

One to avoid for me and my team when in Dublin",1,2024,09,12
246,Why have a receptionist if the person is redundant,Whilst the concept is unique ‚Ä¶ a reasonably well priced hotel with funk value‚Ä¶. To many cost savings are evident‚Ä¶ vending machines are fine but to buy  luxuries not basics. How do you try and iron your clothes in a lobby.. ironing is done immediately before you dress‚Ä¶ this passes an obvious problem‚Ä¶ and then only instant coffee ?,3,2024,09,10
246,The Breakfast needs to be improved.,"They had no scrambled eggs, bacon, cocktail sausages, or pancakes in the breakfast. The saugages (not cocktail sausages) that they actually had was cold. So was the roasted potatoes. And last: The coffee could be better. Thats very important to me. Fix that and perhaps I will be back.",2,2024,09,08
246,Not for a good night sleep,"Check-In bit of a pain with self service create your keys which doesn‚Äôt work. Girl helpful and got past this. Unfortunately one key didn‚Äôt work when arrived at room.

The main issue was the noise, lorry unloading at 5.30am for nearly an hour. With enough banging to give the feeling that an elevator was travelling through the room!
Emailed photos and complaint at the time. Unfortunately no reply.

No beer on draft either is something to point out.

Rooms basic but clean and modern. Just don‚Äôt expect a good nights sleep from some of the rooms!",2,2024,09,03
246,A pleasant surprise,"This hotel was a pleasant surpise! A group of us were spending the night in Dublin and were looking for somewhere fairly central, but not extortionately priced like most places in the city.

We saw this was a new hotel that didn‚Äôt have many reviews at the time of booking, but we liked the vibe and the idea of amps in rooms so decided to take a chance. Self-check in was fairly quick as we had provided our details in advance, and our key card was printed automatically. We booked a Lovely Room which is one up from the smallest, and found it clean and well appointed given the size. Really nice toiletries - especially the choice of 2 shower gels in the cubicle depending on your mood. Sink outside the bathroom area with a well lit mirror. Bed was cosy and no noise from corridors, but we were in a vestibule area. There is also a Marshall speaker to play your own music via Bluetooth. 

We didn‚Äôt have breakfast but used the Galley kitchen for a nice selection of teas (took a while to master the hot tap!). There is one on every floor with vending machine and ironing board.

Best of all was the bar open late, we were there until 3am with no signs of closing when we left. We enjoyed having a singalong with one of their guitars!",4,2024,08,29
246,Would stay here again,"Good atmosphere, clean room, near a lot of Dublin sites, comfortable bed, and helpful staff.  There was not any parking but there is a garage close by.  There are a few good places to eat breakfast or to grab a drink.  The hotel also serves breakfast.",5,2024,08,22
246,"Modern, convenient spot for tourists and business travelers ","Decent space above a convenient bar / restaurant. No complaints about the room itself. It's relatively new, so taxis will need to know the intersection to find it. Recommend taking selfies by the big strawberry in the bar. Located near a number of tourist locations, which is why we picked it. ",4,2024,08,22
246,Beatiful to visit Dublin & plenty to do. Loads of Heritage & and History but a very expensive city to visit. ,"The hotel is a beautiful modern hotel, well decorated in a retro, with a modern twist to suit the heritage of the area. 
Breakfast is included, but it's very European continental.
So don't expect an Irish full breakfast as it is nothing of the sort.
- Boiled hard eggs & and sausages are the nearest to Irish breakfast, that's it. 
- yoghurt, fruits, a couple of cheeses & and a couple of meats. Breads & pastries.
- various juices & tea/coffee

Rooms a please & modern but the toilet & shower are one cubicle & the sink is in the bedroom. A curtain pulls around a glass cubicle. Otherwise, you are laying in bed watching someone shower. It's a little weird as there's no privacy due to the toilet door connecting to the shower being opaque & lights the shower cubicle up in the night. 

There is no kettle in the room. Each floor has a scullery with the weirdest hot water system to make tea/coffee paper cups provided. There's & ironing board in there, too.
- floors 2.4 & 6 have a vending machine with alleged snacks. Use the word snacks loosely. There are cans of fizy pop & water. Brueno chocolate bars, unbrella, felt shoes, shaving kit. No snacks.

Plus side the room has aircon & you get bribed to scrap your room cleaned & towel change for a cocktail voucher when you first check in. 
Nice touch, but really, when you have prepaid a premium to have your bed made & room cleaned. It's supposed to be a hotel, not a hostel.

- Location is spot on & easy walking distance to everything. 
The Guinness tour is good, but book early as the premium tours sell out fast.
Same with Kilmainham Gaol, book early as tickets sell fast. 
There are plenty of locations to eat & drink. 
Just be aware as we were advised by the taxi driver from the airport. There are plenty of beggers & dont tip as you will be hounded by the rest. Also, he advised us to beware there are plenty of pickpockets about.
-Templebar & region is expensive for eating & drinking.
The Irish people are really helpful & polite people.

246,Good value,"We stayed at the Ruby Molly on two separate stints: first a longer one for work, and later a final night after holidays just before returning home. We were obliged to find affordable accommodation, and we just stumbled upon Ruby Molly on the net. Our local friend was slightly horrified because apparently we were on the wrong side of the river. This all turned out to be nonsense. The neighbourhood is completely safe, and the hotel is very well located. It is modern and clean. The rooms may not be very big, and the glass shower cubicle may not be to everyone‚Äôs taste. But they do the trick. Our price did not include a breakfast, so a kettle etc. in the room itself would have been nice. There was hot water available in the corridor, but you don‚Äôt really want to go later in the evening. But all in all, good value even if it‚Äôs not superb.",4,2024,08,19
246,Fabulous!!,"What can I say? Wow. What a fab hotel, location is about a 5 minute walk into Temple Bar. The reception and bar area are ultra modern and trendy, the staff at check in and behind the bar were friendly and helpful. Check in was easy and we was able to drop some bags off before the room was ready so we could go and explore without dragging them around with us. They gave us the choice of having the room tidied by their staff in the morning OR having a drinks voucher each instead for the bar which we went for and got two ‚Ç¨14 cocktails each for free! Great idea! The rooms are very nice, sleek, modern and trendy. Air con, hairdryer, shower gels and shampoos and conditioner. Large TV which easily connects to your phone so you can stream your own stuff! The bed was super comfy with 2 big pillows. Fab Marshall speaker in the room so we was able to have a bit of music on while getting ready. Honestly, we have ZERO complaints. Fab location, Fab hotel, fab price! 5 stars from us! ",5,2024,08,13
246,Great Hotel,"Adorable and eclectic hotel on the north side of the city. The rooms are clean, bed is comfortable and service was wonderful. I‚Äôd say this hotel has a fun vibe. In the lobby is a bar and restaurant which is open rather late from what we saw. I‚Äôd absolutely stay here again and recommend it to anyone.",5,2024,08,08
246,Excellent Hotel,"Excellent hotel,  it sure why so many negatives. The decor of the hotel is amazing, the staff were super friendly and helpful. We stayed in the loft room and the views from the balcony were great. The beds were so soft and had a great nights sleep. Would definitely recommend and will certainly stay here again.",5,2024,08,05
246,Nice modern hotel but needs to fix check in process,"Relatively recently opened. 
Nice place . Modern functional rooms, cool bar area, location a bit ‚Äòedgy‚Äô but easy walking to all of the main areas of the city. Didn‚Äôt try breakfast but looked ok. 
However it seriously needs to fix the check in process and up the levels of service. 
Check in is shambolic and not in keeping with the modern digital vibe of the hotel. Took forever to check in and whilst we were  staying there it seemed like there was always a queue of frustrated people trying to check in ! It is ridiculous that every guest is expected to fill in a quite long form at check in . If they want the information get it at booking time. Check in should take /a couple of minutes not 20 minutes. Also the staff are all very well intentioned and friendly but  generally across the board very slow and not empowered. For example queries about payments at check in seemed to require staff to make calls to a mystery back office. Sort this out and will be a good place to stay.",3,2024,08,04
246,Lovely new hotel,Lovely quirky hotel close to city centre shopping and temple bar areas. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Young and learning as they work. The only complaint for us was the buffet breakfast. Not a great selection and all continental. But everything else was great,5,2024,07,18
246,Totally overpriced-no value for Money,"I recently stayed at the Ruby Molly Hotel in Dublin and was appalled by the outrageous room rate of ‚Ç¨256 per night. This price is absolutely exorbitant and more fitting for New York City, not a town like Dublin. For this steep cost, I received an ultra-small room with no breakfast included. The value for money is simply unacceptable. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone due to their exploitative pricing. It‚Äôs unfathomable how they can justify such high prices for such minimal offerings. Avoid at all costs!",1,2024,07,03
246,Ruby Molly is a con job,"We are experienced travellers We booked a room online on the company‚Äôs website That was confirmed by email On arrival we were given another lesser room No reason was given No refund of extra costs we paid No one to speak with An phone number to a call centre Local staff totally disempowered A more arrogant and patronising outfit is hard to imagine Basic, soul less, god forsaken A true con job on all its customers Office in Malta - do they pay tax here in Ireland? FFS stay somewhere else",1,2024,06,27
246,Don‚Äôt stay here!,"I agree with the last review! Run away from this place!! I had canceled my reservation well in advance to stay here, but they charged me anyway and said there was nothing they could do‚Ä¶ no, they could easily just give me my money back, but they‚Äôre blaming the fact that I booked through another site. They won‚Äôt give me my money back. Don‚Äôt stay here.",1,2024,06,25
246,Run from it.,"Very bad experience. It seems to be a new hotel, with no people trainned.
No fone in the room, no minibar.
We have serious problems with the room and no solution was done.
And ir seems that no one was worried.
Staff did not comunicate with one another. So every time I should explain the same situation over and over.",1,2024,06,25
246,Convenient new hotel ,"We spent 5 days at the Ruby and overall our experience was fine. 
It's important to note this is a new hotel and sometimes it did feel like they were still working out the kinks. 
It's beautifully decorated, and the rooms are crisp. The water temp in our room could never stay one temperature and the bar/restaurant has a limited selection. Self check-in felt odd since there is someone there to help anyway.  All things that I'm sure will be worked out. 
It's not in a trendy part of town, but it is centrally located to all of things and there is great international food all around. ",4,2024,06,22
246,Lovely cozy stay at Ruby Molly.,"Absolutely loved this hotel and very much enjoyed my stay with them. My room was clean, modern, and super comfortable (the bed and pillows were perfect). The hotel itself is brand new, it has a very nice design/layout and is very cozy. It's modern and sleek as well as safe with an excellent location (only a 5min walk to the temple bar area). Staff were extremely welcoming and friendly. The breakfast was delicious: it had a large variety of proteins, vegetables, breads, pastries, etc. They had a little bar to make your own yoghurt/granola bowls which I very much appreciated. I think the price was very reasonable considering the cleanliness and quality of the breakfast. Highly recommend this place and look forward to staying with them again the next time I'm in dublin.",5,2024,06,20
246,Fantastic find.,Recently stayed mid week in this hotel for business. Check in was self service and quick which was great. I was pleasantly surprised with the size of the rooms which has everything you need. Bar service is a little limited but has a really funky feel to it and I‚Äôm sure with time will evolve into a cool spot. Location is fantastic to explore both north and south side of the city with luas stop 2 minutes walk from hotel. Breakfast the next morning hit the spot and I was greeted by the manager Gary who was very friendly and interested in my stay and welcomed all feedback and advised they aren‚Äôt open long and will tale all my comments onboard. I‚Äôd definitely return to this hotel and would recommend to anyone looking for a great location.,5,2024,05,25
246,Fun hotel with unique appeal and great location,"Fun and new hotel. Had to make an emergency hotel switch (I booked the wrong dates) and ended up at Ruby Molly. The staff are very friendly, and quick to take care of things and get me checked in despite having booked at a moments literal notice.

The rooms are a great size for a solo/couple traveler and amenities are nice. While there wasn't a fridge to keep drinks cold (I don't really think that's much of a thing in the EU so not really a detractor) but the hotel bar is open very late and they have plenty of ice available.

The bar menu was limited, but I'm told that'll expand as they get the bearings. Unique fact: each room has a Marshall guitar amp in them and you can sign out a guitar from the lobby and jam in your room. As a musician, just thought that was a really cool discovery once I'd checked into my room. Location wise it's maybe 10 minute walk right into the Temple Bar area and the shops/etc. Definitely would stay here again if I found myself in Dublin.",5,2024,05,24
246,Fine,"Nice new decor but walls are very thin and noise from hallway conversions is disruptive. Luxury feel to the facilities but location somewhat let's it down, overall it's central but still down a side street that definitely doesn't feel safe after dark",4,2024,05,20
246,Modern city hotel,"Ruby Molly is a modern, very new hotel with a prime location. Just minutes walk to Temple Bar and Jameson Distillery on Bow Street.
The rooms were clean, modern and had a wonderful view (5. Stock) over Dublin. Only the ""modern"" concept of transparent toilets/showers is not ideal, but currently ""state of the art"".
Breakfast was rich and good. Staff were friendly and attentive at all times.",4,2024,10,15
246,Ireland,"The great arrival the room also basically on the 3rd is for the room because the service the next few days quite a lot that wishing a guy who served in bar looked at us until bad when we wanted to extend a night seemed to bother them, the girls of the great arrival the Argentine girl also but the others quite unfriendly.",3,2024,10,10
246,More of a designer hostel than a 4-star hotel.,"Very new hotel, practically brand new, with a very cool design and decoration. 
The location is central but on a street with little life.
The staff, very young, very nice but unresolving. Check in is done by the customer directly on a screen. Overall, the whole deal is very impersonal. 
The room, although very nice and spacious, impractical: large wardrobe, but with few shelves for clothes. 
There was no coffee maker or refrigerator. Only two USB sockets in the entire room (rare in a new hotel). There were no plug adapters, if you wanted them they were paid for (no complimentary left, sic). 
The placement of the duvets was strange: two pieces in a double bed, placed horizontally.
It had bad soundproofing, you could hear everything happening in the hallway and the temperature of the shower water was not constant. 
Equipment-wise, it was only free soap/shampoo. The rest of the amenities were for a fee. There was no courtesy umbrella either, if you wanted one they sold it to you. 
All these sales were through a vending machine on the 6th floor. Like I say, all very impersonal.
They insisted a lot on refusing cleanliness (the only interaction). If you still opted for it, they did not make it or bother to make it (8 in the morning), so keep the two glasses they give in exchange for not cleaning.
The entire base is occupied by a bar/restaurant. Very well decorated, and even with guitars available to customers. Worth trying, the food is delicious but the attention very slow.
In our case, for the cost per night, we had very bad value for money, hence I had more feeling of being in a youth hostel designer than a 4 star hotel and that I have been so rigorous in the criticism. 
But if you get it cheap, it's a great option to visit Dublin.",3,2024,09,06
246,Unforgettable,"Conveniently located a stone's throw from the centre of Dublin, this hotel has an agreement with a nearby car park where you can leave your car. The staff and 'young and super helpful, spacious and trendy rooms and rooms with design details and finishes. Really sought after environment! Breakfast with a wide choice of sweet and savory. Too bad we were only one night!",5,2024,08,18
246,Experience in Dublin,"Divine hotel!! Excellently located! Two blocks from the river and Lord the other side you access the pedestrians with cute shops! The very modern facilities! 
It is worth highlighting the whole part of the lobby with many meeting places with a very modern atmosphere and house music. The very friendly and dedicated reception guys and in bar we highlight the attention Jos√© with all the good vibes and very attentive to all orders!! All highly recommended!! If we go back to Dublin it will be our place",5,2024,08,16
246,Comfortable and comfortable,"We went in the first week of opening and were still finishing the work. The hotel is in a central but rather abandoned neighborhood, which is in a redevelopment phase of which the hotel itself is part. The structure is very nice. The pub cozy and spacious. The rooms are comfortable, with great bathroom amenities, although the sink in the room makes cohabitation inadvisable unless there is great confidence. Spacious and comfortable bed. Young and helpful staff. Breakfast of 10 and praise, not to be missed",4,2024,06,24
246,Excellent for everything,"Newly renovated and central hotel. Very comfortable. Very friendly staff, young and friendly guys. Top cleaning. Quiet, brand new rooms, equipped with every comfort. Exceptional breakfast with great variety and quality of products.",5,2024,05,11
