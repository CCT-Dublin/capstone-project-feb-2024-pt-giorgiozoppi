47,Nice but frustrating to have to go to reception to fix your room card every time you left your room,"The breakfast was great, really fresh pastries, freshly cooked omelette and fresh orange juice.

The staff were polite, attentive and friendly. 

The pool on the roof would’ve been more useful and it have been heated. The area is functional with a great view. Unfortunately, the building has been designed terribly though as you have to catch one lift to go down to ground floor walk out find another lift and go up to the swimming pool.

And then there was the room cards. Every single time I left the room I needed to get a replacement card bar one. Something like 12 revisits to reception. The card is used for the lift but the doors close so quickly that I would regularly see people going up and down because they couldn’t get their card to work so we’re called from floor to floor wherever the lift went. The card problem was common place among most of the customers. I saw Security and reception staff all working with people trying to test their cards while holding the door open with their foot.",3,2024,10,05
47,Definitely not 4 stars,"Great location, friendly front desk staff and good breakfast area. That’s it. 

Cons: breakfast doesn’t start until 7  am-you’re a tourist hotel, hello. some outlets did not work. None near bed, was ridiculous. My TV remote needed replacing with an up to date one (huh?). I had to ask for clean dishes since staff couldn’t see dirty cups clearly on counter. Also had finally to ask for soap replacement after two days. I think they were also rationing towels since I think one day I had a bath towel replaced, nothing else. Just one:). Cleaning staff needs serious training or something, I dunno. Guests shouldn’t have to beg for basic things. Bathroom hasn’t been updated in years-chipping ceiling paint; tub needed cleaning; toilet clogged regularly.",2,2024,10,04
47,In Appreciation to a great asset to the tesm,"I’m writing this message to acknowledge one of the Catalonia Barcelona Plaza team members at reception, Daria was extremely helpful in solving a problem with our room644. She went out of her way and very supportive. This made a major difference to our stay. 
Thank you Daria you are definitely an asset to the Catalonia Plaza team.
Wishing you all the best

47,Pros and Cons,"This hotel was booked for my husband for a business trip.  Pictures looked great; but, the reality was a little lackluster.

Pros: 
We found the staff eager to help, quick to respond, and overall looking to provide excellent customer service. When asked for an iron, it was delivered to our room within minutes; when asked about electrical outlets by the bed (which there are none), we were quickly offered an extension cord; rooms were cleaned promptly and thoroughly; breakfast staff was excellent; bar staff was friendly and helpful.  Pool on the 8th floor is respectable and not many people were up there, so it seemed to almost be my own private pool area. There is a nice view, umbrellas, towel service, and bar service. Location is pretty good (it is near Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya), but you have a decent walk or need to take a taxi to get anywhere exciting.

Cons: 
*Rooms are dated
*No iron in the room (we did receive one but were asked to return it as soon as possible as there were not many in the hotel)
*No outlets bedside (this is difficult for charging phones, sleeping machines, etc.)
*Bed linens are fine; but scant. There is a sheet and a ""comforter""; but the comforter really seems like another sheet. There are blankets in the closet; others in our group jokingly described them as ""wartime"" blankets.
*King bed is two twins pushed together (although this is on the normal side for Europe)
*No washcloths provided (there is one bath towel and a hand towel per guest)
*Awkward step in shower with the wand nozzle in the middle of the wall vs being at one end or the other of the tub.
*Found the room to be quiet from street noise, but could hear neighbors in the hallway.

Hotel Catalonia at Barcelona Plaza has potential, but definitely needs a face lift.",3,2024,09,22
47,Great!,"This is a nice hotel close to shopping and restaurants.  They offer  lovely breakfast! There are conference rooms. Staff is friendly. Rooms are clean and spacious. 
I can be particular on bedding and pillows, but the beds are comfortable. Rooms also have good AC!",5,2024,09,20
47,"Top hotel, well located with a few flaws!","Brilliant location with an epic view.  Choose a room carefully as they may have amazing views or may view resident flats at the back.  

The showers are first class - rain showers ... awesome!  The service at the reception is variable as you may need to wait 5-10 minutes.  The bar staff are fun and friendly BUT the security act like policemen. Security are no fun and get you to stand in the bar area.  Really!

Breakfast is 1st class - everything is available.  Comfy beds with total blackout curtains is great but the A/C is noisy.",4,2024,09,18
47,Unpleasant Experience,"We stayed at this hotel as part of a tour. The room was very dated and there were only 3 electrical outlets in the entire room and none by the bed. The washroom tile area was full of mould and tiles broken. We asked for a room change next day and was given a smaller room that initially seemed in better shape. When I pulled back the shower curtain there was mould here as well including around the sink. Furthermore, the staff were not very friendly. The hotel is not near the ""city action"" and I would not consider it a 4 star. Other people in our group also complained of mould in the bathroom and generally unhappy with the hotel. The only good thing was the breakfast buffet which was excellent.",2,2024,09,15
47,Perfect hotel,"Perfect hotel (metro outside and airport bus across the road). Metro 2 stops 5 mins to playa catalunya square.
Pay the fee to upgrade for a room with a view it's well worth it. Our room 652 was perfect, large shower area. Massive bed, coffee machine[refilled everyday),
Plug sockets beside the bed [some reviews saying no sockets],lamps and smart tv which you can pair your phone to watch what you like. WiFi included. 
Security at the door 24hrs.
Breakfast is also very good. Lovely pool and great views of barcelona. 
Couldn't be any better.

Only negative was the price of drinks at the pool bar €19 for a cocktail.

Thanks to I think Joaquin for his professional service at reception.",5,2024,09,10
47,It’s a tired hotel.,"The hotel is in a great location however I felt the rooms are dated. It’s hard to believe in this day and age when everyone has a mobile phone, there is no power points near the bedside table. Another small gripe, is the shower curtain which can get mouldy and I felt the shower in the bath was too slippery for my liking. 
The rooms feel rundown, with mould, chips in the furniture and loud noises coming from other rooms, especially when the toilet is flushed. 
There is limited space to have 2 suitcases in the room. 
The breakfast was great and the view from the roof top bar is amazing.",3,2024,09,08
47,Nice hotel but drinks are a joke,"The hotel is very nice for a 4 star hotel but the cost of drinks is ridiculous.

1 x Rum and coke 18 euros. A coke 5 euros, beers 8 euros is basically extortionate.

Hotels and resorts in the med are getting over priced.

They would get a lot more customers if the prices were more reasonable.",3,2024,09,01
47,Thoroughly wonderful stay in a thoroughly wonderful hotel ,"My husband and I spent three fabulous days in Barcelona for my 60th birthday this year and we stayed in the Catalonia Barcelona Plaza hotel. We booked a vista plaza room and we were very pleasantly surprised when we checked in to find we'd been given a free upgrade to a city view room. Check in was efficient and the receptionist was very helpful. Our room was perfect with a huge comfortable bed, excellent air conditioning and the bathroom was very well appointed with toiletries and fluffy towels. Our room was cleaned and serviced every day and nothing was too much trouble for any of the hotel staff. On my birthday, a member of the hotel staff brought me a birthday present of a bottle of cava, a big cookie and a bar of chocolate and a mini cheese cake. This was a truly wonderful touch and really made my birthday special. If we ever come back to Barcelona, we will definitely choose the Catalonia Barcelona Plaza hotel. It is perfectly located for the transport links for the city and I cannot recommend it highly enough. ",5,2024,09,01
47,Big rooms for city hotel and nice room space,Came for a night away with my wife big room on the 7th floor. Plenty of space comfy cool bar downstairs for a cocktail. Went to the roof for a drink and swim earlier in the evening that was good that was nice with good views though a bit dirty that I don't think could be helped. Will be back.,5,2024,09,01
47,Great View and Comfortable Accommodation,"The hotel has a fantastic location with a beautiful view, right across from the Venetian Towers. The view from the pool on the 8th floor was especially amazing, offering a great spot to enjoy Barcelona. The pool was clean and well-maintained, and the towel service by the pool was very convenient. However, there was no space in the room to dry wet clothes, which was a drawback for us. The room was spacious enough, and having a minibar and kettle was a nice touch. The bathroom was comfortable and functional, and the beds were very clean and cozy. The metro station was very close, making it easy to reach the city center, although Uber or Bolt are also good options. There were plenty of coffee and breakfast spots nearby, and a shopping mall was right next door, adding to the convenience.",4,2024,08,22
47,Just stay elsewhere.,"Nice hotel in terms of decor - BUT, the cards that work the lifts and rooms simply don’t work for anyone- it’s a genuine nightmare. Every time you leave the hotel the cards don’t work in the lift to take you up to the room. If you can get it to work in the lift, it won’t work for the room.  Same story if you go for breakfast, to the pool. It’s a joke, all over the hotel people can’t work the lifts or get in their rooms. It’s just not worth the hassle. I would stay further east so more central as not conveniently located. 
Also the reception staff are very cold.
Just stay elsewhere!",2,2024,08,21
47,suite was awesome in luxury and views,"Great hotel location at Placa d'Espanya with easy, short-walk access to the airport express bus stop. We were upgraded to a suite by Linda from our double room with square view. The suite had two baths and a eating area with table and seating for 4 (good for family gathering).  the views were amazing both day and night looking at the Arenas shopping mall (that has a food court and a market in the basement level), the Venetian-inspired towers and the National Art Museum. We had only one night to enjoy this marvelous suite and would have stayed longer if we could change our flights home after our cruise.
There were 2 issues that lowered our rating from 5 stars: (1) family suites are on the 12th floor and elevators stop at 11th.  People and suitcases had to go up a set of stairs. (2) the pool on the 8th floor has a great view but does not have a separate area for children to play without bumping into the adults.",4,2024,08,18
47,Good breakfast and excellent staff,"Very good breakfast. Lots of hot choices, juices and cook to order eggs. Breakfast staff are very attentive, friendly and professional. 

Negatives are limited outlets in the room, card sometimes does not work in elevators. 

Hotel is in a very good location next to Arenas mall with many restaurants and shops.",4,2024,08,08
47,Unfriendly and Junior suite with no privacy,"WORST EXPERIENCE ever!!!
We usually love hotels from the Catalonia group but this experience was terrible. We booked a junior suite with a terrace.  The room was situated on the 8th floor directly next to the pool. The terrace was more or less open to the public. Impossible to ly on the bed with the curtains open because the pool guests have a direct view into the room. So we kept the curtains closed. 
The bath tub was stylish however no shampoo or shower gel - the bottles were locked in the shower. Our request to provide some shower gel was promised but totally ignored. The staff especially the day staff at the pool bar were absolutely unfriendly. 0 star hotel style bit not what I expect for a 4 star hotel . Never again!!!",1,2024,08,07
47,Disappointed,"Only reason I hive 2 is because the front desk is not honest. Location great . Do not order taxi with hotel 
They charge extra 5 dollars. Very deceitful.  When confronted they said no. I asked taxi he said yes. They get kick backs. So shameful for 5 euros. Co sideline I paid 300 euros night I don't care but don't lie to my face. You know who you are. As managers and directors of this hotel you should be really ashamed. 
To bad cause it's beautiful location and rooms with cute pool.",2,2024,08,03
47,Great location & Views,"When we checked in we got a free room upgrade with a beautiful view to the twin towers. 
I extended my stay for two nights due to convenience of the location and great service, would come back to this hotel next time I return to barcelona.
The cocktails are great also.",5,2024,07,25
47,Very good service keep up the good work and the chefs give him my thanks  smash burger was amazing great place to sun to,"It was such a beautiful hotel, and the staff are so kind the drinks are also very good especially the Fanta lime!!! The smash burger was absolutely amazing thank you to the head of stuff for recommending it, the pool was so refreshing after sun tan all day. I would definitely go again!!!",5,2024,07,24
47,"Very poor experience with our room and services, but the location is good ","Very disappointed with this hotel, can only say we left feeling disappointed. We were supposed to be in a deluxe room with a view, well unfortunately there was nothing deluxe about it. There was an awful stain on the headboard that was covered by a cushion, an attempt to get this cleaned did not work -i dread to think what it was!! The bathroom door stuck so much when you opened it that a maintenance man had to come and fix it but only just. And then the beds, the mattresses were awful we had two very poor nights sleep when I spoke too reception about all of these points I was told that there was nothing they could do and we were in the best room in the hotel! Gosh what must the other rooms be like.
But most of all, you kinda expect that things can go wrong but it is what is done that makes the difference, well we never once had a true apology, even when we checked out I was not asked if my stay was okay, perhaps they don't want to hear that you're not going to come back.
No doubt the hotel will put a message on about this post with the usual apologetic stuff but it will all be too late I am afraid, at over 500 euros for just two nights it really is not good enough. We will avoid this hotel and the hotel chain in the future.",2,2024,07,22
47,Fabulous stay in Barcelona!,"Loved our stay here in Barcelona.  The room was comfy, the staff pleasant, and the location perfect.  Especially enjoyed the pool, sipping on cocktails and meeting new people while we escaped from the heat. Loved our espresso machine so much I think I might buy one when I get home.",5,2024,07,22
47,I wish I could give more stars!!!,"TL;DR: EXQUISITE hotel, facilities and service - HIGHLY recommend! This hotel literally has everything.

There are some very odd reviews below stating 'no warmth or genuine greetings' which is so odd to me, every staff member went above and beyond in our experience. And a comment saying the food was 'average'? Please ignore this - the breakfast was so exceptional we looked forward to it every day!

The hotel itself is breathtaking and has been newly refurbished to an extremely high standard. We were blown away. The green tiles around the reception area are stunning. The downstairs area is so chilled and relaxing, with indoor greenery and chilled out spaces, used for breakfast in the morning and general use during the day, with coffee and juice stations accessible for residents any time. The rooftop pool, bar and chill out area is amazing with fantastic views and there is a 'spa' (massage only) available too. The bar staff were lovely, all the different people I spoke too, very helpful and friendly (as well as the hostess who gave us some vouchers for welcome drinks as well as the ones from reception as my friend is getting married and was there on her hen do!), shout out to my Guinean friend (I didn't get his name) that I mistook for Jamaican, I had so much fun chatting with you! Such a nice guy.

THE BREAKFAST - OMG, a challenger for one of the best hotel breakfast selections I have experienced in my say, 35 years of travelling since childhood. There are 5 amazing stations - a fresh pressed juice station (I had fresh peach juice every day which was amazing) and plant based milks, a tea station with a hot water decanter and little jars with fresh ingredients such as lemon, peppermint, ginger, honey etc to make your own fresh tea, a station with 8 different granolas, 6 different yoghurts and various bowls of chopped fresh fruit and whole fruit (like apples), a hot station where you can pick out the usual hot foods with a made-to-order omelette station, fresh pastries from croissants to donuts, 2 toasting machines with an array of bread and bagels to toast, assisted by fresh spreads, meats and cheeses such as hummus, a tzatziki/feta blend that I was OBSESSED with and freshly chopped veggies such as peppers, onions, tomato and avocado. I WISH I'd have taken pictures of the stations but we were too excited by breakfast each morning to think about it! 

The rooms were spotlessly clean and actually have a window that opens, which is a welcome change! We didn't need to open it as we had air con, but it's a nice option to have. The beds were super comfy and we loved the long pillows! I want some of those at home now. The TV was operated by Chromecast, which I haven't used before but was super easy and a great idea for residents to be able to access their own apps without having to mess about with logging in and out. Other bonuses - a GOOD, proper hairdryer with a nozzle (none of this rubbish attached to the wall junk that does nothing productive), an ironing board that sits on the bed with an iron, a stocked fridge (easy to use for your own things if you wish, a safe, coffee machine and cups. The bathroom was lovely with a great shower (rainfall and standard) with shower gel and shampoo attached to the wall along with complementary, eco friendly bits and bobs for convenience.

The location is beyond fantastic, with two metro stops, the stops for the hop-on-hop-off buses, a huge shopping centre with rooftop restaurants and a street with shops and bars right outside, there is literally nothing more you could want on your doorstep. There is even a pretty little park next to the shopping centre (we had two meals on the rooftop in two different restaurants and they were both amazing! Very convenient if you don't want to venture too far). Taxis are also available all day outside the hotel too and are on a meter, very reasonably priced. 

The one issue our other room had was a smell from the drains that they came back to which was dealt with as soon as reception was called and the team went above and beyond to correct the issue as best they could. Not ideal, but it is more about the solution than the problem, because issues and problems happen, that cannot be avoided sometimes, and it was dealt with immediately.

The only points I would raise for management (which are NOT issues to me, more for you to be aware of) - 1. On our floor for 3 days, it absolutely stank of cannabis. Now don't get me wrong, I use medicinal cannabis myself and love the smell, but I go outside to use it out of courtesy and following hotel rules and I believe it to be wrong for others to flout these rules especially for residents that may not like it and those with children. I also saw quite a number of people leaning out of their windows smoking cigarettes, which stinks even worse. This needs to be monitored more closely.

2 - For your international clients, I would make tea bags and milk more readily available. Our second room asked for milk and were given the Spanish Inquisition about why they wanted it, which was a little odd.

Our experience was 5 star, and this was taken even further by the manager, David, going above and beyond for me personally. I asked on Saturday if they were showing the F1 (British Grand Prix), he told me that they were not planning to, but if the singer/band that was performing in the communal area at 1pm were finished that he would put it on the big screen for me - which he did, just for me! I cannot tell you how much I appreciated this (especially being an incredible race!) and how this accelerated my opinion of the hotel, even though I was already bought it. It is this kind of 'above and beyond' behaviour that keeps customers returning time and time again, and I for one cannot wait to return to this hotel after visiting with friends so that I can bring my husband. Thank you David and everyone at the hotel that made our stay so relaxing and enjoyable! We will be looking at other Catalonia Hotels in the various locations they are if we visit those locations before anywhere else, based on this experience. You have set the bar high for the other hotels in your chain!",5,2024,07,11
47,Good hotel for a stop-over in Barcelona,"Excellent location at Plaza De España with Aerobes stop right in front of the hotel ( less than 30 min non stop transfer to the airport T1 or T2 -Different buses - run every 5 to 10 min 24/24h)
Excellent bedding , crisp bed sheet. Room well appointed . 
Hard floor in the hallway... footsteps resonnate even with double door in the room . 
Rooftop pool offers magnificent view of Montjuíc and the Magical Fountains but the water is cold , even for July 
Food average 
The weakest link would be the service,  warmth and genuine greetings were lacking",4,2024,07,08
47,Book else were if you want to sleep well,"Arrived on Thursday 8th of July to a Very dark room with an inside view on a roof ! No view at all on the streets, no sun light… that’s such a shame in Barcelona ! When I arrived the safe was blocked and the sink also. I Had to wait for two technicians to manage the two problems . I Was woken up early the next morning cause of the tubes vibrations will I am on the 3rd floor. !?! The next day I assisted to an afternoon of conferences, we were all very cold in the room all afternoon so I caught an angine and a big head hake. All day Saturday, same think freezing conference room. Every night they are parties on the roof top and this Saturday the music is so loud at 00h30 I cannot sleep ! So think twice before booking here. Only the geographical position is good. Food is extremely average. Staff does smile ! So different from all I have always know in Spain were people are so friendly and helpful usually !",1,2024,07,06
47,"Amazing, one of my personal favourite in Barcelona","Room with a view to the city, rooftop terrace with a pool and THAT VIEW!

Only thing was little strange is that breakfast starts 7.00 AM, which is often late if you're on a rush to airport.",4,2024,07,05
47,A pleasing stay,"We spent 4 nights at the Catalonia Barcelona Plaza. The location was perfect with the metro into town right on our doorstep. The hotel was clean and attractive, offering a rooftop with a pool, bar and stunning view. 

However, we did encounter a problem with the shower, which emitted brown water one morning. The issue was resolved after quite some time, which impacted our plans for the morning, but we were compensated with free drinks at the bar. ",4,2024,06,12
47,Mind the lift!,"Wonderful location and great selection at breakfast. Open air roof pool fresh! Rooms cleaned daily very well. Needs some maintenance, informed staff of loose metal strip on floor by lifts on level 2, if wearing sandals could cause nasty injury, nothing done about it in following 2 days. Lift mechanisms iffy. On last day also I found myself trapped in lift. Engineer came after about 20 minutes and I was released after another 5. Not one member of staff, or the engineer, came up to me to check I was OK.  I went to reception and eventually got a half hearted apology but they still didn't check I was OK. Felt like they really didn't care.",3,2024,06,09
47,Group tour,We were on a tour and they stopped at this hotel.  It is a nice hotel close to the water and pedestrian shops.  The hotel was nice and clean and had a good breakfast bar every morning.  Most of the stuff we did we walked to. I would stay here again if I ever return to Barcelona,4,2024,05,31
47,"Great place to stay, with a great location!","This hotel is my choice if staying in Barcelona because of its location.  It’s also a great hotel to stay for those cruising out of the port, as the hotel is directly down one road.  I always choose the room facing the circle as I think it’s very captivating.  The restaurant on the premises is a bit pricey, but the breakfast buffet comes with a lot of options.",4,2024,05,27

47,Excellent rooftop 360 view,"Amazing hotel , facilities, staff , food & location . 

David checked me in early and walked over and handed me the keys when I was waiting at the bar .

The rooftop pool is incredible, the 360 views are insane and the seating , decking area very spacious, clean and safe. 

The hotel bar at night was friendly , security at the main entrance and rooms specious with lovely city views.

Highly recommend this hotel and would definitely go back. But one thing I didn’t like was the “City Tax” you got charged per person which I didn’t know about (€14-20) per day.",5,2024,05,25
47,Break,"Lovely breakfast , probably the best i have had , great space and can choose own seating

Lobby is nice looking, breakfast buffet had plenty of options with fresh squeezed OJ- the best! I had a room at the front of the hotel, facing all the action. It had awesome views. The bathroom was really nice at one time but now, it needs some renovations. Hotel staff was nice and accommodating with our questions.",4,2024,05,21
47,Gathering Basketball,"We were there with the basketball association of Catalonia. All 6 selections of youth teams won medals at the national competition, 3 gold, 1 silver , 2 bronz.   
We had a meeting down stairs with some appetizers and drinks . Food was good , great service . I would have given 5 stars if the beer they served wasn't luke warm. That's inexcusable, beer has to be cold . I changed to white wine , not because I wanted to but beer was indrinkable.  Something to bear in mind , maybe for the next group.",4,2024,05,20
47,"Good location, metro rumble  audible","Stayed at this hotel for a few nights. Location is very good , metro and amenities very close. Room we are staying in is fully renovated and clean. Quiet room with the exception of metro line noise running under hotel; an audible rumble is present especially at night on a regular basis although intermittent (room on fourth floor) . I found it particularly annoying.
As commented by most guests rooms are very warm, at times uncomfortably warm.

I was disappointed with staff service on an occasion when I requested camomile bags at reception . For the most part, staff is courteous but somewhat aloof at front desk.",4,2024,05,18
47,Excellent staff and hotel,"Our company planned a staff trip in May 2024 well in advance and in cooperation with the staff in Barcelona Plaza´s commercial and event team. We were a group of 88, all staying in the hotel and the Saturday night was a groupo dinner in the hotel event room. The staff´s professionalism can only be described as five star. In every area of the hotel were helpful, smiling staff doing excellent work. The main dinner was a buffet and like the breakfast or food in the hotel restaraunts all impecable. Our whole group enjoyed their trip and have nothing but positive memories from their visit. We thank all the staff with extra compliments for Olga, Celia and Simona for making our trip so positive and effortless. We highly recommend!",5,2024,05,15
47,Wonderful weekend in Barcelona,"This was our first time visiting Barcelona and this beautiful hotel.
Everything from the meet and greet at the reception to the bar staff and concierge and everyone you meet were so polite and helpful!
The hotel is beautifully clean and so well managed with plenty of room.
Our room was phenomenal… we had requested a large double bed on booking and were upgraded ! 
Amazing views ! Great location for the airport and all transport too !
The breakfast choice is phenomenal! 
So much choice for all dietary needs !
Delicious and plentiful !
Please visit this hotel you will love it !",5,2024,05,13
47,Disappointed!,"For location, it was a good place to stay. Metro is very near and the Aerobus from the Airport stops in front of the hotel. Room was adequate for 3 persons but the room needs serious repairs, the main door hinge is broken, the sink is broken n simply repaired with plaster but not replaced with a new one and the shower hose is leaking so was definitely very disappointed. The room in question is Room 403.",3,2024,04,10
47,Very successful stay,"Hotel in a very good location, right in front of the hotel there is a bus stop to the airport.  Very large breakfast room and tasty food.  The only minus is the lack of smiles on the faces of the staff... as if they were working there for a penalty...",4,2024,04,05

47,In time of need - people step up,"Due to unforeseen circumstances, our stay at this property was interrupted by an accident.  The staff was so helpful and caring and did everything possible to aid us. We had to extend our time at their property in order to get a flight home. Hotel management, front desk associates, waitstaff in the restaurant, bellman, you name it were there for us.  Top notch team of people with hearts of gold. Special shout out to Anna, Linda, David & Pau",4,2024,03,29
47,Great hotel except for the lack of aircon in late March,"Frequent visitor to Barcelona conference and this time at the Palau Congressos. Would have given this a four star if it weren’t for the stuffy rooms. Apparently they turned off the central aircon in March and so they recommend visitors to open the windows if they don’t want some fresh air. The room temp rose up to 29C at night when I tried to turn on the thermostat on the wall. When I opened the double windows the traffic noises outside made it harder to fall asleep. Wish they could at least put an electric fan inside the rooms. Otherwise the staff is friendly, rooms are spacious and clean, breakfast has a fair variety and of course the Metro is just right outside.",3,2024,03,22
47,It's wonderful!,"I had a great time, the hotel is wonderful, clean, the breakfast is plentiful and very tasty. The workers are nice, the cleaning ladies came to clean every day. Everything is close, the location is very good.",5,2024,03,12
47,Great Hotel & Location,"I arrived early and the receptionist was very accommodating and even upgraded me into a suite so that I could get changed and attend a meeting.

The suite was overlooking the Plaça d'Espanya which is a busy junction in the city but there was little noise to affect enjoyment of the room.",5,2024,02,29
47,A good hotel at a great location in Barcelona.,"We stayed at Catalonia Plaza Barcelona hotel near musical fountains during our recent visit. I was not expecting much based on some recent reviews. To my surprise the hotel delivered on quality and service. Check in process was smooth despite it being week of largest conference in Barcelona and hotel at its capacity. The room was small but it maximized utilization. The bed and pillows were quite comfortable. We ate breakfast at the hotel which offered plenty of healthy options for guests. We did not want to stay in the busy Gothic district hotels and this was a wonderful choice. Nothing was too far from the hotel, National Art museum and historic gardens are walking distance. Taxi is always readily available. The air conditioning in rooms was not on (Feb). The room did get a bit warm for us, but it was not a problem because the window in the room could be opened for for fresh air which was a blessing. The mini fridge in room was refreshed promptly and daily. 
Barcelona city has been in a state of drought for a few years now, given this, they still kept room linen service up to the mark with a smile. Be mindful and gentle to the staff and hotel (no matter where you stay in Barcelona).  
We enjoyed our stay.
A few tips:
- the lobby area is pretty small, if you arrive early and your room is not ready. The hotel will happily store your bags. Explore the mall next door instead of sitting in the lobby. 
- Visit the museum and gardens that are walking distance from hotel. They are worth the visit.",5,2024,02,28
47,Enjoyed this hotel ,"Nice hotel, lovely room, clean.
The hotel lobby has a good restaurant - enjoyed lunch there one day. Located in Plaza de España. A block away is Plaza de Toros de Las Arenas, formerly a bull ring  turned into a shopping mall, with shops and restaurants on the upper level. Hotel is a good location.",5,2024,02,24
47,"Good old fashioned hotel, with extremely warm rooms in winter.","The hotel keeps good standards. Check in was smooth and service was normal. The room (seventh floor, towards the front of the hotel) has a comfortable size, great views and was clean. Decoration was nice and bed was comfortable although pillows were too soft. The bathroom has good space, was clean, as good enough towels and include amenities. Only issue about the room is that it was very warm and the central AC does not work in winter. 29 degrees made sleeping the first night very unpleasant, and opening the windows filled the room with noise. The gym is OK, complete and allows you for a good work out although I chose to go for a run on the Montjuïc which is right in front of the hotel. If you will like to hang around this area or attend the Fira Barcelona or Miro museum, the location is ideal. Breakfast was sensational, fresh food and good variety.",3,2024,02,11
47,"Nice hotel,great service.","I am happy to choices for this hotel for our trip in Barcelona.When we arrive with family and check in at hotel.the lobby manager David is really good guy to help us since we have two childrens. He keeps good assistance and let’s check the rooms situation.

Many appreciate for his good service that makes us having a good time living this hotel.",5,2024,01,26
47,Loyal Customer For Life!,"This was my 3rd time staying here. Every time I’ve gotten a room with a good view.Its a good sized room .The metro is just a few feet away. The hotel is very clean and has a good atmosphere . The only feedback I have is that it was during winter and it wasn’t really cold it was a bit warm and the room at times felt hot. 
However I will continue to stay here because I never had that problem before.",5,2024,01,24
47,Only stay if you can get a renovated room,"The hotel is in the process of renovating all public areas and rooms. So, your experience all depends on if you have a renovated room, or not. Ours was renovated (third floor has been updated) on the side of the building, so didn’t get the direct sunlight to make it hot (see many other reviews for comments on air conditioning, which are true!). The room was small per other reviews, but it’s a very convenient location and not expensive, so good value at the price. If I’d had an un renovated room (levels 1 and 2 were not renovated at the time of writing, December 2023) I’d have left. I was with a large group and saw the older rooms - they are in really bad condition.
All up, only stay if you’re guaranteed a renovated room. Also avoid rooms on the front of the building - the view is lovely, but they get very hot and - as above - the air con is terrible.
Lifts also bad, room cards not working is a real thing",3,2023,12,09
47,Thank you.,"We really enjoyed our stay and the food in the main restaurant was fantastic, especially breakfast. 
The staff are friendly, especially the Maitre David Romera. He was so friendly and accommodated all of our dietary requirements. 
Thank you for an enjoyable stay.",5,2023,11,30
47,An incredible Hotel experience,"Satying at the Catalonia Plaza in Barcelona on a business trip was such a lovely experience. Every member of the hotel staff were very welcoming, loads of smiles and they always made an effort to make you feel right at home. The hotel room was super clean, amazing views and excellent interiors. The breakfast had a variety of delicious dishes, probably the best that I had while staying in a hotel. Simple unforgettable!!",5,2023,11,27
47,Worse room ever....,"This hotel room on the first floor was undoubtably the worse hotel room I have ever stayed in. The room was small, dirty, no A/C so very hot and stuffy. The bathroom was falling apart and no basics like charging points that were easily accessible. 
Very Very Poor,  please check before you book, not the best area, dirty outside hotel with rubbish and smoking. Will never be back.....",1,2023,11,18
47,Maybe a 2 star? Not a 4 star hotel. Do not book,"OMG I don’t even know where to begin! The hotel has no sound proof at all!!! The AC doesn’t work at all - when temperature in upper 70s! When I reported to front desk, was told sorry, it doesn’t work like that (turn on and off). Safe wasn’t working at all and only being fixed the day before our last night. Room wasn’t vacuumed and we did not even get a tea bag the day before our last night - what??! Bathroom walls have mold everywhere. Definitely felt being cheated. Very bad experience",1,2023,11,18
47,Bad first impression,"I just checked in an hour ago. First impression is quite bad. The elevator most to the left doesn’t work. Luckily the doors opened. I thought I was trapped. Then, you have to enter your room card in the room in a 45 degree angle to make the electricity work. Just putting the card into the slot won’t do it. Took a call to the reception to figure that out. Aircon doesn’t work. I set it to 10 degrees, and 30 minutes later it’s just as warm. Another client complained about the same thing at the reception when I was checking in, but the staff completely dismissed him. Good service would have been to join him to the room and help him. Well, I opened the window now.

3 nights ahead here as a meeting guest. I guess it can only improve from here. I hope. I regret that our company selected this hotel, as we wanted to offer our employees a nice experience. I hope I was just unlucky and they have a better experience.",2,2023,11,15
47,"TERRIFYING! DANGEROUS, WRONGLY CHARGED","TERRIBLE! 

I don’t no we’re to start!

Checked into the hotel late night after landing. WOKE UP to a gang inside the hotel they took of the fire extinguisher from the wall and broke down the door of the bed room at 6am they sprayed the room and robbed all inside we lay in bed in fright tried calling security many times and had no answer for three hours ans there was still a lot of hussle in the corridor. We was affraid to leave the room and thought maybe we was next! 

We finally built the courage to leave the room and we went to reception and requested a check out due to the unsafe environment. They was understanding and said we can do so agreeing to refund our week stay. 

FOLLOWED by the reception Lucy not refunding but charging our card again for the whole stay ( apparently by accident) WE ARE STILL FOGHTING FOR PUT MONEY BACK IN NOVEMBER! 

It’s been terribly stressful! Back and forth she advised us I’m soo sorry I made a mistake I’ll have it refunded soon as possible. 

But we are discussing with herself and Christina she calls herself a manager, But isn’t happy to even help discuss with accounts! She keeps sending other invoices for other clients and refuses to understand! It’s shocking service since it’s a huge hotel business! 

We are really upset and hope to speak to some management with education to help solve this problem. 

I don’t recommend this hotel as it’s unsafe and also I’m not sure if this money Situation was done on purpose! 

BE AWARE!

IF THERE IS ANY MANAGEMENT HAPPY TO DISCUSS THIS MATTER PLEASE SHARE YOUR DETAILS!",1,2023,11,05
47,Four Stars? ,"Elevators require proxy cards for security reasons, fine. But then, card readers should always work, not just occasionally. Left my room to meet with colleagues at the bar. Realized I needed to go back as I had forgotten my glasses. Meanwhile another random gentleman had opened my room with his key. Not sure how in the digital age a room can sequentially be double assigned once the keys have been issued. I said, 'excuse me that is my room', he showed me his key; it did in fact open my door and had the same room # assigned. The gent disappeared and of course, we were locked out of our room next time we wanted to enter. Another extra trip across the aisles and floors and moody elevators of a huge hotel to have the key exchanged/reprogrammed. No prior communication or good will apologies-sorry-thank-you token from a proactive reception. Eventually made it to the bar, only to realize my colleagues had received a voucher for a free drink. Not me. Ordered a Screwdriver. Bartender looked at me with big eyes. Specified my order to 'Vodka-orange' hoping to dissolve his question marks. Bartender asked 'Vodka with orange lemonade, right?' Me: 'Nonono, just with orange juice' Him: 'Do you want both seperate?' When I said 'Noooo.' I eventually received plain orange juice. Never any vodka. Perhaps I looked underaged at 57.  A complicated case, huh! Constant, elevator bar music even at night when it can become brutal. Alas, I let you decide if all of this is 4 stars. ",2,2023,10,18
47,Terrible staff  and terrible view,"Terrible staff who is rude and arrogant and terrible view whichi is not the same to their reference.
They charged me more even didn't check the real charge.
I booked the square view when I saw the picture but It was the view of ruined building.",1,2023,09,30
47,Great hotel in Barcelona center,"First of all, the hotel was great.
The room is big and clean.
Breakfast was very good and tasty.
Staff very friendly.
Near hotel you can find few restaurants and minimarkets.
Also the metro station is 20 meters from hotel entrance.
The pool is also good. Unfortunately sauna was closed due to reconstruction.",5,2023,09,16
47,Perfect location and great views,"The hotel location is perfect.  Access to several metro lines outside the hotel and the D20 bus goes directly to the Aquarium and the beach.  Our room was on 6th floor with incredible views, as were the views from the rooftop bar/pool.  We didn’t eat here but grabbed croissants from the bakery (Audrey) round the corner. Nothing to dislike about our stay.",5,2023,09,10
47,Every thing is brocken,"Every thing is brocken, safe box, even door lock. The house keeper came inside whithout knocking the door 3 times.
The bed is not comfortable. Breakfast is good. Location  is in the middle of city . Not good value",2,2023,08,29
47,One of the best hotels we’ve stayed in,We’ve stayed here before and the place has never disappointed.  The rooms have been amazingly well presented and the manager Christina and her team have always looked after us.  The breakfast is really top quality and the rooftop bar and pool offers some seriously stunning views of Barcelona.  We’ll definitely be back,5,2023,08,28
47,Another excellent Catalonia hotel,"This was my third visit to this hotel and it seems to only get better each time, excellent staff in all areas of the hotel. But a special mention to Cristina in charge of reception, thank you for everything.",5,2023,08,22
47,Strange room,"The first room I was given looked as though someone else was already using te room. Bed was obviously being used. It was late afternoon so the room was suppose to have been cleared, either they forgot to clean it or someone else was using it.
My trplacement was room 412. The door did not even open all the way. Have to bring my suitcase in sideways. Strange configuration for a room. Looked like it was used for something else and repurposed into a guest room. It was SMALL. TV took up the entire counter space, no place anywhere else to put my glasses, wallet, etc.
Very disappointing",2,2023,08,21
47,"Worst hotel ever! Loud loud loud, terrible staff. Terrible rooms.","The worst hotel I’ve ever stayed in. The doors and walls are paper thin and you can hear every single thing, every person is doing. Specially people walking or talking down the hallways. Good luck getting sleep at night. 
Our A/C unit started leaking water, and at 3am I got up to use the restroom and slipped on the water. The hotel staff simply said they’d look in to the leak. Our bathroom sink would not drain, making it almost impossible to use. The mattress was paper thin, and you could feel the springs dig in to your body every night. Giving me and my husband terrible back, neck and shoulder pains. The shower was filled with black mold, and the shower head barely worked, just spattering water on you. The staff was not friendly at all, and not very accommodating at all. As for the location, it is really dirty outside the hotel. With homeless sleeping right outside the front door. If could do my trip all over again, I would stay as far away from this hotel as I possibly could. What a tourist trap. The great pool that they show in all the photos closes at 7pm everyday. So you can’t even view a sunset while in the pool. And the pool bar just pushes out terrible pre-made drinks that make your stomach hurt. Look anywhere else but stay away from this place. ",1,2023,08,14
47,Amazing hotel,This is honestly one of the best hotels we have stayed in. Our room was a good size and overlooking the Plaza Espana. Breakfast was amazing with a massive choice. All the staff were friendly and helpful. The roof top pool and bar was a bonus with great views. We will definitely be returning.,5,2023,08,10
47,Skip this hotel thanks GLOBUSGO,"The keys didn’t work. The door lock looks broken. one person at reception at 8pm. The internet WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE and when I came back to my room, the bed was made up the bathroom garbage wasn’t dumped. The air conditioning was barely functioning!!  Waste!!",2,2023,08,05
47,Great experience and even more beautiful room views,"The overall experience was great. The hotel is located in a very convenient spot, making it easy to get to every place in Barcelona, either by foot, car, or metro, and has beautiful views from your room. And when I say beautiful views I actually mean it, book a room with Plaza view, it's incredible!
The rooftop terrace and pool are also good. The only inconvenience we experienced for the first three or so days of our stay was poor sound isolation in the room, sleep at night was almost not possible because we could hear everything that was happening in the hall, but we got used to it at the end.
The staff was very helpful and friendly, rooms were clean, bright and had a good wifi connection which made our stay pleasant. 
Will definitely be returning and recommending this hotel to my friends :)
Best regards,
Erika",5,2023,08,01
47,Home to Gaudi,Buenos dias.  We booked the room with the square / plaza view.  Way to go!  Great welcoming staff.  Spacious room and plenty of light.  Breathtaking rooftop views.  Barcelona is a great place to walk around.  Many places to see near the hotel.  Walk or take a taxi.  Recommended.  Would definitely stay there again.  Tip – walk the calles to La Rambla,5,2023,08,01
47,front desk manager was extremely unpleasant and dismissive.,"The front desk girls were lovely and helpful, and always greeted us with a big smile!  especially Silvia!  Also Pol!  
Osman at the bar was wonderful and so was Mario.  Both men were a delight.  
However, the front desk manager was rude and unprofessional.  ",4,2023,07,26

47,"Lovely rooms, not great service for young guests ","Hotel rooms are clean, pretty and nice bathrooms, beds are comfortable. Pool is nice touch though unfortunately didn’t get to use it. Lobby very nicely decorated. However, arriving as two young guests were treated relatively poorly, spoken down to by lobby staff which most likely wouldn’t have happened if we were adult guests. So service was not so great- possibly not worth the money? Also given wrong room with someone else staying in at first- clear communication error which is completely understandable but lack of  apology. Stayed in a hostel for most of trip and location was superb in the rambles- would recommend staying closer to town if not bothered about luxury rooms. ",3,2023,07,18
47,Lack of customer services ,"Found this hotel very unsatisfactory
Our fridge wasn't working reported it three times no response 2 days without a fridge. Asked for an iron 5 times not available over our two days.
The service is lacking do not stay here if you want good prompt customer service. Facilities dated.",1,2023,06,25
47,Warning this is really low standards and not even one star!,"Absolutely worst in many years. Sink in bathroom don’t work, shower broken and sprayed roof instead of me, TV and remote dead, generally worn down and noisy with the elevator making noice all nigh. And I was in the “executive area” - I can just imagine how bad normal rooms are.",1,2023,05,23

47,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza worst Hotel,"First time writing review while staying in the Hotel.
Had booked the Hotel from previous night since was arriving at 9 AM and they do not have early check in.
So far so good. 
Had breakfast. Never seen in any Hotel such unenthusiastic, uninterested and indifferent staff.
The quality of spread and variety would be better in two star restaurant. 
Wifi which they have been touting as one of their usp is not even showing in the room.
Walk out from the room towards elevator some weak Wifi shows up.
Since 10 Am till 4 pm called six times on reception phone number to complain,everything new person answers and promises to rectify the problem, but no action. 
Then I personally visited reception and the gentleman's response was the problem has been resolved. I informed him that in the room there is no wifi. To confirm again I went to the room with no internet and called the reception again, which was answered by a lady who without blinking promised to look into the problem. 
I am still waiting for wifi or someone to bring it to the room. 
In today's age and time this service and attitude from the hotel is highly unprofessional and unbecoming of a service hotel.
I am stuck, since I have paid already for three nights. 
Warning for those seeking to make a reservation at this misleading property

47,Great location for airport connection via Bus,"Could improve the internet connection and reliability, especially in the room.
The quality of TV is poor. Could have more international channels
The room needs a face lift. 
Staff are professional and very kind",3,2023,05,11
47,really nice experience but there are some things to improve.,"what a fantastic pleasant experience to have the hotel room upgraded to a suite.
Everyone would at some point get the opportunity to try a suite to feel a little special.
The reason why I don't give it a rating of 5 are some small things like when you look out of the windows in the room you see how some of the hotel's outdoor furniture and other things are scattered on the roof like it's a garbage dump and sometimes you don't was greeted by the staff with the nicest attitude.",4,2023,05,10
47,Back to Barcelona after some years,"I’ve overnighted twice in this hotel, in April and May 2023. Besides the optimum location (tourist bus stop nearby), staff is very friendly, rooms comfortable, and high level of cleanliness. We had a very good meal in the Japanese restaurant. I’m sure we’ll book again the hotel when back to Barcelona",5,2023,05,08
47,Excellent hotel,"We are so so happy with our stay at The Plaza Catalonia Barcelona❤ Great hotel, lovely staff, perfect room, nice roof top and great location! Easy to take the Metro and the view from the hotel is so so nice. Hip on hop of buses just outside the hotel and many nice breakfast restaurants close to the hotel. I highly recommend a stay at the Plaza❤",5,2023,05,05
47,They old our room category before we arrived. ,"The sold our room before arrival. We booked this hotel for our wedding anniversary. Booked a Suite because we had read good reviews about these large spacious rooms with fantastic views. We were in touch with the hotel a few days before arrival to let them know the time of arrival and asking if it would be possible Mohave the room on the 10th or 11th floors, which the said they would do their best to meet our request.
We arrived at 3pm on Sunday 30th April and were told that ""they had had a problem with the system"" and they didn't have any rooms of the category we have booked left. I was completely shocked as this was our wedding our anniversary!! They offered to put us in a junior suite instead (size 33m2 instead of 88m2) saying that it would be cheaper. I explained that this was our wedding anniversary and it wasn't about the money, I asked if everyone had booked the suites that morning and she said that no, that the days before they had been booked. Therefore, she admitted that they had given our room away. After asking if they would give us anything for the downgrade, like a discount or anything for the inconvenience, first she said she would do a 40€ discount and then she changed it to 100€. Anyway, we decided to view the room and it had chips on the floor, the windows were wide open which I thought was suspicious and after closing them we realised they were covering a musty damp smell... Also, the bed was too soft and the mattress felt like it was deformed. We were lucky to find another hotel. This is the first time something like this has ever happened to us. It was a very busy bank holiday weekend, the Bruce Springsteen concert was on and the Seville festival... so all hotels were booked up. I think they just took a chance that we would have to stay there anyway, so we're so happy we found a room somewhere else. ",1,2023,05,03
47,Shocking!,"Currently staying here. The hotel is on a nice location and the roof top bar and pool are great BUT there is a a HUGE BUT. The receptionist at check-in super unfriendly. The service needs huge improvement and there seems to be lack of management and procedure. We asked at the main bar of food is served upstairs on the roof top and they said yes. When we went to the rooftop we were told that no food is served by a very angry man working behind the bar, in fact the only guy working behind the bar. We then had to go down again and ask, after which food was brought to us up on the roof top. After we had our lunch the same angry man came to tell us that we shouldn’t be eating food here and this is very bad. We tried to explain that the food was brought to us by his colleagues and he should speak to them and not shout at us. He said I don’t care if they gave you the food, “I am the boss here!”! Every day we have been here there is only one man working behind the bar, the waiting time to order a drink is long and everyone seems pissed off that you bother them. There is no waiter, no one to ask for towels etc. This is not a 4 star hotel, 3 maybe. Attention to detail is needed! There is no consideration to the customer at all. Quite shocking for a 4 star hotel situated in a major European city. To the manager: please don’t respond to me with a standard response. More than this is needed here!",3,2023,04,29
47,"Great hotel, recommend it!","Loved this hotel, its staff and the accomodation. Good location near Montjuic. Metro right nexto The hotel.

47,Good experience,"We had a good experience here! Staff were very friendly. Sara at the reception helped us in with our booking. She was lovely and helpful. 

They have a nice roof top swimming pool. Very close to the city centre and major attractions. Everything was few metro stops away and the hotel is located right outside Espanya Metro and it’s facing one of the major attraction - Mont Montjuic. Lovely stay ;)  ",5,2023,04,09
47,really good hotel in great location,"excellent service ,really good location to see the concert. great shopping centre very close with good restaurants, also supermarket and lots of other shops nearby. Would definately come back, got upgraded to better room as a member of catalonia reward scheme",5,2023,03,27
47,If you like heat - this is the place,"Room was clean and well adorned.  However on arrival to the room, and not before, obvious that the room was unbearably hot due to no air circulation nor working temperature controls. It was 30C+ in the room.  On return to lobby to request assistance was told this was the norm, and to open the window to relieve the temperature issue.  Window was open all night and only by morning was it 25-26 C, after a sleepless night laying on top of the bed covers.  Late arrival and early departure made finding another hotel, and the no-refund within 24 hours issue, disruptive and little option.  Hotel staff did not make customer aware of the issue before signing in, much less while booking, and hotel staff offered NO effective solution on direct complaint, offering no other solution.",1,2023,03,24
47,Great experience all round,"First time in Barclelona. Great experience from start to finish. Check in easy. Staff really helpful. Bed was big and comfy, and our room was quiet too. Breakfast had loads of choice. Metro station is outside so easy access for any travel around city. 

",5,2023,03,22
47,"Good Hotel, rooms need modernization",Pretty good hotel overall. The updates to the bar in the lobby and breakfast area are very welcome. Pool has a great view from the rooftop. But the rooms badly need to be updated to be more modern. You can tell they are dated. Plus my shower always leaks onto the floor. But overall a decent hotel with typically good service.,4,2023,03,09
47,Mixed review - good and bad stuff,"The good:
The hotel has a very good location and access to metro, public transportation.
It has a shopping center next to it.
Very good service and breakfast.
The bad: 
Old room and beds, needs renovation.
Acoustics are not good, you can hear every single noise from other rooms.",3,2023,03,03
47,Surprises at every turn,"My group has stayed here before and this trip was a very disappointing experience. Slow unstable internet, heating system inadequate (only heats to 19c, some couldn’t get it below 26C ), barely warm showers, many in my group had to change rooms. ",1,2023,02,06
47,Avoid,"Under construction trade show rip off!

Forced to book though the Fira ‘s hotel cartel B3 who triple the normal rate of a room anywhere in Barcelona.
Day 1 no hot water ,
Day warm water 
Day 3 boiling or freezing only.
Here for another few nights year and can’t wait to get off. Internet stops and starts and can’t manage two things at once.
Rooms are tired and broken- my door was open after cleaning due to a damaged lock. You may be lucky and arrive to find Pubic hairs , you may not!
Breakfast was in a basemen, no egg station, just fried. All my staff were give rooms with x2 singles regardless - rate was €270 a night !!!",1,2023,01,31
47,Avoid this hotel,"Not a 4-star hotel, and struggling to be a 3-star hotel. Reception area under construction, so “lobby” was truly lame during my visit. Reception has max of 2 people working at any time, to service all guest needs, so expect long waits for everything. Breakfast was lame - definitely go to one of the nearby restaurants. Toilet paper holder was broken in room. Room service trays stayed in halls for multiple days (gross). I stayed on 6th floor in “executive” room and the only positive thing I have to say is that the metro is very convenient.",2,2023,01,29
47,Very enjoyable stay,"I stayed in this lovely hotel twice last year and I can not wait until my third visit in February.  This is in a great location, near a shopping centre and public transport.  The rooms are comfortable and Cristina, the reception manager, was very obliging with any requests I had.  For example, I have Fibromyalgia and I asked for extra pillows and they brought me what I needed.",5,2023,01,27
47,Barcelona,"Good place, lots of food, shopping...
A bit pricey, hotels on Las Ramblas are bit overrated.
Easy walking from Sagrada to Las Ramblas.
No comparison to Portugal in terms of people or sites, though..................",4,2022,12,04
47,Convenient but average hotel,"Average hotel that is undergoing some renovation. The breakfast is held in a conference hall.
It is a big hotel, my room is far away from the lift and in need of some upgrades to the room. The location is decent with lots of public transportation around. Next to it is the ""Bull Ring"" shopping center.  
It is very popular with groups, maybe because of the affordable rates.     ",3,2022,12,03
47,Serious Health & Safety problems with little to no help from managers,"I entered room 346 and within less than ~10 minutes a large bathroom mirror fell off the wall which I was standing in front of less than 1 minute earlier.

Just imagine if I or a child or an elderly or vulnerable person was hit by this mirror and injured (or worse) by shards of glass.

All staff did was clean the mess up leaving shards still on the bathroom sink surface area, which I cleaned (see photos, also have video).

I requested another room as this room was clearly not safe, the reception staff offered to downgrade me …seriously, how poor is that!

I requested thay refund the organisation I work for who had paid for the room and the managers refused to give me a decision, they basically ignored me with a smile!

I contacted their CEO, Guillermo Vallet who unsurprisingly also ignored my contact.

The organisation I work for will not be booking within this hotel group again.

This hotel should not be graded 4-star, it is 3-star at best.  Their managers only work daytimes, meaning no hotel staff are prepared to help any guests without their approval, but even when you discuss a problem you will simply get a warm smile and then you will be ignored!

The hotel management are thin vaneered at best, lacking in integrity, take this review as factual and do not schedule any visits that include staying within the Catalonia Hotels & Resorts chain if health and safety are important to you.",1,2022,11,27
47,Sehr netter und aktiver Service n der Rezeption….insbesondere Lucy,"It was a great selection book the Hotel again.
Including diverse Work activities that you don’t recognition the reception service  always found solution to make us happy. So if I will stay another time in Barcelona I will book it again. Special thanks to Lucy! Great job",4,2022,11,22
47,"Great location, great view and friendly staff",Very centrally located with public transportation right outside of hotel; great view of Plaza Espanya from room and beautiful view of city at roof top (try sunset time); staff was very friendly and helpful.,4,2022,11,21
47,"Clean rooms, great buffet","I stayed in room 353 which was located just across from the elevators. I thought, Hmm will this be noisy - NOPE. Nice and quiet. The room was spacious and clean. The buffet was great, typical international hotel buffet, lunch meats, cheeses, cereals, eggs, sausages, rolls, fruit, etc. something for everyone.",5,2022,11,20
47,great location in Barcelona,"great location in Barcelona. close to Fira conference and as well close to the main city center. equipped with rooftop pool and bar. fitness center and health spa.
friendly service and very clean.
currently their main lobby is under reconstruction (Noc 2022).",5,2022,11,11
47,Amazing Hotel,"Stayed a couple of days in this hotel, had an amazing room with great view in all directions. Very friendly staff, easy check-in process. 

Hotel is close to the Metro and a big shopping center, also 24 hour SuperMarket close.

The hotel has an fantastic Roof Top Bar with a great view over Plaza Espana. 

Breakfast is good, lot to choose from, helpfull staff.

Highly recommend this hotel for a stay in Barcelona short or long.",5,2022,11,06
47,MISSING MY SHOES,"I stayed for 5 days at this Hotel , Everthing was OK, but the last day I realise that there is no high heel shoes which stayed 4 days on the floor same place!  When I asked for help from the receptionist, the girl even look at my face! !  They may put into the trash or they may take it but the point is hotel responsible does not take it seriously..",3,2022,11,04
47,Would not recommend,"On a six-city tour of Spain ending in Barcelona, I was required by the tour company to stay in this hotel; it was the worst of the entire trip. The phones on the entire first floor did not work; I could not call for room service, the front desk, housekeeping or any other hotel services. For bedding, all the was provided was a sheet on the bed with a blanket in the closet (who knows when it was last cleaned). this was the only hotel that did not have any outlets next to the bed. The only (1) outlet in the bedroom area was under the desk on the other side of the room. The bathroom tub/shower combo was high and outdated with a public restroom toilet. On the first floor (and perhaps higher), you could hear/feel the vibrations of the metro underneath early in the morning before you were ready to wake up. The only thing good about the hotel was the rooftop bar and the Mediterranean restaurant. I would never stay again or recommend to a friend.",3,2022,10,26
47,"not bad, not good","Besides of the great location, i would not recommend. The rooms are quite old, the hotel does not comply with the 4*. No socket near the bed, just 2 near the tv. The services we asked for were not accomplished.",3,2022,10,24
47,Bring your own lights and earplugs!,"This is the noisiest hotel I've ever stayed in.  Floors in rooms and public spaces do not have carpets but fake wood which results in the areas being loud. The breakfast room was terribly noisy.  We were on the 7th floor and every few minutes there would be a loud machine groaning noise. This continued through the night but not as often. We couldn't figure out what it was since the room was not close to the elevator.  Desk clerk didn't know what I was talking about when I complained.  ""Junior room"" had poor lighting in the bathroom and the room itself. If hotels want to use new light bulbs they need to add more lights. Women need to have good lighting to put on their make-up and do their hair! The light in the shower was so dim I couldn't even take a photo of it. A stool and scale were provided - why? Facial tissue package only held 4 pieces.  Also included were wood toothbrushes, wood comb, shower cap, bar soap for face, liquid soap, shampoo, conditioner were in large bottles.  Shower had a ""rain"" shower head and a hand-held shower wand.  Funny that they use a shower head that wastes water but then use lighting that is almost non-existent.  Floor was missing chunks and the laminate on the desk was separated from the desk in several places. Also provided: robes. slippers, hair dryer, iron, ironing board, coffee maker, safe, one bottle of water, fridge. Blackout drapes. Air conditioning worked well. Luggage rack collapses to the floor. Staff was nice and helpful. Breakfast was good with a nice selection.  Hotel is 12 minutes from the airport.",2,2022,10,20
47,"Great view, clean rooms, friendly staff",Fantastic hotel with a very convenient location. All the staff were super friendly - room was very clean and had a beautiful view.  In room fridge was nice. The staff and their friendly service really made this a special stay and I’d certainly book again. The view from the rooftop pool and bar can’t be beat and is better than the view from the Arena next door. Reasonably priced drinks at the pool bar and fantastic service with a smile from Peter.,5,2022,10,14
47,AN EXCELLENTLY LOCATED AND COMFORTABLE PROPERTY,"After a hectic and botched up travel (by the travel booking company called KLOOK)  from Paris, reached from the Airport at night at this property. It hardly took 15 minutes from the Airport by Airport bus to alight at the crossing right in front of this hotel..so convenient. The property may not have given us the initial look and feel of a 4 Star property, but it all vanished once we entered our room. It was good, comfortable and good size even by European standards (space was even better than the new hotels like Marriott, Hyatt, Radisson etc in my country). The cleanliness was excellent and so were the amenities. Breakfast — lots of choice and sumptuous. Did not try other meals as were spoilt for choices in Barcelona being a touristy place. Had to shift to nearby hotel as this was fully booked for other days. All in all, our experience was excellent for a two day stay here.",5,2022,10,09
47,Great location easy to get to from the airport.,"We stayed at the Catalonia Barcelona Plaza
October 3 rd to 7th 2022. 
We stayed on the second floor. The room was perfectly fine. Big bed. Bath. Fridge. TV and clean. 
The windows were very good at blocking out the sound from the road but the plumbing was very noisy. If next door flushed or ran a bath it disturbed us. The Hotel is lovely. Staff very helpful when needed. The pool on the 8th floor was fabulous to visit after a day site seeing we enjoyed coming back about 3 or 4 and have a relaxing couple of hours on the terrace sunbathing and drinking cocktails. The music was not great though. The location of the hotel is the best. It was a 12 minute bus ride from the airport. Bus A2. It has a shopping centre right next door with a supermarket on the ground floor and lovely restaurants on the very top. And it was a great location to walk and see the sites. There are a lot of road work’s happening at the moment. 
A negative and one you need to keep your wits about you are all the locals wizzing about on the electric scooters. 
We had a lovely time and would recommend this hotel.",5,2022,10,08
47,Excellent hotel,"This hotel is on Plaza Espana. It is 10min taxi ride from the airport if you do not want to use public transport. It sits above several Metro lines. If you are here to attend a congress at the Congress centre, this is probably the nearest and best hotel to stay at.
My room was large, well equipped, quiet and was on the 5th floor.
Breakfast is served in a huge room, rather different in character from the rest of the hotel. There is lots of choice and lots of room.
The place is spotless.
I have nothing negative to say and will gladly stay here again.",5,2022,10,07
47,"Excellent, as ususal!","Location is perfect for business travellers. Close to train station and airport.It is in a shopping area so is plenty of shops, restaurants and bars.
Rooms are confortable, clean and big enough to work and rest.
The staff are absolutely professional.
So...what else?",5,2022,09,27
47,Super lovely hotel,"Very good stategic place for shopping in Barcelona where you are near All Brand Zara , desigual , C&A and all other brand and it’s clean and safe place and also staff are so friendly and helpful and price is very good compared to others and also near a bus station",4,2022,09,26
47,Great Floor 7 Upwards,"This is a tricky review to write, because I had two terrible days here and three great ones.

To start with, location: the hotel is on the Plaza Espanya. This is very busy with traffic, but there are plentiful taxis here and a metro nearby which make travel around the city very easy. The noise and bustle is more than compensated for the view of the Font Monumental, the Venetian Towers and the Montjuïc Palace. 

Reception is large, busy and friendly with English spoken fluently. Check in was quick and uncomplicated.

Now to the problem. I had booked a double room, and was told to find it in floor 3. The room stank of cigarettes; the kettle leaked (creating alarming puddles underneath the TV); the chair was too low for the desk space; there was a hair in my tea cup; my double bed was two separately made up single beds pushed together; and in the morning I awoke to the sound of my neighbour shouting randomly. The view was great, but the room was probably one of the worst I have stayed in this decade.

I went and got an upgrade to a junior suite, which was to my surprise only c£25 per night more expensive than the ‘double’ I had booked. And what a difference! You take a different lift to floors 7 upwards, and it is genuinely like a different hotel. The rooms are clean, light and modern and a totally different experience to downstairs. 

So it’s 2 stars for my first room, and 4 stars for my second room and the location. I would stay here again, but only if I got the right room.",3,2022,09,25
47,"Really Nice Hotel , deserves more than 4 stars","When i booked this hotel it was for the location based on an event i was attending over the Plaza Espana. I was sceptical about the quaity of a 4 star hotel after all see bad 5 star hotels where we live in Marbella. 
But i have been really pleasantly surprised on all fronts.
The Suite i stayed in was enormous with seperate lounge, bedroom , beautoful bathroom and additional guest toilet. Nicely appointed all over and very comfy bed with great views over the plaza.
The room was on 9th floor , only one floor down is the pool terrace which is very nice pool and seating areas. The only comment is that the three days i am here they close part of it for private events but wasnt too much of a problem. The food menu at the pool bar needs to have more choice.

The Japanese restaurant in the hotel is a real find, great food, great prices.
Breakfast buffet well appointed and sufficient choice, fresh orange juice making machine is a pleasant surprise.

Overall very happy with the hotel, location excellent also right next to Arena Mall . Would come back again for sure.

One thing i noticed , it woudl be very easy for non guests or people with bad intentions to enter the hotel, easily go up to the floors and pool area, there is no key card needed for the elevator. This is an issue i woudl think the hotel should look into to make it a safer venue.",5,2022,09,22
47,Lovely hotel in a great location,Great hotel and the location is perfect for getting around Barcelona. Amazing views from the 8th floor bar and the fountain display was an added bonus. We will definitely stay here again when we are next in the city,5,2022,09,20
47,"Location, Location, Location","This hotel gets my 5 points for its location, bang on Plaza Espana with the metro and bus right outside the door.  It also gets 5 points for the fantastic breakfast buffet.
The rooms are starting to get a bit dated, bathrooms might need updating but they were clean and served their purpose.  I also didn't much like the 2 twin beds on wheels instead of a double bed.  Also the safe required a special insert and key which the hotel didn't have enough of for all the rooms so we ended up not using.
Overall I would still highly recommend because the location is so fantastic.",4,2022,09,12
47,The worst exoerience in my life,"I was stolen in the lobby of the hotel! Someone took my backpack while I was in the reception. The employees refused to look at the cameras to identify who took my bag. No one helped me, tried to search for it or even gave me a word or a glass of water. The guys from the reception, Cesar, Erick and a blond lady always cold and rude.
I have traveled for many places around the world but I have never was robbed inside a hotel and received the worst treatment of my life! Avoid this dangerous hotel with cruel people!!!",1,2022,09,08
47,"What can I say? ... Its just ""OK""","As hotels go, its nothing special, no particular USP. The location is pretty good and a great view up the Font Magica  from the roof pool level. Its also very handy for the airport bus (get the local one, not the pricier ones which park outside). The rooms are OK and the shower is good and powerful but the toiletries leave a lot to be desired (who wants a shoe horn these days? ditch them and add some lotion). 
We didnt use the overpriced breakfast as there are so many great eateries nearby (try the Arena next door).
The pool was good but it got very crowded and I suspect a lot of non-guests used it from what I saw. Dont hope to get a sun lounger.
The acid test.... would I stay there again ?  Probably not.",3,2022,08,31
47,I don’t recommend.,"-waiting more than 1hr for the check in 
-thieves entered and stole the bag with documents from some customers 
-room smell like weed 
-doesn’t look like 4 star hotel I would say 1 star 
-completely different from the pics 
-my door room couldn’t open if don’t kick it like really old doors 
-I would never go again",1,2022,08,29
47,Great Location,"We received a wonderful welcome and we’re delighted with our family room on the executive floor. The complementary fruit and bread sticks were a lovely touch. A very spacious room and immaculate en suite shower room. 
The location of the hotel was very convenient for visiting the sites of the city and the views from the rooftop bar are spectacular.
The quality and choice at breakfast was excellent for the number of guests catered for. 
Our room was very clean and had everything we needed. Reception staff were very polite and helpful. We would definitely return.",5,2022,08,25
47,Fountain View Barcelona,"Wonderful location close proximity to airport and also things to do nearby. Nice gym and spa.  They have good shower products, but no lotion which I found lacking when they had other things like dental kit, shower cap, nice towels, etc.  We had a junior suite with bottle of sparkling cava which was a nice touch.  The rooftop restaurant was beautiful, but we couldn’t eat there since we didn’t have a reservation and it was a Tuesday night( plenty of space but lack of staff they told us). We had hoped to watch the fountain show, but it was no show on Tuesday ….this would have been a great view to see it! We would stay here again and hope to use the rooftop pool next time.  Check in was easy and staff were all friendly.",5,2022,08,24
47,Excellent,"Best choice ever.from location to the end of our vacation everything was excellent. Food was super good, the personnel was also amazing  and location is excellent.near to all the main points of attraction and the metro station is exactly in front of the hotel.",5,2022,08,23
47,Disappointed,"I stayed in this hotel for the last 2 nights of a group tour.  I cancelled my reservation for the additional 2 nights I had planned on.  If you are sensitive to smells, you may not want to stay here.  There was a chemical/perfume scent throughout the hotel - including my room and it irritated my throat and nostrils.  The place is giant....many rooms and my room was very far from the elevator.  It's basically like a big corporate nameless faceless hotel.  If you like character and local charm, this is not the place for you.",3,2022,08,22
47,"Substandard Hotel, disappointing","I am not a complainer and usually give the benefit of the doubt but we are currently staying here and I am very disappointed.  The staff at check in were extremely helpful and friendly, which was admirable given how rude the majority of the guests who they were dealing with were, but thats where it ends. When we arrived there were a lot of dodgy looking people hanging outside the hotel which unsettled us.  There is however security on the door all the time.  While I was inputting my card details a lady standing behind me was so close she was almost touching my shoulder,  thankfully the receptionist asked her to step back and give me space.  
The room is not of an acceptable standard for the price of this hotel.  The wooden floor has large gaps  outside the bathroom door where you could easily stub or injur your feet should you walk barefoot.  The door is hanging off the minibar fridge.  The bath is very worn which makes it look really dirty.  On the plus side the room was clean and the air conditioning is very good.  We have a horrible view of the back of the hotel which is a building site.  We were out all day today and when we got back the room had not been serviced.  I asked about this at reception and was told its too late for it to be done now.  I was offered clean towels.  I expressed my disappointment and was told they would see what they can do.  We had a drink in the roof top bar yesterday evening and the service was awful.  Extremely slow,  about 20 minutes wait,  it doesn't seem like you can wait at the bar which I would have been happy to do.  The drinks come in a brown McDonald's type paper cup,  fair enough, we are saving the environment bit just to warn people not to expect a plastic glass.  We moved seats after ordering and I told one bar man who informed me I would have to go up and tell the guy I had ordered from which I did but he followed behind me and repeated what I said.  Why he couldn't tell him and point us out confuses me,  we were within his sight.  In fairness the manageress was flying around tidying up sunbeds and doing her best to help out.  It wasn't excessively busy either.  I have stayed in many, many hotels of various standards,  from hostels to 5 star and I have to say this is one of my most disappointing.  For the price I would have expected much better.  It certainly wouldn't be top of my list for a return visit.",2,2022,08,15
47,Great staff,"My family and I stayed at the Catalonia Plaza hotel for 4 nights. Everything was great, our rooms were comfortable and the breakfast was worth it, but what we valued the most was the treatment received by the staff. They helped us a lot, especially Silvia, who answered all our questions and was very patient with us.",4,2022,08,15
47,Great,"Couldn't be more pleased. Good location if you want to experience both FC Barcelona and tourist attractions. Great breakfast, pool and room. Friendly staff that helped us with everything we wanted. We recommended this hotel for everyone who wants a nice stay i Barcelona",5,2022,08,15
47,Hjk,"We like this hotel-Catalonia Barcelona plaza.the staff was very generous ,specialy SILVIA-she help us very much.she was wonderful
Nekt time to Barcelona I will stay in this hotel-definitely.and I will recommend to my friends",5,2022,08,13
47,"Nice location, ok hotel","Very standard everything: room, breakfast, service. The bar on the top is nice. Nothing wow’ed me, but nothing was either very dissatisfying.
Ok breakfast, worth the money. 
We ordered the room with the view, got 1st floor, not worth the extra money…",3,2022,08,08
47,Unfortunate beginning to our honeymoon!,"Yesterday we checked in to the hotel for our honeymoon (which we did mention in our booking comment). We booked an executive suite with view on the square. Check in was smooth but as we arrived in our room we were met with disappointment. The first thing that hit us was the strong smell of Body odor which made my wife quite nauseous. This reflects badly as it means that the room was not cleaned thoroughly. The second disappointment was that the view of the square was more a view of the road next to the square. We called the front desk to request a simple room change. They offered us another room which was a downgrade from what we initially booked. Then refused to give us a refund. We asked if we could switch rooms the next morning, and they confirmed there would be availability and that we could change to the same style room in the morning, and were quite dismissive with us. This morning we called to confirm the room change and were told that there was no rooms available…contrary from what they told us the night before. We were even willing to pay more for an upgrade and were told that wasn’t possible. We then checked in their own booking website and there was, indeed, rooms still available. We are looking to switch hotels in the middle of our honeymoon because we are so disappointed with this experience. I know a manager is going to just apologize at the bottom of this post, but that doesn’t give us back our once in a lifetime  honeymoon experience.",1,2022,08,08
47,Disaster,"This place was a hot mess, and I would not recommend. First off, our room was not ready until just before 17:00. Once we got in, the AC hardly worked and there was an awful smell coming from the drains in the bathroom (which persisted all five days).
The first day there, my fiancée and I got drinks at the rooftop bar. We became violently ill and blacked-out after just one round of drinks. We are not sure exactly what happened, but from what we could gather, someone put something in our drinks. It was a very scary feeling, especially because they came straight from the bartender to us. I would not trust the drinks there, but I will leave it at that. 
Most of the staff members were completely rude and would question my every move — it felt very discriminatory. One manager rudely asked me why I grabbed a towel on the rooftop at nighttime (when the pool was closed, but rooftop still open). I told her I grabbed it to lay down on the very dirty and stained pool-side beds, and she continued to press me as if that was not a proper reason? That pool was not the cleanest, so make sure you shower afterwards. We also had 100€ stolen from our room during the day while we were out. 
Another situation — the pool ran out of towels, so they told us to use our room towels and request new ones for the room. It took three requests and FIVE HOURS to get towels to our room. 
I will say, despite the nightmares listed above, the location was amazing and the breakfast was above average. The rooftop was beautiful too, other than the dirty pool. Unfortunately our rooftop drink situation made me feel very unsafe, so I would never even consider staying here again for that alone. Please be careful!",1,2022,08,07
47,Great stay at the Catalonia hotel,"Dear All, 
Thank you for making our stay very pleasant. We really enjoyed our time in Barcelona.
The kids and both of us had a great time at your hotel. We enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere, the good location and the fun of the roof top.
A special Thank you to:
- Silvia at réception who has been very helpful, kind and attentive to our needs. 
- Johnny at the Japanese restaurant from Archibald & Co, we had an excellent time and the food was delicious. 
It would be ideal if the pool could open at 7am.
We highly recommend the hotel and the restaurant.
We wish you a good summer.

47,"Great place, amazing view, convenient location",My partner and I had a great time at Barcelona and we were extremely satisfied with the presentation of the room. We purchased a city view of Pl. Espanya and it was absolutely gorgeous to see the magic fountain at night. I absolutely recommend this place!,5,2022,08,03
47,4 Day Break,"We stayed at the Catalonia Plaza for 3 nights. Our first night was uncomfortable due to the air con not working in our room, nor the mini fridge, however staff the next morning were quick to accommodate us in a new room which was much better. The rooms are basic albeit have everything you need. The pool area and bar is fantastic, great atmosphere and friendly staff. César on the front desk was very friendly, always happy to help. Hotel is in a great location, would definitely recommend.",4,2022,08,03
47,Just perfect!,Everything was just great. The hotel and the rooms are so pretty and the view from the room and the rooftop just absolutely wonderful. Silvia was so nice and really helpful and she even gave us an upgrade. The perfect ending to a perfect summer holiday. Thank you so much!,5,2022,08,02
47,"Friendly, Professional Staff in a very good Hotel","We travel a lot to Barcelona and this was the first Time we booked this hotel. The hotel is located on Plaza España and has very good access to everything you need to do and see in Barcelona. The Hotel itself is amazing. The rooftop Terrace so far the beste we had in Barcelona. Big pool, nice ambiance. The rooms are modern, clean with comfy beds. 

The staff was extremely friendly and professional. Big thank to Linda for all the good advice, friendliness and professional care she gave us!",5,2022,08,01
47,Poor service,Having to constantly ask for coffee etc for the room and toilet roll. Asked for an iron but they don’t have ironing boards ! Poorly trained staff. Lifts not all working. Pool day beds have now canopies as shown and advertised on website ,1,2022,07,29
47,Greates hotel ever,"Hotel is so nice and big, the swimming pool área is awesome and its súper clean everywhere, the recepción persons are extreemly nice and where very helpfull regarding places to see and places to eat.

I had dinner at the Kurai ( japanese) restaurant at the hotel and was amazing, one of the best ones i have ever traed.",5,2022,07,25
47,For the tourist in YOU,"This is a tricky review to write.  On one hand, the hotel met nearly none of my expectations as a business traveler.  But if your expectations are different, if might work well for you. So when I book a 4-star hotel in a major city it creates some expectations.  Traveling for business creates more of them.  If I could sum this hotel up in one word, it would be “tourist.”  Hence, if you are a tourist and like a rooftop deck with many other tourists, a really nice view, and are ok with the attention to detail of the hotel not being super great, then it might be good for you.  The location is really good for tourism.  Lots of nearby stuff and excellent access to public transit.  For a business traveler it’s less than ideal.  It’s a pretty impressive Mid-century building with an interior that matches, but otherwise it falls down a bit.  Back to the 4-star.  In such a hotel I expect things like maybe a bathrobe/slippers for the wooden floors.  Attention to the lack of toilet paper in the bathroom.  A bar somewhere in the hotel that is not the rooftop tourist-atorium with wine in plastic cups and 20-somethings floating in the pool half-hammered.  I know, I sound like a cranky old person.  I’m not—just picky when I fly 12 hours.  Seriously, the hotel has no interior bar where business travelers can work and talk about why they came to Barcelona in the first place.  Serious kudos to not having single-use plastics in the shower, but the trick is that you have to fill up the pump containers (hint to management).  The a/c worked well during this miserable heat wave, but I was forced out into the streets to find a bar where I could type this review :)  The rooms are fine.  But just fine.  Not 4-star fine.  No bedside water bottles.  And yes, Barcelona’s tap water is excellent to drink, but it tastes like sh#t.  Everyone single person knows this.  There should be more water for the guests of a 4-star during a heat wave (maybe they have a whole house filter in which case I retract this snark, but they should let guests know that with a little sign—back to the attention to detail). Reception staff was pleasant and professional. Did I mention it’s a great location for tourists?  Seriously, the hotel should really, really be a solid 3-star.  When I compare it to my usual Barcelona go-to, the H10 series, it really comes up short.  I think this is mostly due to insufficient training, lack of attention to detail, not really knowing how to create a 4-star stay, or maybe just catering to a different clientele—and that part is fine.  The mistake is mine, not theirs.  Will I be back?  Of course not.  Should a tourist with a hankering for a rooftop bar/pool, super easy access to tourist stuff, and who doesn’t really expect a detailed 4-star experience stay there? Absolutely—-go for it.",2,2022,07,15
47,Stay at Catalonia,"100% positive feedback. Good atmosphere, clean, great location, swimming pool at the roof top as well as the gym get's 100 points. The only thing that can be approved is the start time of the great breakfast. Missed the second day because of a flight I had to get.",5,2022,07,14
47,Great experience & Carmen was so accommodating! Will be back for sure,"Loved the experience from the very start, Carmen was so accommodating and helpful! The view from the terrace is amazing! There is a gym on the 7th floor as well. The interior is very nice. We will come back for sure.",5,2022,07,13
47,Amazing Hotel but even more amazing treatment,"The welcoming was over the top and Carmen did an amazing job! First time in this hotel and won’t be the last for sure.

Very good Location and terrace and Plaza de Espana views. Very good quality for the price",5,2022,07,13
47,Friends 50th Birthday,"The Service was absolutely stunning. The Roof top terrace with the pool is a wonderful place to relax and enjoy. Nice crowd of people. 

The hotel is a good spot to start a day tour in Barcelona. I will come back with friends again to enjoy more of this wonderful place",5,2022,07,11
47,A break with friends,"Lovely hotel and well positioned in Barcelona. The hotel was nice and clean and the rooms were good. The bar on the roof is excellent with a view and pool but the prices varied depending on what staff were working, even though there was a menu with prices on - we were told the prices were wrong on day one then day two they were as they should be. We didn’t eat in the hotel other than at the pool bar, the menu could be better but was ok for snacks (chips, pizza). We got a taxi to most places although there’s plenty within walking distance.",4,2022,06,26
47,Stolen and mistreated inside the hotel!,"We (me and my 2 sons of 7 and 9 years old) were booked in this hotel for an International Football Competition in FC Barcelona.  Some things happened during our stay (6 nights stay), like receiving the visit of the hotel manager with a security person at 9pm in our room to question why we did not make the check out (this happened in the 4 night) even though he made our checkin! Also the room service personnel was extremely unpleasant. But the worst is yet to come... On the checkout day we did the checkout and left our stuff with the hotel (was the last tournament day).  Around 4pm we picked up our luggage and we were waiting for our cab in the hotel lobby.  I walked 5 metres max from our luggage to the balcony to ask a question and when I came back my bag with all documents (pass, IDs, insurance cards), money (credit cards and money), laptop, iPad, jewerly, and and and) had disappeared. I started to search everywhere, asked for the help of the staff and they just looked at me and said i could not leave the luggage unattended. There was a recording camera that I asked to see and they said just the police could see it.  I asked help for someone from the staff to go with me to the police (that was vis a vis the hotel) as I do not speak well the Spanish and they said they could not do it (with 6 people at the reception desk). I was nervous and with 2 small boys without any document and no money and the hotel personal just mistreated me the way they could.  And the most impressive is that my phone was charging at the same place and 2 other personal bags where together with the stolen one...  How could the thief know precisely the bag to take?? So please, do not stay in this hotel! I hope FCBarcelona (and I wrote them) do not make any negotiation with this hotel anymore.  Signed: Vanessa Huenerwadel from Switzerland",1,2022,06,23

47,"Excellent, however bad internet","Everything good. Perfect communication to airport, city centre 30mins of walking or 5-10 minutes public transport. Very nice gym, pool, and the room was super modern and clean. No noise from the big street. Friendly staff. They also took good care of our room when we weren’t there.

Things to improve: the wifi was not good at all, only sometimes. And better air condition in the gym would be nice.

Thank you",5,2022,06,10

47,WORST EXPERIENCE DO NOT STAY HERE,"DO NOT STAY HERE PLEASE LISTEN AND READ OUR REVIEW.
We planned to stay here for 2 nights in June, we booked this in April for a reasonable price.
Unfortunately on the 2nd our flight was cancelled due to ongoing problems in the UK. We contacted hotels.com who contacted the hotel and confirmed it was ok to check in the day after on the 3rd. We arrived finally at 20 to midnight on the Friday after multiple delays and uncertainty over 24 hours after we were meant to arrive. 4 people were on the front desk when we arrived and no one seemed to bat an eyelid, there were not customers waiting, eventually Juan served us. He asked for our passports and spent a while looking at his computer to tell us there was no booking in my name. I explained what had happened and showed him the booking confirmation on my phone, which said in big green letters ‘your booking is guaranteed’ he said there was no booking tonight or the night before and there was a mistake with hotels.com the site we used. We showed him the messages on the platform which confirmed it was ok to check in on the 3rd. Juan clearly thought we were idiots and had no care for our custom, he made no effort to resolve the problem, explain where the issue had arisen or give us any form of compassion. The service comprised of us, 2 young girls waiting in the lobby after over 24 hours of travel, no communication or acknowledgment from the front desk for spaces of 5 to 10 minutes then being told sorry there’s no booking. Juans colleague was there he wouldn’t even speak to us or make eye contact just raised his voice and pointed at the screen which we couldn’t see. The colleague eventually said there had been no bookings from hotels.com that night or the night before and we had never made the booking, even though we had the reservation clearly on my phone with confirmation. This went on for about 30 mins until they arranged for a room for us, €307 for one night which was only €100 cheaper than what we had arranged for 2 nights, this was not in our price range, especially as we would sleep at 1am then get up the next day to check straight out. We had no choice, left in the centre of Barcelona with no other options at the morning quickly arriving. We paid for the room and we’re told, Christina the manager would start at 7.30 the next morning and she would resolve this for us. The whole interaction with the staff that night was demeaning, cold and unfriendly. We were not helped with bags to our room. The next morning at 8.30 we arrive at the front desk to speak to javier, he tells us Christina doesn’t work on weekends and she would not be here, he was aware of our issue and we should come back at 11 when the reception manager would arrive. We then went for breakfast and the first comment is ‘breakfast is not included’. This hotel is a soulless establishment, built from a staff of cold and rude employees with no care for their customers and especially no care for young women’s safety. We came back at 11.30 to give the member of staff time to start their shift, we checked out, paid for breakfast and finally the reception manager arrived, I cannot remember his name but he was by far the stand out in the display of poor customer service. It took about 10 minutes for them to see the emails I had sent with evidence of our booking and also confirmation from the website that we could check in on the 3rd. The reception manager launched into a hugely embarrassing performance telling us that we are silly to believe a correspondent for saying we should be able to check in on the 3rd, and would we believe a customer service employee if they told us he would pay out of his own pocket? He smirked the entire time as I was reduced to tears in the front desk in front of 30 plus people after 24 hours of travelling and no sleep, he made sure to back up his accusations with hand gestures, smirks and laughs. We felt so unsafe, unwelcome and scared that night as young women. We would not wish this on anyone.",1,2022,06,04
47,"Location, location, location","Centrally located. Easy access to everything: Expo 1929 Palace and fountains, Montjuic castle and grounds. Great restaurants and cafes within easy walking distance. Don't miss the freshly-squeezed orange juice for breakfast and the custom made omelets.",5,2022,06,02
47,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza hotel,"The hotel reside by espanya square, The metro is right in front the entrance of the hotel which makes it very convenient, The staf of the hotel are very friendly and weloming and allways happy to assist.",5,2022,05,29
47,Dissatisfied,"The hotel is beautiful, clean and in a great location.  I rarely complain about anything, however, the young lady who checked us in said, ""oh, and your breakfast is included!""  This is not something I expected because normally I don't elect this unless it's automatic because I prefer the flexibility to have breakfast somewhere else.  And usually larger hotel breakfasts are expensive.  There were four of us in our party, and since it was ""included"""" we went down every morning to take advantage of breakfast.  When we checked out however we learned it was NOT included and we were charged $20 for each person per day.  We explained the mistake to the front desk person, but he said he could not help us.  Unfortunate.  We won't return to this property.",3,2022,05,27
47,Good Location,"Very good location for touring Barcelona. next to Metro, Airport bus station, Magical fountain, Montjuic Castle, plenty of food outlets and shopping. Only setback is the loud noise from air-con from room (maybe only my room).",4,2022,05,19
47,Could and should be better,"This has all the capabilities of being an awesome hotel, half of the rooms are fairly old and outdated, the new ones are much nicer on the upper floors. Food and Beverage could be better as could the terrible wifi. ",3,2022,05,16
47,Great hotel,"Fantastic service from the ladies on reception, I arrived very early and they were able to accommodate an early check in. 

Great hotel in a fantastic position in the heart of the city. There is a roof top bar on the 8th floor with a swimming pool. 

Would recommend for business or pleasure.",5,2022,05,13
47,"Perfect location, great breakfast, lovely staff","This hotel is perfect for private and business travel. Very close to the airport, metro station in front of the hotel. Fabulous breakfast buffet with omelette station and freshly squeezed oj. The staff has been very friendly and supportive in all aspects of our event. Definitely will be back!",5,2022,05,10
47,Easy Access!,Walking distance to the fair (Fira Barcelona) and all main tourist atractions. Silent rooms! Nice gym with a view! Rooftop pool with a bar. Friendly and serviceminded staff. Five (5) plus in my books!,5,2022,04,25
47,Great location with a beautiful rooftop bar.,"Short stop from the airport. Airport shuttle stops in front of the hotel and there is also a metro right in front of the entrance. Great location, beautiful hotel with a nice rooftop bar overlooking the city. Very friendly staff an overall great experience at this hotel.",5,2022,04,21
47,Poor hotel,Stayed for 3 nights in April. The rooftop pool was filthy and had 5 glass bottles floating around in it. The aircon for the entire building didn't work and the rooms were unbearably hot. To finish it off there is a strange loud bass sound that goes off every minute or so from 7am lasting all day that can be heard from most rooms. Wouldn't recommend.,2,2022,04,15
47,Best hotel in Barcelona,"The best Hotel in BCN City, coming every time I'm visiting....from the desk the experience is amazing. Room size, the cleaness, confort, services, breakfast, location....  Mentioning the personal from at reception they're always very helpful and nice.",5,2022,04,14
47,"Great location, needs some maintenance","Excellent location with Metro entrance just outside the hotel, lots of restaurants at the shopping centre across the road, easy to walk to the Magic Fountain. 
Breakfast buffet was reasonable with a good selection/variety.
The rooftop area was very nice but still too cool to get full benefit when we visited in April, the bar was not open and pool too chilly to swim in!
We stayed in a family suite — parents and 14 year old. The suite was a bit on the small side for the price and there were lots of small things that indicated a lack of attention to property maintenance. The flooring had slipped in a few places leaving gaps, one of the TV’s had a distorted image, batteries in one remote were not working, doorstop had come off allowing the suite door to hit the wardrobe door when opening it. The top bunk sloped down and creaked alarmingly, and the ladder to the top bunk was cracked in places so teenager slept on the lower bunk. Not sure I would trust the safety of the top bunk especially for a teen or adult.
Overall for the (not insubstantial) price I would have expected a better room size and quality.",3,2022,04,11
47,My  Stay in Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,"My experiences as i stay in Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, Miss Cristina in the front deck she so nice and dose her job perfectly, most of the staff need to be upgrade by going for training, the ladies that keep the room don't clean the room well,  The food need to be continental, this is my 2nd time staying in the hotel they need to have a different types of food i did not enjoy the food",3,2022,04,10

47,"Great quick service, easy access to airport for short stays","Had a superior terrace room and this was one of the most spaced out rooms I’ve had. Double shower head that both sprayed! And huge shower and inviting tub. Terrace had views of the pool but it was raining and we got in late. Separate elevators for higher floors and well located near restaurants, sights and easy drop off from the aerobus if you’re taking it. Wish I had more time
 In this room, and would repeat if in the area. Only cons are it’s a little noisy random water noises and inconsistent sounds. And the toiletries are very manly smelling so women bring your own. Spoil yourself and upgrade your room if you choose this area to base in BCN, as it’s a little further but still accessible by metro to get to the main sights and streets, just not in all the action.",4,2022,03,20
47,Absolutely the worst hotel ever stayed,"Did not want to write this review but just cannot help myself. 

Booked this hotel because it was rated as fabulous on Booking. Payed 3000 EUR for 7 nights but that is a big mistake. The room is dirty, noisy. They just don't vaccume clean everyday. We even found a broken condom left under the bed from previous guests!! 

The hotel says the room is with air conditioning. What a lie. When we arrived, the room was too hotel and the air conditioning was making strange loud noise. Complained to the reception and we were told that there was no air conditioning but only heating. 

The service is terrible. Reception does not answer the phone.

Again some of the comments on Booking said the room is sound proof. What a fake news. Our room is definitively not sound proof at least. You could clearly hear the noise from the corridor and the lift.

All in all, it is the worst hotel experience I have had. I worked in the hotel industry before. The hotel has four-star and I really wonder how they could have that. Such a bad experience, never again.",1,2022,03,04
47,Amazing hotel,"I liked everything about the hotel. 
The friendliness of the staff, the spacious room, the incredible views and the terrace, unbelievable
the pleasant smell felt in all spaces, the elevators with touch buttons, the common spaces, everything was very good",5,2022,02,20
47,Amazing views and great location,"This hotel was perfect for our 2 night stay in Barcelona 
We had a room with a view of the beautiful fountain outside 
Easy to get around metro is right outside 
Nice walk up to Barcelona ground if you are going for football 
Breakfast wasn't the best but my partner is a fussy eater for me it was fine they had eggs, pancakes and plenty of fruit and yogurts.",4,2022,02,15
47,Great choice for Fira Barcelona,"It is a very convenient option for Fira Barcelona events, standing at the opposite side of Plaza de España -and at the same time, a short taxi or metro ride to all the tourist attractions.  
The hotel is stylish, although kind of dated, with spacious and comfortable rooms, with all the necessary amenities. Breakfast was notably hearty, with plenty of variety, and the service was efficient and helpful. 
Overall, it was a satisfying short stay, and it is certainly one of the options I would consider when back to Barcelona.",4,2022,01,26
47,Great location with fantastic views of the city,"We stayed in the Suite on the 10th floor - is a beautifully appointed apartment with a separate lounge room, beautiful bathroom and the bed is HUGE.

We only stayed one night but the staff we interacted with were all very friendly and efficient.

The views are outstanding and to wake up on a sunny morning as the Barcelona skyline emerges into the sunshine is quite something to behold.

Personally I think for the quality it is great value too.

Only about a 15min taxi ride from the airport and the Espanya TMB Metro station is quite literally outside the front door.",5,2021,11,20
47,Location,"Location is very good, really close to the metro station and airbus.
the room was very hot inside, even in November.
The wifi is not so great, sometimes it does not work.
The lounge is closed for executive rooms.",4,2021,11,15
47,Breathtaking experience,"Our stay in Barcelona was short, business trip. I decided to revisit this hotel, as my first experience was great, and this time was the same - the rooms, breakfast, in general location is very beneficial for various reasons - close to the city center, Barceloneta beach, airport (in just 15 - 20mins by car), parking place, the shopping center Arenas just across the street and beautiful view over the Placa d'Espana, Fira and beautiful fountains.. absolute magic! 
Also, the staff was very kind and professional, especially Lucy! 
Dear Lucy, thank you so much for everything! <3 :)",5,2021,10,30
47,The hotel Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,"Linda she is a very nice woman she help us every day when we were needed something and even when we talk with her a lot it didn’t  bother her and she was so happy to help us with a big smile , She recommended us stunning places in and out of town and even explained to us how to get around and how to get to them",5,2021,10,28
47,"Great Hotel, Terrible Room Service Food","The Catalonia had nice rooms with everything you can imagine, but I was on a business trip, came in tried an hungry and wanted to eat in the privacy of my own room. I ordered a pizza and it was so bad, I couldn't eat it. The bread smelled like it came out of dirty oven and the cheese wasn't even melted. I am glad I ordered a salad, but was already hungry when I showed up at my business event. So I have to give service 1 point for this.. the rest was great.",4,2021,10,25
47,Doesn't worth it,"Pros:
+ Decent location.
+ Large room.
+ Good view from the roof top bar.

Cons:
- I booked a double bed room, and on arrival received two single beds without an opportunity to change my room or do anything about those single beds (some hotels put a cover on two single beds making them a double). Reception was not helpful at all. They were like ""your booking was just a ""request"", and we didn't guarantee you would get a double bed room"", while my booking clearly says ""type of bed: double bed"". That approach doesn't make sense, as if I was aware of getting 2 single beds, instead of a double, I would book my room elsewhere. There are enough alternatives in Barcelona. That seamed to me as a low level scam.
- Issues with door cards. You have to go to reception nearly every day to change your card to enter your room, as they randomly stop working without a reason.
- There are no irons in your room. When I requested one on reception, they were like ""sure, we will bring it"". 1.5 hour later still nothing, as they clearly forgot about it, so I had to go down (no answers to phone calls) to ask again. 15 min later someone knocks my door and brings an iron. I was like ""how about the board?""... The person was like ""erm... We don't have them"". I was like ""really? How am I supposed to iron?"". The person was like: ""ok, ok, I will try to find one"". Only after that I managed to get the full set of an iron + a board.
- There were no sockets next to my bed in my room. At all. #strange
- Most things in the room are pretty out of date. There are lots of marks, scratches, dents, etc. Proper renovation is required.",2,2021,09,28
47,Great hotel,"Great hotel with perfect location. Nothing to complain about. I would highly recommend. The service, staff members are there to help. Breakfast is very rich and tasty. On the 8-th floor you will find the pool and the bar with outstanding view!",5,2021,09,20
47,Amazing Hotel for Holdiay/City Break,"Amazing hotel - Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, just superb. Everything was great couldn’t ask for more. The comfort, the staff, facilities, location, breakfast. Soft and great size beds, cleaniness, the views,
Thank you very much, will be back!!",5,2021,09,06
47,Very nice location.,Excellent hotel and very well located next to  the metro with many places to eat in the vicinity. The staff was friendly and helpful always there to help in any way. The rooms were very nice and mostly quiet. The only problem we experienced (and the reason for a 4 star instead of 5) was the shower. The hand held shower is mounted in the middle of the wall when turned on it pushes the curtain out and floods the bathroom. They need to simply put a mount on either end wall. Taking a shower was a disaster.,4,2021,09,05
47,Good and average hotel,"God and average hotel. Nice team in reception, friendly and very helpful. arrogant team at rooftop bar, got the impression that they didn’t want to help me even though I reach out to them very kindly. To many loud kids at the pool, not family friendly. The hotel addresses to people 18+, and to few sunbeds, not as many as shown in the pictures from their website ",3,2021,08,28
47,a good hotel.,Good price for a good the room and all workers are nice prople. our room was very clean and the recepccion workers are always helping with questions and what to do in such big city. Plaza Espana is a good place for see the city and with all problems of covid we would only stay in such good hotel like catalonia.,4,2021,08,22
47,Trust me find another hotel,"Staff from the reception called Alejo was being very rude towards me and my friend when we told him that the room we just checked in at was dirty. First of, he told us that in his system its clean and we should stay there for the night and tomorrow it will be cleaned up. There was pubes hair everywhere in the toilet... So... We told him that we wanted another clean room and reluctantly he gave us another room that was even more dirty! We went down to the reception again and i told him if this was the cleaning standards we didnt want to stay at the hotel. He replied, that he has never experienced people complaining about their dirty rooms before and asked us if we were trying to get an upgrade. He was being rude, 0 service and now he was accusing us for trying to get a better room. I immediately told him that we did not want to spend our money at this hotel when being spoken to like that and that we wanted to cancel the stay. Worst service and behavior from this guy and really low cleaning standards. Trust me find another hotel.",1,2021,08,12
47,A wonderful experience,"This hotel excedeed our expectations. The room was large, clean, very well soundproofed. Obviously it doesen’t have skipperul and a bathrobe because it is a 4 stars hotel, but otherwise we lacked nothing. Varied breakfest, nice rooftop pool, polite staff. ",5,2021,08,06
47,Bad service,"Our stay at this Hotel has not been a good experience. The room itself was ok. 
The service was not as expected. Our hair dryer did not work, it was exchange only, after when we complained. This happened in the first out of the 10 nights we stayed at Catalonia. 
Then later, our minibar started to break down and the inside light was blinking constantly through the whole night (annoying when we have to sleep) We announced this at the reception when we returned home the next afternoon. 
Here, we were told in a rough tone that we should had reported it first thing in the morning. Maintenance came to our room and fixed the light on the minibar, but was not fixed properly since the minibar started not to cool down the drinks. The door knob in our bathroom could not be locked. Once again, you sent maintenance to fix it , but in vain, was not done properly, still we had trouble locking the bathroom door. We constantly had to request toilet paper, as the cleaning stuff did not fill it up as they supposed to, just as they did not fill up the minibar as well. We were forced to buy our own drinks such as water, soda, beer and more in the supermarket. The cleaning stuff did not remove the empty bottles, cans out of the room when cleaning, so we put it out ourselves and leaving outside by the door. 

It has been the worst service, we have ever experienced on our holiday.
",1,2021,07,27
47,Limited facilities,"Visited this hotel last week. The sun loungers shown have all been removed and there are about 6 day beds which are very close  together. Not sure how there could be a good choice of food as per previous review as all the restaurants apart from the breakfast one are closed! You have to wear gloves to use the breakfast buffet. The rooftop has some lovely japanese tapas but there are only a few tables so you may wish to book prior to arrival. It is on the 8th floor and on the night we visited it was very windy.

When we arrived we had to ask about whether the restaurants were closed. They confirmed room service was available but did not inform us that the only menu was at reception!

We had a terrace which was lovely but at times very windy. We were supposed to have access to the executive lounge but this was also closed. The hotel did not inform us of this until we asked. We were told we could have soft drinks free of charge from the minibar but needless to say we were charged at checkout and had to have this removed.

It is a difficult time for hotels but it is important that you are honest with guests what to expect. There should also be a price adjustment if you are not providing the usual facilities. Vague statements are not acceptable when you are paying premium prices! The location was great and there is a lovely shopping centre across the road with a range of restaurants but the opening times were variable. Abrassame was our favourite    

Make sure you validate you car park ticket at reception",3,2020,07,24
47,Typical plaza,Nothing special typical plaza but good choice of food ! Not ideal for shopping for outsiders  and not much crowded inside but traffic is busy outside.  There were some mini exhibition took place when I visited  ,3,2020,07,05

47,Hotel Catalonia,"This place is clean, which is always my number one concern when staying anywhere. While limited, they offer vegan options at each restaurant they have, and for breakfast. The area seems decent enough, and there are a lot of places nearby to which one can walk. 
As for any negatives, the bed were a bit hard and the bathroom smelled. 
Other than that, no complaints. The staff was also very nice and helped us with any of our needs. ",4,2020,03,08
47,Exellent hotel,"This was our second stay at the Plaza and we are thrilled by the exellent service and kindness of the staff. Professionality all through. Highly recommended. We will return.

47,A great stay at the hotel!The best view!,"With the help of Lucy from reception we had one of our best holidays ever! She has upgraded our suite to another one at the top floors of the hotel that had the MOST amazing view ever! The suite was incredibly big, like a proper apartment, you could have comfort and feel like in your own home, and the views! Every corner of the suite had windows with a different view, including the spacious bathroom where you could relax in the bathtub and view the city! That is comfort for me, especially when you travel with family! I cannot advice more this hotel for my friends that are visiting Barcelona, especially the ones with kids or travelling with family they NEED to take one of these top floor suites! The metro station is at the exit of the hotel, noisy and vibrating centre of the city is at just one stop away, everything is near!! There a shopping centre with restaurants, shops, supermarket, pharmacy, anything you need at the doorstep! And a great breakfast, i loved that everything was fresh and good quality, including toiletries in the bathroom all organic and nice! Great stay, i felt like home!

Rooms are spacious but each one I used suffered from a loud lift shaft or mechanical noise occurring from early morning to night.  
Breakfast is ok, but nothing special. Good location, walking distance to lots of places, but have stayed at better places in BCN",3,2020,02,07
47,"Excellent hotel, but poor internet connection at the room","The hotel is absolutely lovely. Beautiful, good service, thoughtful staff, amazing breakfest. They help you get around in the city and even book the attractions. Internet connection in the room was quite poor. That's the only inconvenient I had.",5,2020,02,05
47,Great hotel,"Location is very convient, hotel is nice, and the rooms are great, and with a great view from 12. floor.

47,Mixed bag,"Friendly staff, nice initial impressions, great breakfast - LOTS of problems during stay; not really suitable for business travel. The rooms are a let down; sink didn't drain, phone didn't work, bath water initially brown when you turn the tap on, door key cards unreliable and need to be replaced with NFC cards, iron can be borrowed at reception but no ironing board (really not good for a business traveler), maintenance staff not working overnight so if you have a problem you have to wait for next day. HOWEVER some really good points too; so I feel bad scalding the hotel.",3,2020,02,03
47,Good Hotel at a central place,Very good Hotel very clean we were there for Barcelona - Granada. In front of hotel metro station from there you can travel for 15€ 48 Hours very fast to ramblas etc. We enjoyed our stay at Catalonia plaza kindly personel,4,2020,02,01

47,Best choice in Barcelona. Amazing! ,"My top choice when in Barcelona. I have been to this hotel several times and every time it is a pleasant surprise. Completely renovated and with excellent staff this hotel makes your stay in town easy and pleasant. Perfectly connected by all means of transportation (the airport bus, as well as 2 metro lines, taxi and severa buses are at the front door). Five star service for a very reasonable price. This time I was in a suite and the views were spectacular! Will definitively be back",5,2020,01,22
47,Excellent Choice!!!!,"If you are having holidays in Barcelona,this hotel is an excellent choice!

47,"GREAT HOTEL AND GREAT LOCATION, HOWEVER THEY CAN IMPROVE ON THE CLEANLINESS","The hotel was great, rooms are great with a beautiful view of the Barcelona Plaza. The bathrooms can do with an upgrade as they are very old. The cleanliness of the dishes and cutlery at breakfast can definetely be looked at, dishes looked like they were not washed properly. ",4,2020,01,13
47,Absolutely stunning hotel with service to match.,"We had passed this hotel many times and decided to book for a weekend break. 
They kindly gave us an upgrade to a suite, this is definitely the best room we have stayed in and we have stayed in many. It was stunning with views over Barcelona on three sides. As we were away for a celebration they also brought a bottle of champagne to our room, a lovely touch.
The service from check in right through to our departure this morning was second to none.  We could not recommend this hotel highly enough and this was certainly a five star experience.
It will certainly be repeated.",5,2020,01,12
47,"Great views, poor to average service","Poor check-in experience, staff on reception are not friendly. Poor WiFi quality, no bathrobes and slippers. Room keys don’t work constantly, you need regularly come to the reception. Japanese restaurant staff required service training. Breakfast is disappointing.

The rooms were nicely furnished, had comfortable beds, and all necessary amenities. The bathroom is clean and modern. The buffet breakfast served in a huge area where one could easily get a table and was excellent with lot of variety, live omelette station and good coffee.

47,Amazing view for New year's Eve and that's the only good part,"Myself and my husband arrived on the 30th Dec for a 2 night stay. We were allocated room 158 which lasted about 2 hours the room was shaking with the metro noise. This is one of the newer rooms which was a good size and clean and tidy but there was no way you could sleep in there. We asked if we could move rooms which went down like a lead balloon by the look on the reception girls face but we finally got moved to room 206. A re model needs doing asap. The noises in this room well I have no idea. Someone we met was on the 6th floor.and they havd to buy ear plugs. I think it was the toilets making like a suction drone noise.  There was 1 plug socket we could use in the room and for a business hotel I have no idea how people manage. The bathroom is very tired round the edges as well. So the main reason for choosing the hotel was location for Nye and being able to go on the roof terrace for the fireworks . So we was told to go reception on the morning of Nye and get tickets. That was fine
 What time can we go up there? We were told about an hour to an hour and half before. What happened that night was so disorganised it was laughable. We went to the 8th floor at about 10.40 just so we got a good spot. The door was locked but that was fine we would wait. Then more and more people came up and I mean it was uncomfortable. All waiting for the door to open . 2 people called reception to get some one to come unlock the door because no one was controlling who and how many were coming up the lift. Around 11 it opened. So it's Nye on the terrace no bar open? Really. They must of missed out on thousands  Everyone just took there own drinks. So to sum it up. For the hour and a bit we had up there it was worth it. But if you want a hotel that is worth its money and quiet. This isn't it.",3,2020,01,03
47,Best Hotel in Barcelona so far,"Until now it was the best hotel we've stayed at in Barcelona. Clean rooms, spacious and with wonderful view (we've got an upgrade).

47,Christmas in Barcelona,"Excellent location on two metro lines, aerobus station and shopping gallery. Very comfortable bed, excellent room cleanliness and room service, quiet room with a view at shopping mall. Nice terrace on 8th floor, with bar, pool and great view at the square. Got a very good price at cca 80 €/night for the Christmas period. Helpfull staff at reception, free drinks and sweets placed close to lifts. The only small issue was with noisy guests passing through hotel corridors in the late night as the doors to the room were not very well noise-insulating. ",5,2019,12,31

47,Can't wait to return. ,"The whole experience was 10* from begging to end.  On arrival Alex and Bidzina took our luggage to the room while we done the check in with a friendly lady called Julia, she accompanied us to the room to wich we had been given an amazing upgrade to one of the suites. The room was absolutely stunning with magnificent views to the plaza. As we arrived late we ordered room service for dinner, a smiley chap called Rafa bought it up and it was delicious. There was a big variety for breakfast, even vegan options for myself. The reception manager, Oscar did our check out,  very helpful and professional. He kindly took care of our luggage for the day. The whole team was very professional and accomodating. Thank you. We are very much looking forward to our next stay. ",5,2019,12,26
47,One and done,It’s 100 degrees in our room their response open a window to sirens in the streets. That’s exactly what I want to listen to while I sleep. I realize these people are used to sleeping with Eskimo jackets when it’s 15 degrees out. This is a hotel if you don’t know how to accommodate you should probably not be in business. ,1,2019,12,24
47,Excellent Location and Breakfast,We were so impressed with the Catalonia Barclona Plaza Hotel that we are returning in May.  It is in a prime location right next to the old bull fighting ring which is now a shopping mall with excellent restaurants on the roof and some of the best views in Barcelona.  The breakfast at the hotel is more than anyone could ever want including an omelet station and Cava!,5,2019,12,19
47,High expectations but quite disappointing,"The hotel itself was quite nice and the breakfast spread was very good. However, I was charged for room service items that never actually got delivered to my room and they weren't taken off my bill in the end either. Also, the staff was not as accommodating and friendly as I would have expected from this place and the restaurant food was too expensive but didn't taste nice at all. Was a horrible dinner to be honest and I left hungry and disappointed. Hands up to a specific spa lady though who was extremely friendly and tried her best with custom therapy to relief my pains when I fell ill there.",3,2019,12,18
47,Nice hotel,"On my stay I got a room in the oldest part in the hotel. It wasn't impressing at all. The newer part is renovated.
The stuff was nice and helpful. 
The hotel is near to the subway, than you can reach everything easily. ",3,2019,12,16
47,"Convinient, modern, clean","Modern, clean hotel. Wifi in room and reception areas with reasonable speed. I stayed on the upper floor with outward views. Unbelievably beautiful views especially at night. I did not find any noise disturbance of traffic. Clean and spacious rooms, rooms were tidied up and fresh toiletries loaded everyday. Service was good, breakfast had a good variety including hot food section and live kitchen for a variety of omelets. The food at dinner was excellent. 

Practical points: 
Subway and bus stop (including Aerobus) just outside the hotel doors. 
Shopping and a variety of restaurants nearby. 
Attractions nearby- including Fira de Barcelona, Arenas de Barcelona
It took me 25 minutes on Aerobus from the hotel to the airport during peak hour (was probably lucky) and 20 minutes by taxi on the way in.

Would I go back?
Would love to go again.",5,2019,12,15
47,Nice stay at the hotel Catalonia Barcelona plaza,"Nice stay at the hotel Catalonia Barcelona plaza.

47,Bad service,"Hi
We’ve came for a vacation at this hotel. 
Maybe one of the rooms or something is under-construction. We came back to the hotel to have some resting time, but there’s a driller which makes a lot of noise that we couldn’t have our resting time. I called the receipt for asking when will it’s stop. They told me they will check and call me back. At the third time I was asking for the manager. She tried to explain why it is good for me...
I ask for stop the noise and I told her “it’s all about money.. 
I told they didn’t told us it will be noisy.. 
their answer is “we don’t have what to do about it”. 
I told the woman how was talking to me that I don’t have another time for vacation... they didn’t even ask if we want to have another room. 
I didn’t like the behavior and the service here, and I would have not come back here.

My room had a mini fridge fully stocked from Cava down to water, you also get a choice of tea and coffee and yes there is a kettle, a TV and a hairdryer. I only had breakfast there , but they have 5 restaurants and a rooftop bar.
  Couldn't ask for a better location.
Lots of lovely restaurants to chose from in the area, shopping Mall less than 1 minute walk with more places to eat.
Really easy to get around, in front of the hotel is the Metro, buses, including the bus from and to the Airport and taxis.",5,2019,12,09
47,Crooks nest - Nido de ratas,"My partner got his bag stolen in the breakfast area, in front of all the staff, and they did nothing to stop it. They refused to call the police or advice what the emergency line number was. For a hotel of this category you would expect they'd protect their guests better, or at least cooperate with the victims and the authorities. They all looked and acted very complicit, from staff to upper management. Avoid this place at all cost.",1,2019,12,06
47,Amazing 4* Hotel in Barcelona,"This 4* luxury hotel is in Plaza Espana Barcelona, close to many touristic atractions. It s not in the city center, therefore the prices are decent.

There was a restaurant in there but not open at the time. Menu looked worthy - may be pricey for some",5,2019,12,01
47,Bad service (do not stay),"I stayed for 12 days (11 nights) for business trip start 15 November until 26 November 2019. In day 5 I reported to the receptionist that the AC is broken and until day 7 no one fixed. Then On day 9 I moved to different room, now the phone is broken. I need to make a local call since when I arrived my baggage was broken I used Etihad airways. Then I reported again to receptionist at 12.00 on day 10, I said I need to make a call to local Etihad office pls fix before I arrived this afternoon. Once I arrived hotel at 19.00 it's still broken! Then they ask me to call from receptionist.
Since I stayed for that long, and for my 2 complaints this hotel did not response in proper manner. I definitely wont stay at this hotel again. I also did not recommend for anyone stay since it is bad service for 4 Star Hotel.

47,Perfect hotel. ,10/10 hotel. Couldn’t fault it. Perfect for a weekend in Barcelona. View from the room- could see the sun rise and set from bed. Could see the magic fountain show from the hotel room. Staff were so helpful explaining the transport and going out of their way to show us the best way to get to tourist attractions,5,2019,11,23
47,Very bad breakfast,"Central location.
Friendly reception staff.
Room looks fine but heating did not work, we got cold at night.
Breakfast was chaotic, tables were dirty, glasses were stainy, trays were empty, staff could not handle the crowd and did not stop people touching food by hand, etc
We prepaid two nights but decided to leave after the first one.
Receptionist asked for the reason of early leave, we answered, she said several guests had similar experience with the breakfast and they were also bothered by some strange behavior fellas being disgusting in the breakfast area.
Nice that she understood our decision but would had been nicer to offer us to refund the cost of the unused second night.",2,2019,11,18
47,"Decent hotel, great location","Stayed here for 3 nights. Location was excellent just outside Metro station. Staff was helpful and hotel interior was wonderful. 

Room was decent sized for the two of us with a view. 

Only issue we had was the shower overflowed everyday I to the bathroom floor. Called reception to remedy and they sent a member of staff but he couldn’t understand the issue or spoke a word of English. Said he would send a plumber then next day but didn’t and we had towels all over the bathroom floor to stop water from getting into the room.

But other than that not a disappointing stay and we enjoyed the terrace bar and pool.",4,2019,11,18
47,My business stay,"Cons:
   - bath tub was broken and dirty
   - the temperature in the room was cold and there was no way to heat it.
   - requested a heater but it got never delivered
   - there was no iron in my room, even upon request I got it with a delay on the next day
   - I needed more shampoo than what was available
   - The room was smaller than usual",3,2019,11,18
47,Bag Stolen in Hotel Restaurant ,"It is just not safe... first day at breakfast, all the guests were checked in before entering, only one way in besides the kitchen, so it had to be staff or someone they knew. In 1 minute, getting coffee, my bag with money, computer, gone. Ok, outside on the street there is crime, but inside a restaurant inside the hotel you should be safe! That is why we spend more for a better hotel. Spoke to the management and the police... no one cares. The cameras do not work, security is not in the restaurant, and no ID on the staff. ",1,2019,11,17

rooms are neat and tidy, options at breakfast are good. lacks good restaurants with good vegetarian options. everybody wants the view of the square",4,2019,11,17
47,Old and wrecked,"I did not have a good experience at the Catalonia Plaza.

Having a super location near the Placa Espanya transportation hub, apparently, means that the subway trains make the entire block tremble slightly. I found it hard to get asleep to.

I always wondered why hotels have (the same) carpets, but now I know: Laminate flooring isn't as durable as carpet. There were large cracks in the flooring in the room (behind the door) and in the hallway on the 4th floor. Together with the occasional chrome strip to keep everything together makes this an unpleasant experience with a roller bag.

My experience in the bathroom of the room was abominable. When seated on the toilet, the toilet paper dispenser poked into my side. When somebody flushes the toilet, the entire hotel block enjoys too. The water from the shower head fluctuated between 25 and 40 degrees Celsius with the handle exactly in the same place. The shower head leaked. I'm not the cleanest person in my own home, but my shower head doesn't have white (calc) and black (mold) residu, as yours does.

Never. again.",2,2019,11,11
47,Average hotel with noisy rooms,"We stayed two nights during our Globus Spanish Fiesta tour. The front desk staff are abrupt  and make you feel like you are disturbing their oh so important personal discussions. Answering the phone gets priority over customers waiting to speak to them face to face.
There is a view of the magical fountains from the swimming pool cum bar on the top floor but it closes at 8pm right when the fountains are scheduled........guess management doesn’t want to make it convenient for their guests to watch the fountains!
The rooms are noisy with sounds coming in from the hallway as well as the closed windows. The hotel is located on a very busy intersection and the noise continues all night.
The bed was king size with only one bedside table. There are no plug points near the bed so make sure to take an extension cord if you use a CPAP machine. The plug points are behind the TV or under the desk.
The bathroom was old and had no walk-in shower. The bathtub is high sided so it is not easy to climb in and out of. There is a flimsy shower curtain so the floor gets wet.
We fortunately had a safe in our room; out tour leader  advised us that not all rooms had safes. We were provided one bottle of water (refillable) which was not replenished on our second night. Everything about this hotel felt like the staff were going through the motions and doing the bare minimum!",2,2019,11,09
47,Very disappointing,Don’t stay here if you rely on Wi fi ! We could not get any internet connection in the room and the response from the hotel was “ work in the hotel reception “!also  We were on the 7th floor but the outside noise was ridiculous . There were definitely not noise reducing windows in our room- we may as well have been sat outside ! We asked if we could have a drink on the roof terrace and were told it was closed for winter . !! The room was very nice but overshadowed by poor facilities. Such a disappointment for our first night in Barcelona. Would sadly not recommend .,1,2019,11,06
47,Disappointing,"We stayed 4 nights, but asked to pay the full amount at check in despite the fact we can guarantee the payment with any credit card. I travel a lot and this is the first time I experienced this in a 4 star hotel. Kind of feeling got trapped...

 Most of the rooms do not have outside view. See floor plan. 
The reception personnel are not trained and not accountable. Called a day prior to my arrival to have a double bed and they said no problem. But once at the check-in, they said there is no more double bed and if I want I can change it the next day. The next day, the reception said they cannot change room!?!
So I asked to set the 2 single bed together. They said it will be done. At the late evening when came back it was not done...
Breakfast quality is standard with limited choice.
House cleaning somehow throw away the brush of my electrical tooth brush the second night. Very annoying.
All in all this hotel is relatively expensive in regards of the services. I think definitely one can find a better hotel with better services and price.

47,Lovely place!,"I loved everything, my hotel was close to Gotic Barrio and a amazing place. I saw some typical Catalonia  events and love it. I’ll come back for sure.
The city was very cleaned, secure and good prices in cafes and restaurants.",4,2019,11,05
47,"Good, but could improve","Great location. Front desk staff not that kind. Clean, good breakfast. Wifi not that good.
There was a situation on my room, the room was very clean, but the plumbing appeared to have a problem, since there was a really bad smell coming from the bathroom.",4,2019,11,04
47,Average service,"I stayed 4 nights for a conference. I stayed in junior suite 706 which is a good size, but it only had a shower which smelled and had mould (see picture). Asked for a bathtub but was told that the refurbished rooms don’t have this.

The breakfast buffet was good but some days turning up at 10:15 they had already cleared stuff away.

The staff was average. Depending on who we asked something the response was either yes or no. Trick waa to keep asking until someone was willing to help.

One day housekeeping didn’t do up the room.

The roof pool was nice (but much smaller than on the pictures). And quiet as it’s off season.",3,2019,11,04
47,Nice,"I have spent the more 4 days this year in Barcelona Plaza Hotel. This is due to the excellent service and treatment in the hotel.

47,Must go hotel,"Very will located. Staff very professionals, eficient, with discretion. 
Rooms are very well designed. 
2 restaurants very nice for those who don't have the time. 

Parking. Roof terrace with swiming pool with amazing view on Monthuic and Plaza de Espana. 

Price is very fair for what you get. ",5,2019,11,04
47,Avoid. Not worth even despite location,"Stayed 3 nights with family. Awful experience. 
This is a good location but a very unsafe area. One of my colleagues had her handbag stolen with passports from the breakfast area! 

But despite the safety issues, nobody came to help us with luggage when we arrived with a baby and lots of bags. 

One of the staff at the reception was great. But they all are extremely understaffed playing multiple roles and once, and have 0 training in customer service etiquette. 

Staff at buffet area are very nice and friendly, but breakfast buffet doesn’t have many healthy options. 

Location is awesome but still not worth it. Next time I’d rather just go with something near La Rambla.",2,2019,11,03
47,CHEERS TO LULAH,"Fantastic stay at this beautiful hotel!!

From the check-in to the check-out everything was Outstanding! Especially Lulah's attention, kindness and smile at the front desk, congrats for such a great job!

Stayed the 25th for one night. Got to the rooftop with some mates which has incredible views and was really worth the experience. Highly recommend it, whether you are staying over or not. The room was huge, very comfortable and the shower amazing!

Breakfast was up to scratch too. Plenty of stuff, fresh fruit, amazing croissants, fresh squeezed OJ... what a great way to finish my stay!

I will definitely come back. Congrats to the whole hotel staff, but above all to Lulah!! You made a huge difference. Cheers.",5,2019,11,03
47,Wonderful stay,"We had one night between our cruise and flight home; chose this hotel based on location and I am so glad I did! We arrived too early for check-in but were allowed to store our luggage and sit by the pool and take advantage of the poolside bar.  When we were able to check-in, we had an upgraded room that was quite large and overlooked the Placa Espanya.  Hotel is very convenient for excellent restaurants and the bus to the airport stops right outside the door.  Our only regret is that we could only stay one night.",5,2019,10,28
47,Could do a lot better!,"Service from hotel staff was poor, slow and not very helpful. With a delegation of 55 guests we were left to fend for ourselves during the separatist  protest. Bar service was slow and of a poor standard. At one point in the evening the hotel main bar ran out of glasses, we were served drinks in plastic beakers, these drinks included single malt whiskey, wine, and gin an tonic.  The bar was not full!",2,2019,10,28
47,Checking off Barcelona bucket list,"Convenient and vibrant location, Metro just outside front door so you can go anywhere.  Night views from rooftop pool spectacular overlooking Plaza Espanya; grab a wine from the bar and watch the magic fountain. Four nights and something always happening on Avenue Maria Cristina.  Must do the trek up the hill to MNAC, one of the best organized and visitor friendly museums anywhere. Breakfast options are plentiful but queue can be competitive and choices may dwindle if you're late.  Staff very cooperative and efficient.  This is a popular hotel with high occupancy yet an excellent value, would stay here again with no reluctance.",5,2019,10,25
47,"Mediocre. It will do, but not five stars","First, the positives. Great location, right next to the old bullring which is now a shopping mall with many places to eat and shop. Right on Plaza Espana, with the picturesque boulevard leading up to the grand Museu Nacional d' art de Cataluna. 

The staff were very friendly. There was a bartender in the deserted bar one night who spoke excellent English and helped me choose a bottle of wine to take up to my room one night. He provided exceptional service. 

Breakfast was good in the very spacious dining room, with efficient and friendly staff who prepared made to order eggs. 

Our room was very clean. We had no view. Our window overlooked an interior courtyard with nothing to see but a huge white canopy that covered the entire space. Beds were comfortable with good pillows.

Not so good: there was a lot of black mold in the bathroom (I notice that several other reviewers commented on this same issue). The shower head was weirdly positioned in the center of the tub, aimed outward toward the room, rather than the more common configuration at one end of the tub, aimed toward the tub. It was a challenge to shower without flooding the room. 

Electrical outlets were sorely lacking. None by the bed at all.  I had to move the TV to access one outlet behind it. Or I could get on my knees under the desk to access one outlet near the floor. 

We were travelling with a large group. At least two people in our group said their A/C was not working at all, so the rooms were very stuffy. Their rooms overlooked the street and they said the street noise in this very busy area made it impossible to sleep with the window open, so they really couldn't compensate for the lack of AC. The A/C in our room did work, but it was all or nothing -- either off or on. So I had to get up a couple of times during the night to turn it on or off as the room got alternately too hot or too cold.

I would not rule out staying here again, but just know that you are going to be getting a mid range hotel which may have some issues.",3,2019,10,25
47,awesome view for la merce fireworks!,"my mom absolutely loved how close this hotel was to the trains and the aerobus took us right there from the airport - so easy! best part was such a great view for the fireworks for la merce festival, we even could just sit in our room open the window and watch the amazing show! would definitely stay here again in the future.",5,2019,10,23
47,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,"My wife and I stayed from October 3rd to October 16th, 2019 at the Catalonia Barcelona Plaza. A fantastic hotel. Close to the subway, close to all the best in Barcelona. We were very well attended and used the structure of the hotel to relax and enjoy the best that it has, its comfort!
",5,2019,10,23
47,good standard,"No complaints. i like this hotel because of its location at the plaza espanyol, next to the metro station and next to the montjuic parc.
The hotel itself fulfills everything that you need when the hotel is mainly used for sleeping.",5,2019,10,21
47,"Dirt, mold and not worth the money at all","There was hair on the floor in the room and bathroom. Almost no free sockets (only 2 pieces: one in the bathroom, one behind the TV). Bath mouldy. Bath tub rotten. Breakfast is not filled up everything. Unfriendly staff in the breakfast area. Elevators do not stop on one level. Everything looks spoiled and worn out.",1,2019,10,21
47,Convenient transportation,"Airport shuttle bus stop,15~20 minutes by bus to airport, 5~10 minutes each bus arrives. metro L1/L3 Espanya, it is convenience to many views.
the hotel room is clean, large, but renovation of old as long history
some views are nearby",4,2019,10,20
47,sevice not included,"Front desk staff was not helpful. After arriving late I was placed in a room was no view and no sheets for the second bed. The next day they refused to move us, they were too busy. Come back tomorrow was their attitude.",3,2019,10,20
47,Business Trip,"Lovely location and nice hotel with beautiful roof top swimming pool and bar.
The hotel offers a good standard of in room facilities with a professional service.
It was a pleasant stay and welcome place to rest after busy days.",4,2019,10,16
47,"Horrible smelly rooms, great location","Horrible smelly rooms (room 138) with broken down doors and bathroom fixtures. Great and convenient location - easy to get to, and connect to other places in the city. Breakfast spread was OKish. Definitely won't come back here. ",2,2019,10,12
47,Great experience,"Very nice hotel, with an extraordinary location, incredible views. Both the metro and airbus station are right in front of the entrance of the hotel. We were very pleased with the free update that we received - from a standard double room to a family suit with stunning views of the placa Catalunya. ",5,2019,10,12
47,Vacation/Tour,"We have just checked in as part of a tour group. I found the ease of luggage arrival and check in to be smooth and easy.  Partly due to our great tour manager. 
Upon entering the room, with the first lookabout, I didn’t see a 4 Star hotel - more like 2. The room is dated, the lamp over the bed is holding on by a thread (in this case, only the bottom screw). Doors are scratched up and old looking.
I went to draw a bath after a long day of travel and noticed black mold all around the tub, under the soap dish (scratched at it and it came off in flecks), I opted to shower instead. Bath towel and hand towel both had someone else’s hair on them - I don’t even feel clean call at this moment. A call to reception went unanswered...
We are here for 3 nights, 2 included with the group tour and an additional $250 for a 4/5 Star hotel price for the extra night. Not worth the price paid for what we thought was going to be beautiful room - ours overlooks the porches of neighboring apartment Bldg.

I will post a follow up review if Management follows up with the complaints of this tired part of the the hotel.

47,Montserrat & casa batllo',"Must visit pilgrimage place near Barcelona.
One can go by cog- wheel train which is a great experience with spectacular views.
There are multiple hiking trails from below & from the monastery.one of them takes you to the statue of black Madonna.
Casa batllo in Barcelona is a fairy tale building conceptualized by Gaudi a great architect way ahead of his time",5,2019,10,09
47,Good location ,"Location was perfect for business purposes, close to the congress center but also to the city. Nice restaurants and rooftop. Rooms were ok, bed are confortable, spacious. However, I had many problems with the key, very sensible to the environment. Even though I didn’t put it close to the phone or ipad (even wallet!) as recommended every time I asked for a new one. I had to ask for 5 different keys, and finally a technician was supposed to come (never came)because locks run out of battery?
The room has only 2 plugs, one of those for the TV, the other one right next to it, and no iron which they couldn’t provide in the reception because they had already given away the ones they had in the reception to other guests. 
",3,2019,10,08
47,Fabulous,"Great location, great room, great experience. Can not recommend this hotel enough and how they assisted me in making my fiance's 30th birthday a time to remember. They decorated our room lovely and upgraded us for free. The location is ideal and a short 10 minute taxi/metro to everywhere you need to be. Lovely helpful staff and fabulous rooftop pool. Loved our weekend away. ",5,2019,10,07
47,Simon in Barcelona,"Very interesting experience for 4 days in Barcelona only. Recomending walking tours and Not recommend Hop in Hop off, because it takes a lot of valuable time. Recommend All Gaudi work, the rest of museum is nothing special",5,2019,10,05
47,Great Location,"The hotel is in Spain Square w/easy access to the metro and many eateries. It has a shopping mall next door, located in an old bull stadium. There is a wonderful pool/ bar area on the 8th floor of the hotel.  The breakfast buffet was pretty good. The weather in September is great too.",5,2019,10,04
47,Great Experience,"I was in Barcelona for ESMO, and this hotel was provided f by my sponsors. It is right in Spain Square, and given that I had about 18 hours only in Barcelona, it was a memorable experience. Highly recommended!",5,2019,09,30
47,Central & Noisy,"If you're looking for a place to unwind and get a good night's sleep this isn't the hotel. But, if you want to be centrally located and have a great city view from your room, then book a spot now. The elevators didn't always work but there was always at least one in service at all times. The location is right across the street from a former bull ring that has been turned into an amazing shopping mall. You can get cheap eats and fine dining just a few steps away. This area is teeming with tourists so beware of pickpockets! One of our friends had her purse stolen and another friend had her watch taken right off her wrist. We had a drink on the rooftop terrace but didn't have time to drift away in their comfy poolside cabana loungers.",4,2019,09,30
47,Amazing Experience at an Awesome Location,Great Spot- Everything Needed was at Arms length. The best part was the metro station which had both the lines. The Breakfast menu was short but nice. The only issue was the lack of bottled drinking water available as complimentary.,4,2019,09,30
47,Not great,"I’ve never understood hotels that are positioned so close to Congress venues, that will obviously get large amounts of bookings from people on business, that don’t supply irons in their rooms. Surely they realise that people will need them. There seemed there were a few available from reception but when we checked in they had all gone. 

My room was comfortable enough but could do with some updating as there was quite a bit of damage in the bathroom. ",3,2019,09,28
47,Catalonia Plaza hotel,Good value for money. Location of hotel was convenient because the underground train station was located just in front of the hotel. Plenty of restaurants in the arena mall just next to the hotel. Choose rooms facing the square as it gives a good view of the National museum of Catalonia arts,4,2019,09,23
47,good location,"the location of the hotel is very good for traffic, tour, diet, and shopping. If I has the chance to back to  Barcelona, I would like to choice this hotel again, because it leaves me many amazing memories. ",4,2019,09,23
47,Good hotel in a great location,"Look no further if you want to have a spectacular view from your room.  Located just 20 minutes walk from Ralambra mall and on top of the train station the location is perfect. buy T10 and enjoy exploring the city, watch fountain show at night and go shopping to the former bull arena next door. The hotel itself is nice and have good amenities. My room had enormous wardrobe. Although in the busy location you can have good night sleep. The service is great, we arrived in the morning and could leave our suitcases behind reception and received a welcome drink voucher to the rooftop bar. The reception is always busy but you can ask questions and book a tour. The breakfast has a great choice buffet style. I definitely will stay again. The only one issue i had is with swimming pool upstairs and limited seating available. you have to be up there really early to find anything to seat. Perhaps hotel should think about changing the big over-sized bed to something smaller - like on the photo, that will accommodate more guests.",5,2019,09,22
47,Luxury in city centre ,"After a relaxing cruise holiday I decided to have a night of luxury in Barcelona.
We had a beautiful executive room facing the city and the stunning fountains.
The room was very modern and contemporary excellent quiet air conditioner necessary in the summer months.
The bed was super king size comfortable with quality bed linen .
The shower room was exceptional lots of room power shower and high end toiletries.
We used the roof top bar and pool all day loved the chilled music and atmosphere,then took a walk in the evening to see the fountain show at 9:30 
No noise in rooms as had 2 solid doors to corridors.
Executive rooms have complementary refreshments and snacks.
Good hairdryer in room and fabulous mini bar etc.",5,2019,09,16
47,Barcelona Holiday,"Great hotel, staff always helpful, and located near the old bull ring. The rooftop pool was a delight to use, as was the bar. Breakfast well managed, and a personal chef to cook the eggs. Well recommended if you want to stay in this part of Barcelona",5,2019,09,10
47,TWO-DAY BUSINESS STAY IN SEPTEMBER,"Highly recommendable. A real four-star. Located right at Placa Espanya, 20 meters from the Metro and Airport express buses. Efficient staff. Great breakfast buffet. Rooftop terrace and -pool is execellent!",5,2019,09,10
47,disappointing,"disappointing
Bugs in the room, slow and bad room service, they gave me separate beds and I booked a big bed, the fridge was not working well, the location of the hotel is excellent and the view is beautiful",2,2019,09,09
47,"Great staff, slightly confusing layout and lifts","Room was great, not amazing but I had the cheapest option, it had comfortable bed and everything I'd expect (refrigerator, toiletries, hairdryer etc). All staff I spoke to were very nice and helpful, from reception to bar. Well equipped gym (though could do with some music, was weirdly silent).

Only downside is having to take lift to lobby then up in a different one to reach rooftop. As per most hotels the stairs are fairly inaccessible, but I'd prefer to use them than wait ages then squeeze into t tiny lift!",4,2019,09,09
47,Poor maintenance and service,"Poor maintenance of the hotel overall and poor service. Water doesn’t sink in the shower, conditioner makes terrible noise, got stuck twice in the elevator. The room has not been cleaned, when asked to clean the room- was told that’s its late to be done. And got charged twice for the stay for double-booking!",3,2019,09,09
47,Falls down on the little things,"- free drink voucher not provided;
- bar discount not applied;
- pancake station unmanned; 
- no ingredients list for a catered event so vegetarians and people with allergies were struggling;
- check-in took ages, due to all the different forms / ID required. 
Not the best considering the price. ",3,2019,09,09
47,Paradise,We had an amazing holiday holiday at The Catalonia. It was our 2nd visit & it was perfect. We stayed in a privileged suite both times & really recommended them. The best review I feel is if you would return to a hotel & we are.....October 2019 & are counting the days.,5,2019,09,08
47,"Great Location, Great Stay","Pros:
- Mall with restaurants right beside hotel
- rooftop pool with amazing view of mnac, magic fountain and over all plaza d’espanya
- day beds on rooftop 
- bar on rooftop, runs till 2 am
- location is very central 10 minutes walk from sants area 
- location is 2 minutes walk from barcelona city tours bus stop
- close to central station, easy to get around
- modern rooms
- accommodating staff
- taxis at the front always
- 10 minute cab from barceloneta where all the night life is
- 5 mins subway to catalunya where shopping and las ramblas is

Cons
- need to update doors, had to body the door to open it
- elevators close very quickly
- front desk isnt always the friendliest 
- rooftop seating gets full really fast, the lounge chairs by the pool in their main pic are not at the actual hotel
- expensive food service

OVERALL
Would stay again considering how central it was and how many activities you could do close by as well as the fact that it is a very clean hotel
",4,2019,09,03
47,Not 4 Stars!,"I booked the room with great expectations, only to find out that even as a married couple, they gave me and my wife two single beds. They kept insisting its the same thing, but its not when the beds keep sliding away. Went to the room, to take a shower, only to find out that the shower was broken, and water was everywhere. Requested to move, instead they put a new shower handle, which didnt fix the leak from the tap.

There were holes in the curtain, and the wall was broken. 

Decent enough hotel, but definitely not 4 stars. Would recommend for the location and the rooftop pool. Not for anything else.",1,2019,09,03
47,Barcelona Vacation,Great hotel and location for the price point. With easy access to transportation. The train station is in front of the hotel and the hop on and off tour bus is across the street. I highly recommend using the tour bus to get around the city,4,2019,09,03
47,Nice Hotel in Barcelona,I stayed here for a convention.  This hotel is located on Plaza de Espanya with easy access to the metro.  The Arenas shopping mall and many restaurants are nearby.  The hotel offers a bountiful breakfast buffet for an additional charge.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Barcelona.,5,2019,09,02
47,"Great location and rooftop, bad WiFi","Loved the room, the location, the breakfast, and the rooftop pool! It's 1 min from the metro, which is great. The aerobus to the airport also picks up right outside, and you can buy tickets from the front desk. The cons were bad WiFi, weak air conditioning, and very few outlets to charge in the room. However, overall, I would highly recommend this hotel for its location and service! ",4,2019,09,02
47,Barcelona stay for 6 days,"This hotel is a mid range and smart hotel suitable for all age groups but primarily its set up for couples and having a few days around the pool, we were surrounded by 18 -30's who took pride in showing off their chiselled bodies. 

If you get a street view room the view is fab but most triple or family rooms are internal with no view and feel somewhat depressing in such an amazing city. 

Close to the Magic fountain and on the tour bus route so the location is fine. 20 mins walk to the port and 30 mins walk to Las Rambla for the more mobile individuals. 

Modern hotel

Breakfast was continental and had some amazing food but lacked some of the more traditional things the brits like such as beans. 

Coffee was freshly ground from the bean
Orange juice was straight from the orange etc

Couldn't fault the quality of the food on offer

There was an omelette station where you could get omelettes, eggs etc but it could do with separating from the other food areas as there was always a queue at this station which made it congested for getting other food. 

4 lifts serviced the floors well

Pool is on the 8th floor with free towels for the sunbeds but space up here was really at a premium and there was also a rooftop bar by the pool but drinks were not cheap.

Supermarket and shopping centre right next door too. 

Parking was ok with 4 floors of underground parking but price is £22 per day

All in all a good stay",4,2019,09,01
47,Very good!,"the location, the room and the service were perfect.
the room quality was great.
As we only stayed 2 days, we needed a hotel that would help us with transportation and this was perfect.

Thank you for all!",5,2019,09,01
47,Location,"Location  makes this hotel a real gem, metro station right outside the hotel will take you to a there you need to be. Great to see the fountain show from the rooftop bar/pool at nights Aswell. Great stay. ",5,2019,08,27
47,Fantastic hotel with great staff in perfect location!,"This is a fantastic hotel for many reasons and I highly recommend staying there on your trip to Barcelona.
The location couldn’t be better for exploring the city. It has a bus stop and tube station literally right outside of the hotel. We would pick where we wanted to go and within a few minutes be there via the tube (Tip: buy the T10 ticket which costs approx. 10 Euros and gives you 10 trips which you can use on the tube, trains and busses) It’s also across from Font Màgica de Montjuïc which is beautiful and has a great water fountain show in the evening. There is also a range of restaurants on top of the shopping centre across the road. We ate at a few of them and found them to be really good. The Italian one we returned to as we liked it so much.
They also have a few restaurants on site. The only one I can comment on is the Japanese which is fantastic, really quick and efficient service and the food was really tasty. They also have bar snacks on the roof terrace which were convenient for a day by the pool. The roof top terrace was great for a day of relaxation, however it does get busy so you may have to wait around to get a sun bed.
I initially thought the breakfast was pricey (14 Euros) but I had it one day and it’s actually really reasonable due to the choice and the fact that it was a buffet. They even have a Bloody Mary station if boozy breakfasts are your thing. 
The rooms are really clean and spacious. The rooms were cleaned daily without fail and the beds are comfy (we stayed in an executive room). The shower was great with a normal power shower and also a waterfall style shower that can be used at the same time.
Lastly, the customer service. I found it to be fantastic and the reception team are really helpful and nice to talk to. I have to give a special mention to Cristina as she was great! I was liaising with her on email before my arrival and she was really helpful and responded promptly. It was also my birthday when I was there and they left me a cake, card and some balloons in my room for me to come back to. Cristina also phoned me to wish me a happy birthday which was a really nice touch and all of this topped off what was a special day. She is a real credit to the hotel.
I absolutely loved my time in Barcelona and I think it’s my favourite city I have visited but a lot of this was down to this hotel as it’s a pleasant place to be and the location is perfect to get the most out of your days in the City.",5,2019,08,27
47,No ac for 5 days,Bad maintenance & management— 6 people checked room ac. Apologized for not being able to move me__ after all this they said ac was working but workers didn’t turn it on correctly. Oscar the manager had a habit of rolling his eyes with the problems that were occurring ,1,2019,08,25
47,"Great location, smart rooftop bar with pool",I enjoyed my night stay at the hotel. I had everything I needed and the staff were helpful. The corridors to the bedrooms seemed really hot but that’s a minor point. Loved the roof bar and would have spent more time there if I could.,4,2019,08,25
47,Beautiful... few issues,"Have written full review to hotel. In summary:

Unfair offer of complementary upgrades to people at check in- needs to be more equitable. 
Lovely receptionist- Julia. Super sweet housekeeper- Luz. 

Beautiful hotel, well maintained (family suite). Pool nice but not really child friendly- more for drinking/ adult socialising. Would be amazing if there was an indoor pool too!

Breakfast- so much choice, something to suit every taste. Pleasant table staff and amazing chef making the omelettes- he was friendly and efficient too. 

Didn’t manage to eat on the hotels restaurants but there is so much choice locally- location is perfect to go to The  Arena mall with amazing  rooftop restaurants (La Botiga is exceptional); also all major city sightseeing tours stop by the hotel.",3,2019,08,22
47,Terrible hotel - very noisy,"If you enjoy a good night sleep after a long day touring a beautiful city, then this hotel is NOT for you. Thin walls, plumbing issues and noisy floors, I couldn't wait to leave. You can hear conversations as well as the showers and toilets from all adjoining rooms. The toilet/plumbing had an added extra feature with horrible noise and water spurting from the toilet for two days. The PVC flooring in the rooms and corridors accentuates the sound of shoes and noise no matter what hour guests return. Every footstep is heard.  If something is dropped on the floor in the room above you, you will know about it. 

The TV did not have a power cord, the kettle would not turn off and we could not get through to reception by phone. 

Once in reception it was hit or miss with customer service. I have traveled around the world and this would be the worst hotel I have stayed in. Its a shame because it is conveniently positioned to restaurants, buses, metro, shopping and a 20-25 minute walk to the main square. The housekeeping was good and the rooms were clean.",1,2019,08,22
47,Best hotel i had ever been.,Grate place to stay and grate place to relax. Very nice location. I like the hotel interior and the hotel room was very clean and nice. I like the pool very clean and big. I hope i will visit the hotel soon again.,5,2019,08,21
47,Nice htotel,"It was excellent, good service, kindly personal, everything was sortet out at once. The breakfast was varied very overwelled. The location was in top, busses and train just outside the door, and many taxis. Sure i would recommend this hotel",5,2019,08,20
47,Great experience but ...,"Great experience in this hotel next to the metro station and near to restaurants and to plaça espania, but the price was very high, the noise of water was in the bathroom and the telephone was not working ! ",3,2019,08,19
47,great hotel,"I had an excellent time while staying at the Catalonia Barcelona Plaza.  I would recommend your hotel to friends.  In fact, I did recommend your hotel who stayed at a different hotel for his 1st night.  He moved to your hotel on 8/6 and was very happy to do so.",4,2019,08,13
47,The Paella conquest,"We looked forward to breakfast every morning. Loved that the chef made us an omelette. The food was very fresh and the orange juice freshly squeezed. Everyone was friendly and the restaurants were very nice. The rooms were clean and good for asthma suffered, floor boards.",5,2019,08,13
47,Absolutely perfect!,"Upon arriving at the hotel we were instantly greeted with friendly reception staff and a beautiful lobby. We were quickly checked in and met with a free upgrade to one of the suites on the higher levels of the hotel. Our room was immaculate, beautiful furnished and incredibly comfortable. The location was directly above a shopping complex which also provided multiple access points to the underground rail system. The pool bar was also lovely however was relatively full so we struggled to find seating (granted we did arrive around 1pm). Our stay at this hotel was just perfect and we would not hesitate to book into the Catalonia Plaza upon returning to Barcelona.

Thanks! 
",5,2019,08,12
47,Lovely Hotel and great location!,"Location was great - easy access to Las Ramblas etc and the view from the hotel was beautiful! The music and vibe around the pool is good fun, drinks and snacks are lovely. The staff are friendly.
 
They had removed the individual sunbeds from the pool area, meaning they only have around 10 Bali beds for the whole hotel ... for 3 friends it was really difficult to have somewhere to lie down together and enjoy the sun etc. There were lots of tables and chairs around the pool but people just wanted to be lay in the sun so you literally had people sprawled on the floors on towels. There was a large convention there the same time as us, so it was really busy and unless you were by the pool at 9am it meant spending a day on the chairs trying to relax instead of a bed. We also smashed a glass on our bathroom floor and had to call 4 times for somebody to help us clean it as we had nothing to use to get rid of it. 10 hours later - it took a more demanding phone call to reception and eventually the guy came off the front desk himself and helped us clear it before there were any injuries.  We had a triple room for 3 people and only 2 bath robes - we did ask for a third but it never arrived. It was almost impossible to speak to anybody from room service to order any kind of drink or food - they never picked up so we actually never ordered with them but would have had they picked up the phone.",4,2019,08,12
47,"Fantastic centre with blend of shops, cafes and art","A wonderful place to start on the promenade. Has everything in it. We often ate there and then strolled down the marine walk among yachts. Beware the byciclists though.  Our favorite was paella negra, calamari frit and beer :) 
Highly recommend.",5,2019,08,12
47,Awesome Roof Top Bar,"If I was to return to Barcelona, I would book to stay at this hotel again. The hotel was fantastic and had many great qualities, although that’s not to say we didn’t have 1/2 minor hiccups! The rooms were fantastic, the beds were comfortable, the bathrooms were lovely, and the rooms have room service and mini bars, they are however EXPENSIVE. We did have to change rooms on the first night as the shower was not working, they apologised but did not offer any compensation so I had to go to the reception and complain and they ended up offering us 4 free drinks at the bar. On arrival they were not very friendly and we had to wait at the reception for a long time to be checked in and checked out on the final day, I would definitely this is their major downfall which could be improved. 

The Roof Top Bar is by far the best feature of the hotel, it has great views, an amazing pool with lovely but limited sun beds, the bartenders are friendly and the drinks are reasonably priced!! There are only 6 double sun beds by the pool so if you want one, make sure you are queuing up at least 15 minutes before the Roof Top Bar opens or-else you will not get one AT ALL. The Roof Top Bar has a lot of seating to compensate but who wants to sit in a chair for hours?! At night the view of the Magic Fountain of Monjuic is unbelievable.

The hotel is situated in a brilliant location, it has many great attractions within close proximity and the Metro is right outside the hotel which is by far the best mode of transport as trains are every 3 minutes and it takes 10 minutes to La Rambla/Gothic Quarter. 

We checked out late for free which was nice of them to offer but we waited 30 minutes in the queue to check out and they tried charging us for using the mini bar when we didn’t. P.s. they charge city tax when checking out. Overall, we had minor issues and the hotel isn’t perfect, but it is a great hotel which could be better!",4,2019,08,11
47,decent hotel,"checked in after a late flight, room was 2 twins together not a Queen i requested. bathtubs weren't the cleanest, but the rooms otherwise were clean. day 2 the staff moved our belongings into a room with a queen size bed which was nice. ",4,2019,08,10
47,This hotel saved my trip to Barcelona,"This hotel is just so amazing. It was my first time in Barcelona. I didn’t quite realize before hand how huge the city is. There is a lot of crime here, i heard and saw many people get bags, phones and other valuables stolen. Therefore this hotel made my stay fantastic because I could just stay here.

I got a complimentary upgrade to a better room on the top floor, nothing to complain about regarding the room. There is a free snack bar by the elevator with juice, coffee machine, snacks, fruit etc. The wifi could be better. 

The pool area is THE BEST. I recommend that you get there around 8:40 and wait until they open the Doors at 9:00. If you get there just a minute after 9:00 all of the Sun loungers will be reserved. I didn’t have any problem getting one because I got there early. The Sun loungers are great, double beds and you can easily spend the whole day at the pool. The water is Perfect temperature. Great drinks and food at the pool. 

The only negative thing about the hotel is that i didn’t feel comfortable When they knocked on your door at all times of the day. The First day roomservice knocked on my door while i was taking a nap. I asked him kindly to go away but then he just OPENED the door with his key and put down a free bottle of water. I enjoyed the water but you get a bit frightened while sleeping in underwear and a random man opens the door. 

Taxi’s right outside the hotel, metro as well that i didn’t use. 

Breakfast buffet is not worth the money I think. 

I wont be going back to Barcelona but I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone.",5,2019,08,09
47,Overall poor quality hotel,"- check in / check out took forever. there was not enough staff
- problem with the pipe in my room = smelled like sewage 
- housekeeping did not add toilet paper until I ran out. I had to ask more than once
- landline phone did not work in my room 
",2,2019,08,09
47,Very nice hotel. Excellent location!,"We arrived around 12pm check-in and was very very busy, it took about 30mins - apart from this our experience very positive. Our room was upgraded for free to the executive room on floor 6, the room itself was very very nice, the only downside was that the walls are very thin so you hear literally every footstep and whisper. We had a view of the main square so that was nice. We also had free drinks and snacks near the lifts. The rooftop was really nice, the views are amazing. The pool is a decent size but there are limited sun loungers, I think 10-12 in total, and the rest are chairs. They have plenty of space up there so it’s a bit confusing why they choose to have chairs over sun loungers. Anyway, it does get busy but there is plenty of room for everyone. The gym was very small and only 3 machines but I noticed that they were building a new gym in the room next door so that would be a very decent upgrade! Staff are nice, the drinks are the bar is a little expensive compared to prices in the town centre. Location is perfect! It’s on both L3 and L1 metro lines which makes life sooooo easy. You can literally travel anywhere you like in 10mins. The aerobus stop is right outside, making airport transfers effortless.",4,2019,08,08
47,Ruined our holiday,"Our train into Barcelona was delayed and so we called the hotel to tell them we would be late and it would be midnight. They insisted this was no problem, however on arriving at the hotel our room had been given away. They offered no help whatsoever and were quite rude asking me to move aside so they could serve other (richer) customers. Despite having a young child with us who could barely stand up with tiredness. I insisted they find us another hotel and after an hour and a half of making one phone call they sent us to their sister hotel - a dump outside of town half built, that stank and was filthy and asked us to PAY THE EXTRA. Amazing. They didn't even offer a glass of water. Rude inconsiderate staff. Terrible experience. My daughter is sick as a result. Don't go to any of these hotels",1,2019,08,07
47,Beautiful Hotel!,I visited this hotel as part of a work congress and loved it.  It is well located and provides impeccable service.  What I enjoyed the most was the pool area on the roof of the hotel and the beautiful view from it.  I also tried the massage service which was decent for the price. I would recommend this hotel.,4,2019,08,06
47,Barcelona vacation,"First trip to Spain and highly recommend Catalonia Barcelona.  The hotel, restaurants, rooms and staff were phenomenal.  The location was amazing- especially the view from the pool.  It's also not too far of a walk to Las Ramblas.",5,2019,08,05
47,Worst hotel experience ever,"Simply don't go there. That money can get you way better services elswhere !
7th floor under construction. Workers on the hallway with tools and dust on the floor.
Room with insetcs on the floor. Decor panel supposed to be screwed to the wall and was't, even the screws were unattached. Heavy noise as from 7 in the morning. Workers on the hallway all day long.",1,2019,08,05

47,Would visit again,"Great hotel with amazing breakfast, nice views, friendly staff and very good location. Would recommend this hotel especially for couples. Would love to visit again if visiting Barcelona. Surpassed the expectations",5,2019,08,05
47,Rip off!,"Myself and partner stayed here for 4 nights monday to friday. Room was clean and adequately air conditioned. We only recieved one towel each per day from cleaners. I purposely brought two towels we had used in the pool area to the room as we generally has two showers each per day and I knew 2 towels would not be enough. When I came back to the room, the cleaners had clearly rooted through my suitcase and taken the two towels I had left there for later. This case was in the closet and out of the way of the cleaners. My suitcase should not have been rooted through and the cleaners had no business in my case. I said nothing about this to management as during previous encounters with reception staff they were rude and abrupt. I new I would get no satisfaction by complaining. There was one particularly helpful worker at reception. I did not get her name but I always tried to get her attention as the others had previously rolled their eyes when we asked them why no tea bags/milk had been restocked in our room after the cleaners had came.

When checking out, we were told we owed 40.00 euros pending charges. The woman receptionist advised this was for two biscuits, a bottle of water and crisps which we had eaten. It said nothing anywhere visible to the eye about there being charges for these amenities in the room.In ireland, it would be nornal for a biscuit and water to be left in the room free of charge, therefore we did not think any differemt of this service.

I informed the worker we knew nothing about these charges, and that 40.00 for two cookies, one packet of crisps and water was ridiculous. The worker advised this was the price and insisted we pay it. This hotel as previosuly mentioned was nice and appropriate for our needs. It was also not cheap and I think 40.00 for amenities which had no visible charges on display is a joke! I will not be returning. Also, I do not appreciate people rooted through my case and my belongings being thrown aside.",3,2019,08,02
47,Below expectations,"Don’t be fooled by the rooftop pool. This hotel is very disappointing. Poorly constructed the walls are as thin at paper - you hear everything at night including footsteps on the fake timber flooring and neighbours toilets flushing through the night. This morning I was awoken by hammering (hotel renovations). The roof top pool is open to the public so difficult for guests to get time by the pool as few chairs left for guests.

The complementary drink is a half glass - which pretty much sums up my experience at this hotel.

My worst experience on day 2 or my 5 day visit was to ask reception where I could find a nearby medical clinic to see a doctor as I was feeling ill. The reception attendant consulted with his manager and they told me a doctor could visit the hotel for Euro 100 or cheaper if I just went to the clinic directly. I took their advice and directions and walked the 30mins to the hospital clinic. After a 2hr wait I saw a doctor and after a 5min consultation I was told the cost was Euro 223. I was shocked! I was more disappointed that the hotel’s inexperienced staff had made this recommendation. This has spoiled my time in Barcelona. I discussed this with hotel management who have failed to acknowledge the poor advice given by their staff. 2 days later the hotel management have still not contacted me or apologised even though the knew which staff member gave me the recommendation. Surely it is common for guests to be ill and in need of a doctor - with hotels expected to help in this situation.

I very rarely post a hotel review but felt I needed to as so disappointed.",2,2019,08,01
47,3 night city break,The staff were really helpful and were willing to google and print maps/directions. Breakfast was well catered and had plenty of options . The pool and terrace had a excellent view over the square and magic fountain i really would recommend a visit when the fountain is on it seemed to be the biggest and busiest on a Sunday . The rooms were clean and modern. The best bit about this hotel is the location it had buses to the airport right outside and the underground right outside we purchased a 3 day metro ticket so we were able to pop on the L1 and L3  line which was ever 10 mins if not less and we could get as many trains as we wanted so we traveled all over Barcelona by the underground.,4,2019,07,30

Staff were friendly and helpful, particularly Marco at reception and Jacqueline at the rooftop bar. They helped to make my stay at this hotel really relaxing, they’re the reason I would choose to stay here again in the future.

Highly recommended.",5,2019,07,30
47,very nice hotel,Very nice hotel on a good location. Pool and bar on the roof is very nice and makes is a very special experience after you visited the city of Barcelona. taxi to the ramblas or center is cheap about 7-8 euro. ,5,2019,07,30
47,PERFECT,one of the best hotels in BCN - specially if you compare it with the hotels near Plaza Catalunya etc. - prices in the Catalonia BCN Plaza more than okay for the service etc. you get - and with the metro you are in some minutes in the main city ..........,5,2019,07,30
47,Great location,"The hotel is at great location, the subway is in front of the hotel, shopping mall next to it, bus departs to the airport in front of the hotel and even some tourist attractions are in front of the hotel. ",5,2019,07,29
47,Great hotel,"Clean and great location. The airport bus leaves by the entrance (one goes to T1 and another to T2) every 5 min. Lots of restaurants in the area. One of them, the best steak I have ever had (Arrosseria Las Arenas). I did not care to pay €20 for breakfast. I rather went to the corner 30 m to the left of the hotel entrance an had a sandwich. Another pre regarding the hotel is the terrasse pool area. It opens at 9 AM. Be there then if you want a sun bed.",5,2019,07,29
47,Perfect centrally located hotel for all of Barcelona.,"Loved the air conditioning in the suite after a long day wandering around the wonderful city.
Very comfortable bed.
Staff throughout the hotel were great.
The sunbeds were comfortable, though in short supply, at the pool area.",4,2019,07,29
47,Hen weekend,"Stayed for 3 nights with 7 others... Great selection for breakfast, rooftop bar and pool were amazing, friendly and helpful staff, excellent location. Would recommend! Will definitely stay here again... 5*",4,2019,07,29
47,Lovely hotel,"Check in was quick, we were upgraded on arrival to a larger room who was great as we were there for a birthday trip. The room was modern & clean, no faults, it was spacious with a nice powerful shower and large bed. 
There was refreshments near the lifts which were restocked every morning including juices, water & coffee. 
The pool area was nice, could be quite hard to get a bed if you wanted a bit of sunbathing time after / before sightseeing. Generally you had to be first out or last in. They had plenty of seating areas around which may have been better as beds as there was quite a lot of people by the pool at all hours with it being mid-July. The service was relatively slow but not painfully, we still enjoyed it. 
The hotel is well located with lots of restaurants, bars & a shopping centre next door. Also, the metro being straight outside was actually brilliant, it is so easy to get around using it with trains arriving every few minutes and the longest journey took us just over 10 minutes, we were there for 5 days and our pass cost just €10 each. Great value. 
We would stay again if we were to return. ",5,2019,07,28
47,"SUPERB SERVICE, SUPERB STAFF ESPECIALLY LINDA","This place is a must when in Barcelona!  I am all about reviews and always go by them as well as LOVE to post  wonderful treatment, service so others can experience that too.  Their location is amazing.  I was in Barcelona with my two kids and due to confusion I had only reservation for two.  I am impressed and deeply thankful to Linda that handled this confusion so professionally and accommodated my second kid for extra pay however instead of the room we were given a breathtaking suite, that was the highlight of our vacation! The pool area and service is amazing, I did read reviews about them but they exceeded all the expectations and I will definitely go back to them and strongly recommend them.  Thank you Linda, thank you for such wonderful treatment.

47,Perfect location ,"We stayed for two days in this beautiful, modern hotel. The location is perfect, just steps to the shops at Arenas and Plaza Espana. The pool on the eighth floor was fun, especially on hot days. The bed was comfortable, my room was clean and the staff was friendly. My only negative: check in was at 2 and I didn’t get my room until almost 2:30. I will definitely go back. ",4,2019,07,26
47,Another amazing visit to this fantastic Barcelona hotel,"We have been staying at this hotel for our annual girls trip for the last 3 years. I can not recommend this hotel highly enough. It is 20 mins from the airport on Aerobus (€10.20 for return ticket) and the bus stops right outside the hotel. It is located centrally right next to Espanya metro and a 10 minute cab ride to the port / beach where there are plentiful bars and restaurants. There is also a great shopping mall right next door with a good range of shops and eateries. The hotel is clean and smells beautiful. It is decorated to a high standard with an amazing rooftop pool and bar on the 8th floor. There is a spa but I have never visited it as we are always too busy.  I think it is being refurbished. We always sit up on the rooftop bar terrace which has day beds and pretty pool area seating with spectacular views to finish off the evening with a nice cocktail or bottle cava. Prices are pretty reasonable and the service is fabulous (staff so friendly). This time I was offered a free upgrade to a suite which was spacious and had a bathroom with rain shower and a bath overlooking stunning views over Barcelona. Minibar well stocked and a Nespresso machine for fresh coffee daily plus seating area, TV, sofa. Convenient late-ish check out at 12 midday and hotel safely stores bags until you return. For a high quality short break with fabulous service this hotel will take some beating.",5,2019,07,25
47,Great Location - Hotel needs an update,"The hotel is located in a great spot for tourism and transport, unfortunately the building needs a bit of an upgrade. This hotel is not priced according to the level of comfort and service I received. 

When we arrived we found our ""king sized bed"" to be two rolling twins pushed together. The mattresses were of the old spring variety and generally uncomfortable. When we first received our room the shower and A/C did not work. The front desk staff was helpful, sending someone up to look while we grabbed dinner. When we returned, the shower worked but the A/C and some of the lighting did not. Another person was sent up to look at the room and told me to request a new one after trying to fix the problems. When I went to the front desk I was treated very rudely by the management. 

He came up to the room & randomly jiggled the breakers in the fuse box until the light worked. Never once did he apologize for the time and hassle it had caused us. He also managed to get the A/C to work, providing you spin the dial all the way in the wrong direction and didn't expect the thermostat to work. This resulted in us waking up multiple times in the night (not hard because the bed was so uncomfortable) to turn the A/C on of off. I would wake up shivering or sweating depending on which phase the A/C was on. 

The free breakfast was great and almost enough to make us forget that we were sleep deprived and suffering from hip and back pain from the bed. ",2,2019,07,20
47,"dirty bathroom, good rooftop and location","i stayed in room 312. the bathroom was dirty with black mildew around the bathtub, on the wall, and on the shower head. My request of having the shower head cleaned was declined on the first day. Only after I show them the photo proof on the second  day, they agreed to clean it. Very disappointing. 
There is a rooftop, which is the only positive experience I can mention. 
There are hotels in the same price rage with much better rooms and services. I wouldn't stay in this hotel again. ",3,2019,07,19

47,Worst hotel ever - DO NOT RECOMMEND!,"For someone who travels frequently all I can say is that this is literally the worst hotel I ever stayed in. I'm sitting in the lobby right now and can't begin to describe my frustration. 

Let me start from the beginning. 

I landed in Barcelona on July 7th, 2019 and headed to the rooftop because the room was not ready yet. The service was utterly bad. No waiters to get me a menu or take my order. Even when they took my order it took hours before they got it. Salad without dressing. Anyways that's just the beginning and I thought it would pass. 

The rooms are terrible ! I felt like I was in the ghetto. the curtains in the bathroom are so old there was water dripping all over the bathroom. I used more thann 5 towels to control the water from leaking into the room. Not to forget the disgusting mold on the ceiling. Even the bed sheets were not tucked into the bed. The entire experience was REALLY not pleasant. 

Now let's move to another interesting point. I couldn't for once call the receptions from my room. All the numbers I was dialling were not working. I was here for 5 days not one answer! it wouldn't even go through! I tried literally every number and then had to run in the hallway looking for a room keeper to hand me whatever I needed or go down to the reception. 

last but not least, I'm about to travel back home after a 5 days conference. I'm exhausted and I have a long day ahead. Since I checked out and I have a few more hours before I leave, I'm sitting in the lobby on the couch sideways. I'm not sleeping, I don't have my legs up. I'm a normal girl who is sitting on the couch sideways. The butler comes up to me and tells me to sit straight. I thought it was a joke at first until the manager comes up to me and tells me to actually put my shoes on and sit straight. I told her ill put my shoes on but I REFUSE TO SIT STRAIGHT. 

What world does she live in? they're coming to tell people how to sit? I've been the fanciest hotels in the world and I've never been treated or told to do anything like that. Ill sit the way I wish to sit as long as I'm respectful. I'm not dressed inappropriately, i'm not sitting in a provocative way so I can't believe I was actually told that. This is the most disrespectful thing I've ever been told in my entire experience of travelling. For a customer who has paid money to stay at a hotel I deserve the minimum of respect. 

I highly don't recommend you coming to this hotel for any reason. Rooms are bad and service is worse! 

The name of the terrible manager was CRISTINA GOMEZ. Someone needs to teach her a thing or two about hospitality and management.",1,2019,07,11
47,You pay for the view and the pool ,"I would not recommend this hotel for Barcelona - although the view was nice, especially from the rooftop, it is crazy overpriced for what you get. AC was bad unless you can rig up a card to leave in the slot while you are not in the room. After about 12 hrs of constant AC it worked well. Shower situation was horrible - crazy water pressure. I was on a conference and everyone i talked to said they basically created a pool in the bathroom the first try. Not only that, there was mould in the shower, which I wouldn’t expect for a hotel with 4 stars. No plugs by the bed at all - incredibly inconvenient. Then on our last day the maids tried to come in and clean our room at 930 AM! Check out is noon and we had not been to the desk to check out so I’m not sure why. This hotel is not worth it, in my opinion ",3,2019,07,10
47,No air-con in JULY!?,"I stayed here on business on 9th July 2019.  The overall cleanliness, staff and pool were great.  The air con... not so much.

The air con didn't seem to work when I had arrived, however thought that I needed my key in the power socket for the air con to work with the lights etc.

12:30 AM my first call to reception asking if there is anything they can do to fix the air con.  They said it was not possible until 8AM the next morning. 

3:00AM my second call to reception.  Unable to sleep in a room with no air con, no fan and is 28 degrees on the thermostat.  Tried opening a window but unfortunately being located on one of the busiest roundabouts in Barcelona does not help.  Apparently the hotel is full and they cannot put me in another room.  There is nothing that can be done and it is impossible to  sleep in this room.

7:30AM Checkout.  I made my complaint known to the staff at front desk.  Apparently it was a known problem from the morning before that all rooms ending is '31 did not have working air con (this is the part that really wound me up).  Why was I put in a room that was already identified as having problems?  To make matters worse, I was apparently 'upgraded to this room' so I was not eligible for any compensation.

If it wasn't for the doors to the pool area being locked, I would have slept on a sunbed and actually gotten some sleep.

Not ideal for a night away with business. 

2 pieces of advice for the management within the hotel:

1)  Don't put people in rooms already knowing that they are faulty.  Particularly in Summer.

2)  Please clarify your definition of an upgrade.",1,2019,07,10
47,Shearings trip,"Had a fantastic time to Barcelona with Shearings, drivers are very knowledgeable and informative. I opted for the tour rather than just taking off by myself as I don't think I would have seen as much. Only downside was I didn't get to see the Sagrada familia because the coach wasn't allowed to park, which is a shame. Did see the Olympic stadium and Barcelona FB football ground and the surrounding areas",5,2019,07,09
47,Great location ,"The rooms itself were very basic, bathroom could have done with a bit of repair as could the front door, however the roof top pool provided gorgeous views of the area and is very centrally located to lots of fantastic restaurants, the arenas shopping centre, and has a metro stop right at the front door which makes using public transport a breeze! Breakfast provided by the hotel was ok, “hot” foods were cold, even at the start of breakfast when it opened",3,2019,07,09
47,Feedback on stay experience,"The staff at the reception was very courteous and helpful. The experience in dealing with the staff was very pleasant and friendly.

Nice pool area with good service. If you are looking for a good hotel for you and the family this is a no brainer. ",4,2019,07,08
47,"Good rooms, great locaiton, but service should be (much) better at this price tag","Room facilities were very good. Rooms are relatively recently decorated, A/C is good, bathroom facilities are excellent - but service from staff could be improved substantially to make a 4* hotel experience.

Reception staff were excellent in accommodating us with our baby and offering an executive room with a cot.
Then on, service went downwards, for example: 
- a couple of days, room was left uncleaned (even thought it was vacated on or before 12.00 noon) and we had to go to the reception and ask that it is attended to when we were back in the evening. 
- for 4 or 5 days, the bathroom sink was blocked (and getting worse) before anybody noticed 
- accessibility to the breakfast area (for the disabled or people with prams should be thought of again)
- tables during breakfast were consistently missing coffee spoons, napkins, etc.
- staff at the terrace pool bar were unhelpful and veeeeeeeeery slow to serve guests 
- one of the two lifts getting to the terrace pool area were faulty for a couple of days - staff didn't seem particularly bothered about it
- cleaners (accidentally, I assume) picked up my white t-shirt, I guess while lifting the bed linen - nobody cared to return it back to me. I asked at the reception, they didn't have it as lost property - they didn't even apologize!",3,2019,07,08
47,Bus to and from the airport,Nice plaza very busy there is a bus which goes back and fourth to the airport easiest way in my opinion.  There are luggage holding services that are not far. Very much in the center of the city and a nice area to visit.,4,2019,07,07
47,Incredible service,Definitely the best choice if you’re visiting Barcelona - the staff is very professional and helpful which is amazing. They offer prompt help and are incredibly helpful and responsive. Great location also!,5,2019,07,06
47,Review of Catalonia,"Nice hotel. The sheets need to be changed daily.  The hotel must place umbrellas at the pool.  It's to hot to  sit next to the pool to watch our kids without an umbrella there.

Food was good. Service was a bit slow.",3,2019,07,04
47,Just okay,"The hotel in general was fine. Location was okay with several restaurants within walking distance. While we appreciated the upgraded room with a view of the plaza, our room reeked of smoke. I specifically asked the person checking us in to confirm we had a non-smoking room because I have asthma. She replied that there are no smoking rooms in the hotel. Well, there either used to be smoking rooms or someone made the bathroom a smoking room in this particular room. Luckily the bathroom was in the hallway and we could shut the door to where we slept. Otherwise, we would have had to move rooms or hotels. Would not stay again.",3,2019,07,01
47,Great European Hotel at an excllent location,The location of this hotel was perfect and near many sites. It was also a close cab ride to the convention center and other attractions. The hotel was clean and European style and the rooms updated. The roof top pool was great!,5,2019,07,01
47,An OK stay,"Its the small details that ruined this experience for me. It’s a good hotel in a fantastic location, but they missed the mark on the small things that are essential to every hotel stay. I will compliment them on the Handy device. That little gadget was a life saver. ",3,2019,06,30
47,very nice,"I was here for a day only, but great location, very impressed with the rooftop bar/pool area. I would recommend. 
It is near stores, restaurants, subway, tourist attractions, and there are cab right outside all the time. ",5,2019,06,30
47,Good hotel but with some drawbacks,"We chose this hotel because of its rooftop terrace and pool. The idea was to be able to retreat from the hot and crowded streets once or twice during the day. But the other guest reviewers who have mentioned the noise are unfortunately right. They play sharp, loud pop music from a twenty something Bose speakers spread around the entire terrace leaving every spot really noisy. Adding the sound from nearby construction work and the noise pollution is complete. That’s what we thought. But when the pride parade concert started 100 meters away and the crew at the bar insisted on leaving the pop music on, resulting in two competing songs at all time, we had to give up. Even our three teenagers think it is too much. 
A suggestion would be to keep the music down in the morning until noon so that there’s a chance to escape a couple of hours at least. Or switch to low sound spa/lounge music. 
Since we had to stay more in our room on the fourth floor than planned we also feel the view towards the backyard as more of a draw back. Even in the middle of the day it is rather dark and gloomy. Also the run down bath tub and poor quality tap (temperature on the water varies with several degrees making the water in the shower cool and hot randomly) is a bad alternative to staying by a pool. Had we known about this we would have stayed at a higher quality room in another hotel without the terrace. 
The best things about this hotel as far as I can judge is the trendy lobby, swift elevators and an efficient check in. ",3,2019,06,29
47,nice one,"organice the poolopen times better, that every staff now it. and repair the keycardsystem. room was pretty nice with a great view. it is not so far with the taxi to the basilica and rambler. nice restaurants in the neberhood!",4,2019,06,26
47,Arguably the worst guest customer service ever!,"Booked this hotel on the recommendation of Spanish friends for a three night break. The brief, sunshine, pool, sleep and good food!

Check in was slow, ok I can deal with that.... young adults sat outside my room at 3am shouting and laughing with no one answering the reception phone..... I could deal with that too by opening my door and asking them to move.  On the rooftop pool at 1545 having a lovely time and being told there was no more service and we had to leave by 1600 for a private event was booked that was a blow! Where do you go?? The lobby was full with a conference attendees and the restaurants closed! The staff said no manager would come to the pool area so I went down to reception! A member of staff came back after 20 mins and said we could take a taxi to a pool at sister hotel, not ideal when you’re in your swimming costume and paying full rate for your hotel!

I’ve just received an email from the hotel accusing me of lying as apparently we would have been told in the morning of the pool closing, errrr nope we weren’t, not one guest around the pool had! Trust me I’d have checked out and gone somewhere else! No compensation, no apology, I’m gobsmacked! In my line of work I book over 3,000 hotel rooms per annum and I would expect this response from a two star hotel. I never rant on here and always give hotels a chance to repair any negative experiences, we all have daily challenges sometimes right? However, today, I want to share my experiences as I don’t think the cost of this hotel is reflective in the service you might expect.....",1,2019,06,25
47,A good choice to stay in Barcelona,"Excellent accessibility ... to / from the airport via the Aerobus right at the door step. Metro also is right at he door step.

47,Excellent,"Excellent location, service, breakfast, I welcome drink. The hotel is opposite Magic Fountain, close the metro, close the Aerobus stop to airport. I like terrace on the roof with pool. I stay only one night, but I hope I wiil come back. Thank you very much. ",5,2019,06,22
47,No bad overall,"It did the job. Location was convenient and you could go off site for cheaper, better food. Room did the job, not sure there was any benefit for the room upgrade, however room was clean and bed was comfortable",4,2019,06,22
47,FANTASTIC STAY after our cruise!,"We LOVED the spacious rooms and location of the hotel. The rooms were clean and loved the amenities too. I would only advise to install outlets next to the beds so people can charge their phones or use their technology in bed to charge for the next day. Also no outlets for the coffee pot which was frustrating to make coffee in the bathroom. Other than that lovely hotel, with a beautiful heated pool on the roof top, and a decent gym. Great location across from the national museum, next to a wonderful shopping mall, and near our favorite restaurant franchise Tapa Tapa

Lulah and Anna were FANTASTIC at the front desk, helping us check in when we arrived early, recommending where to explore, and helping us find another night stay when our flight was unexpectedly cancelled. Even the doorman (tall man in a suit with charming smile who has been with this hotel over 20 years) was so helpful hailing a cab for us and getting our luggage in the car in record time so we could catch our flight! The staff was world class indeed and made our stay sooo muc more pleasant.",5,2019,06,17
47,Great hotel in Barcelona downtown,"The Catalonia Barcelona Plaza is an excellent hotel locaed in Paze Espanya. Service quality is top-notch. High value for price you pay. when panning your next trip to Barcelona, I highy recommend you to consider Catalonia Barcelona Plaza as your preferred choice.",4,2019,06,17
47,Smoke smell in the room,The hotel is located in a nice place. I tried to change room because of smell of smoke. The staff said the would fix it. I was at a conference and was not able to find a hotel close to the hotel. Got a small compensation.,2,2019,06,17
47,"Perfect view, room and atmosphere","After a hectic business trip, the Catalonia was the perfect place to escape to. Lovely, spacious room. Fantastic view. Friendly and approachable staff. And a great bar!
Highly recommend staying here!!",5,2019,06,17
47,Booked thru Viator wich is part of Tripadvisor,"We ( a group of 10 )are actually checking in the hotel today June 14, 2019. Upon arrival they have booked us on the Standard room, however, conditions of the rooms are very poor. Bathrooms are very disgusting and we have booked this tour since back in 2018. The front desk won't do anything to accommodate us in better rooms. Attaching pictures. They claim they are full. NOT ACCEPTABLE!",2,2019,06,14
47,Cards Scammed,"I stayed here in October last year and had to show a card at the desk when we arrived.
On the 10th of May five of us that were in the group had our cards scammed.
This is the only place were we all had to present a card to stay there.
Be very very carefull.",3,2019,06,13
47,Expensive breakfast,"Because of an early flight, I ordered a pick-nick box instead of breakfast which was below standard, and this for €20. Shame! Noisy environment outside. Unstable temperatures in meeting rooms, where I catched cold.",3,2019,06,11
47,Stunning View,"This hotel is spectacular! My husband and I decided to go big and book the Executive Suite and all I can say is WOW!! This is by far the nicest hotel room I’ve ever stayed in. Not only do you get panoramic views of the city from almost every angle, but they put so much thought in to every detail of the room. 

The room itself is very spacious, my guess would be around 1,500 square feet. It features a living room and dining room area, as well as 2 bathrooms and a bedroom. In addition, the room offers a fully stocked mini bar. Last but not least, the room also provides a “handy”, a free phone to use while in Barcelona for GPS purposes or free phone calls, which came in handy (see what I did there), since my cell phone provider from the states was not working very well.

If you are on the fence about booking the executive suite, I assure you that you will not regret it! The location is in perfect walking distance for many restaurants and even the Museu Nacional D’art De Catalunya.",5,2019,06,09
47,"Average Hotel, Expensive and Needs Refurbishment.","Can’t believe how disappointed I was with the hotel.

The Location is very good and we picked it due to the location for a concert and the reviews which seemed very positive.

The room we were in was tired and old, it was incredibly hot and the air conditioner makes no difference whatsoever, also the noise from the corridor and the street on the lower levels are incredible.

We asked for something as simple as an Iron and we were told it may not be possible, this is a four star hotel or what? 

In my previous reviews you’ll see the hard rock hotel which was cheaper. So, This hotel was more expensive than a 5* Hotel in Ibiza and honestly it was embarrassing. 

Still, you live and learn and I learned to not stay here again :)

There are better 2/3 * hotels close by, I’d suggest looking at them until the entire hotel is refurbished (as that seems to be the copy and paste excuse as to why some of the rooms are like a flashback to 1990).

For the price they charge, it doesn’t stack up.",2,2019,06,08
47,"Wow, this place is AMAZING !","When you drive up to the Hotel Catalonia Barcelona Plaza you know it is going to be an amazing stay. Surrounded by iconic buildings with thousands of people who came from all around the world to be exactly where you are staying and have the same views that you do.

My wife and I have travelled the world including places like the Maldives, Tanzania Four Seasons, Bora Bora, and I have to say this hotel rises to the highest standards that we have stayed in.

We were lucky enough to have the pleasure of being helped by Andrea during out stay. Her knowledge of Barcelona, detailed responses and amazing customer service is one of the reasons why we now trust the Catalonia brand. We had never stayed in a Catalonia hotel before but after dealing with Andrea and the rest of the staff, we will certainly be back for our travels throughout Europe.

Barcelona is an amazing place that has so much energy. If you stay in Barcelona, right make to do it right. If you stay at this hotel you will not be disappointed. Posting a view from the room so you can see how amazing it is.

Some tips I have would be to get a suite if you can. Pay a little more, they are incredible. You will not regret your decision. The other one is enjoy the restaurants at the hotel. They are very good and should be taken advantage of.

Thank you Catalonia for an amazing stay!",5,2019,06,08
47,Just Relaxing,"Our first coup trip without any plan, I needed to check where to eat that why I used this app.
People are so relaxing here, I cannot image any face would look like if German people had same life attitudes. Love this city!",5,2019,06,08
47,Super!,"Tired and hungry, arrived at the hotel late in the evening, was met with the most helpful receptionist, to be told our room was upgraded & we were given a card for a future discount in Catalonia chain! thank you !",5,2019,06,06
47,Barcelona,Spent a fabulous day in this vibrant city. Could have stayed longer so much to see. We had been before for a few days but this was just a whistle stop visit. Love it. Plenty of shopping if you want that. Walked miles. Make sure you have comfy footwear as there is a lot to see,5,2019,06,05
47,weekend sightseeing,"The view from the fifth floor room is incredibly beautiful to Plaça de les Cascades. quick, easy public transport to attractions and the airport. sunny roof pool, cozy bar and delicious cocktails. I enjoyed every minute, I can only recommend it!! (choose: square view room!!)",5,2019,06,03
47,Any,"I am not used to do these comments. The only comment I can do is that the door of the bathroom did not close.

I consider this option unusual because it does not define clearly what you want me to consider",5,2019,06,02
47,Vacation,"Excellent stay, comfortable hotel and great location. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Barcelona. The location is perfect with the Metro right outside the door and buses easily accessible.",5,2019,06,02
47,"Gorgeous hotel, but needs maintenance and staff not friendly","This is a gorgeous, very big, hotel.  It is on the Plaza de Espanya.  We were able to view the ""Magic Fountain of Montjuic"" display from the roof top (8th floor), without having to fight the crowds.  It is very close to the metro station, so you can get anywhere in the city pretty easily. 
The hotel is so large, with only 1 bank of elevators for the first 7 floors, that it felt like I had to walk a mile to get to my room on the opposite side from the elevators.
The room was large and the beds were comfortable, but it faced the interior, so my view was the tent-like top of the restaurant.  The bathroom tile was in very bad repair (broken or cracked tile fixed with what looked like spackling).
The staff seemed to be a bit surly and unhelpful any time that I had to interact with them.",4,2019,06,02
47,BarcaGP,Gorgeous hotel with the most fantastic restaurants (Mediterranean and Japanese) with outstanding food and service.  Pool bar area was good but only had a brief experience if it.  All areas Service excellent except the bar within the hotel which was poorly staffed and very expensive (unless you were drinking wine).  Spotlessly clean and rooms very well equipped with excellent Wi-fi ,5,2019,05,31
47,My review,"I was happy with my stay.  I don't any specific negatives to report. It would have been nice to have a bit more drinking water in the rooms.   One negative -- don't require your guests to take a voluntary survey and then have to write a 200 word assay.  I, for one, am much to busy to do this.  Thank-you.

47,Excellent experience at Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,"I had reserved my room at this hotel for me and my wife and had not listed my 1 year old child. When I arrived there, Linda very kindly upgraded my room to a very luxurious and spacious suite with an excellent view of national arm museum. We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and we will never forget our experience there. Thank you very much Linda and all the staff for your hospitality and great service.",5,2019,05,28

47,Excellent choice of hotel when in Barcelona,"We stayed for 4 days on the 5 th floor and got a lovely spacious room with a big double bed, sofa and chair - plentiful of wardrobe space, iron and ironing board, safe and a well stocked fridge. Very quiet looking into a courtyard. The bathroom was massive with a powerful rain shower and all amenities incl shaving kit and toothbrush etc. Lovely products. Breakfast downstairs behind the reception area with choices for everyone. There are also chefs available making omelette, scrambled eggs or anything hot. Great selection of hot and cold delicacies. Fabulous sun decks and pool on the 8th floor - separate lift. Love to come back and stay for longer the next time.",5,2019,05,19
47,It was a pleasure to visit.,"t was a pleasure to visit.The staff was polite, the room was clean. Very good service. I have been visiting this hotel for years and always is a high quality service. I will recomend to all of my friends.",5,2019,05,16
47,Perfect Couples City Break,"Perfect location, right on a popular metro line. Amazing views from the roof top bar and the pool is beautiful to refresh in after sunbathing. Room was very clean and very comfortable. Bathroom was a great size and always clean. ",5,2019,05,13
47,Excellent hotel with great customer service,"We arrived at the hotel from Barcelona airport on the airport bus.  The airport bus only has 3 stops. The hotel is the first stop, a journey time of around 15 minutes.  Don't bother getting a taxi unless you want to get ripped off.  The bus costs five euro 90 cents,  a taxi 30 euros.

Upon arrival in the reception area are two cold fruit infused water fountains.  Nice touch when you need a drink while waiting in a queue to check in.  Our twin room was overlooking Placa d espanya and its beautiful fountain,  magic fountain of montjuic.  We Could not of wished for a nicer room,location and view.  The 360 degree view roof top pool is amazing. Finished to a high standard with top quality beds, chairs and stools.  Not to mention the view. We researched and researched hotels with pools.  We definitley booked the right hotel.  I will be returning without a doubt. Next door to the hotel is a coverted bull ring,  Las Arenas.  This is such a great place, bars and restaurants on the top with 360 degree views, stunning. We rented bikes from a bike shop around 10 minute walk from the hotel on the main street called ""Just Bike"", 10 euros a day.  Fantastic bikes and customer service would highly recommend hiring a bike during a stay in the city.  Had a fantastic stay here and could not fault anything. I would also like to mention a English girl who works in reception at the hotel cannot remember her name but she was a credit to the hotel.",5,2019,05,08
47,Love this hotel!,"Great location,helpful friendly staff,breakfast time a treat...! Hotel is a nice walk to Rambles,subway outside the door,always taxis waiting. Again,location ,location,location. Would not stay anywhere else in Barcelona",5,2019,05,08
47,Great Staff,"I stayed at this hotel for 6 nights. There were issues with one of the rooms, and the great staff there made sure they were corrected. Especially the bellman Alfredo, he was extra helpful and made sure to take care of our needs. Thanks!",4,2019,05,08
47,Nice hotel for staying during business trip.,Every year we are staying at this hotel while visiting the Bridal Fashion Week in Batselon. We can only say a huge thank to the staff of this hotel for making our stay calm and comfortable.The room is kept clean. During breakfast there is a wide selection of food and drinks. The metro is only two steps away from the hotel. The shuttle bus to the airport in three steps from the hotel.,5,2019,05,07
47,City Break,"Excellent Hotel in the perfect location.
Public Services was readily available right outside the door.
Receptionist Lynda & Lucy where extremely friendly, helpful & informative & helped us tremendously in making our stay so enjoyable",4,2019,05,06
47,Ideal location - pray you dont have a problem though,"I cannot fault the location and some of its features, The pool and its view are gorgeous, the beds are comfortable, everything is clean and breakfast is lovely.
We stayed here twice within a 5 day trip. We had to share a bed (on a business trip) despite booking a twin - it was very embarrassing. On our second visit our shower flooded the bathroom and hallway leaving items damaged and very little was done to correct any of it. A lack of empathy and service overall considering the price.",3,2019,05,04
47,Okay,"The hotel is clean and really cool but we got a really bad experience with the HVAC the first night: just as we turned it on the room started to smell really really bad as if something was getting burned. 

I also think the rooms are missing electric outlets near the bed for the clients to charge their phones. The bathroom was always clean but the placement of the shower is weird in relation to the tube. 

Breakfast is awesome!",3,2019,05,04
47,Great place for more than a town,"In such a place, the envy to come back to Barcelona is just a normality. Due to Linda, the check in / check out formalities were very quickly. The breakfast was excellent, both for the children and the adults. The access to the transport network is very easy and convenient. Definitely we should come back!  ",5,2019,05,03
47,Unremarkable,Hotel was pleasant and maybe it was the weather but staff outside the reception were very thin on the ground. Pool bar did not open.  We were told we had been upgraded to an executive room but ended up paying more than confirmation email - so maybe not!,3,2019,05,02
47,Vynikajúce ubytovanie priamo v centre mesta,"excellent accommodation right in the city center. Large rooms, nicely furnished. Very pleasant lady from Slovakia at the reception who advised us everything we needed to know. Breakfast super rich, colorful, and very tasty. only what was not good was the noise from the corridor near the room.",5,2019,04,30
47,The Big Change,While Barcelona is very interesting and I have been there several times before this time it wasn't the same. I rate the city as 5 stars but the crowds were bigger than I have ever experienced there. Another thing is the crime rate has increased. Not that your life is in jeopardy but the thieves and lower level crooks are on the prowl.  On 2 different occasions we were warned about people stealing luggage from tourists.  And don't change money with anyone on the street.  I am experienced traveler with 60 countries under my belt. That said a nice old gentleman stepped into a money exchange while I was there and said he would show me a better place.  He said he needed USD and he would trade his Euros saying we could help each other out. I watched him carefully made sure I got the amount he promised. Only to find out what looked like a Euro was really old Greek  currency of no value. He knew how to hold it.  So 300 dollars loss later and he was gone like an Olympian and I  had nothing.  So don't trust anyone in Barcelona. Hope this helps anyone going there.,5,2019,04,28
47,nice hotel - freindly personal,Good breakfast. Clear.  Quiet - but double bed transfers the movements of the other person. Bedroom with little technical failure. the bicycles were stored without complications in the hotel at night. The cocktail bar had fewer drinks than the cocktail menu.,4,2019,04,28
47,Nice hotel. Obnoxious managers,The hotel is comfortable but the lobby is soul-less. They have a wonderful piano there. Pity they stop people from playing it? That would at least make the hotel have a little bit of character which it desperately needs. Grey. Dead. Devoid of life.,1,2019,04,28
47,"We will be back, for sure!","I couldn't imagine better birthday gift for my partner! Staff was very friendly and polite, so helpful in every and each ways! Almudena organised a surprise for my partner (she gave us Executive Double Room with Square View, bottle of really good alcohol along with amazing dresser and plate of delicious fruits) and Linda really made sure we are going to experience nothing but flawless and excellent service! Great location, superb staff, restaurant with delicious food nearby, amazing unforgettable views... I would highly recommend to everybody!",5,2019,04,24
47,The besta location in Town!,"It is clean hotel with helpfoul and kind personality. All the staff are wery friendly.
The location is top for all the city toures and allso all the trips outside of the town (Monserat). If U are a bit of a sport soul, there is a near Motijuc park, there U cann jog or just have a long walk.",5,2019,04,23
47,Very good hotel,"Very good hotel, centrally located at plaza Espanya. A lot of restaurants nearby. Breakfast is absolutely fantastic. Stayed for 5 nights and felt very much at home. Only room for improvement are the bathrooms. At least in our room it needed to be renovated to match the overall high standard of the hotel.",4,2019,04,18
47,A short but sweet trip,It was a very nice experience at Catalonia Barcelona Plaza hotel. The service was excellent and a very good idea of having snacks available near the lift on each floor. There are numerous facilities which made my business trip a great experience and the location also allowed me to go out and discover the region easily.,5,2019,04,16
47,Great service poor facilities ,"Totally uncomfortable. The building is old inside and requires a refresh. I was given an ok very large room and accepted it as I am traveling in a group so don’t have the luxury of choice.  Bathrooms are horrible.The toilet does not flush properly despite maintenance coming up to fix it. I was willing to pay for a better room but they are full. I am so tempted to move to another hotel right now. It is my 4th visit to Spain and this is the first trip where I have used the Catalonia brand. I’m Very disappointed. 

In Madrid I stayed in Catalonia gran via for one night with 3 nights booked for next week. The bathroom was brand new so great but the rooms smelled bad. I’ve now moved that booking elsewhere. The staff are very pleasant and helpful at both properties and really try to make you comfortable but the property upkeep and maintenance is very poor. I honestly believe that star ratings should include clientele comfort. Most of these types of so called superior tourist hotels have great general areas but the rooms especially Bathrooms need work. I have stayed in other great hotels all over Spain but right now I feel like I never want to return here ever again. ",1,2019,04,12
47,THE BEST HOTEL IN BARCELONA!,"We were looking for a nice hotel in the center of Barcelona, to have a close distance to all of what the city has to offer. 
And after choosing this hotel everything was amazing the location, the room types, the access to the pool and spa, etc. The hotel is a short 5 min walk to the famous Ramblas street and 5 min to the popular shopping street Passeig de Gracia. 

We love the hotel so much that we always return when we are in Barcelona, and as returning guests the management treats us very nicely. We want to give a special thanks to the manager for being very kind, helpful and friendly. 

DEFINITELY RECOMMEND this hotel for families and for business trips as well, because of the amazing location and hotel facilities. 

",5,2019,04,12
47,Awsome,The Hotel is a very good hotel and the location is excellent. The staff were vey friendly and provided a great customer service. The room was very clean.

47,Excellent hotel for business trip/conference,"I stayed 1 night to attend a conference and was upgraded to an executive room on 5th floor (with inner court view). Very convenient location with stop of Aerobus (airport shuttle bus) and Underground/metro at Plaza d'Espanya. Spacious,  comfortable and clean room. Impeccable. Only amenities I missed were tissues and body lotion. Rooftop terrace  with cocktail bar and pool has stunning views. We enjoyed the cocktails. Conference venue is also very good. If I would come to Barcelona for a city trip, this hotel is excellent value however you need to take underground or bus to go to touristic hotspots such as barrio gottico, La Rambla etc.",5,2019,04,07
47,Excellent business location,This is a wonderful Hotel in the heart of Barcelona. If offers all it takes for a professional business meeting. Als well suited for a Family location or a leisure trip to Barcelona. I very much recommend this Hotel.,5,2019,04,06

Roof top and pool were fantastic. Excellent breakfast.  I hope to come again as soon as possible!!!",5,2019,04,01
47,Bed bugs,"Be careful! I got badly bitten by bed bugs. I travelled with some friends, separate beds and I was badly bitten. My friend in the bed next to mine, got bitten but not as bad as me. I did not realise it until the last day of my visit, when I went to the pharmacy to get medicine as I couldn't stop scratching my neck, my arms and parts of my legs. I thought it was mosquito bites, but there were no mosquitos anywhere, and the pharmacist asked if I was staying in a hotel and said to me to inform the hotel. I did inform them when I went back to recover my luggage to head out to a different hotel.",1,2019,04,01
47,Wonderful location and friendly service team.,"Fair price for the service and location.. Friendly personal, helpful.
The sightseeing from the window spectacular. The Saturday evening I could admired from the window the spectacular show of the fountain with is placed in the Plaza de Espana.
From the swimmingpool one can admire the night in the Barcelona.
The underground, the bus, taxi are very well communicated and come in time.
Breakfast with variety a type of food.

",5,2019,03,30
47,HOT ROOM,"We stayed in room 617 for three nights.  Although the weather was absolutely perfect outside, the room reached temperatures of 28.5 degrees C (80+ F).  The air conditioning did not work.  The window opened, but the only way to get a breeze was to open the room door for a cross breeze.  People sitting in the courtyard were quite loud.

Otherwise, the room was very nice.  Bed was comfortable, minibar well-stocked. Perfect location for lots of attractions!",4,2019,03,27
47,Best hotel in Barcelona,"Absolutely loved my stay, location and the amazing friendly service from the staff  They are an asset to your team  I will definitely stay within the Catalonia brand in Barcelona as your stands far out weigh 4*! Thank you for a wonderful stay ill be back :) ",5,2019,03,25
47,amazing,I can not praise the hotel and it's staff anymore highly. They went above and beyond to make sure me and my partner had an amazing stay at their hotel. The room and view are beautiful. I would recommend a trip to their terrace as the views are out of this world. cannot wait to come back.,5,2019,03,23

47,Great location and wonderful staff,"Highly recommend!  Hop on Hop off bus stops nearby, as well as the Aerobus from the airport.  There is also a metro station right in front of the hotel.  Noise from hallway can be diminished if you shut the extra door between the entryway and bedroom. Wonderful friendly staff and perfect location.  Would definitely stay there again!  Also close to magic fountain which was beautiful.",5,2019,03,21
47,TOP hotel on perfect location both for tourist or business trips to Barcelona !,"- perfect location next to Metro station, few stops from old city centre and direct bus shuttle service to Airport (Aerobus)
- very beautiful and clean rooms, big bathroom with rain shower, very nice views to Plaza de Espanya and Palace of Montjuic
- no noise from traffic inside the room, very quiet (I was on the 5th floor)
- excellent breakfast with very much choice, freshly baked pancakes, eggs, waffles, fruits,....
- very nice roof terrace on the 8th floor with cocktail bar and swimming pool and magnificent views of Barcelona

- nice shopping mall next door (Arenas de Barcelona) with nice restaurants on top",5,2019,03,18
47,Business Trip,"Great hotel and highly recommend. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Bedroom was excellent.

This hotel is worth a try when you are visiting Barcelona for business and pleasure. Great facilities and food.",5,2019,03,18
47,Barcelona Marathon Stay,"Air con not being on was the only issue, everything else was really good. Location was great, food was great access to transportation was great but it was a really hot weekend for me and with the air con not being on at this time of year made it difficult to sleep at night which isn't great preparation for a marathon.",4,2019,03,18
47,"Great location, beautiful rooms","We picked this hotel because we wanted to be near the Barcelona Sants train station. Turns out it wasn’t that close (but still an easy 10-15 minute walk) but so much more convenient to other metro lines. It also has a direct connection to the train going to Montserrat and the shuttle buses to the airport stop directly outside. 

Besides transportation, lots of restaurants and cafes nearby, together with little shops, pharmacies and bank ATMs. 

The hotel itself is very classy, rooms and bathroom very nicely furnished and designed. The only downside was the air conditioning that seemed to only blow warm air no matter how we tried to reset it. The rooms facing the city have afternoon sun so they are warm, but with the window open it got a bit noisy since there’s a busy roundabout right outside. Great view of the boulevards leading out from there especially the one leading up the hill to the National Art Museum of Catalunya.

We would definitely stay there again if we want a convenient location but pick a different one if we want a slower paced vacation with more peace and quiet.",4,2019,03,17
47,Conference great facilities and beautiful views of the fountains from the roof terrace.,I liked this hotel and loved the pool top bar and terrace enjoying a sangria in the evening I arrived. The room was clean and spacious. Garden room with breakfast was the best I have had so far in a Barcelona hotel. Please stay here it's luxorius and good to go to the airport or access the metro to go anywhere in Barcelona!,4,2019,03,15
47,Magic place,"This was our second to stay in Barcellona, this time with another couple and their two little kids and we elected to stay at the same hotel and have had two great experiences. The rooms are lovely and spacious and accommodate four people which sometimes is hard to find. The staff are helpful and the restaurant is lovely. But the location is the hotel’s best feature. It is just outside the metro and less than a 5 minute walk from beautiful fountains. Price was very reasonable.",5,2019,03,14
47,Very good Hotel. Friendly staff and beautiful rooms.,They arrange everything for us when my wallet was stolen in the Metro. The Metro is under the Hotel and perfect for day trips.  We get a beautiful room at the 5th floor with a stunning view. The pool and bar are beautiful. The room was clean.,5,2019,03,11
47,Great hotel. Perfect location. Perfect staff,10++ perfect hotel. Room on 5th floor is beautiful. Bed is super. The hospitality from staf was great. In Barcelona city the stole my wallet. Serge an Julia did everything to make our holiday still possible. Thanks again.,5,2019,03,06
47,Excellent location for tourist,"I stayed there for 4 nights and this is my first trip in Barcelona. I had a long flight and arrived a bit late in the hotel, the front office staff Lulah is very friendly and helpful,she escorted me to the room and helped with the luggage as I was very tired after 15 hours flight. 

The location of the hotel is excellent, airport bus in in front, take 20 minutes to the airport, and metro is just step out of the door from the hotel, if your room is facing the espanya plaza, then you can even see the fountain show in the evening, the view is just amazing. For me as a first time tourist in Barcelona , it's just perfect location, almost 20 minutes by public transportation to everywhere, and if you want to visit mountjunic, bus 150 is also just in front of the hotel. I would say it's more than a hotel, it's a landmark.

For hotel facility, everything is under a good condition and well maintained, amenities are also very good. I would like to stay here again when I visit Barcelona.",5,2019,03,05
47,Catalania Barcelona Plaza,"Great hotel, great location, great staff, good value for money, will definitely stay there again.  After long week at a Substandard hotel during MWC, 1 night at this hotel was exactly what was required.!",5,2019,03,04
47,Not a 4 star hotel,"Clearly not a 4 star hotel, more like a 2.5 star. More on the lines of a Residence inn or Fairfield inn. Small rooms with dated bathrooms and no counter for toiletries. Water temperature not consistent during showers. Room thermastat doesn’t work. Only one power outlet for your stuff. And the room and entire floor smelled like an ashtray. And I heard the elevator throughout the night even though I was far down the hall from the elevator shafts. ",2,2019,03,04

47,"Great hotel in the center of Barcelona, near Metro station, restaurants and parc","Very good hotel with large rooms with rain shower, 5th floor is executive floor and has view on the Placa Espana and the museum on the hill. Good breakfast, lunch and bar option. Everything provided by friendly personnel. Hotel is near Metro station and can be easily reached by the train from Barcelona Airport to Placa Espana [end station]. Next door there is the old arena which has been transformed into a shopping mall and on the 4th floor several restaurants with a great view over Barcelona. Hotel is worth the stay when visiting the city for a few days busness or pleasure wise.",4,2019,02,21
47,Stolen Belongings in room,"I left the room for the day at around 11am and was back around 5pm. The room was cleaned but my exercise bands, the coffees and milk and water, and last but not least, my toiletries including expensive cologne and creams were all gone. First they said the supervisor was gone for the day and will email us what they know the day after.

I had to check out on the same evening so I went to the front desk and tried to sort it out. They didn't really care until I said I must then file a police report, otherwise I'm accepting that nobody should be responsible. Then they changed they story  and said the cleaning lady ""didn't see anything"". Then after a while, they said they'd go through the rubbish to see if there's anything.

I had to catch my flight so I left them my number and email etc. Of course there absolutely no news since. They have absolutely no intention of resolving this. Book at your own risk.",1,2019,02,17

47,Andy’s birthday,We decide to book fairly last minute to celebrate my husband birthday. Barcelona is one of our favorite cities and our first time in this hotel. Whole weekend was very special and the hotel helped to make this possible ,5,2019,01,26
47,well located hotel but outdated rooms (on the 3rd floor),"The hotel is very well located.The staff at the reception and restaurant is very friendly.Breakfast is excellent.The rooms however (on the 3rd) floor are very oudated with some issues (one of the wall lamps hung from the wall, the shower head hung loose causing the water to spray in all directions, and the cleanliness of the room was not what you expect from a four star hotel)I was travelling with colleagues. Some of them stayed on the fifth floor and were very satisfied. This floor is modernized.",3,2019,01,21
47,Good location but not well maintained... and infested by cockroach !,"The location is indeed quite convenient - on plaza espana, next to Montjuic with good connections to the airport. 
The hotel itself is getting old and clearly under-maintained - rust around the bath, with visible fissures repaired... 
Encountered a huge cockroach in the bathroom on my last day - running out of my toilet kit... urrrghh. When I told the staff at reception, I didn't get any reaction apart from a rapid ""sorry""... hello, customer service anyone ?!? By the way, check-in was extremely slow - can't we have a simpler customer centric process ?",1,2019,01,20
47,"To stay top, please do some refurbishments","First of all, my overall customer experience was not that bad; it’s a typical business hotel with a lot of facilities. Although, I can’t put aside that this hotel urgently need some refurbishments: please get rid of the cheap laminate floor that makes a lot of noise; also the badroom deserves an update: a 4-star hotel should not have stained joints between the tiles; also a lot of walls in the corridors are damaged / scratched.

",3,2019,01,17
47,Great for New Year,"Rooftop terrace had great view of New Year fireworks. Clean, comfy bed, quiet. Handy for airport bus and metro. Next to good shopping centre and supermarket. A bit far from Gaudi buildings but easy to get to. Near city tour bus stop. ",5,2019,01,12
47,good stay but need some improvements,for the positive side its a good location / good price very good bistro restaurant . i like the breakfast very good spread.  on the negative side my main issue was no AC & room was so hot . i felt it coming from a country which the summer temperatures go up to 50d. the hotel policy was no AC during winter & ask me to open the window . this is ridiculous as the noise & dust from the round about is terrible could not sleep first night. The calling nos were wrong on the list which was duly acknowledged . for the executive room pls have a executive lounge like other hotels & 24 hour self-coffee machine. having some chips n soft drinks not enough to pay more for executive comfort as we are willing to pay even more if improvements are made . the staff needs to SMILE even at breakfast etc... its free.  how ever my experience changed when i met Jennifer Simon who took my views seriously took action with a written apology & invited me to join the rewards program. you need more staff like this for sure & because of her efforts i will re-book this hotel on next visit as its closer to our biz office & port . once the customer service improves this hotel will be hard to beat. ,3,2019,01,12
47,Great Room; Great View,"My husband and I stayed here on a group tour of Spain, and we were there over New Year's Eve. The hotel gave out tickets to hotel residents for the hotel's terrace so we could watch the New Year's Eve spectacle on the Placa d'Espanya - a great location! 

The lobby is very nice and spacious, but the staff were not particularly friendly or helpful. When we needed to get our carry-ons out of the hotel's storage area (our tour had arrived too early to check-in, so the hotel let us store our carry-ons while we went on a walking tour - no complaints there!), we had to wait almost 30 minutes to get someone's attention and then finally get them to give us access to our bags. Then, when we were trying to find a place to eat on New Year's Eve, we asked the woman at the front desk to call a restaurant for us. Her reaction was, ""You have a telephone in your room."" Not exactly a great customer service response. 

The breakfast was exceptional. They had people making fresh omelettes and pancakes, which made the lines quite long, but the food was great!

The room itself was very nice. We got a corner room, so we had three large windows and a good view of the street. The bathroom was large and clean, and the room was also quite big. I wish we could have stayed longer!",4,2019,01,02
47,Excellent location,"Excellent hotel choice for new year's eve celebrations on Plaza De Espana, but also for any time.  Great location, close to Metro, tourist bus and airport bus.  Staff are friendly and helpful.  Our room had a plaza view and again, a good choice; 6th floor with view of plaza and surrounding area.   Breakfast was standard hotel buffet breakfast but a good choice with a gluten free section which is something I need.",5,2019,01,01
47,Good for now. But has some issues.,"We stayed for one night on the 12th floor. The elevator stops at 11th floor. So we have to carry our luggage up one floor.

The unit seems fairly new. However whoever designed the bathroom must be questioned for the reason to select wood-grained panel in shower area. It is so coarse and rugged. There is no way this material can last long without accumulating dirty stains and gunk.

The service number listed on directory sheet is 91. But in reality it is 99. It took quite some time to get the right number, because 99 is not listed on the paper for anything. I think the management needs to run the hotel a bit more diligently.

Another very unreasonable thing IMO is the excessive charge on minibar items. Everything is charged. A thumb-sized box of tea is 4 EURO. Two tiny cookie is 2.5 EURO. Water is 3.75 EURO for 2 small bottles, etc. In other hotels those things are typically complementary.

However it is nice that the hotel provide a box of complementary fruit salad in the room. I guess this is the trade-off.

Otherwise the hotel is fine. The location is good. Subway is right in front. Close to airport and train station.",2,2019,01,01
47,Stay at Catalonia hotel in Barcelona,"It was very comfortable stay at hotel Catalonia. As we reached their,the porter came & took our luggage to the reception. Even though the hotel was full of people ,we had a pleasant receptionist to attend & soon we were member of them. He took time to go over the city map to show us the way to the site seen we were interested in. Room was well decorated. Only thing we missed was the morning tea. As there was no English tea,cream & sugar. I guess in Spain people drink coffee. It was ok as we were leaving early morning to the airport. Before cruise,we stayed at fairmont hotel. Your hotel is quite compatible to them as Catalonia is in the heart of the city, clean comfortable,new with good staff & service. 🙏 ",5,2018,12,22
47,Brilliant Hotel,From arrival to departure it was a pleasure to stay in this excellent hotel. If I was to be critical and it’s a minor point... the bar is soulless and I preferred to go to a bar external to the hotel. The seating can do with being more comfortable as it felt like I was sitting at a breakfast table.,5,2018,12,17
47,Comfortable and nice!,It is a really nice and equipped hotel for business trips. Cooperative and friendly staffs. Our rooms located on high floors and super confortable. But I have heard that some rooms in lower floors are not still renovated. So they might not been that nice. ,4,2018,12,14
47,Central Location,"Good location, close to everything, metro station is right infront of hotel entrance, mall and supermarket is just across the street, many restaurant around, and a market just 10minutess walk, near tourist attractions, like montjuic mountain and many others.",5,2018,12,09
47,Charge for everything and don’t tell you,"As per any normal hotel tea and coffee in the room with biscuits and a pack of crisp. The biscuits and crisps are actually on the minibar list and if you choose a biscuit with your coffee it will cost you €2.50 a pack. Only one tea bag ? Don’t ask for another unless you want to spend another €3 . Fancy a drink at the pool bar as seen in their web site. Well think again, it’s only open in summer. You could have a swim though. 
",2,2018,12,02
47,Disappointed ,"I was expecting more from what I’ve seen in their website. My room was very old, chair and bathroom door broken. Amenities and decoration were just normal. 
The location is good,however, a busy area. That’s why I have requested a quite room in high floor. Reception confirmed to me that my room in second floor would be quite. Well,it wasn’t. It was hard for me to sleep due to the outside noise of traffic. 
Breakfast was good I must say. ",3,2018,12,01
47,Great hotel,"I had a nice room, very large.  Finding it was a little challenging at first but it was worth the effort.

The breakfast was really good.  They cook eggs to order and make fresh waffles.

The staff is great.

Wonderful location.

There is even a very good fish and chip shop only 4 blocks away.

I would have enjoyed staying longer.
",5,2018,11,26
47,Comfortable and good location,"Great business hotel, but also good for weekend breaks. Comfortable with good facilities. Right above the metro so easy to get to all locations. Roof terrace and pool are added attraction from spring to autumn.",5,2018,11,22
47,Hideous,"Room scorching hot, security a huge concern, colleague robbed whilst sleeping, my room door was also opened in middle of night, window cleaning at dawn whilst still in bed with curtains open, shower switched from burning to freezing, mould in shower, tv not working, food dreadful, business center not functioning, beggars outside hotel doors. 
Worst experience ever.",1,2018,11,16
47,Friendly staff in a great location ,"I stayed here only for one night but the service I received was very good. I had arrived early but my room was not ready but I was told to come back but later and lucky for me the room was ready 2 hours before.

The check in was smooth and with speed. The front reception staff were very friendly.

I booked an Executive Room which was a good size. The view from my room was not very good (room 615).

The amenities in the bathroom were great and the shower was good. If the rain shower was more powerful then it would be great.

Lots of TV channels but not many English speaking (only news channels were in English)

I tried to ring the reception but no one picks up which was disappointing. The WiFi I thought was slow. I did a speed test and it was only 3mb download speed.

The breakfast options were very good and the staff were attentive and friendly.

The rooftop is worth a visit as the views are good.

The location is great. Taxis available easily outside the hotel. Shopping mall across the road (halal restaurant at the top La Lola) and the fountains across the street. 

Took a taxi to Nou Camp which was only 10mins away.

Overall, I thought the hotel was good and I would stay here again.",4,2018,11,08
47,Amazing location & service!!,"We decided to stay a few nights before our cruise. It’s an amazing location for day trips, shopping, eating. You can find everything at the Bullring. 
Lucy was so friendly & accommodating. We will definitely stay again on our next visit.",4,2018,11,06
47,Hotel Stay,"Overall, the hotel offer what we were expecting and exceeded expectations in other areas. Good breakfast options and wifi was great too. Superb location and on bus routes and there is a shopping centre nearby.",4,2018,10,22
47,Good location but tired.,"The location for the hotel was nice - near the Catalan Museum and metro stops. But the hotel, especially the bathroom, was tired. The shower was set up so that when it went on, it soaked the bathroom floor (and there weren't a ton of extra towels to sop up the water.) It was also a huge step up into the shower (into a big raised bathtub) which was really uncomfortable.

Some other things that weren't great: 
- I had a room on the first floor and could make eye contact with people driving by on the bus so definitely ask for a room on higher floors.
- The phone instructions to reach the front desk were not correct.
- The toilet run off and on.
- The gym was a tiny windowless room with minimal equipment.
- Definitely leave extra time to check out as the line can be quite long.

That said, the hotel was comfortable, the room was clean and a good size, and breakfast was tasty.",3,2018,10,18
47,Beautiful hotel in a stunning location,"Absolutely loved this hotel, cannot recommend enough. From start to finish, everything was perfect. Very comfortable, clean rooms, beautiful pool area with fantastic views of the magic fountain displays.  Great buffet breakfast with all you can want. Conveniently located near the easy to use metro lines, buses, shops and restaurants.  Everything you could hope for in this amazing city.",5,2018,10,18
47,Perfecto!!,"I had booked one night at the end of a business trip to Girona which finished in Barcelona and selected this hotel based on location and the attractive outside spaces.
On arrival I was prepared to be disappointed when I was told that the room with a terrace that I had booked was not available. The helpful reception staff assured me I would like my new room and also offered a complimentary breakfast. 
As I headed to the lift they pointed me to the second set of lifts that led to the tower containing suites and when I got into the 10th floor room I was impressed. There are only two suites per floor and the view out over Plaza Espana and towards the fountains was spectacular. The suite went full length of the tower so you had views out on three sides across the plaza, the Arena centre (bull ring) and across the city to the sea. With lounge, two bathrooms, spacious bedroom etc it had everything you could need. Perhaps slightly dated in parts but overall a great experience. The 8th floor pool, bar and terrace were lovely at night and breakfast was varied and fresh.
Location is perfect with metro and airport bus stops only steps from the front door.
I'm looking forward to returning for another, longer visit and using the pool. Would recommend the suites for the spectacular views.",5,2018,10,10
47,"Great location, good Hotel staff, poor attitude in resteraunt","Good location and my room had a great view of the Plaza. Good staff on the front desk.

However the room looked tired, partuclalry the bathroom with mould on the tiles over the bath.

When you pay the rate they charge you should expect bathroom fitting to be up to scratch.

The attitude of staff in the Mediterannean resteraunt left much to be desired.",3,2018,10,08
47,Great located crowded,"This hotel is located in plaza Espania in walking distance to Barcelona arena and magic Fontaine of Montjuïc,all city attractions are easily accessible by metro or walking,the breakfast options are poor without earlier charge due to crowdedness,the rooms are quiet but our room have no view and far from elevators",4,2018,10,07
47,"Big hotel, lovely atmosphere ",The hotel is big. it has a nice atmosphere. At the 8th floor there is a beautiful pool area with a bar overlooking the plaza de spana Barcelona. free coffee and fresh juice are available daily. Lobby furniture need to be replaced and are old and tired. Rooms are good and well decorated.  Real fast is expensive but there are a lot of cafes and restaurants around. There is a big shopping center near to the hotel with a food court and most of brands shops. ,4,2018,09,18
47,When you arrive at a hotel to find they haven't a room for you ....,"Seems like a lovely hotel but sadly I arrived to find that the reservation I had made a month in advance was transferred to another hotel. Having booked this hotel specifically for location, and that friends and colleagues were staying there, I ended up 30 minutes away. I assume that single travellers are easier to shift than turning down group bookings. The Catalonia Ramblas was very nice, but in the wrong place.  The reception staff were overrun with problems from what I could see.",1,2018,09,16
47,Lovely hotel,"My experience at this hotel was amazing. Check in was quick and we were clearly upgraded (although this was not mentioned at check in) as we had a room on the executive floor with a fantastic view!
We could even see the magic fountain event from our room - beautiful 
The room was so comfortable and clean and such a great view.
Not far from the centre and right by the metro and one of the sightseeing hop on hop off bus stops- very convenient 

The reception staff were efficient and managed to sort a problem we had with bus tickets.

The breakfast I thought was a little pricey but it was very good quality and there was a huge choice. I liked the fact you get an omelette made for you while you watch - so fresh and also waffles or crepe. 

I would return to this hotel.",5,2018,09,15
47,Lovely place,"I was there in june for 2 days for a business trip and I have to say, everything was just perfect. The staff the service, everything.The only thing I am sorry is that I couldn't stay longer. Will go back for sure!",5,2018,09,06
47,Nice but with remarks...,"Let me start with the downsides. 
- the toliet and shower. Not fresh at all 
- the smell of moist and unfreshness in hall ways. 

The upside. 
- the location
- the rooftop bar
- the bed 
- the service and employees. ",4,2018,09,04
47,"Nice hotel, noisy at night and lacking in important features.","Pros: 
Lovely hotel 
Good air con. 
comfy beds
Good location 
Helpful staff. 

Cons: 
Awful breakfast; had to choose from bacon, and 2 types of (cold) sausages and that was it for hot breakfast, lacking in so much more variety. Pancakes, churros cold. For 20€ I think this is really bad. 

At night while trying to sleep I could hear bass and music coming from somewhere (not sure where) sounded like a club above or next door, keeping me up resulting in a bad nights sleep 3/6 nights we were there. 

Pool area ok, not enough space for everyone to sit as seemed over crowded in the afternoon. Also the music up there is terrible and played very loud. 

Overpriced drinks €5 for a small orange juice. 

Shower pan overflowed if it was on full pressure so had to put it on a slower pressure which wasn’t ideal. 

No English tv channels and seemed no way of changing it.",3,2018,09,03
47,To iron or not to iron... that is the question.,"First of all there are many positives with this hotel, but unfortunately they get the basics with customer service wrong which deems this review as a negative one.

Check in was fine. Our room wasn’t ready but we were allowed to leave our bags and we went up to the roof top bar for a swim. First impression of the pool/bar area was fantastic but during our stay in became clear there are not enough sun loungers and the bar is massively overpriced. I think two cola’s comes in at around €9. Saving grace was the 5 bottles of Heiniken offer for €20. But they either never had any of them or they were warm and wouldn’t serve them. We ended up sat in hard bar chairs for our first day. 

Getting our room was easy enough. After having a wander around Barcelona, this hotel is fantastic for its location, we came home and asked reception for an iron as we were going to a wedding the next day. They said not a problem and I gave my room number. The next morning the iron hadn’t arrived. I called reception and told them my situation and they wrote my room number down and told me when an iron becomes available I would have it. Let’s put it this way, I’ve been back for a few days and I’m wondering whether the hotel meant I needed an iron for my house in England as the iron for the hotel room never turned up. I did call them again and for a 4 star hotel my reply was ‘we don’t have any so we can’t help you’. 

The room itself was nice but it did contain limescale around the bath which wasn’t pretty and also I found it had one complimentary bottle of water, which during a heatwave had gone in an hour. Good thing there is a little stall outside the hotel selling bottles of water for €1, lifesaver. There is a small mini bar in the  room and to be fair I didn’t find these prices too expensive but we didn’t use it. 

What we did learn during our stay was that the higher floors seem to be of a better class. If you get out of the lift on floors four onwards there are fresh fruit, coffee and juices waiting for you. The rooms seem to be of a much better quality and even the floors themselves look and feel more luxurious. As far as I know you don’t have to pay anymore to stay on these floors so my recommendation if you are looking at staying here would be to request to be on a higher floor. Let’s put it this way, we had a safe in our room which needed a key from reception to open and close. When I asked reception for this key a lady opened a little draw and said no we don’t have any. When I told her we have valuables she told me to bring them to reception. Just all seemed a bit armature for a 4* hotel. All safes now days should surly be digital with your own code. Again, higher floors seem to have these.

I would stay here again but only if certain things were improved. The whole bar side of the hotel could have sun loungers around. There should be water in the room every single day. Iron and ironing board in every room and a digital safe. And if there is limescale around the bath the seals should be replaced every few months. 

The hotel’s location is wonderful and you have taxi’s 24hours right on the doorstep. You will also have access to the metro which is fantastic for getting around, especially if you buy the T10 ticket. There is a lovely cafe attached to the hotel if you walk out and go right. This sell’s ice cream, coffee, tea’s and the most amazing ham and cheese croissant you will ever taste and the price is fantastic. We had our breakfast there every morning. 

All in all it was a good stay and there are a lot of positives but they need to iron out the poor issues in order for this hotel to be on another level. ",3,2018,09,02
47,"Business trip, exhibiting in the Fierra","Great location for a business trip at the Fierra, just across the road. Lovely views in the evening from the rooftop bar and centrally located. Rooms are a little dated but comfortable and the staff were friendly.",4,2018,08,31
47,Amazing except from the music!!!,"Perfect location, beautiful rooftop pool and views!! Rooms were clean and a good size. Our only criticism would be the horrendous playlist of music by the pool, odd mixture of overplayed songs painfully loud!!",4,2018,08,30
47,Great Location,"we stayed here for two nights.  the rooms are spacious and clean, and the staff is friendly and helpful.  the great rooftop pool and bar.  great place to relax after a day of sightseeing.  breakfast was plentiful and tasty.",5,2018,08,28
47,Good thanks to location,"I stayed at the Catalunya Barcelona Plaza for 5 nights with my 2 teenager children during the month of August. The hotel is perfectly located on plaça de España with metro station opposite and bus stop to airport. Room was good even though I had requested 3 single beds: we had 2 and another one which acted as sofa/single. Clean facilities (gym is ridiculously small) good staff and large breakfast buffet every day. They have a pool and terrace bar on top roof which gives you excellent views of the square and Montjuic. Forget the idea of using the pool since sun lounges are taken over (I suspect) very early on in the morning and by guests who think they are living the high life of Ibiza. And finally, I would not recommend the hotel for business until they sort out a very temple mental wifi. So all in all a good hotel with excellent location which could do a lot better. ",4,2018,08,27
47,"""Great Allrounder ""","Stayed here for 4 nights for my wife's bday ....Great location , great views, amazing rooftop pool and bar.... Really good breakfast !!!! Prob say more a 3* than a 4* , but never the less really good hotel !!",4,2018,08,23
47,Barcelona catalonia plaza hotel,"Great hotel with modern decoration! Comfy king size bed, nespresso in the room! Exquisite breakfast even for the most demanding customers... bus stop, taxis and metro just near the hotel! Plaza Espanya is one of the most popular places so the hotel lies in one of the best areas of Barcelona! I strongly recommend it and i will definitely visit again!",5,2018,08,20
47,Amazing views,"Just stayed here for three nights. The location is fantastic, with transport links to everywhere from literally outside the front doors. The room was a good size with a very large, very comfortable bed. The rooftop pool and bar are a real bonus and the views from up there are amazing. The staff are very friendly and helpful. I will certainly look to stay here again",5,2018,08,18
47,Really good ,"I have been to Barcelona twice before and never really been to this part of the town. Hotel is right on placa espanya. Metro station approx five metres from the front entrance. Shopping centre across the road. Font Majica across the other side of the placa (our two rooms overlooked the placa and fountain). Limitless food and drink options within a five minute walk. Lots of little supermarkets for supplies too.
Hotel lobby isn't the prettiest but not an issue. Rooftop pool is stunning. Drinks nks and food are pricey up there but for the setting it is what you expect. We spent many hours in and beside the pool.
We have two kids aged 10 and 12. Got an interconnecting room. Amazing. Kids had a massive twin room and we had an even bigger double room. We had our own little lobby that acted as a connection. Made it more like a family suite. Wasn't exactly cheap but worth every penny. Would highly recommend. ",5,2018,08,16
47,"Amazing views, great location & top hotel","My husband booked this trip as a surprise 50th birthday in Masy this year.  He booked the hotel a year in advance and asked for a big bed.  We were very pleased with the room, they gave us one of the presidential suites with a big bed, dining table and lounge area. A nice surprise was the complimentary bottle of cava, fruit and chocolates, a lovely touch by the hotel.  The room overlooked some famous landmarks and the roof top terrace had stunning views for miles; fantastic when you are sipping a cocktail. Metro and bus routes were just outside the hotel and the hop on/off buses were just across the road. Loved the choice of breakfast and there was a gluten free selection available. I liked the small touches such as the complimentary drinks, fruit, sweets and biscuits which were available and we were glad of when you had been sighting/shopping all day. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting luxury and location.",5,2018,08,16
47,"Change the playlist at the pool, please!!","Very nice hotel, great service from the people working there but please change the playlist at the rooftop pool during the day! It's aweful having the same songs shuffled and repeated over&over&over&over. We stayed for 3 days and it started driving us crazy, poor people working at the bar every day.. the playlist makes no sense it has ""fur Elise followed by a metal-song then again some french rap, ..."" ._.?

Please change the playlist all customers and staff will be grateful for that 🙏🏽 

Other than that everything was great! We stayed on the executive's floor, had coffee, fresh water and juices on the floor, we liked that a lot!",2,2018,08,13
47,Really good hotel,"This is a great hotel, within a great location. Literally the metro is on the doorstep. The R5 to Montserrat is there too.

The room was spacious with a great view and was great to come back and relax in. The pool is kept in a great condition. It even has an amazing view of Barcelona and a bar!

The only thing that let this place down was one lazy member of staff. When we wanted to extend our stay by 1 night he told us we had to wait until our checkout date then rebook for a night in the morning. This gave us the inconvenience of having to pack to find out we could stay in the same room then had to unpack then pack again. All because the guy on reception couldn’t be bothered to look. We went on booking.com and found the room, so we knew there was availability.

Except for this one guy it really is a great hotel for whatever you are staying for.",5,2018,08,11
47,The customer is always wrong,"We booked our stay a few months before going at a decent price, we thought. 

I decided to check the price again a day before we were supposed to arrive and it had dropped by a considerable amount, both here and on other similar websites. We thought about canceling and booking again but unfortunately we were a few hours too late for that. 

When we arrived we were charged around the same price as I had seen the day before in the app and I was pleasantly surprised. However, upon checking out from the hotel we were told we didn't pay the right price when we arrived so we got another considerable bill. I told them I wasn't happy about that but they didn't care at all. I showed them evidence of the price being a lot lower just a day before our stay but it didn't sway the person in the staff we talked to. She couldn't even explain this to us, only repeating the same thing over and over again, without considering our viewpoint.

It was a sorry end to an okay to decent stay for us. Why don't I say good or excellent like most? For mostly two reasons: One, because when we arrived in our hotel room we noticed we had two small beds and no bed for our 1 yo child, despite me mentioning specifically in our booking that we needed one large bed and a children's bed. 
Two, when we were moved to a different room with one bed the air condition was broken and didn't work properly for a few days and never really decreased the temperature to the level we wanted. We were sweating the first few nights and they couldn't do anything about it. The first night they send a hotel staff that fiddled around with the controls, like we hadn't already tried that, looked at the temperature not moving down at all and then left after about 15-20 minutes, without speaking a word of English.

Not happy with the customer service here and I'd say the price was way too high compared to other similar hotels in Barcelona. Avoid the massive price changes, like we experienced here.

47,Good place to stay,"I’ve found this hotel to be really comfortable, really helpful and polite staff , I had a few problems with room cleaning but apart from that, lovely room and rooftop swimming pool.Close to the Underground and bus stations. 1 hour to get to Playa de Sao Sebastia in just 1 bus.Close to reach the tourist attractions.And our hotel we had the opportunity to watch the Magic Fountain from the rooftop.And by the way,this hotel is in front of Plaza España.Absolutely a good place to stay.",4,2018,08,10
47,3 years marraige trip,I Think the hotell is perfekt location right in the city Placa de Catalonia.So just än airport bus.And walk 5 min.The best with hotell is the breakfast especially the omeletts to för for. Good fruit and bread. The tortillas and other omeletts could be kept hot.The rooms where ok.But the reception not flexibel. Askinking an extra duve no they Said.despite there was picture of it.And no flexibility when we checked out.We wanted an extra hour but no.So Breakfast 5 stars.reception 2 stars.Clean yes 4 stars .,3,2018,08,07
47,Short Break in Barcelona - excellent location,"Travelled as a couple in July after going to Benicàssim FIB festival. In much need of relaxation time and that is exactly what this hotel provided.

During check in the staff where very friendly and we were lucky enough to be upgraded to an executive room on the 5th floor.

Like most hotels in Barcelona the rooms are quite small but lots of compact storage space and a huge comfortable bed or bathroom was also lovely. Room was very clean and we had the room cleaned each day and if required the choice of fresh towels. 

Safe included and a proper hairdryer provided.

During the day the pool area was quiet and lots of room the sunbeds are very comfortable and plenty of towels as you need them. Bar staff are very attentive around the pool area and small touches like nuts and jelly sweets complimentary are always welcome. 

We did not eat much in the hotel so cannot comment on the restaurants.

During our stay there was a taxi strike and whist I thought this would be challenging as I usually taxi everywhere the metro service was excellent and the stop is yards from the entrance to the hotel - staff were excellent at giving information. 

I would highly recommend this hotel to people looking to have a city break and something that is value for money. 

The magic fountains are only about 400mtrs from the hotel and worth going to see. 

",4,2018,08,02
47,A must have to go back place,"Perfect place, perfect location, everything was fine! The room was very comfortable and clean. The breakfast was excellent. The staff was also awesome - especially LINDA at the reception desk. The swimming area is quite small, but has a beautiful view to the town.",5,2018,08,01
47,amazing hotel,"amazing view from the rooftop pool, really good wine and cocktails menu at the bar by the pool, very clean area with towels available at the pool. friendly bar staff. Really nice bathrooms in the rooms and really clean. really central location lots of nice restaurants nearby. Very close to magic fountain, easily reached from the airport on a 15 minute bus journey.",5,2018,07,30
47,"Not cheap, but ...","Since everything in Barcelona is really expensive, the price is okay, especially when you don't come with a car. We had to pay for 1 day and 20 hours 44 Euros for the car in the public garage under the hotel. The hotel didn't give us some kind of rebate ticket or so.

The location is away from everything but still not too far from the centre and has a metro station nearby.

The reception hall makes it look like you just entered The Grand Hotel, the standard room we had booked war rather simple in decoration (old fashioned standard furniture).

Like so many hotels they had that badge in the bathroom that if you're eco conscious, just hang up your towel, and they won't clean it, throw it on the floor to get it cleaned. We left it hanging and they still got changed. We felt a bit taken for a ride.

When I tried to call to reserve a room for two nights, at first I couldn't reach ANYONE, I had to call 3 times to finally get someone and then it wasn't the reception. The person on the phone told me to call again after 9am. When we wanted to check out, we were therefore asking from when on the reception was ""manned"", and we got the reply in a nose-up way that the are there 24 hours. 

The room itself was big, the view was great. We didn't dare to open the window, because it looked somewhat broken. 
On the roof is a swimming-pool with a bar. The bar was not offering much, the waitress didn't speak English.",3,2018,07,29
47,Long weekend ,"I took my 85 year old stepmum to Barcelona for a 3 night break and couldn’t have picked a better hotel for our requirements though that doesn’t mean it’s for everyone. I chose the hotel because I wanted a roof top pool and having  previously stayed in BCN with my husband 10 years ago the rooftop pool we ended up with was basically a tiny plunge pool on a concrete roof and not conducive to relaxing  with a cold drink etc. I researched loads of hotels with ‘rooftop pools’ in BCN and many were equivalent to just described but the Catalonia Barcelona plaza exceeded all expectations. Stunning views and plenty of loungers / seats / lots of couples daybeds for the young romantics and delightful bar staff. As one should expect in a European city 4 star hotel drinks are not cheap but i.e €14 for a gin and tonic but they serve good measures without even asking for a double ! Location was €8 to Las Ramblas by taxi. Next door to hotel us huge shopping mall built into the original bull ring and has eating places / designer clothes etc and a great supermarket ( closed on sundays) Maybe some would prefer to be a little closer to Las Rambas or the port but I loved this hotel. Oh and a particularly nice touch was that on the floor level beside the lifts every morning was a complimentary coffee machine !Bottled water, freshly squeezed orange juice, crisps, bread sticks. It seems to arrive around 11 ish but if you’re on room only it’s a nice bonus ",4,2018,07,21
47,excellent hotel despite size,"This seems to be a very popular hotel (including for sport teams and conferences) but once in my room it was quiet. the room was very modern and comfortable (executive floor).  the bathroom was huge and included a bidet.The mini bar was so full I could not use it for anything else. No microwave. there is a business center downstairs with two computers. 
Its location is excellent. there is a shopping center across the street and it is easy to walk to top attractions. Staff was very professional. Breakfast was great: lots and lots of (delicious) choices!!",5,2018,07,19
47,Perfect,"This hotel really was just amazing! could not fault it in anyway at all! the hotel staff was all so lovely, the hotel was clean at all times. 

upon  arrival you are greeted and shown to your room as you should be.The rooms themselves were a bit small but was perfectly fine. 

The location for us was perfect sitting on the roof top in the middle of Barcelona and yet feeling like you was a million miles away from it all and able to just relax. 

We did not eat at the hotel, the Breakfast and food service we did not try so cannot comment on however we did try the bar and it was fantastic the staff know exactly how to make a gin! 

We have already spoken about returning to the hotel! for another weekend break.",5,2018,07,19
47,BeUtiful hotel,We took a cruise that ended in Barcelona. We found the hotel on TripAdvisor. Everyone's reviews were good. It was in a perfect location just a block from the bus and train station in front of the hotel. Hotel staff knew English well so it made us more comfortable ,5,2018,07,18
47,Great place for shopping ,It's the heart of the city of Barcelona alot of restaurants shops and snacks. A must see but if it's a hot sunny day consider  going before sunset. Alot of of shopping and snacks in the area very close to ramblas street ,5,2018,07,15
47,Very good,I have been in this hotel many times it is a wonderful hotel in excellent place close very important places rooms are clean and very good food are great service of the workers are very good and very pleasant the hotel have a wonderful swimming pool on the rooftop with wonderful views soot is a wonderful hotel,5,2018,07,12
47,Lovely City Break ,"Me and my best friend booked at week in Barcelona and loved it . 

Hotel on first impressions was really lovely , we did arrive really early at the hotel so was unable to check in till 2pm which was a killer but we New it would be the case . 

They took our bags from us and we went and just chilled on the roof top where pool & a bar was.  The pool area was lovely and sun beds supper comfy and gave you an amazing view of the city around . 

We walked pretty much everywhere as it’s such a lovely city to walk around but beach is probably around 20 Minuets walk roughly . Taxis are cheap enough as well to get around if needed . So so many places to eat which were lovely! 

Sensi Mezzanine ((MUST) best tapas ever! 
Book though little small place but unbelievable! 

Pura Brasa ( mixture of food ) little different and very nice ! - really close to the hotel 

Bacoa - 🍔 Burgers 

Cheeky snack - Chocolat - Box ( so tasty ) 

Church is not finished but still nice to see ( if want o see inside book day before you go and see it ) . 

Park Güell ( lovely to walk around ) 

Beach ( very nice still to wonder & chill on) 

Fountains around 8:45/9pm Font Màgica 
( Placa d'Espanya) location 
get there early as it can get busy 

Arenas De Barcelona ( big arena , shops food court nice restaurant) La tagliatelle .. pasta is so GOOD!!

47,Rude staff,"The staff was consistently and uniformly rude. The check in clerk demanded to see the exact credit card that I paid for the room months earlier with.  She said without me presenting the card that I could not checkin. I told her the card had been compromised and the bank had me destroy it and presented the replacement card. She said that would not do. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told their was no management on premise. I have checked into hotels all over Europe for many years and have never been asked this question. She made us wait for almost an hour. The solution they presented me was to refund the old card which had been destroyed and for me to buy a new room at today’s rates. I informed them they’re refunding to a card that had been destroyed was useless, but there was no attempt to understand the situation on the other side.

The check in person offered me four voucher‘s for free drinks in the bar which I later tried to use only to find out that my two free Gin and tonics would cost me $37 euro. Even though the cards don’t say so, management had put a limit of beer and house wine on the cards and wanted me to pay for the free drinks. 

When I wanted to borrow an iron and ironing board I was given a limit of 45 minutes and the Bellman that delivered same was pounding on my door within 45 minutes to retrieve the iron and ironing board as if it was gold. 

When I asked for a new room key and gave them the room number I was told adamantly by the staff that I did not have that room and after the hotel staff members arrogance wore off he decided to check another list and found that we’ve been staying there for three days already. 

In good conscience I could not recommend this property:  the hotel is in a good location, the property is maintained to an average standard, but the staff makes it unbearable to be a guest there.",2,2018,07,01
47,City of dreams,We visited the city and stayed in the hotel.Hotel is centrally situated the rooms r good well maintained.Breakfast place spacious.All type of transport available at the walking distance.The famous musical fountain very close.,4,2018,07,01
47,"Great Location , Hotel & Service","We just loved Barcelona we had 4 days & that wasnt enough time to see all the things we wanted to do . Our Accommodation was Very good , great location , friendly staff who were very helpful . A fantastic  full breakfast . We were on the 7th floor & a great view . The hotel had a good pool area & bar on the top floor , great view . The room we had was very spacious with everything you could want, even down to a cellular phone , & at night time there was a little chocolate on the bed awaiting us .
We always get on the Hop on /  Hop off buses to get around they were great value. It was wonderful to say I had my feet in the Mediterranean sea .There is a great food market in the town.  The view  from the Tibidabo Peak was amazing . We went on the sky wheel, you had a  magnificent 360  views . A lovely Catholic Church. I would go back tomorrow. I would Highly Recommend this Hotel.",5,2018,06,30
47,Couples,Lovely sangria - with tapas and then paella.  The staff are friendly and bilingual.  Definitely make reservations before you come - as this is a very popular place for locals and tourists.  We will be back with our friends before departing for our cruise!,5,2018,06,29
47,The best stay in Barcelona,"Our stay at Catalonia Barcelona Plaza was nothing short of wonderful. We were greeted with joy, showed to our room and treated by all staff fantastically. Our room was so so comfortable & had all the facilities and comforts that we could have wished for. The staff knew the area and were great to give advice on where to go and what to see. With all of this in mind and the BEST rooftop pool in Barcelona we would come back in a second. Thank you for such a wonderful stay : )",5,2018,06,26
47,Good Location and Service,"The location is great for sightseeing, shopping and restaurants and about 20 minutes to the airport. About 15 minutes to the old city and waterfront by taxi. Rooms very clean. Super rooftop bar with some food, a nice pool and an awesome view of the city. We watched city wide fireworks with friends as well as the fountain display. Check your bill closely as someone charged drinks to our room from the rooftop bar. We explained we paid for our drinks and had no charges. They dropped the charge. They have a cellular device/phone you can use around the city and make calls to selected foreign countries including USA at no charge!",5,2018,06,25
47,VERY POOR AND ARROGANT ATTITUDE OF STAFF,"Worst attitude of staff we checked in on 18th June 2018 and to our surprise they do not open the door as luggage can be brought in from the roaming door can be brought in from static door.When I complained that you are watching and opening the door he behaved like a dumb as he does not understand english.2.They provide one complimentary water bottle which did not happen till 21st June 2018 the day we checked out despite several reminder at the reception. 3. Final disaster was when our bag was stolen from the lobby/reception where they do not have proper cctv coverage they did not bother to accept our complaint to be passed on to police.
Purely useless rude and arrogant staff behaviour at lobby and reception worst experience.",2,2018,06,25
47,Excellent choice as usual,We use to go to this Hotel when we go to Barcelona. It is ideally located and after its last upgrade it is modern and fashionable. The swimming pool at the terrace overseeing Barcelona it is unbeatable.,5,2018,06,24
47,Superb hotel and staff,"This is my 6th or 7th stay at this hotel and can’t rate this hotel highly enough . 
I have stayed in various room types and can’t really fault it . 
Breakfast is well worth having too . A large variety of options . 
Staff are very friendly , helpful and courteous and work really hard . I have to mention Francisco & Cristina on reception in particular . I have had numerous encounters at check in / our with these lovely people and nothing is too much trouble . 
The pool terrace is very busy at the weekends and could probably do with a couple of extra staff but it is a fantastic place to sit or swim / sunbathe with a drink and also fantastic views of the Magic Fountains of Montjuïc . 
The hotel is perfectly situated for the Bus Turistic on the Red route and also there are always plenty of Taxis outside . It’s approx 30 minutes from the airport . 
We will continue to go back to this hotel time and time again for our mini breaks to Barcelona . 
Overall I would highly recommend this lovely hotel ",5,2018,06,24
47,Great location ,"Stayed there one night on our way east.
The hotel has a great location at plaza Espania.  We got a room on 4th floor with an excellent view ower the square and to Montjuic hill.  The room was big and comfortable but the bed was a little squeaky.   For a longer visit the hotel would be a perfect choice. ",5,2018,06,22
47,Beautiful hotel,"I visited for a work convention, the hotel was absolutely amazing. Brilliant location making it possible for us to do some sightseeing in the few hours we had free in our itinerary. Rooftop pool bar has the best view of the surrounding beauty including the magic water fountain.",5,2018,06,21
47,Awful. So many bad points I lost count,"The hotel looks nice from the photos. Not so good when you get here. 

Bad points:
- rude staff (apart from Lucy on reception, she was amazing.)
- there are building works going on so when you are on the rooftop that’s all you can hear all day. Plus the crane comes right over the top of you, which I deem dangerous. (Pics attached)
- small, cramped room
- no iron or ironing board available for use 
- phone in room doesn’t work
- food is only available from the rooftop pool at certain times and you can’t bring your own food up there, and the food is adverage.
- to get from the rooftop pool to your room, you have to go down to reception in one lift and back up in another. 
- the music on the rooftop consisted of 5 tunes played on repeat which included 
Classical music, of which they clearly didn’t read the crowd on the roof for this.
- everyday the hotel security would ask for our room cards on the rooftop in an unfriendly manner. It would have been better for a nicer member of staff to check that we were guests. They also do this multiple times a day which is disruptive. 
- this hotel is unsafe for children!!!!! The windows in the rooms open up fully which allows someone to climb out with ease. Very dangerous. 

Good points:
- great view from the rooftop
- nice pool
- comfy beds on the rooftop
- comfy beds in the room
- good shower 
- clean rooms 
- good wifi
- drinks on the rooftop are well priced

I wouldn’t stay here again. 

Although the one amazing think about this hotel was receptionist called Lucy. She checked me in, was friendly and helpful. She was an absolute pleasure to deal with and I’m surprised she hasn’t been headhunted by a bigger hotel branch. She was amazing. ",1,2018,06,21
47,Beautiful Barcelona,This Catalonia Piazza is beautiful place to spend time and admire and rice feed the pigeons. Children and adults enjoy sharing time with the pigeons. This is one of the many beautiful places to visit in Barcelona and next to it are the Ramblas,5,2018,06,18
47,Enjoyable!!,"We had a really great time during our stay thanks to Christina! She fixed a few problems we had with the room at the first night! Friendly, clean hotel, with really delicious breakfast! Near metro station, and gorgeous view from the roof by the pool! Thank you Christina, you made our days!",5,2018,06,13
47,Poo on my Dressing Gown,"Title sums up what happened, got to room had a shower went to put on dressing gown and noticed a brown stain which appeared to be where the last guest had wiped. this was then not really sorted out and dismissed by reception. They are still ",1,2018,06,06
47,In need of refreshment,"This hotel does not deserve four stars. Three and a half would be closer to the mark.

Rooms are spacious enough, but quite run down. Just two examples - a safe which is inoperable (""we are changing to electronic, madam""), and a hairdryer attached to a power point with open wiring and no cover (which was rectified by housekeeping the following day). And a very old, uncomfortable desk chair.

Yes, it is quiet. Yes, it is close to the metro and a  large shopping mall. Yes, there are plenty of buses to the centre and a direct bus to the airport. Yes, there are taxis at all hours directly outside the hotel.

The bed was comfortable, with good linen, and pillows. There was plenty of wardrobe storage, fast wifi, tea and coffee making facilities and a free smart phone. Forget about reading in bed; lighting is woeful.

The bathroom has a shower over the bath with good water pressure, decent towels and basic amenities.  The shower curtain could do with an upgrade to glass.The toilet and bidet look new, in a small alcove in the bathroom.

Breakfast is fine, but every different food station is set all around a very large room space.

The score of four (rather than three) reflects the excellent transport links nearby.",4,2018,06,04
47,Family stay May 18,"This is a lovely hotel. We had 2 rooms with a great view of the Plaza Espania on the 5th floor, (Executive rooms)
My only complaint was that on Thursday 31st May the pool and roof terrace was closed to hotel guests at 6pm. We therefore had to vacate the terrace because of a private function. When this is a hotel facility i feel this is not acceptable and we were not made aware of this at booking or checking in on the 28th May. This is poor customer service. If this had not had happened i would have rated the hotel excellent.",3,2018,06,02
47,City centre......,Absolutely in Plaza Espanya square next to Arena mall. Perfect location and good rooms. Although rooms need little refurbishment. Very good and vast breakfast buffet. Everything is walking distance and thus very convenient. Surely a good choice when in Barcelona.,5,2018,05,31
47,Mr. ,"The Location is perfect well located in Placa Espanya. The breakfast is good and staffs are very friendly. The reception staff, Christina, is very helpful and friendly. The room in executive floor is very good, nice bed, well insulated double windows, shower is good, TV is large with various channels. However, it will be better with more English channel other than CNN, CNBC, and Bloomberg. This is and will be always my regular hotel in Barcelona.",4,2018,05,29
47,Amazing,"Everything about our stay here was wonderful. We arrived early in the day. The staff was super friendly and engaging. They upgrade my wife and I to a room on the 6th floor. The room was spacious, more than enough for us two. There are restaurants on the property and also we had breakfast included in our room price. Overall it was a great experience in a wonderful location. Easily accessible by bus from the airport. We had a 6 am flight to return back home and there were taxis already outside waiting. There was nothing I could complain about our visit. I highly recommend this hotel.  Plus the view is amazing from the pool area/bar. ",5,2018,05,29
47,4 Stars? No way,"lower rooms are very dated, not clean, and by no way 4 stars. broken none working hair dryer (electrical installation of that one in a wet room, open wires, would be considered a fire hazard in most European countries) 3 plugs in the whole room, 2 of which are used. 2 90cm beds instead of proper one. air condition loud. bath tube broken. wall radio that goes on in the morning and you see no switch. pillow case inside out (what is the staff doing, colleague found insects crawling in the room). no iron on room (this is a requirement for 4 stars and for a business traveler). breakfast was okish if it would have cost half of what it did. one could never reach reception on the phone (convinient).

the only redeemable things to say about this place is that the roof top bar is really nice (these pics reflect reality the rest must be hidden rooms) and the location is good.

suffice it to say i was in 5 star hotel 15 minutes walk away for less money the week before and the difference is day and night.

would not go there, if you have to, insist on a room on the higher floors, i hear they are renovated.",2,2018,05,25
47,Amazing hotel!,Really clean hotel.  Friendly employees. Awesome location.  I was beyond satisfied. They upgraded my room to a suite free of charge... amazing room! Will only stay at this hotel from now on when i come to barcelona ,5,2018,05,22
47,F1 Experience,F1 experience. Excellent location for city access and to the track. Shower was cold water on Sat. this was disappointing considering everything was exceptional. Excellent reception and concierge service!,5,2018,05,22

47,"Nice hotel, although not really central.","Location - was ok, although not central, far from main square and La Rumbla Street. It was about 4-5 kms away. Needed to catch a taxi. Close to water fountain show and bullring was across the road. 
Hotel - was good, really nice rooftop bar with pool, great views, and view of water fountain show.
Room - was good, has kettle with tea only and no coffee satchels, hotel door wouldn't shut properly needed to pull it hard. No power points near bed and only 1 on bench, which wasn't really practical.
Bed - was comfortable, although long pillows not really practical. 
Air conditioning was just okay.
Bathroom - spacious, bathtub with shower, tub was really slippery.
Breakfast was included - good choice of buffet, nice and spacious in breakfast room.
Service - was great.
Wifi - was okay, little slow in room.",4,2018,05,09

47,Catalonia Barcelona Spain Worst Experience Hotel,It is the worst experience with a hotel I ever had. I wouldn't recommend Catalonia to anybody. Initially I made booking with Catalonia Roma at Av Roma they were having a water problem so they had to shift me to Catalonia at Pl Espana and now this is my 2 second day in the Hotel and me along with several other occupants is facing a problem with Air Conditioning in the rooms. The Hotel staff is neither friendly nor apologetic. They don't even know how many branches are there for Catalonia in Barcelona. All in all it is lethargic experience.,1,2018,05,06
47,Staff extremely polite and helpful & room with a view.,"Spacious room. At the reception one of the Staff (Oriol) was very helpful and made sure we had the best stay at this Hotel. Many of the rooms as facing the Water fountain but even if it doesn't , from the roof you can just about to see the water and light show. 
The roof on the top is elegantly built with a bar and helpful staff.
I suggest you choose this Hotel. Especially if you like fancy Breakfast with huge selection!",5,2018,05,03
47,By far the worst experience we had in Barcelona,"This hotel cannot be rated as a four stars hotel at all.  Not a pleasant experience we had in Barcelona.  Here for business, if I have a choice I will never stay at this location again.  Only good is it’s location, subway station located right in front of the hotel.",1,2018,05,03
47,Excellent! Would absolutely stay here again.,"Great rooms, space, excellent breakfast, very helpful and watchful staff. I stayed right after Easter and loved the location. Right in front of the ""fountains"" and with a Metro stop in front of the hotel, I'm recommending this to a friend who's traveling to Barcelona in July.
The hotel staff was sharp, friendly, accommodating, pleasant and all around gracious.
They foiled a theft by being watchful. Only warning is that because of the great aspects is its location, and the traffic can be noisy, but doesn't make it uncomfortable.
Best breakfast I've had in a hotel in many tours of Europe. They had everything!!!",5,2018,04,30

The rooms are very spacious, it is quite a large hotel with a subway station right out the front of the hotel. The hotel also has a shopping centre across the road.

The staff were very friendly and the breakfast was by far the best I have had in Europe on a whole. Overall it is a great business hotel with the right size amenities to suit your expectation.

My only recommendation would be to provide some bottled water in the hotel rooms as this was not present.",4,2018,04,22
47,Dimitar,Very good location but bigger expectations for 4 star hotel in term of  accommodation. Clean enaugh and friendly personel. Old rooms but clean and comfort. Very good breksfast but in the crowdy restorant. ,3,2018,04,22

The rooms are modern and comfortable.
Absolutely I will go again. ",5,2018,04,16

The hotel is on top of the espanya metro station so this enable excellent exploration at a non tourist cost

47,Central location for business and pleasure,"Stayed here on the executive floor. The room was decorated to a  good standard, modern, clean, comfortable with a good range of facilities. The view was beautiful over the Plaza. It has a great shopping centre and restaurants right next door, with amazing views. Breakfast was plentiful. Staff were friendly.",4,2018,04,13
47,Great location & view means amenities suffer,"The hotel cancelled my reservation being unable to process my credit card -- the same one I ended up using to check in & out, so check-in took 20m. My room had an incredible view of the Plaza España & Palace, and was in a fantastic central location. No AC in April (in a four star hotel!) meant I had to sleep with a wet towel to stay cool, and poor WiFi meant I had to venture to an internet cafe or the lobby to work on my laptop reliably.",4,2018,04,09
47,No way it is a 4 star hotel,"Checked in the hotel with a group of friends, but I was assigned to a different floor from them.  When asked the front desk,  I was told that the hotel was fully booked and no way they could change for me.  After I got into my assigned room for 30 mins, the room was still so warm.  Called the technician, he finally told us that the air conditioning was not working.  The front desk then to open the window😱 but we were on the low floor facing some dirt.  After insisting, we were given the top floor(didn’t we were told that the hotel was fully booked?).  The air con issue was not solved as we finally were told that all the rooms were out of air conditioning but at least we could open the window in the new roim.  Why would even this be considered a 4 star hotel with this kind of service?",2,2018,03,25
47,"Great location, but at the end an average hotel","Hotel Catalonia Barcelona Plaza is perfectly located however it is already ""used"" and old fashioned in the rooms. It can also be very noisy if you have a room oriented to the main street. The staff was very friendly. A highlight is a fantastic roof top pool with bar.",3,2018,03,22
47,Lovely spot,"I am not giving an excellent rating as some things were not spot on . 
Staff friendly yet checking in and out slow. No news papers in the lobby. Rooms clean and spacious . Bed really comfortable and always hot water . Love the tea cooker in room and the various hot drinks on offer. The Buffett breakfast is amazing don’t miss it! My room was not cleaned one day. I can back from a long day of touring and my room had not been cleaned , was quite a let down. The location of hotel perfect shuttle to airport right out the door ! Lovely area to stay!",4,2018,03,21
47,EXCELLENT HOTEL,"This really fancy hotel should be rated 5 Star and not 4Star. The employees were super nice, friendly and most helpful. Airline crews stayed here while we were here. There's a wonderful shopping mall that has been renovated from a bull fighting ring and it's a/c and super clean. There's a full grocery store, bunches of fine restaurants, great shopping. The area around the hotel is safe for those wanting to jog, walk, etc.",5,2018,03,13
47,Pleasure,"Nice hotel 
 Good location, plenty of cafes/ restaurants within walking distance
Reception staff very professional and pleasant.

Room has tea/ coffee making facilities 
Brilliant shower 
Massive bed 
Very clean

Breakfast is very good with lots of choice 
I would recommend although I think it is a little expensive 
PS. Rooftop pool on floor 8 was fabulous but a little windy 

",4,2018,03,13
47,Great location and classy room,"It’s my second hotel in Barcelona. This first one is not bad but this one just amazed me! The location is superb where all shops and tourist spots are around you. And the airport bus stop is right in front of the hotel which is only 1 stop to the airport! It’s more convenient than taking taxi!

The room is spacious and well designed. It’s clean and tidy too. I have got my room upgraded to the executive floor and there are fruits and drinks self serve station right at the lift lobby of your floor. 

The roof top bar is also nice and love their welcome drink! Will definitely stay here again.",5,2018,03,11
47,"Perfect location, friendly staff and first class accomodation.","we had the clock tower room overlooking the water fountain and  on up the hill towards the Art museum.

47,Good Hotel with Good location,I want for a congress and everything was excellent. I experienced one of the best beds I've ever met in a hotel room. The reception can manage quietly and efficiently large number of travelers coming in or checking out.,4,2018,03,03
47,"Great Hotel, Perfect Location & Excellent Service","The hotel is top quality and it is perfectly located. I stayed there for a business trip and the service was excellent. The front desk team was very flexible in arranging some courier services for me and their guest service assistant, Andrea, was very kind and helpful in providing local recommendations for restaurants and booking them. I definitely recommend it.",5,2018,03,02
47,"Excellent Hotel all around - service, food","My wife and I were on a Globus tour of Spain, from Madrid and ending in Barcelona.  We spent 2 more additional nights after the tour ended and visited all over Barcelona.
To many of my fellow 44 travellers as well as definitely ourselves, this is the BEST hotel on the tour.
Location is great at the Plaza de Espana, which by its name, you know is very central.  Metro station is within 2 minutes walk, the bus to the airport is literally outside the door.
Many restaurants are close by, big huge monument outside is a landmark, as is the former bullring (Arenas), which has many restaurants (food court downstairs), and shops.  So, the convenience is here already.
The staff is great!  I can't compliment them enough.  We received help from booking tours to general questions requiring maps and Metro rides. Oriole, at the front desk (reception) was great in resolving a big problem we had in a tour that was the wrong date, and basically spent over 20 minutes just working on a solution with somebody at Park Guell, and it was finally resolved to our satisfaction.  The front desk was always helpful, never impatient, and spoke English well enough that there was absolutely no problems in understanding any of the staff, which is a big plus.
Eating facilities:  Excellent!  Huge dining facility!  Only 'complaint' and not a serious one, is that they are so far apart!  But after a little bit, you know where things are, but initially, it kinda overwhelms you a bit.  We were greeted warmly as we entered the facility. The staff was excellent!  Upon entering, you are escorted to a table.  They will bring coffee right to you, instead of you having to figure out how the Espresso machine works.  We had one instance where they ran out of melons (Yummy!) and the server brought it right to our table!  To me, that's important, because they are observant in knowing WHERE you are sitting, as well as the initiative and thinking to bring the plate to you.  The omelette man was very good and did an excellent job of making it very presentable.  The 'manager' of the dining area was also observant and helping to keep the tables clean, and directed activities accordingly - very good.  I noticed that the workers also tried to keep the floors clean, particularly the omelette man.
Eggs cooked to order.  Fresh waffles made.  Lots of fresh fruits and juices.  Great variety of good food!
---
What did I find 'bad' about this hotel?  The number of electrical outlets are very sparse.  There was none by the beds!  For me, it's nice to sit up in bed, and use my laptop, while charging it.  There's one outlet by the desk, which had their iPhone plugged in and I used that one.  I don't know if it was truly working or broken, but the outlet under the desk did not work... and I was too tired to try to find out what the problem was.  
Other problem was that the cleaning maid left a dirty towel once, which I'm sure she was using to clean the room, on the sink area.  Maid should always give the room a 'once-over' to make sure everything is in place before leaving!
-----
All in all, I would rate this hotel very highly!  Great location, great service, and great personnel.  IF we ever come back, say 2026 in time for the Familia finish (??!!!), we would stay here!",5,2018,02,27
47,Great location but in need of a touch-up,"The location works great for me when i come for business trips. However, the hotel needs a bit of a touch up. The room I was staying in felt run down. Especially the bathroom. There are not enough power sockets - I had to unplug the tv in order to charge my mobile phone. There are no power sockets near the bed so you can't charge your phone and use it for the morning alarm. The air conditioning worked only with heating mode - I had no way of controlling the temperature except on/off mode. 
Having said that, the hotel is great value for money. It is clean and tidy, staff is helpful and breakfast is very good. I will definitely return - I hope in due course this establishment will get the touch-up it deserves.",3,2018,02,23
47,Great Location,"I don't usually leave reviews however I think on this Occasion the hotel really deserves one.
Staff are very friendly and helpful ,more so than most hotels. 
Our room was upgraded to a suite on arrival. The hotel is clean and spacious.
The location is fantastic, metro outside and local buses.
Would defiantly recommend this hotel.
Tara",5,2018,02,21
47,Great location and service,"This is my second time staying in this hotel. The location of this hotel is perfect, 30 minutes on the local bus from airport and metro located right outside hotel. Lucy really looked after us when we checked in for a special occasion. Views of Placa de Espanya were amazing. Very relaxing and clean hotel. Staff were very professional and made us feel very welcome. Wouldn't stay anywhere else in Barcelona!",5,2018,02,14
47,Excellent,"I have stayed here on a few occasions. Each time i am there i am very pleased with my stay. The staff are very helpful and will cater for your needs. 

The rooms are spotless and i had a double bed which was great as most hotels give you two single ones put together. 

The rooms are basic but nice. You have a mini bar but very expensive and luckily it is not one of the fridges with the sensors as i did empty it and put my own items in and left theirs on the counter (i'm sure they hated me for it :) ). 

On my last stay, i was on the 5th floor and apparently the only one, but they were renovating and when i return form work that day, i found  note under my door to go to reception. They upgraded me to the 6th floor and apologized for the trouble although, due to this being a work trip i left before the works started and returned when they finished. Needless to say the upgrade was nice. The new room was similar size with some difference, better tv, an inner window for added noise control, nice fridge and bathroom.

I do not know what the food is like as i went out with work colleagues. The location of the hotel is fantastic. just outside the door you have a bus stop where multiple buses stop and you also have the metro. Buy a T10 ticket, it is great value for money. 

Across the road you will walk through the pillars to view the fountain which lights up at night and music is played and it turns into a colorful water display. 

Overall, i was there for work, but if i was travelling alone for a break i would recommend this hotel.",5,2018,02,12
47,Barcelona. ,"One of the best places I have visited, absolutely wonderful experience,  wonderful people, lots of shops, bakery with fresh croissants, curros, fresh baguettes. Free WiFi everywhere which was useful. Travelling by Metro was very easy and reasonably priced.
",5,2018,02,07
47,Great location very tired.,This hotel could benefit from a good overhaul of the plumbing and decor. The staff and house keeping were excellent. They must be fighting to keep the place in good shape on a daily basis. Comfortable beds. Amazing breakfast shame the hot meats were always cold..plenty of other things to choose.,3,2018,02,05
47,my review,"#1 it was pretty loud due to some constructions.
#2 For one day no water for shower/toilet in my room
#3 I should have been sent an invoice via email to my account which I still did not receive
#4 no safe key was available for two days

breakfast personel was very friendly!",3,2018,02,05
47,Water issues in rooms,"Hotel was nice enough and the roof top pool terrace was amazing, with stunning panoramic views.

However most days the water in my room would run out of the taps brown. On one particular day, there was no hot water at all and very brown water, this was down to an unexpected water leak on the fifth floor and this was explained to me and fixed by the evening.

Breakfast was nice, but much spread out across the restaurant (Hot food in one corner, salad and cold meats in the other, tea and coffee in another corner) of quite a big room.
",3,2018,02,05
47,Perfect site to start your Barcelona trip!,"Traveling alone and felt very welcomed by the friendly staff. I ended my trip here, but wish I had started it instead. Close to a major metro stop and an information office. Walking distance from fountains, Greek jardins, theater, Olympic stadium and museum of art. Busy neighborhood but centrally located. Airport bus shuttle has a stop in front of this hotel",5,2018,01,28

Excellent location, not far from city centre.Friendly staff, nothing to much for them, very helpful.Will recommend to my friends. Wisited Barcelona for business and will definitely stay at this hotel again. ",5,2018,01,27
47,Good hotel with nice location and great pool area,This hotel is located on plaza Universitat so it's a walking distance to city center. The hotel itself is nice and clean and rooms are more or less spacious. The price is not extremely expensive taking into consideration that we are in the center of Barcelona. The service is good and the breakfast are great. There are various types of buffet that you can arrange all kinds of meals.,4,2018,01,17
47,Nice Hotel,"Nice hotel with a beautiful view over Barcelona directly at the Placa d'Espanya. Nice and clean suite, clean and quiet, good service.
Airport buses stop directly in front of the hotel. 20 min to airport and 15 min to Placa De Catalunya and La Rambla. ",5,2018,01,16
47,Great place for a short trip,"Located centrally, friendly staff, beds are superb, rooms very nice, views amazing from top floors. Breakfast fair. Sauna must be booked in advance, no restimg room.

47,A sort of terrible place: the room is an oven!,"I’m at 5th floor, just renewed room: terrible glue smell. But ok.
Still a nightmare. Room is large and fine but it is an oven: temperature is very high. Impossible to sleep or relax. Opened the window to improve but then lot of roads noise.
I called twice. At 6pm they told me that cannot so anything. But they’ll check. Called again at 11pm: they told me to stop heater: but controller is off. Better, is out of order. They told me that they’ll call me back. It is 1 an and I’m still waiting. A NIGHTMARE!",2,2018,01,08
47,Super service ,"Very nice hotel with an excellent service. Special thx for good breakfast. Room was clean and Wi-fi worked good. Nice view, near the hotel is a non stop market. That was a good experience, will return here 100%.",5,2018,01,06
47,Great Hotel-Great Location,"We were a group of 6 that stayed for 2 nights at this hotel. One night before a cruise and one night after. When we landed we purchased a return bus ticket for the A1 Metro bus. It took us directly to the front of the hotel. On the return you simply walk outside the hotel and the bus lets you off right at the terminal of the departure section of the airport. It could not be more convenient. Not necessary to spend more on taxis or private transportation.

The hotel is located perfectly for walking around and sightseeing. It's about a 20 minute walk to Las Rambles. You can purchase Hop- on Hop- off bus tickets at the main desk and the bus stop is just across the street from the hotel. There is a mall across the street as well with a grocery store for purchasing food or snacks. It has a great selection of bottled wine that is so inexpensive it is shocking, especially compared to what we are used to paying here in Canada. There are many restaurants located within the mall so you are not limited to having to eat at the hotel. We did purchase the buffet breakfast each morning and I probably would not do that again. I would prefer to just walk across the street and purchase something there unless you want that big buffet style breakfast.

The room was very nice, modern and clean. It was a nice size with a huge shower and looked as though it had been recently renovated. We had a room looking out over the square so it was quite lively out there. You cannot leave the window open though as it is very noisy. They have very good sound prove windows installed. You barely hear anything once they're closed. My only complaint with the whole hotel is not having access to air conditioning when we arrived. It was very warm and the first night sleep was definitely uncomfortable. Apparently, they shut it down that time of year. However, it would be nice to have the choice of putting it on if the room is uncomfortably warm. We didn't need it on the second night as the temperature had dropped on our return from the cruise.

We did book another cruise for Fall out of Barcelona again. I would definitely return to this hotel as we all agreed it is so convenient to everything. The staff were friendly, helpful and accommodating. 

My only other recommendation and problem we experienced while there was that both our rooms were pre-paid months in advance at time of booking. When we returned home I noticed we were charged again for the 2nd night stay. Not sure if this was the fault of the hotel or the company we booked with but we did end up getting reimbursed. So if your room is pre-paid prior to arriving, I would confirm that with them to save yourself the hassle of getting your money back. Other than that, you will enjoy this hotel and location.",4,2018,01,05
47,Great cxentral position,"Fantastically positioned hotel. We walked to Barcelona FC, beach and Gothic area (not on the same day!) - it's about 45min -to an hour for each.  Lots of good cafes and restaurants nearby. We went to El Faison twice and ate outside in the evening in December! The weather was 17 degrees although we were in t-shirts and locals in coats.  Breakfasted at BuenasMigas just outside hotel so can't comment on the hotel food. There are two restaurants inside but we are drawn to the local area.
Tip: Book over New Year and you get the best seat in Barcelona for the fireworks! There's an in-hotel party but we didn't go to it. You need tickets. We were happy to eat out and then use the roof garden for the view. Staff friendly, beds comfortable. Slightly noisy aircon but won't spoil all the other conveniences unless you are very noise sensitive, in wich ase you would not be booking a city hotel!",4,2018,01,04
47,New Year’s Eve destination ,"We stayed in a family suite and was absolutely delighted .

47,Great room and location,"First time in Barcelona, found this hotel on another website.  Check-in was curiously took a long time but we were upgraded so can't complain.   And 2 nights here were less than one night in NYC!  Had a room on the 6th floor looking right out over the plaza.    Drinks and light snacks are available to all on the 6th floor.   The room was beautiful and well appointed.  Bathroom was spacious, loved the shower.   Regardless of the temperature, go up to the 8th floor pool and take pictures.  Right next to a mall, Gran Via, art museum,",5,2018,01,03
47,30th birthday stay,"Wonderful hotel, great location, very clean and tidy. Was given a free upgrade due to it being a special trip which was a lovely surprise and our upgraded room was amazing! Huge bed, pillow menu, lovely clean bathroom with very large walk in shower! 
Roof top pool and Terrace is lovely, views are amazing over the city! Shame the roof top bar wasn’t open at all so wasn’t able to enjoy the views with a drink on my birthday but the hotel was very kind and sent room service to my room with champagne and chocolates on the eve of my birthday, wonderful surprise!!

Its the start and end for the hop on/hop off buses and the place to join a free walking tour.",5,2017,12,28
47,A must stay,i Would recommend this hotel to family and friends for business or pleasure for couple or for business or if you were travelling alone - it’s an all around hotel and worth the money and a perfect location ,5,2017,12,28
47,Stunning rooftop pool and bar view,I liked the most the rooftop pool and bar. The view is stunning. In the evening you will have the best view to the fountains light show for free😀. Rooms are spacious and very clean. All have a great view /we had a view on Arena/. Hotel gives feeling of luxury and we had very good time during our stay. I recommend!,4,2017,12,25
47,An amazing location. An excellent hotel,"The location is one of the best in Barcelona, well conected by Metro, taxi, bus, shuttle bus to airport close to Train station, surrounded by Commercial centers, museums, exhibition halls. The staff friendly , rooms quite nice and breakfast rich and excellent",5,2017,12,22
47,Amazing Stay!!,"Stayed on 12/18. The staff at the front desk (Oriol - if I remember correctly) was really friendly and we felt like we were genuinely welcomed. Thanks!!
The room was clean and the location was fantastic - we took Aerobus and the bus station is literally less than 1 min walk from the entrance of the hotel. Would definitely stay again next time I'm in Barcelona.",5,2017,12,21
47,Excellent hotel,"We had a great room on the executive floor. Very comfortable, very clean, with all the amenities we could wish for, including a nespresso machine,restocked daily. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was excellent with a variety to meet anyones wishes.",5,2017,12,20

47,Practical,"The hotel was very clean, they have a friendly and helpful staff and the location was near restaurants, shops and Metro station. The view from our room was the National Museum of Art and the hill of Montjuic.",4,2017,12,19
47,Nice...,"We stayed on the executive level. Lovely spread of nibbles and drinks as you exit the lift on to the executive floor.
The room was tiny but well equipped. Nice bathroom but again very small. Great location. Metro a few feet from hotel entrance. Staff very helpful and friendly. ",4,2017,12,12
47,Location,Hotel is right in front of airport bus.  It is a good base for travel around Barcelona and to the cruise port.  The pool area on the terrace has very nice view and should be good for liunging during warmer seasons.,4,2017,12,12
47,Perfect Birthday Trip!,I came to Barcelona on my first solo trip. Being a woman traveling by myself i was already a bit nervous! When I arrived at the airport the taxis knew exactly where the hotel was located (even with a bit of a language barrier). i arrived and was in the center of all the action! There was a beautiful Christmas Choir happening in the streets in front of the hotel so the welcome was super warm! I arrived a bit early so my room wasnt ready yet but they gladly took my luggage and i went to the roof and took some amazing photographs of the festivites happening out front. Also they gave me a drink ticket for the bar while i waited :) Before I arrived i sent an email telling them it was my bday and if they could provide a higher level room for me because i heard you get the best view from a higher room. To my surprise they upgraded my room to an executive suite that was as big as my NYC apartment!! I had my own wrap around terrace/robes/fruit with champagne it was the BEST BIRTHDAY GIFT EVER!!! The service was unbelievable. Room service is 24hrs and the portions were large. The only negative thing i would say is they need more security at night securing the front entrance. It is very quiet and there was not a doorman or anymore making sure the only people accessing the property were hotel guests. ,5,2017,12,11
47,Beautiful hotel and wonderful staff...,"I was just dashing in and out for a flight, but had a really nice one night stay.  The staff were fantastic, and the hotel very grand and had a really cool, sexy roof top pool, bar and dining. I would definitely stay again...",4,2017,12,10
47,Super hotel and good location,"Good hotel and restaurents, very good breakfast.
Super location and easy to acces via bus ( from airport ) and or metro.
Accorss the street , you have the Arena, shopping center incl good and cheap restaurents.
Staff very frindly and helped when taxi's did not drive, due to strike.",4,2017,12,04
47,A regular businessvisitor to Barcelona,"Apart from the fact that the hotel is excellent by any standards, it is particularly convenient in being the first bus stop from the airport when arriving and the last bus stop when leaving. This means getting to my room in a minimum of time.",5,2017,12,02
47,A gem in Barcelona ,"This hotel not too fancy but very practical in a prefect location of Barcelona, near everything u need , busy but not too crazy, I stayed there for a few days, the room was awesome! Because I was arrived earlier in the morning , the nice French girl gave me a suite so I can get some rest right away, after a long flight from NYC, heart warming the suite at 9 floor also has 2 bathroom , facing the plaza , phenomenal view day & night can’t be more happier , also u can see the pool view at the side of living room, Gorgeous sunset view at pool, wow, see the pic blow , its forever in my memory! 

Stunning breakfast place so as breakfast too, the handsome French manager George was very kind & helpful, the only problem is: the bathroom sink has some smell from pipe , hope they fixed it already cause very disturbing the sleep ! 

Overall it’s a good place to stay in Barcelona , will return this hotel if I come back to this city again ! ",4,2017,12,01
47,unsecure Hotel and you are easy target for thieves,"staying at this hotel is equal staying at the street!!! my passport was stolen from my locked suitcase from inside my room!!!  
And I had to check-out with a broken suitcase.
** Hotel management claims that I didn’t take precaution (they forget that I can’t take my big suite case to meetings!!)
** And they suggested that I didn’t close the door (they forget that it is not a door for a house – and that no strangers should roam between rooms)
** Staff is nice (helped me to wrap my damaged suitcase with plastic-film – and translate some papers).
** Breakfast is good.
** it is a tired old hotel (decoration & furniture).
in this hotel you are easy target for thieves.",1,2017,12,01
47,Good business hotel,"I stayed here 3 night due to its close proximity to Fira conference centre. Their executive floor is up to scratch. Nice bed, good bathroom and quite recently refurbished. The breakfast is worth the money too, grate selection of food. I also sampled their Japanese restaurant which was a nice surprise. The food was nice and not overpriced. The staff everywhere were attentive and friendly. All in all a pleasant stay.and I would stay there again.",5,2017,11,30
47,Family holiday in Barcelona,"Great location.  A modern hotel with spacious, clean and comfortable rooms.  Ask for a room with a view - for a small additional cost it is worth it to wake up to the view of Montjuic Castle and enjoy the lights of the city at night. Staff friendly and very competent.  Bus to airport stops literally in front of the hotel.  Overall great choice for a family holiday.",4,2017,11,28
47,Very good,Endorsment for the reception in particular I renember Alba who immediately take care of us. Clean and perfectly located and well serviced from taxi near the Barcelona trade fair I will be back. Thanks,5,2017,11,27
47,Sightseeing ,"Barcelona- definitely the city that doesn't sleep. 
Use the excellent Metro and local bus services, at Catalunya ... so cheap!  ****First thing to pack if you want to get around is a pair of really comfortable shoes or trainers - your going to need them ****
We didn't want Barcelona to be an expensive week, so we took the red tour bus in Catalunya and went around the Orange Route and the Green Route. Get the two day ticket it's worth the extra 10€.
We made up our minds what we did and didn't want to see. We used the Blue Bus that goes to Tibidabo Mountain the highest point where The Temple of the Sacred Heart is. The views were amazing you can see all over Barcelona. There's also a fairground for the children. 
We ate out all the time it was cheap enough, one of our favourite places was Dunnes the Irish Bar on the road called Via Laietana. The Gothic Quarter was superb for shopping. We visited the Palau de Music on a Flamenco Dancing and Spanish Guitar night, it was superb and the decoration of the building is amazing. Park Güll and Sagrada Familia was really good too. ",5,2017,11,27
47,"Nice hotel, but making a reservation was a hassle","There was much confusion for over 1 month in trying to get the reservation confirmed.   After I finally had the reservation finalized, the hotel was very nice:  clean, comfortable, good wifi, centrally located, friendly and helpful staff.",4,2017,11,26
47,Excellent Location - Excellent Breakfast Rooms and Service need significant improvement,"We stayed at your hotel From November 19-23, 2017. We booked two rooms for our family.
I would like to bring to  your attention several points that came up during our visit:

    Connecting rooms were not offered when we came to get the keys to our room.
    Construction: You are conducting construction at your hotel. This was not brought to our attention prior to booking and we would not have booked a room at a hote under renovation. We complained several time about the noise but nothing was done! This is not acceptable. We do not come to a vacation to hear constant drilling noise above us.
    Room: 

    Noise on top of the construction noise we suffered from the noise on the street. You must add a second layer of noise insulation.
    Air Conditioning is shut down - we were told that as of November you only heat the rooms - this was a particularly warm week were cooling was required. Opening the window to bring in the noise and pollution from the traffic is unacceptable.
    Safety Deposit Box - There was no lock available for the security box - I have no idea why you do not equip all rooms with locks for the safety deposit boxes. The security situation in Barcelona requires visitors to carry a minimal amount of valuables. An attempt to pickpocket us occurred.
    Lighting - The room is very dark kindly replace the light bulbs, add lights.
    Beds - The beds were two separate beds instead of one queen bed. The blankets are very poor quality.
    Bathroom - The shower curtain is a bad solution - water spills on the bathroom floor. The positioning of the shower handle is in the middle of the bathtub instead of the end - where it was originally was. No body lotion is provided, as well as sewing kit, and other basic amenities. The water that comes out of the shower is BROWN and only after several minutes becomes clear. There is shower gel / shampoo - all in one They have decided to save on costs.
    Electrical outlets are missing for charging phones next to the bed, and only one on the desk.

     4. Breakfast:

    The knife used to cutting bread is dull
    The knife used to cut salami is dull
    There is a neglect in refilling the tables with food that is missing
    The pepper grinder near the vegetables is broken - I remarked but it was not replaced.

     5. Gym

    The TV does not work
    It is missing basic equipment
    It is missing a mirror

    6. House Keeping

    I requested extra towels - it took over an hour and only after a reminder call to get them.

    7. Front Desk

    I asked to speak to a manager to voice the points I mentioned above, this after I asked to extend my stay for a late check out. I was told by the front desk manager that my complaints are all motivated to get a free late checkout. The front desk manager said that this is the way the hotel is and it was clear that she was not interested in improving the service or the points raised.",2,2017,11,23
47,Very Good Hotel,"We spent 4 nights in this hotel and certainly enjoyed it. Good position, nice big lobby, good breakfast, nice facilities and very good and friendly service. If you book this hotel in the near future make sure you get the rooms facing the circle and not at the back where they are doing some construction work and is a bit noisy.",4,2017,11,20
47,Fantastic hotel in a great location ,"The location of the hotel was beautiful.   The hotel was very busy.  You need to get the key to the locker from the front desk by paying a refundable deposit.  Breakfast was included and was awesome.  A variety of choices. They were making fresh crepes, waffles, omelette etc.  loved the stay",5,2017,11,17
47,"Great Location, Beautiful Room but in Need of Maintenance","I had a nice stay at the Catalonia Barcelona Plaza in room 423.  It was a nice room, dirty grout in bathroom, huge closet, no robes, refrigerator, a safe, and a very hard bed.  Really bad window view.  Nice breakfast under a tent in the center courtyard.  Perfect location with lots to do in the area, including a bullfighting ring turned shopping mall across the street.",4,2017,11,16
47,Great hotel in a great location with a lovely staff,"We had a wonderful time! The hotel staff were so nice and helpful. The hotel is very comfortable and accessible- from the airport 
and to all the city attractions. We had a beautiful view from our room. And overall had an excellent stay!",4,2017,11,14
47,Excellent hotel,We experienced an excellent staying in a very well located hotel with nice services and friendly personnel . Clean and comfortable rooms; excellent breakfast. We would definitely recommend this hotel to others and we would love to return again!,5,2017,11,13
47,Love that hotel,This Hotel is located in the heart of Barcelona.   It's very busy and I can see why.  The staff is very friendly.  Upon your arrival you get a coupon for a welcoming drink.  If you are lucky enough you can get a view of the water fountain show from your room or you can go to the beautiful roof top.  The hotel is right across from the Arena mall.  We met a basketball team from Istanbul during our stay as well as a lot of tourist from the US.  I would have given this hotel a five star but my bathtub  was a little dated and the noise level was ok for me because i am a heavy sleeper but a bit too much for my companions ,4,2017,11,13
47,Awesome!,"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights with a group of 50 pilgrims. We were all on the 3rd floor and our room had a very nice view of the bull ring across the street that has been turned into a mall with a walk around on the top. We were were also fed both dinner and breakfast at this place and both were truly amazing with a buffet that had an extremely large selection of food as well as an omelette station. The rooms were clean and even though there was a lot of city noise, the windows were thick (like on a cruise ship) that the noise was blocked out. Excellent place!!!",5,2017,11,12
47,Can be better,"I stayed in the hotel on a business trip. The rooftop has a nice view, the pool and the bar is class. 

My room was disappointing and the walls were not thick enough as I could hear my neighbor coughing or flushing the toilets + my room view was not really nice. 

The breakfast choice is large but often cold (eggs,sausages cooked in advance). 

Regarding the service at the reception, they were nice and spoke multiple languages. 

I wish it could have been the same at the rooftop bar! Their english was bad but they were also very very slow... you could spend forever to order something (it was not busy so no excuses). ",3,2017,11,10
47,Terrace room with business,"Check in was slow. But this was only due to the amount of people checking in at the time. I think it is a Airport hotel, which normally I try to avoid. The hotel was very clean and my room was great. It looked exactly like the photos. There are 2 restaurants and a snack bar. We used the Japanese restaurant only. Which was very good. Every evening around 1800 hotel staff go round every room to offer a good night chocolate. If you are out then it will be waiting in your room for you. 
My room was a little noisy. I was in 893 which next door was a staff entrance where a lot of banging and noise was coming from. Not for long but every now and again. That’s probably my only gripe. ",4,2017,11,08
47,Wonderful older hotel conveniently located within Barcelona,Wonderful older hotel (dated bathroom with a shower curtain although it was fully functional).  Shower had plenty of hot water and strong pressure.  Front desk staff was very helpful and informative.  Two different subway/metro lines just outside the hotel's front door.  Right across the street is the former Barcelona bullring which has been turned into a shopping mall with plenty of dining options.  Twelve to fifteen minute walk to Las Ramblas (or a three or four stop trip on the various metro lines).  Wonderful hotel helped make Barcelona a wonderful experience.,5,2017,11,04
47,Dirty and noisy ,"The only good thing about this hotel is the rooftop bar and the views over Plaza España and Montjuic. That's all. 
Big, with wooden floors in hallways making each step clearly audible to all. The doors to rooms were not sound proof. In fact with all lights off in my room I didn't need a torch or any lights on to find my way to bathroom because there were significant slots between the door and its frame. While walking downs the hallways you could hear every word people would say in their rooms. Very buzzard for a 4-star hotel. 
However the worst part were the bathrooms. Take a look at the picture and answer yourself if that's a 4-star EU cleanliness standard. I changed my room twice upon arrival because I could not accept a black, mouldy, filthy-looking rim around the basin. I heard from my colleagues that they had similar black lining or spots around their bathtubs. That's a big no! I wouldn't go back there. Sorry. ",2,2017,11,01
47,Smooth sojourn,"Safe. Great staff. Clean. Calm. Beautiful. Subdued.
I am used to travel a lot, mostly on my own. I have felt warmly welcomed at the hotel. Always safe. 
The room was clean, with a beautiful view. 
The staff was helpful, very attentionate and enthusiastic.",5,2017,11,01
47,Excellent Hotel in great location,"From check in to check out we were impressed with the service we received. The hotel is in a great location being right next to a Metro station and 15 minute walk to the Olympic Stadium. The room was clean and tidy. We were travelling with our 14 year old daughter and the couch served as her bed. although OK for a short break, we will need 2 rooms from now on",4,2017,10,31
47,A tale of two hotels,"First of all, the Catalonia is well situated.  Secondly the hotel is a merger of old and new with an old side and a new side.  The old side is wood panelled and cosy, with the usual tiny lifts, the new side is contemporary with bigger rooms.  So ask which side you are booked on.  There is a roof top pool, and several bars.  Rooms on the old side are small but not tiny.  As ever in Barcelona go for location and this place is well situated",3,2017,10,29
47,Beautiful views,We stayed here one night as a wedding gift from family. The views are beautiful on the rooftop. Room was lovely and the breakfast buffet was amazing. Drinks by the lift too (the good stuff). If I was to stay in the city again would deffo stay here!,5,2017,10,25
47,Fridge Door,"The door to my room fridge fell off when I opened it.
Which the reception team thought was hilarious when I reported.
Until I told them it had landed on my foot. It hurt so much I cried.
It was fixed same day. My foot took quite few days longer.",3,2017,10,24
47,Nice staying at Barcelona Blaza,The hotel is very nice with all the necessary amenities. I was there for a business trip. There was only a constant problem with my keycard which was not functionning well. I loved the pool and the terrace in the 8th floor with maginificient view over Barcelona.,4,2017,10,24
47,Service beyond the call,"This is a lovely hotel, perfectly located and convenient to transport.  Metro station and airport shuttle both at front door!  We had an issue with our passports and the courier company supposed to deliver them.  The front desk staff couldn't have been more helpful and pleasant.  Strongly recommend it for your stay in Barcelona!",4,2017,10,23
47,More than adequate confusion over the bill,"The hotel is clean and modern the rooms are recently refurbished and of good quality. Very much a functional hotel and not to atmospheric but staff helpful. I would have no issue about staying on business again but only use as a base if with family

",4,2017,10,20
47,Great location,"The highlight of this hotel is the awesome  view from the rooftop bar. The location is great, close to the metro. There is a bullring next door that has been converted into a modern shopping mall. The room was clean and breakfast was tasty with lots of food to choose from.",4,2017,10,17
47,great stay,"it's a wonderful stay in your hotel. everything worked out great. Excellent room, breakfast, excellent location. All hotel staff are helpful. Will recommend this hotel to my friends or anyone who plan to visit Barcelona. ",5,2017,10,17
47,A Wonderful Time......,"We chose this hotel because of the location outside of the main tourist area.  It is located in front of Plaza España and just to the left of the old bull fighting ring turned shopping center. The local surrounding streets are filled with quaint very good places to eat. Two that come to mind are a small Turkish place and an Argentinian Bar/Cafe. 
 There is a metro station right outside the door of the hotel that will take you anywhere in the city for about 2 Euro.  Across the street behind the Plaza España is one of the stops of the City Tours double decker busses. 

As far as the rooms they were very comfortable and modern clean decor fills the space.  Bathrooms were large and with all the nice amenities.  There is no carpeting so everything can be heard in the hallway.  I felt like I needed to take off my shoes as to not disturb anyone else on our floor.  

Our room included breakfast in a very large room with a very nice buffet.  Anything you could possibly want was included, a fresh bakery station, an egg station with every possible preparation you could think of, a juicing station, fruit, waffles, pancakes.  If you leave that breakfast hungry it's your own fault.  Every morning during our stay we ate here and were able to go straight through our day of sightseeing until dinner.  They even have a gluten free station available for guests with that need.

There is a roof top pool with a bar.  Careful....the sangria will knock your socks off.  It was amazing but after just one (very large) sangria my mom and I were giggling all the way back to our room.  Service at that bar is very friendly and the view is unbelievable!

We loved Barcelona, want to go back and would not hesitate to stay here again!!!",5,2017,10,17
47,Catalonia,"Excellent room, friendly helpful staff excellent choice of breakfast and only a bus ride to the main centrre. Highly recommend this Hotel. The pool was fantastic set on the rooftop but unfortunately the spa didn't open until 11am so didn't get to go.",5,2017,10,17
47,Great hotel ,"We were at the hotel in 10-14/10/17, the hotel was great, we gat a nice room whit view to the plaza, the location was perfect and the staff was kind and pleasant. the pool was nice and good for relax😎",5,2017,10,17
47,Surprisingly good,"I was here for a conference for 3 nights 7-10th October 2017.

First impressions weren't great - the building is fairly ugly from the outside and the reception area seems low and bland.  This is not a hotel full of character.

Check-in was smooth and the staff friendly.  Rooms maybe a shade on the small side but very well appointed and with all the extras you'd expect.  My only criticism would be the walk-in shower floor which is rather like an ice-rink when wet.

Inclusive breakfast was excellent with plenty of variety.  Rooftop pool and bar is a little haven of tranquility, though bar prices are predictably very high.

SO easy to get here from the airport with the shuttle bus stopping just across the road on arrival, and almost straight outside the door on return.

The area is perhaps a little soulless but it's so easy to get around by Metro, bus and open-top tourist bus it really doesn't matter.",4,2017,10,17
47,Nice Hotel but Very Noisy,"My mom stayed here for 4 nights. I met up with her on the last 2 nights. She was upgraded to a beautiful suite on the 9th floor. It was incredibly spacious and luxurious. I mean, one of the bathrooms had a jacuzzi! The views were nice and the location is also good. It's not central but it's across the street from a tour bus stop and right next to the airport bus stop.

However, it was incredibly difficult to sleep because our room faced the pool and people were out there until 2am. We could not sleep before midnight because of this. There was also a strong sewage smell coming from the sinks. So it was either open the window and listen to the loud partying, or close the window and suffocate from sewage smells. 

The staff, aside from check-in, doesn't speak much English. My mom asked the maid to tidy the smaller bathroom for 2 days but she didn't understand. I speak Spanish and clarified when I got there. Later, we ordered bottled water from room service. They didn't understand ""water"" so I finished the order in Spanish. You would think water is a popular order... 

The bedroom could also use more outlets. There was only one behind the couch. The breakfast selection is good, and there are several restaurants in the hotel. We tried Kurai and it was decent. The front desk actually recommends places outside for tapas, paella, and seafood. We did try a few of their nearby recommendations but they were way too touristy.",3,2017,10,16
47,Five irons and NO ironing boards!,"Thinking I must be crazy, I found a lot of reviews that said they don´t have any irons for clothes (I think they have 5 for the entire hotel). Well, I just discovered they also don´t have ANY ironing boards. What a horrible thing to be unwilling to provide travelers...especially business travelers! 

Their solution - They have a ¨service¨ that will charge you 6 euros per shirt...complete rip off! Also note that this has been a complaint for a long time, and the persons who responds to these reviews always writes ¨We are sorry. We want you to give us a second chance.¨ It´s a lie. They have done nothing after a year fo complaints.",1,2017,10,14
47,"Great hotel, great location!","Catalonia Barcelona Plaza is located on the Placa d'Espania which has beautiful views 360 degrees around.  Across the street is the old Arenas de Barcelona which has been turned into a mall.  The Museu Nacional d' Art is directly across the placa. 
 They have beautiful waterfalls at night and music as well.  You can catch the fountains from your room, the pool bar or take a walk over.  The hotel looks new, it is exceptionally clean, and the hotel staff were very nice and friendly. It has a nice cocktail bar. The gentleman at the front desk gave us maps and gave us directions to certain tourist attractions via the metro.  The metro stop was directly in front of the hotel and very easy to use.
  The train station was across the street from the hotel.  We took the train to Montserrat.  We were only a few stops from Las Ramblas.
  This hotel has a rooftop bar which all lit up at night.  You can see the water and light shows at the Barcelona Museum.  It is a 10 minute taxi ride from the airport.  
  I would definitely stay here again in the future!",5,2017,10,11
47,Fantastic,The roof top bar/pool area is amazing and you can see all of the city. There was a concert going on down in the streets with light show - we watched from the roof top. I love this hotel- food was not the greatest - but location and accomadations are top notch.,5,2017,10,11
47,"Great Views, but a little disappointing","We changed rooms 2 times due to issues in maintenance.
We weren't given any complimentary water, which we should have because the water tastes horrible out of the tap. We paid over €2000 for 5 nights. For a 4 star hotel it needs to look at the little things to make it a better stay.",4,2017,10,10
47,Very nice Hotel with nice members of staff,"It is a nice Hotel in a good place of Barcelona. The overview from the 7th floor to a part of the city is great.
The people from the Desk and service are very friendly and helpful.
The rooms have all necessary paraphernalia and they are clean, but I was only for sleeping in my room. :-)",5,2017,10,10
47,Five Star all the way,"Fabulous view from our mini suite over Plaza Espana. Service was excellent and always with a smile. Breakfast yummy. Pool loungers the largest I have ever seen, we had it to ourselves. Will definitely recommend and go there again.",5,2017,10,09
47,Great location,Hotel is centrally located with great views over the placa espana. Rooms are large but are very dark and in need of a little modernisation to match the look and feel of the communal areas of the hotel. Rooms could be better soundproofed as you can hear when everyone opens a door in the corridor. Breakfast selection was wide and varied. The rooftop bar is very nice with great views of the city. The hotel was very expensive due to a lot of large events happening in Barcelona at the time which did not make it good value for money but overall a nice stay.,4,2017,10,09
47,Fabulous hotel,Stayed here with family in August. We booked one suite and two standard rooms - pleasantly surprised to get upgraded to premium rooms. Suites are slightly dated but very spacious. Stunning views all around and ideal location. Rooftop pool was very busy at all times and bar a tad expensive - but in line with what you would expect from such a premium hotel. Hostess on our floor was helpful with dinner reservations. Highly recommended.,5,2017,10,08
47,Central hotel,"Very good and central hotel.
Rooms are big and clean but are deserving a better maintenance.
The view of the room was to the fountains in mont juic. 
The staff was very helpful and friendly.
Breakfast is good with a large variety. They have 2 or 3 restaurants at the hotel which was great as I arrived quite late, but you have many other choices in the surrounding.
I would recommend this hotel, either for leisure or for business.",4,2017,10,08
47,Excellent hotel,"Stayed in hotel for 4 days on executive floor. Very nice rooms with great sight on placa espagna. Breakfast was very good, wide range of options. Airco in fitness was a bit off.  Service given at desk was excellent. Location is well covered by taxis so convenient.",4,2017,10,05
47,Fabulous views over fountain,"Great hotel, amazing views to front of hotel. Executive rooms had everything that a 5* hotel should have. Lack of TV channels in English - news only. Road noise kept to a minimum with double, double glazing. We had a fabulous 3 night stay and will definitely return.",5,2017,10,04
47,Great place!,"Our hostess Alba was wonderful! She had such a great attitude and she helped us first timers to Barcelona with great information.
The room and the view incredible! Great place to experience Barcelona. Close to the Sea as well.",5,2017,10,03
47,Best hotel in Barcelona,"Highly recommend, staff is friendly, happy to help you and answer all your questions. Facilities are modern and clean. Great convenient location accesible to bus lines, shopping center and best city attractions. Would definitely consider this hotel before any other. ",5,2017,10,03
47,"Good location, Service is not the best, skip the breakfast","Check in was a breeze but had to wait quite a while for a room to be ready.  Traveled on business and there were no irons in the room.  I called to ask for one and was told that they have irons but just not right now.  I asked when they thought one would be available and was told they had no idea and that I should have booked an upgraded room if I wanted an iron.  Rude.  About an hour later an iron was available.  By the time I went to an appointment and got back to iron my clothes for the next day, it was gone. 

The breakfast buffet was quite skimpy on the selection especially for 20 Euros.  

The saving grace for me was the roof top pool area and the view over the plaza.  It is a perfect spot to watch the magic fountain show and we were lucky enough to be there for the fireworks show for the La Mercè festival 2017,  It was spectacular!!!

The shower is perfectly designed to flood the bathroom if your are not very careful.  

This is not a quiet hotel, you can hear every toilet around you flushing at all hours and hear traffic from the street. 
 
Caution to everyone, the safety lock inside your room does not work.  Twice I locked the room from the inside and housekeeping barged in twice after knocking.  I couldn't get to the door fast enough before they came in.",3,2017,09,29
47,Probably the best hotel in Barcelona,"My stay, after a traumatic few months (of which I made the hotel aware), was made excellent by the friendly, welcoming and extremely professional  approach at all times.
I cannot recommend highly enough the staff and in particular pool bar manager Leo, Angelica and of course who could forget Thais. All were my rock whilst I was here.
The setting, quality and professionalism of the hotel, the staff and the management is stunning throughout.",5,2017,09,27
47,Business trip to Barcelona,"A large group of us stayed in this hotel whilst attending a conference at the Fira Grand Via. This is a very central hotel with good access to bars, restaurants and the metro and a fairly short taxi ride to the Fira Grand.  

The hotel has a great rooftop pool and bar area with great views of the city. The rooms are quite large with minibar, safe and flatscreen TV. 

The staff were very polite, friendly and helpful. Breakfast had a very wide range of foods to cater for pretty much everyone. ",4,2017,09,25
47,Good business hotel in the centre,"Stayed at this hotel recently on a business trip.

Its location is handy as it is close to the city centre and also to Espana metro stop. They have a good rooftop bar with a swimming pool. Their breakfast spread is quite extensive and includes hot dishes as well as continental breakfast.

Rooms are well equipped and spotless.",4,2017,09,25
47,Nice views from the pool area and bar,"The room was really nice and clean and beds comfortable.
There are a lots of restaurants and bars around.
Pool and bar at floor 8 is great: the bar is quite expensive for Spain, but the views are worth the money (drinks about 10 euros). We spent some time there after walking around the sights and in the evening after the dinner.",5,2017,09,23
47,A great way to end a long trip,"We stayed here before flying home after a long flight across the Atlantic. The room was great, spacious and well furnished. The rooftop terrace gives great views of Plaça d'Espanya though the pool is outdoor and pretty cold in September! 

Special thanks to Andrea who helped us out a lot on up the 6th floor and made our stay very enjoyable.
",5,2017,09,22
47,i was expecting more from 4 stars hotel,"The quality of the room service and cleaning was an issue for me, the towels had spots on them, not a lot choices of food when it comes to Vegetarian and the quality it not up to standard of 4 stars hotel.",3,2017,09,19
47,Excellent,"very impressive rooftop bar with an exceptional view, right across the street from a great shopping center would definitely go back and would definitely recommend to my friends. I was over for a business trip but would go back in a heartbeat for a holiday",5,2017,09,19
47,Great Barcelona Hotel,Stayed here on a work trip. Location is excellent at place Espanya for transport links. Rooms very good and excellent service. Breakfast really good and the rooftop bar and terrace is amazing. Expensive hotel by Barca standards but would recommend ,5,2017,09,17
47,Good quality option,"We stayed at the Catalonia Barcelona Plaza as part of an organised holiday. The rooms are generous with a large wardrobe, in room safe and good size bathroom. Our room had an opening window that faced into the inner courtyard of the hotel. The courtyard is covered and is where breakfast is served. The hotel foyer is well appointed and has an ATM inside. This was reassuring as we had been warned many times about pickpockets in Barcelona so to have an ATM in the lobby was great.
The hotel is located on Plaza Espana and there is a metro station right outside the door. There is also a large shopping complex in the old bullring across the road and a lovely walk directly opposite past many fountains and at the top there s a lovely view of the city.
My only negative comment is that the bathroom was worn with a few fixtures loose and a door that did not close but it was it still functional with plenty of room to hang our laundry.",4,2017,09,17
47,Catalonia never lets us down,"It was as our first time to Barcelona and wanted to have a nice home base to work from to tour from.  We have stayed several times at Catalonia hotels over the years and always had great service and comfortable accommodations which we expected again.  The Catalonia Barcelona Plaza did not let us down.  We had just flown in from an all-night flight from Canada and were exhausted.  Lucy at the reception desk was able to get us to our room ahead of schedule which was greatly appreciated. The hotel was bright, spacious and the wonderful staff always there to assist.  We spend four night and enjoyed every moment we were there.  The roof top pool was always a nice way to end the day and have a refreshment and view the city at night. Special thanks to Thais and Wafa at the pool bar for making us feel like home. Highly recommend staying at this hotel.",5,2017,09,14
47,Amazing rooftop bar and terrace,"Just back from a long weekend with friends in Barcelona. We enjoyed our stay at the Catalonia Barcelona Plaza. The rooms, staff and rooftop bar and pool definitely make up for the location being a few kilometres (€6) in a taxi from the city centre. 
Rooms are recently renovated and furnished to a high standard. Staff were very friendly and helpful. I would recommend. ",5,2017,09,12
47,Honeymoon in Barca,"We chose this hotel as it has a rooftop pool, offered family accommodation (double & single beds) and location. Its very easy to get to from the airport (first stop on the bus, took 20 mins) and also has access to the underground directly outside the Hotel. As it was our honeymoon I paid slightly higher than I would have, however, it was money well spent. The staff on reception where great throughout our 4 nights, and upon arrival provided us with one of the penthouse rooms (thanks so much for this !) and a bottle of Cava. The views from our room and the pool where fantastic, especially towards Montjuic. There are some great restaurants (Las Arenas) and bars within walking distance and the city tour bus stops across the other side of the road. It was great watching the Magic Fountains from the rooftop bar. Overall a great stay, would highly recommend if you want to pay a bit extra. 
Barcelona is a great city.

47,What a view!,"We knew we would be tired after being in transit almost 24 hours so we booked the room option with a view of Plaza Espanya. Wow, what a nice well kept room and then...we pulled the drapes. The Plaza was magnificent with the castle and fountains in the background! We cleaned up and headed to the rooftop bar for sunset...great wine by the glass and more wonderful views. We felt at home...so we stayed at the hotel and ate at the restaurant(s)... yes both, we had a small bite of Asian while we waited for our table at the other restaurant. Everything a wonderful--service, setting, food quality and preparation. The rest of our stay measured up in every way: location, services, transportation, staff. Linda at the front desk was particularly helpful. Thank you CBP!! We will be back.",5,2017,09,01
47,Short stay,Stayed at this hotel for a few days in August. Rooms were big and cool with the air con - not too noisy either considering its near busy roads. Easy access to travel outside of the hotel and easy to get to from the airport. Didn't have breakfast or eat in the restaurants but the menus looked good. Only slight negative would be the bar at the pool is quite expensive and they don't allow you to bring in your own food or drink. Overall great stay and would stay here again. ,4,2017,08,29
47,Very poor value for money,This is an expensive hotel with quite average service and poorer quality facilities . The rooms look dated and the facilities such as the gym are very poor for the price . There are long waiting times at reception fir even the most simple enquiries ,2,2017,08,28
47,Barcelona trip,Great location but could improve the check in process and time.We found the roof top bar and pool a great asset that the hotel has and getting around Barcelona from the hotel very easy due to its central location,4,2017,08,26
47,Fantastic hotel with stunning rooftop pool bar and excellent customer service,"We were transferred to this hotel late at night after a booking mix up with the Park Guell ( totally my fault). On arrival we were given a quick check in and given the same price (even though it was a 4* hotel instead of a 3* hotel). We were tired and fed up after the mix up and they quickly allocated our rooms and gave us free drinks vouchers for the rooftop bar. Views from the rooftop pool and bar are stunning and the surrounding area by the pool has bed / loungers and mood lighting as well as excellent service. The bedrooms were spacious and air conditioned with lovely showers and minibar. Everywhere very clean and nicely decorated. The reception staff were so helpful and kept our luggage secure on checkout day (checkout is 12md) until we returned at 8pm. We used the pool every day and sat outside until late drinking cocktails and cava. There is also a spa but I didn't use it. Beautiful surroundings and excellent service. Hotel is located next to a small shopping centre with a range of cafes and restaurants. Metro station is just outside the hotel making travel around Barcelona very easy. Taxi rank right outside for when we wanted to go to the beach at night and very cheap. Would highly recommend for a short break or even a longer break and great value for money. Although we were given a disocunted price due to the mix up, I have since seen very reasonable prices on Booking.com. Will definitely return - thank you.",5,2017,08,25
47,Great location for seeing the sights.,Great location for seeing the sights. Easy to drive to with secure parking. Large lobby area and great pool area. Family friendly with spacious rooms. Staff were generally helpful but could have been a bit more aware of the queues forming when checking in!,4,2017,08,24
47,Great Location on the edge of the City Centre,"The hotel was selected due to its rooftop pool and proximity to the main City Centre. It is a brisk 40 min walk to both La Rambla area (at the time of writing may I offer my most sincere condolences to the people affected by the atrocity on the day we departed) and the Marina/Beaches. We also used plenty of taxis, and the journeys above cost 10 euros each way. Worth it in 35 degree heat. PS whilst on the subject of taxis, it is around 35 euros from the airport (the meter shows 18 euros but a 15 euro airport supplement is added.)
 If you are already interested in this hotel you will know about its fantastic outlook. It is just that! Views up towards the National Art Museum and Montjuic Castle, together with the central monument in the roundabout and the double tower monuments. Absolutely breath taking when you arrive. 
We were allocated room 601 on arrival, a triple room for 3 adults. It was clean and fresh but unfortunately had one window which looked into the central area of the hotel which is towards inward looking room windows. We requested an alternative with a view which was granted the following morning. All front facing rooms/suites were fully booked, however we were given room 628 by the extremely helpful Francisco (male) on the desk. It gave us 3 windows and a side view of a park and a rear view with Tibidabo cathedral up on the hill in the distance. Not the perfect front facing view, but even with the air con in the room they are very warm and we were spared the glaring sun.
 Level 6 was an executive level. This was not prebooked but a free upgrade by the hotel. On the landing outside the lifts were regular (but limited amounts of) complimentary coffee, juice, water, crisps, biscuits, fruit, finger sandwiches and pizza. However, it always seemed to have been taken just before we got there. I soon realised (and complained to reception about) that people were just coming from other levels either by the lifts or the access stairs and plundering our complimentary items. There was supposed to be a member of Hotel staff sat near to the items as a point of contact/concierge but |I only saw her once.
There were tea and coffee facilities in the room together with a stocked mini bar which you could also use to place some of your own items in to keep chilled. If you consumed any of their items you would be charged eg 3euro50 for a 330ml can of Estrella lager. I cannot comment on the spa facilities on level 7 as we never ventured there.
 Talking of venturing, finding the rooftop bar was initially a test. From level 6 you had to get the lift down to reception then exit your lift and go round the corner to another lift which only accessed levels 7 to 11. We realised on the second day that we could use the stairs from level 6 and just walk up two flights to get to the pool area to avoid the lift adventure. The rooftop bar and pool area was level 8. Fantastic. What a view. Not just the ones you see on the website but 360 degree view of the city and hills. Be mindful of the limited amount of seats/settees/longers/beds around the pool and terrace area, as per any holiday, lots of towels left on beds for long periods of time not being used. Nice mix of people using that area including families with young kids and groups of young adults. 
The drinks. Be careful! 6euros a pint in a plastic glass (3euro average in other establishments. 16euros for a gin and tonic (which I fell for, but it was a very nice gin!) On the other hand it was only 4euros for a rather nice large glass (plastic) of white or rose wine, which was a good 12% version. A genuine coca cola 4 euros, but add a shot of vodka to that and it was an additional 8 euros. We purchased nibbles from the bar e.g a lovely jar of Ocado style olives for 4 euros. My daughter had one meal there on our arrival day and it was a lovely tuna steak salad for 12 euros.
 They have quality bathing towels available as you enter the terrace area and plenty of toilet facilities and outdoor shower area. The bar/terrace staff are really helpful and appreciate any tips.  Security staff were always visible in and around the hotel which was reassuring, but not intimidating, they also attended the rooftop terrace at random intervals to check we were all genuine guests ( on one occasion they did ask a female to leave who did not produce a valid day pass/room card who had been sunbathing on the best bed for about 3 hours!)
 We were on room only basis and in a morning I turned right out of the front of the hotel and there were quality cafes and take away bakeries selling croissants for about 1 euro, choc croissants for about 1euro50 and various other delightful pastries. There were also one or two shops selling water at less than 1 euro a bottle and orange juice at 2euros a carton. All within no more than 100yards of the hotel. We visited many of the tourist attractions which I will review separately due to my daughter pointing out the length of this review. Hope this helps.",5,2017,08,19
47,Located Along Plaza Espana,"Among the Hotels I stayed during my more than 1 month european wanderlust, the Catalonia Barcelona Plaza get the Highests Marks beside the Radisson Blu in Biarritz France. This Hotel is right smack in the Center of Barcelona and is just steps away from Plaza Espana and the former Bullfighting Ring of Barcelona which is now converted into a Shopping Mall (I love shopping malls you see) and a 10 minute walk takes you to the Base of Montjuic Hill and 15 minutes to the Olympic Stadium.

It is also  a convention and Business Hotel as it lies just across the famous Fira Del Barcelona Trade Center, which is the trade convention Capital of Europe and there was the Barcelona Car Show when we were there (with free entrance to boot!). Around the Hotel are numerous bars, restaurants, Bars, Tapas Bars, shops, souvenir stores (the best is eating at the top of Las Arena Mall (with sweeping views of Barcelona and again is the former Bullfighter Ring) and there is a Barcelona Subway Metro Stop Entrance just in Front of the Hotel (Plaza Espana Metro Station) that brings you everywhere in Barcelona.

This hotel is a favorite of the Tour Group Companies as well that is why we stayed here for 2 nights. The Hotel has 14 floors and 354 Rooms and Suites.divided into double room or square view room or Premium or Terrace of Suite Rooms. The rooms are small as typical of european standards at 22 Square Meter for the Double or Square View Rooms and 26 Square Meters for Terrace View. 

We stayed for two days in a Square View (facing Plaza Espana) Room and cost of a night here with breakfast is 227 Euros a room (for two persons) a night web rate and 250 euros if not via internet.

Other Hotel Amenities Include: Swimming Pool with Terrace Views, Spa and Sauna Facilities, Fitness Center, Business Center, Laundry Service, A Solarium at the top and 3 Restaurants (Filigrana-where the breakfast buffet is held, Umo Japanese Restaurant and Gourmet Shop) and 1 Bar.

 The Rooms (Double Rooms and Square View) are small at 22 square meters (typical of european hotels). 

they have a modern design and the amenities here include:Air conditioning and heating Flat screen satellite TV with PPV ana a LED TV Free Wi-Fi and the rooms and all areas of the Hotel Full-length mirror Hair dryer Marble bathroom Minibar Mini Fridge Room service Nomo group and Telepizza In Room Safe deposit box Soundproofed rooms Telephone Free Bottled Water and Chocolates (not in our room as maybe it our room was discounted as we were booked as part of a tour group package)

cons: no free bottled water (for tour groups), no ironing board, the separate door to the foyer and the room makes the room more smaller, Not universal Sockets, only European standard two pin sockets (so bring your universal plug adaptors and USB Ports).
 
Check in is 2:00 pm and check out is 12:00 pm",5,2017,08,18
47,"Marvelous view, comfort room","It is a nice hotel, with clean and comfort rooms that view in Plaza de Espagna. The staff was polite and helpful. Breakfast medium but decent. However a little bit expensive comparing to similar hotels in other European cities.",4,2017,08,18
47,The most beautiful hotel.,"Attending a conference meant we needed to be close to the venue, hence our choice of hotel. What a gift!! Beautiful hotel, lovely big rooms, friendly staff, good food,and well placed for buses, taxis and shopping. Our rooms were clean, comfortable and well air conditioned. Would definitely visit again.",5,2017,08,17
47,Very unimpressed ,First stop in Europe after Dubai and am so disappointed and hoping rest of Europe hotels aren't the same. Staff unfriendly almost to point of been rude. Supply  2 small caps of milk for tea in room for 2 people. Called and asked for more as used it in the morning and 1/2hr later room service knocks on the door wanting to charge me $12 Aud for sml jug of milk. Said only want like this (showed him empty) he said no wait till tomorrow. About 12 sun lounges and some other chairs on roof top pool. People come up when first open and place a towel or book glasses something small on so they look like been used they then leave the area and  don't return till late arvo to use them but staff allows this and won't remove so people like myself that are actually up there swimming and wanting to use and relax have to sit in hard chairs. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. ,1,2017,08,17
47,Make your choice for other hotel!!!,Bad experience!!! I didn't get the room I paid for!!! The room I get was not fashionable and very poor with the old curtains and holes. Too expensive hotel. You don't have anything you paid for!!!  Tried to resolved this situations but and the they said if you want something different you must pay extra 60€ per night!!! I see this is a normal situation as they have already pictures to show you. ,2,2017,08,16
47,"Lovely hotel, fantastic location, met all of our needs!!","We used the Aerobus from outside the airport which took us straight to the hotel in about 15 minutes. Once there, we were able to check in early but were told our room would be ready at 2pm - no problem for us as we had researched this beforehand and expected it. The hotel happily took our luggage and off we went to explore!

The hotel has a fantastic location - it is a stones throw away from the Montjuic fountain and is on top of Placa Espanya. The airport bus back to the airport is located directly outside the hotel along with the metro which was also very handy. We bought a T10 card to share between two of us (10 journeys for 10 euros). However, it was also very easy to walk to different locations from the hotel too. 

Our room on the 5th floor was very pleasant with fantastic views of the Museum of Catalan Art. We did not ask for this, so I guess we were lucky with the room we were given! The room was spotlessly clean and a lovely modern design. One thing that could be improved is the shower curtain - the material is quite flimsy and the curtain is short, meaning we often stepped out the shower to a flooded floor. However, this is something we soon dried up ourselves.

The rooftop pool is gorgeous and offers panoramic views. The pool opens at 9 and as we found out, you need to be upstairs and waiting before 9am. Guests would rush out to lay their towels on beds, and then not come back for hours at a time. This was incredibly frustrating as many families with children came up to look for a spot only to find empty beds with towels and left belongings covering them. Possibly a new rule should be introduced to stop this from happening in future (if you leave your bed for 45mins unattended, the towels and belongings are removed to make way for other guests). Drinks were a little expensive, but this was to be expected for the location and views.

The staff we encountered were all very helpful and cared about our needs. At times however, we found the maids to be quite noisy bashing about in rooms when making them up. This did wake us on our final morning when we decided to have a lay-in after getting back from the Barcelona match late in the early morning. They also came into the room without giving us a chance to respond to the knocking. When check out is at 12, there is no need to try and come in at 10!

A lovely touch was the computers and printers in the lobby, making it easy for those guests who need to print out boarding passes.

All in all, we did really like the hotel and would not hesitate to return. I am sure we will be back within the year! Thank-you Catalonia Barcelona Plaza Hotel!",5,2017,08,15
47,Such a good 4 star it should be 5 star,"Wonderful hotel, great friendly staff, beautiful location, trendy rooftop pool.

Booked for 4 nights as a surprise engagement for my Fiancée. Asked the hotel for an upgrade and we got a lovely room on 6th floor. They also surprised us with a complementary bottle of champagne and strawberries!!!!! It was a lovely touch.

 Room was huge and had everything you need. 6th floor is premium floor so there are drinks and snacks provided free of charge to all guests on this floor. Nice to have ice cold water and juice after a day around barcelona. 

Trendy pool area is beautiful by day with clear views across barcelona. It's stunning by night. Prime location to view the fountains in mont juic. It's lovely to come home after dinner and relax with a mojito on the terrace. Perfect way to end a perfect few days in this wonderful city!!!!

The staff were always so helpful at the front desk and around the hotel. I cannot say enough about this hotel. It's just perfect for a city break. Walk out the door and your at the metro stop. 

Get the T10 ticket. Lady at front desk of hotel advised us to do this. Ten trips for €10.

I will be back!!!!!

47,Not central enough,"Unfortunately although the hotel is fine, the location is not the best if you are looking to be more central. We also left our luggage in the luggage room on our last day while out in the city as we had a late flight. When we returned we found the porter locked in the room with the luggage (locked from the inside), when we got home here had been items stolen from our luggage and at that stage it was to late to do anything about it. If in Barcelona please assume everybody wants to steal from you. It is a beautiful city and we will return but please be careful. ",2,2017,08,09
47,Great Trip,"Got off to a very bad start! Despite receiving an email from the hotel confirming our slightly earlier check in no one was ready for us, no rooms available to check our outpatients and no one expecting us!? Had to wait nearly 3 hours for us all to be checked in despite several coach tours arriving and being booked in whilst we were waiting! Had a laptop stolen whilst we were in the foyer and management wouldn't let us view CCTV ! Eventually got our rooms and they were very nice, spacious and plenty of storage space for all our stuff. No drink making facilities in room, did have a bottle of water, this was not replaced at all during our stay. Breakfast was good and plenty of it, very varied choice. Staff helpful and friendly when asked for anything. Great base for exploring, literally right on the underground station.",4,2017,08,09
47,Our first visit to Barcelona,"This hotel is in a perfect location. We enjoyed the Magic Fountain experience across the street many times. There is a shopping mall nearby that has a food court, restaurants, and a grocery store. The Metro stop is right in front of the hotel. The hotel has excellent restaurants and there are many restaurants in the surrounding neighborhood. Our room was quiet, modern, and clean. We would stay here again in a heartbeat!",5,2017,08,09
47,Great experience,Great experience with great team that was able to make the pleasure happened. I will definitely come back to this hotel again also I will strongly recommend it to thise who are willing to visit this country. ,5,2017,08,08
47,More less,"In general this hotel was not bad. Pros: centrally located, loads of places to go and to eat nearby. Cons: we were waiting for our room up to 40 minutes after 2 p.m. and finally nobody update us that it is ready, I did call myself. In the room there were not even hosting water, lack of towels and dirty mirrors. I didn't spent too much time in hotel, but I think it shouldn't matter, the quality should be better, definitely. Stuff guys, please draw attention on that. Everything else was quite good. Stuff is polite and responsive. Best regards!",3,2017,08,07
47,Location great but room quality poor...,"We spent 2 nights here ... pool area is nice but too small for the number of guests ... staff are very polite, friendly and helpful...  check-in and out was dreadful - very long queues - we had to wait for 15 mins just to get to the desk... I travel every week on business around Europe - worst I've ever encountered... 
The room was quite dated and the maintenance and cleanliness left a lot to be desired - certainly not commensurate with 4 stars.. (see photos)... 
security was a bit worrying too... door lock on room was faulty and didn't always work correctly and there was no requirement in the lifts to use your room key... in this day and age very unusual for a hotel of this grade... reception was busy and anyone could have walked in and gone up to accommodation floors or pool area... one guy in reception area who I never saw stopping and checking anyone...

Hotels in Barcelona are notoriously expensive - but this was not worth almost 200 euros a night ... ",2,2017,08,06
47,Great hotel,Lovely hotel in a wonderful location adjacent to the Bullring and Plaza Espana. Room very spacious and well equipped with large comfortable bed. Bathroom a good size with separate toilet and shower over the bath. Beautiful pool and bar area on the rooftop with fantastic views to the light and fountain nightly show. Extensive breakfast . Would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2017,08,04
47,"Room with terrace - room OK, but terrace was a joke.","We spent six nights in this centrally placed hotel, a good location for the Fira conference centre, and for walking around the city. We paid a premium for a room with terrace, only discovering on our arrival that it was positioned at the end of the rooftop swimming pool area, ""screened "" from the pool users by some pot plants, which were only knee high. This meant that there was no privacy whatsoever; people passing by to the bar could look straight in; some yobs actually threw their lit cigarette ends over on to our sun beds, burning the cover; and one end was flanked by the back of the bar, where the sound of empty bottles being thrown away was a regular feature. This was very disappointing- the management quickly replaced the sunbed covers for some stained ones, which again, wasn't very nice and inappropriate for the standard of hotel. 

The room itself was spacious, and comfortable, with kettle and fridge. There was a large bathroom, containing separate shower and what looked like a large round spa bath in a separate area, but which turned out to be just a bath in an unlit space. Opening the window in this space was impossible, as it overlooked the sunbeds on the pool terrace. Bottled water should have been supplied daily, but we had to keep on asking for this. 

Breakfast was astonishing in its variety of food on offer. The breakfast hall was huge, so one had to walk a long way with plate in hand to find what was required. On our second day, we realised that we were eligible to use the ""Gourmet Corner"", adjacent, for a more intimate breakfast experience, with only a little less choice. There is also a Japanese restaurant, whose food was very good. 

This hotel was very expensive at around €300 per night. For this price, I would have expected more of our accommodation, and certainly a properly screened off terrace, which, in my opinion was an expensive joke. 

On our departure, the concierge helpfully called a taxi to take us to the airport. He had a long chat with the driver; on entering the taxi we were told that we would have to pay an extra €20 to get to the airport (to avoid traffic jams). We considered that we were ripped off here, and wonder if the concierge might be knowledgeable about this practice?",4,2017,08,02
47,Room with a magic view,"We had arrived in Barcelona on the second leg of our daughter's school orchestra tour. We were a bit early for check-in as we wanted to go up to Parc Güell. Staff were happy for us to leave our baggage and check-in later. 

What a surprise on our return! We had paid for a city view but found ourselves upgraded to a Clock Suite. Incredible view of Plaça Espanya, the Av. de la Reina Maria Cristina and the Museum Nacional d'Art de Catalina.

In the evening we made our way up to the roof terrace for drinks and to watch the spectacular Font Màgica de Montjuïc. We've watched the music and light display from up close, but the birds-eye view was truly incredible.

We found the staff friendly and accommodating. Room was immaculately clean and very special! ",5,2017,08,02
47,Great value,"The rooftop was incredible, with a great view of the city and of the magic fountain show! Very convienent location and good value for money! A very busy hotel but even with so many people we still managed to get a day bed by the pool! ",4,2017,08,01
47,Great! Definitely a good place to base yourself,Great place to base yourself for a City break in Barcelona.  We had a lovely time there and enjoyed the friendly relaxed attitude of the staff.  I so want to steal the pillows.  They are even more comfortable than mine at home!!!,4,2017,07,31
47,Dignified hotel with great location,"The hotel boasts quality in everything from service to material selection.
Large room with good beds. Something characterized by hotel age, but clean and well equipped.
Super service both at the reception, bar and restaurants. Restaurant Filigrana is definitely worth a visit!
'The roof terrace is unique with its spectacular views and beautiful furniture. From here you can see ""La Fontena Magica"" with its spectacular light show.
Could wish for a bigger hotel gym but otherwise perfect.
Looking forward to my next visit!",4,2017,07,31
47,311Anne,"Huge Hotel by the Plaza de Espana, perfect location:  metro station, airport bus stop, taxis stand.  Very busy streets.  Room with view on the fountain and the palace.
Room needed some lift up as well as the hallways.  Fantastic pool on top.
Excellent breakfast.  The Gourmet Cafe is serving delicious food, not very pricy, compare to the street restaurants nearby. 
Staff could be more welcoming.
Overall nice stay.",4,2017,07,30
47,"Convenient location, great views from the roof","Easy to get to as the Aerobus from the airport stops right outside and there are several Metro lines at Placa Espanya so very convenient for getting around.  Within easy walking distance of the National Musuem of Art and the Magic Fountain - the pool bar (on the roof) gives excellent views of these.  Montjuic is also close by.  Large room with efficient and quiet air conditioning.  I kept this on all night as it was too warm without and too noisy to have the windows open.  No tea or coffee making facilities in the room which I would have liked.  Breakfast is a buffet with a wide selection - can get busy at times, may be difficult to find a suitable table.  Don't use the 'hot' water  provided for tea as it's not hot enough - use the hot water function on the coffee dispensers.  Several restaurants - beware if you are vegetarian as eg the goat's cheese pizza 'always comes with ham' even though the menu gives no hint of this.  I sent it back and it was promptly replaced but worth stating if you don't eat meat.  Service in the Gourmet Corner can be slow - I didn't use the other retaurants so can't comment.  Staff very helpful - I stayed one night on my own account and thereafter on a group booking and the staff arranged it so I didn't have to move rooms.  Other members of my group also found the staff helpful if issues arose.  The hotel looks awful from the outside (very functional and ugly building) but much better inside.  There are not enough locker keys for the safety deposit boxes in the rooms so you may not be able to use this facility.  I gave up asking in the end.  Overall definitely somewhere to consider.",4,2017,07,30
47,Trip to Spain,"The hotel was clean, excellent A.C. (for Americans in July this is a huge bonus). Beautiful pool, great view from our room looking out on the magic fountain show at night. Location can't be beat, metro right downstairs. Decor could be updated, the room smelled a little like smoke, and there were no outlets on the nightstands. Otherwise this is a great hotel.",4,2017,07,26

47,"Great location, great facility","The hotel is in a beautiful spot in Barcelona, next to the Arena mall. There are cafe's and restaurants in the area, but I totally recommend the hotel's breakfast which is fantastic and varied. The room I would advise you to stay in is 646- you will thank me later. The swimming pool is on the 8th floor and it's magnificent.  The hotel's staff is wonderful and helpful, especially Alex. We are here for 4 nights but we will be back. ",5,2017,07,24
47,Not favorably impressed,"Not what I expect from a 4 star hotel. The quality differences are in the little things such as not having sufficient safe deposit box locks for the room safe, no complimentary bottled water, or non-functioning coffee machines at breakfast, and polite, but non-responsive service at the front desk. As can be seen from the other poor reviews, management's pattern seems to be polite apology, followed by the scripted thanking for the feedback which offers an opportunity to improve. However, this appears to be little more than an empty response that results in no, or very few real improvements. Would we stay here again? No!",2,2017,07,20
47,Simply Outstanding ,"Two thirds of the way through our fantastic holiday and we come to Barcelona earlyish to check. They can't get us in but offer to look after the bags so we head to further to again explore the wonders of this great cities. Upon our return we're upgraded to a suite! Clearly everything about this hotel is magical. The staff are excellent and the pool area is also fabulous with plenty of day beds and a great bar on the eighth floor. The location, whilst a little out of town (30 minute walk) is great for the magic fountain and not too far from ""Tickets"", a fabulous local restaurant. Upgraded room was an absolute delight! Thanks to the team for making ours a wonderful stay.",5,2017,07,20
47,Standard international hotel but a great location,"This modern hotel is big and inevitably somewhat soulless- so far so predictable
 What sets it apart is its superb location on Plaza Espanya, which is a tremendous transport hub and h gets you almost anywhere with metro, rail and bus (including the superb airport bus) right outside the door. Train to Monnserrat? Starts underground, just across the road. Add tho that the excellent shopping mall next door and the Montjuic arts complex in walking distance and splendidly visible from the hotel, and it's a great centre from which to explore. Rooms are predictably well equipped, breakfast a comprehensive buffet. Staff helpful and multilingual, and the rooftop bar and pool are a great treat with super views.",5,2017,07,19
47,Breakfast in the school canteen,"Good location if you want to be in Montjuic. Nice bathroom. Good rooftop bar with small though busy pool. Some examples of very good service, but very slow check in. In a 4* hotel I'd expect complementary water in the room, at least for a welcome (summer, Barcelona!)  Breakfast - good food but setting very unpleasant, noisy, crowded, room layout so illogical we were constantly getting up to search for things - even more than in most self service hotel breakfasts. ",3,2017,07,18
47,Best Accommodation in Barcelona,"Stayed for 5 nights, best location, best staff, excellent room, best wi-fi, Location location, access to Metro and all busses, incl Aero Bus (Direct to Airport) from directly outside the main entrance to the hotel. overall, best stay ever in Europe!",5,2017,07,18
47,"Theft, beware!","My iPad, phone and aftershave were stolen from a supposedly locked room. 

The hotel offered me no support, other than to try to prove none of their staff had accessed my room with a keycard. 

If you travel here, keep valuables with you!",1,2017,07,18
47,Great hotel that did it all very well,"We stayed here or last 3 days in Spain. The hotel is located on the Placa Espana, next to the Bullring and facing the Venetian Columns and the National Museum of Art with its fountains. There is a metro/subway station just in front of the hotel which makes getting around Barcelona very easy. While this is a very busy location the rooms in the hotel are surprisingly quiet. We tested that by opening and closing our window which faced a portion of the Plaza. Open, noisy. Closed, no problem.

Our standard room was of good size, clean, with a good bathroom, comfortable beds, good wifi and good a/c during the 3 hot Barcelona days. The front desk took care of our needs without problem. Breakfast was very good and is served in a large tent-topped room/courtyard (you decide) just off the lobby.

This proved to be a very good stay.",5,2017,07,17
47,Wonderful Hotel,"So I have just returned from my second visit to the Catalonia Barcelona Plaza having visited for a week last year.  This is an amazing hotel, 20 minutes from the Airport (cab or bus) and with a fantastic location.  Situated on the busy Plaza Espana it has the most wonderful views right down to the sea and is right beside a great shopping centre (with a lovely hairdressers just inside the door), the metro and has taxis outside the door.  This is a busy hotel with wonderful reception staff who very kindly upgraded us to the 6th floor and made sure we got a lovely room with a view.  Adriana is always on hand on this floor and is very helpful and kind.  The room is lovely and has everything we would have wanted but the view is so amazing that you spend most of the time looking out the window!  The rooftop pool and bar area is the nicest I have ever been too, with the most amazing views, wonderful staff (both day and night time) and beds always readily available.  Had lunch here two days and it was lovely.  All in all this is the nicest hotel I have stayed in and am already planning my next trip as soon as I can get out there again.  Barcelona is a beautiful and vibrant city in its own right but when you stay somewhere as nice as the Catalonia Plaza it just makes the trip more special.",5,2017,07,13
47,Great hotel in nice location,The hotel is located in Plaze de Espane.You can enjoy a wonderful view of Barclona at the roof where the pool is located. To the left of the hotel there is the Arena shopping mall with food court and beside it located many restaurants and coffee shops. To the right of the hotel there is shopping streets with also restaurants and coffee shops. Facing the hotel u can walk 5 minutes to the magical fountain. With the additional to the above the Metro is far 1 min from the entrance of the hotel. The staff were friendly especially Sabilla which gave us a specific details how to go and switch  metros to Sagrada Familia .The breakfast was good. The room was ok.,4,2017,07,12
47,Fantastic experience,"My sister and I arrived late on Saturday evening and were welcomed by Senne (I might not have remembered her name but the lovely Dutch receptionist?) and directed to our newly decorated room on the 6th floor. The room was lovely and had the most fantastic view. It has everything you need - good shower, nice towels changed daily, lots of hanging space and really comfy bed.
Every day, on the 6th floor there are snacks and drinks overseen by the charming Adriana. Nespresso coffee, apples, sweets and ham rolls - we didn't eat much but it was a nice touch and great for a cold drink after an afternoon by the rooftop pool.
The rooftop pool is gorgeous - big comfortable beds and chairs for the daytime and a cocktail vibe in the evenings - a fantastic addition to the hotel.
Again, staff at this bar were friendly and efficient - in fact, I would say that the staff are among the friendliest and most efficient I have encountered everywhere.
So, the pluses of this hotel, if I were to choose 5 - great staff, clean and beautifully laid out rooftop pool and bar, amazing views, lots of nice little luxury touches in the rooms and even the hallway and finally good value for money. It's 6 euros in a cab to the Ramblas (cab stand outside) and there is plenty to do and see around the hotel too.
I can't think of a single moan... I'm already planning my return trip!",5,2017,07,11
47,"Poor hotel, nice people","The hotel was not worth the money. Building was old and requires major renovation. Electrical installation in the room was scary. Overcharged for breakfast and double room that I never enjoyed.
The location of the hotel was excellent and the staff was very friendly and helpful. ",2,2017,07,11
47,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza Hotel,I love this hotel!  I would definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Barcelona.  The location was perfect with Metro at the doorstep to easily get around the city.  I also liked the fact that the property is surrounded by many places to eat and shop.  I would also note that it is very easy to get to and from the airport from the hotel is very easy!  ,5,2017,07,11
47,Excellant experience  - great location and ecommended hotel.Staff member Cristina made the stay wonderful!,"We had planned a special trip to Europe from or home in Australia. Barcelona was our exit point from Spain and we booked 4 nights. We choose this hotel because of its location, webpage and positive reviews. I wanted to make it a special last few days for the wife before our long trip back to Perth. We booked online via Booking.com and I thought I had booked the room overlooking the Espanya plaza but on going to our allocated room found it an inward facing room with no view except inner hotel rooms - these would be fine for a work stopover but for a special trip I believed I had booked the Plaza overlooking room. I went to reception and raised my concerns and also the specialness of the trip - in came staff member Cristina. She was so helpful and understanding and made it happen that a Square view room was found for our 4 night stay - Cristina we love you TY! you made our visit so enjoyable. The room was great, spacious with a hallway off which the bathroom was housed separate to the bedroom. The king size bed was very comfy and the A/C perfect.  The view over the Square and up to the  Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya (MNAC) which has a colourful fountain light display each night. No noise issues were experienced on the 5th floor where we were. The hop on hop off buses stop nearby and are the perfect way to get to see the sights and sounds of Barcelona. Other features of the hotel are a great roof pool area that provides views across the city and a very good restaurant which is situated - forget the name but begins with F. Great food and great service. A notch down but still good was the Japanese restaurant which is part of the complex (we enjoyed a meal here on our last night). Staff were very helpful but as mentioned high praise to Cristina. Highly recommended but definitely say choose room that has the Espanya Plaza views - you wont be disappointed.",5,2017,07,08
47,Superb terrace dinner party,"We celebrated our friend's surprise birthday party on the 8th floor terrace with the most stunning views of Montjuic and the fountains in the city. The service was impeccable, the food amazing and the setting was just right. Our meal consisted of foie-topped eel sushi, followed by a sea bream ceviche. The fish course was a generous serving of tuna steak on the bone and the meat dish was roast beef you could sear at the table on a hot stone. Superb. The meal was rounded off with a coconut rum minty ice cream bowl and a bit of birthday cake. The decor, the wonderful staff, the view and amazing food made the ideal setting for the party and everyone had a lovely time.",5,2017,07,06
47,Rooftop pool and bar made the trip excellent.,"This hotel is well located on the Placa d'Espana, easy access to the Metro. We were welcomed by efficient staff and enjoyed a quiet clean room. The rooftop bar and pool were excellent for viewing Barcelona, & we dined on a beautiful degustation menu with wines to celebrate the feast of St Jean. Best breakfast selection in our trip. The hotel staff kindly allowed me to store a small suitcase there for a week while we cruised from Barcelona & I would happily stay again.",5,2017,07,04
47,Great hotel,Excellent hotel at a great location  it has all the facilities that you need to make your atay very comfortable. I would have no hesitation based on several stays here to reccomend this hotel for a business or leisure stay,4,2017,07,04
47,"When in Barcelona, look no further!","The location couldn't be any better. The subway station entrance is right in front of the hotel, sightseeing and public transport bus stations just across the road and next to the hotel. The Aerobus airport bus stops and departs literally in front of the hotel. Amazing breakfast. I had a room on the newly renovated 7th floor.............. very nice and well appointed. The pool and terrace on the 8th floow provides for a fantastic view of the marvelous Placa Espanya and the Magic Fountain of Montjuïc. Just a small critisism of the seemingly under staffed reception area which meant longer waits for check in and any communication with the reception desk employees. Otherwise, a perfect hotel in every regard.",5,2017,07,04
47,Excellent location for work or play!,"The location is only about 20 minutes from the airport and close to downtown as well. The area is very vibrant with plenty of restaurants and right on the Pl. Espanya. There is a Metro stop right in front of the hotel - I used it to get to the Gothic Quarter, just 4 stops away.

The staff was very helpful during check in/out and for any questions I had during my stay. I was there for business and the hotel set us up up with a very functional suite and everything we needed to conduct our meetings.

I was extremely pleased with the modern rooms, the lobby and the beautiful rooftop bar. The included breakfast was excellent and extensive and in an airy enclosed tented area - lovely! I would absolutely stay here again the next time I am in Barcelona!",5,2017,07,02
47,"Modern, classy hotel in Barcelona","The Catalonia Barcelona Plaza is a modern hotel with high standard features: large rooms, well equipped bathrooms, attractive common areas. More like a high end business hotel. But the best part is the rooftop deck with infinity pool and bar - overlooking the ""magic fountain"". What a treat!
Great location. Overall highly recommended.",5,2017,06,30
47,Look no more! This is THE place!!!,"I'm VP of alliances in a high tech american company. I was in need to organise a small business meeting in Barcelona for my US and Germany colleagues, and this hotel just solved my entire challenge, and for a great price! 

I got great tooms (must check out their Clock suite room they got me in !!),  and they set us up with a nice meeting table, early check in and late check out, anything we needed was made available (coffee, water,...) And the location and view is just the best possible. The icing on the cake was the roof top swiming pool and chill out terrace. Espectacular! 

Excelent food in the breakfast buffet and do not miss the Japanese restaurant...

In summary, i'm going this hotel for any other meeting in Barcelona in the future, and will take my wife next time. I'm sure she will love it!",5,2017,06,29
47,A disappointing experience,"Unfortunately, had a very disappointing stay at this hotel.  Check-in process was extremely slow.  The room was small, very dated and not well cared for.  The walls were paper thin which didn't allow for sleeping in especially when the cleaning staff was banging around.  The worst part was the lack of service.  I asked for directions and tour recommendations from the front desk and was given one line of information. No offer of a map or brochure.  When I checked out, no one mentioned that there was a taxi strike so I could plan for it.  The door man did offer help with the metro or a private company.  Simply told me to walk.  Would not recommend this hotel to anyone looking for comfort or service.

The only bright spot as others have mentioned was the breakfast.  Great selection, good service, but doesn't make up for the rest of the experience.",2,2017,06,29
47,Excellent hotel but pricy,"We really liked our stay in this hotel, I find it a bit pricy, breakfast was amazing! Very well located.

Check-in was a bit slow, so many people checkin in at the same time and we came from a red eye flight so the wait was a bit long.",5,2017,06,26
47,Beautiful views & Great rooms,"I had a really fantastic stay at this hotel. Although I had never been I chose Barcelona to pop the question as it is my partners favourite city and both the city and this hotel did not disappoint. 

We arrived bit early and were checked in quickly by the staff who I found to be polite and helpful. The gentleman Fran at the reception desk was particularly nice. They offered to look after our bags while we went and explored the city which was great. 

After eating lunch we were given the keys to our room and we were really happy with the room (mucho gracias Fran). The views from our room were breathtaking as you could really see a lot of the city. The room itself was perfect; immaculately clean and modern decor. it may sound odd but it had a nice clean smell which is, to me, important when  you stay in a hotel (I travel a lot for work but usually not in as nice places as this). 

We only had one day in Barcelona but it was one of those days where you feel like the universe is helping you along and our stay at Catalonia Barcelona Plaza played a big part in this.

I'd highly recommend the pool bar (on the 8th floor I think) which has a beautiful view over the city and the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya & Magic Fountain in particular. It is really nice and relaxed in the evening time although I was there on a Monday. 

My fiancé and I left Barcelona with beautiful memories of our time there and I'd like to thank the staff of the Hotel Catalonia Barcelona Plaza for their part in our day.",5,2017,06,26
47,a great hotel,a great hotel with all the services you could ask for.  Not located in the main area of Barcelona but is easy to get around with short metro train trip. Airport aerobus and metro train stations right near the hotel.,4,2017,06,26
47,One night stay,Only stayed for one night wish it could have been one month from the grand marble fittings to the fine breakfast which by the way catered for every contenant amazing !!! The rooms were very spacious with free condiments and slippers my only draw back was the very rude and grumpy barman he's there to do a job not be rude to paying customers for this 4 out of 5 sorry,4,2017,06,21
47,Want to give a higher mark but attitude over an iron is not good!,"Let me start by saying when you walk into this hotel you feel as though you are on holiday. It has a really nice lobby, the rooftop bar and pool area is great and the breakfast is really good too.

As a business traveller, I'm just really annoyed about their attitude over an iron/ironing board, or not as may be the case. It's mentioned numerous times in reviews and is so easily fixed - set up an ironing room on each floor! - but the management seem unwilling to do so.

I arrived on Sunday for six nights and wanted to iron my shirts etc. upon arrival. I was told that they'd try to sort an iron and board out. I subsequently asked twice more that day, including at midnight when I got back - to which the guy on reception said if not sorted in the morning, bring your stuff down and we will get it ironed using the in-house service.

I then checked again the following morning and was then told that they only have four irons for the (massive) hotel, no boards and don't know where the irons are. If I wanted something ironing I should use the in-house service (6 EURO for a shirt and polo). I wasn't paying that out of principle so got everything done at the mall next door (six shirts ironed, one polo and a suit dry cleaned for 28 EURO). 
#Firstworldproblems and all that, but it was still annoying.

Otherwise, room is a bit dated but functional and nice and quiet, and dark, if you have an atrium-looking room. 

Loved it up at the pool bar on Sunday but 15-min wait for a drink – one more member of staff would have made all the difference.

To sum up, a really good option at a good price (at least for our group) but intransigence over the provision of an iron is not acceptable, unfortunately.",3,2017,06,20
47,Beautiful experience,"I liked very much your helpful team, this was my first time in Spain. I think I can't find a better place to spend time in Barcelona! Thanks a lot! Breakfast was very good and I enjoy the pool with amazing view! ",5,2017,06,20
47,Great hotel for business or pleasure - located near football stadium/palace,"Super hotel!  I was staying for business but the location is ideal for those staying for fun.  I had a room on the first floor which was spacious, cool.  It was a bit noisy from the outside road noise, but I got used to it.  The food is superb!  Really fabulous breakfast and lunch was served in a wonderful room and the waiting staff were just wonderful.  So pleasant, efficient and friendly.  The pool area on the 8th floor is lovely - plenty of sun loungers, a bar area.  A real retreat.  Although I was here on business, it's somewhere I would certainly consider staying for a break.  ",5,2017,06,19
47,Excellent location,"A very good hotel on Plaza Espana. one of the central Barcelona's squares. Near famous Arenas, today closed, where, some 40 years ago I have been first and last time on Corrida ( better said: killing the bulls). Very good staff and food.",5,2017,06,17
47,Great hotel in good location,"The reception staff is friendly and helpful. The hotel location is good, close to metro, plenty of restaurants and shops nearby. The view of roof top is great. We enjoyed to watch the magic fountain show at night there. ",5,2017,06,17
47,Excellent 7th Level Pool Deck ,Not all is fun at the Catalonia. Customer service in terms of friendliness is hard to get. But accommodation is great with excellent views on the Praca Espanha. Pool deck is a wow. Rooms are large at least my corner room was. Bathroom is outdated and while showering I burnt myself almost and slipped in the bath tub. Temperature changes are extreme and sudden. Uncomfortable to say at least. Business rooms in basement are great. ,4,2017,06,16
47,Great stay,"Was there in June for a company event, despite the hotel being full to breaking point of all my worldwide associates, we found the staff friendly and attentive to all our needs.
The breakfast was of top quality, the pool and surroundings are unmatched in Barcelona. 
Thank you i will certainly be coming back",5,2017,06,14
47,"Excellent value for money, high up in the Barcelona sky","Spent a comfortable 4 nights in hotel suite, large bedroom, siiting room and working place. Magnificent view from 11th floor right upon the Venetian towers and the famous fountains at Plaça Espanya. Nice open air swimming pool on the 8th floor. Breakfast  in quiet secluded place with excellent service. 
For business or pleasure this is the place to be!",5,2017,06,14
47,should have ironed out problems,"no iron, broken phone, one unhelpful member of staff, toner gone in printer so couldn't print off boarding passes.generally inconvenienced.
Otherwise clean bright hotel with reasonable breakfast and decent bedroom, although shower was a bit shabby",3,2017,06,13
47,One of the best hotels for the money,"Hardly anything to improve. Not within walking distance to major attractions, but metro station right outside front door. Great restaurants and shopping within a block. Great area to walk and explore. ",5,2017,06,12
47,Sandra is amazing !,"My wife and I got a free upgrade to the executive floor, and that was amazing. Specially Sandra, the guest experience assistant who was extremelly helpful, charming and made our stay much better. If you stay on the executive floor you'll be lucky so she can help you for anything as it was a 5 star hotel. The Hotel is well located and the connection by metro , taxi and aerobus is pretty good. Also remarkable the swimmimgpool on the 8th floor.",5,2017,06,12
47,Brief visit,Visited briefly to the 9th floor to see the magic fountains from the roof top bar. Unfortunately there was a very loud disco in progress so we decided to leave and go up to the square to the fountains.,3,2017,06,12
47,Super location / Great joy,"I came for 2 nights. So easy to get it with the Blue aerobus - just 1 stop from airport. 
Great room,  super nice helpful staff. Perfect location! its not centric but metro is right next to it, the staff was and the breakfast was fabulous. the Arena shopping mall next it and the BEST thing in the hotel is the ROOF TOP BAR - looking at the Monjuic and the colorful fountains. amazing view of Espanja square",4,2017,06,10
47,Great location/super nice staff,"My only negative about the hotel was the stark décor---no pics on the walls in the room hallways or any décor. Even though the wood walls were lovely, the feeling was stark and uninviting.  The local was so convenient, the staff was super nice and the breakfast was fabulous. Would stay here again in a heart beat. There always was a 
security person---dress in a business suit--in the lobby giving you a secure feeling.",5,2017,06,07
47,Great experience,"Hotel was clean and safe.  Staff was helpful for all questions and getting us tickets for buses.  When we arrived and checked in, we were upgraded to the Executive floor, which was a great surprise after 12+ hours of travel.  Would recommend Catalonia Barcelona Plaza to anyone.  ",4,2017,06,07
47,Amazing rest place!,"Great room, amazing staff. Perfect location! Our wedding anniversary was unbelievable good! We want to visit Barcelona an the hotel Catalonia Barcelona Plaza again in future. We can recommend this hotel for all people!)",5,2017,06,07
47,Snadra was terrific! Great location.,"We stayed in an Executive room. Sandra, the Guest Experience Coordinator for the Executive Floor, was the best part of our stay. She was very friendly, and was extremely helpful. When my wife couldn't find a certain gift for her coworkers, Sandra made multiple calls to the manufacturer to find out how my wife could find and buy what she was looking for. The hotel is in Plaza Espana. WARNING: there is more than one Hotel Catalonia in Barcelona. This location is convenient for taxis, metro, the Sants train station, and the airport Aerobus, as well as the Bus Turistic. However, it is not walking distance from El Born, the Gothic section, Eixample, La Rambla, Barceloneta, or other tourist areas. There is a rooftop bar and pool with a great view of The Magic Fountain. The sparse and bland decor is nearly Scandinavian. Sandra was the best part of our experience at the hotel.",4,2017,06,06
47,Really high end hotel,"From Airy lobby, grand entrance, we know we are moving into a high end hotel. The canopy covered cafeteria is spectacular. Only complains are the missing safe in the room and poor shower design which makes it next to impossible to keep the bathroom dry. Great location right above the Metro station . Overall a very positive experience. Oh, another thing, they don't seem to carry French Open tennis on their TV lineup. ",4,2017,06,02
47,"Good service and nice location, overall good!","Nice hotel, decor a bit retro in the lobby and corridors. Rooms spacious, nice and well equipped. Good airconditioning. Good and comfortable bed and pillows. Good location. Excellent breakfast, lots of variety. Pool bar very nice. Good service.",4,2017,05,30
47,Good hotel,"Great location, fab pool, superb food.helpfull staff, 
We enjoyed every minute, site seeing, fab museums, gardens, parks, beaches, restaurants were all good.
Architecture was amazing, as was the old city.
The walking was safe and easy , as was the Metro and the frequent bus service,
The airport bus was fast and cheap, stopping right out side the hotel in Barcelona Plaza.
Amazing views from our roof top pool and bar, the Magic Fountain was a delight, as was the Art Museum and the Olympic Stadium.
A must visit, we are going back! ",5,2017,05,30
47,Business in Barcelona,Excellent venue right in the heart of Barcelona. Easy to get to all destinations of importance. Helpful staff and great quality food. the rooms on the outside have a great view. Very good shopping near by if you have limited time and sights are close by too and you can do it on foot or by metro. A little pricy but worth it.,4,2017,05,30
47,Great Hotel between Fira and Downtown,In Barcelona on business with meetings both at the Fira and in town. Could not pick a better location between the two with great access to the train heading West to the Fira and the Metro into town. The hotel itself was nice. The service was good. The rooms were clean. Check out the view from the pool. ,4,2017,05,25
47,Aircon,"The aircon was not working during my stay and no solution at all eventhough we have made complaint to front desk not even room change or room upgrade or something else as compensation, which commonly done with other hotel. Not having good experience at all with the hotel.",3,2017,05,23
47,Good location,"Very well located hotel. Expensive no frills but convenience and good staff, helpful and courteous. Rooms without any view and lot of walking in corridors to reach your room. 
 No kettle in the room for tea or coffee.No help for lugging the luggage.Very difficult if not physically fit.. room without a view.
The only good thing was location.",3,2017,05,23
47,Cruise,"The hotel was an excellent place to stay before getting on our cruise. It was very accessible to the sites, tour bus, and restaurants. Also taxis were readily available due to the location and proximity.",4,2017,05,23
47,Terrible service,"Staff ever so rude, rooms stunk in both suites, was not allowed to use facilities after we checked out at 12, our flight was at 4, we was not allowed to freshen up in the spa, as when we checked in they said it was fine then when we went to check out they refused us away",1,2017,05,22
47,Good for the price,"The location I think is the best thing of the hotel. The check-in and out was also really fast and everything was ok. The only two things I didn't like was being awaken at the weekend by the cleaning ladies, even with the ""Do not disturb"" at the door. Saturday and Sunday always the same behavior. And then not having space to open a bag. I had mine in the bed next to me. Apart from that, is a good hotel.",4,2017,05,22
47,Will stay again,"Great location, great staff, great atmosphere.  Sandra in particular was great; no complaints and the amenities were very nice.  I recommend this hotel for travelers and locals alike, with an added bonus that the Museum of Art and the Arena shopping mall are very close by.",5,2017,05,22
47,Lovely stay...thanks to Oscar!,"Just got back from a three day business trip staying at this hotel. The rooms and facilities were great and the breakfasts and hosted lunch was great. Limited options for vegetarians. Soundproof windows and so your sleep is not compromised by the outside traffic. Very comfortable pillows!
I arrived at 10am after setting off in the UK at 02:45, so I was shattered. The lady on reception was not very helpful and insisted that my room and no similar rooms were ready yet and I've to wait until check in at 2pm. I came back an hour later to the same response. However, a much much more smiley and helpful receptionist called Oscar was more willing to save me from my sleep deprivation. He got me straight into a room. He also helped me find a great place to have lunch on our final day of the trip.
Thank you Oscar for being so welcoming and helpful. Your colleague could take a few pointers from you!",4,2017,05,21
47,True 4-star hotel,"This is a 4-star hotel in all respects. Location is great but there are other great areas in Barcelona.
Location is by metro station and by railway station to Montserrat. Old bull-fighting stadium across the street has many fine and reasonably-priced restaurants on the roof, with great views of the city. Hotel is Highly recommended.",5,2017,05,20
47,Facilities are great,"Been here for 3 nights for business, the hotel facilities were great, breakfast was great, easy access to foods and transport.

Staff was very helpful on any request, shower was great as well, nothing to complain about at all",5,2017,05,20
47,Excellent Hotel and Great Location,"Enjoyed my stay at Catalonia Barcelona Plaza early May 2017.  Hotel is modern, well furnished rooms with a great buffet breakfast.  Across the street is an old bull ring that has been converted into a shopping mall with stores, restaurants and a large grocery.  I was able to walk to Las Ramblas, and most sites in Barcelona.",5,2017,05,18
47,Not the best but lovely view ,I stayed here with my wife and baby the hotel is nice but our room could of done with a lick of paint and some TLC only eat breakfast in the hotel was ok standard hard to access with a baby and pushchair. Over all not a bad hotel if I had to I would stay here again. ,3,2017,05,17
47,not a 5 star hotel,"I would not have written a review except for the incompetence and lack of facilities. I arrived late for a th  to have none pick up the reception phone for 15 minutes, I went downstairs and the phone was off the hook - by 'accident'. As I have a conference in the morning I requested an iron for my room, only to be told that there were no irons even though many people asked for them, I couldn't speak to the manager as he was home asleep, I couldn't use the laundry room as the lady the key was home asleep.",1,2017,05,15
47,Great stay at Barcelona,"The hotel is great, the staff is attentive and helpful. The room was well equipped, however a bit runned-down. The location is great, the view from the rooms are amazing. Definetaly recommended for everyone, who visits Barcelona.",5,2017,05,13
47,Awesome stay,"I got room upgrade, instead double bed room the receptionist gave as an apartment. The roof pool is very nice, the view there is amazing. Would totally come back to stay at this hotel next time. Helpful people at the front desk.",5,2017,05,12
47,Nice hotel,"Nice hotel, very comfortable room with a great view to the magic fountain.The  breakfast was very good, the staff were friendly .The location is also  very good -the metro station is in front of the hotel. In the evening , nice classical  music at the piano!",4,2017,05,11
47,"Modern hotel, good location!","This property is a visually welcome change from most of the older hotels in the city.  It is very modern with huge glass windows.  It sits right smack in the middle of the plaza Espana with great views of the Royal Castle and Magic Fountain of Montjuïc.  I was not impressed with the breakfast buffet.  There were many choices, but the quality of food was not acceptable.  Also, the hotel ran out of locks for the safe in each room.  I was very disappointed at having to leave my valuables at the front desk each time I left the vicinity.  The staff was very helpful and professional, as was the room service delivery people.  Good location, great restaurants within walking distance.",3,2017,05,10
47,Great Base,"Couldn't fault anything. Went to watch Barcelona football match hotel was a good base only 25-30 min walk.
Staff very helpful letting us know where to go and how best to get there.
Rooms spotless 
terrace pool and bar class water a bit cold but what do you expect in April.",5,2017,05,10
47,Business Trip,"The front desk did not have a room ready when I arrived from US. I was exhausted without sleep and had to wait in lobby hotel for 4 more hours. I sat on couch in lobby and closed my eyes. security came over and said there is ""no sleeping"" in lobby..it is against hotel rules policy. I just laughed.",4,2017,05,09
47,Very decent hotel with great breakfast,"Nice hotel, very comfortable rooms and bathrooms. Breakfast is very complete, and the personnel is friendly. Check-in/out took a bit long, but the rest was just perfect. Nicely located near the metro. ",4,2017,05,09
47,Very good hotel Barcelona.,"Business stay on very good hotel, with some improvements to be made in terms of modernisation and decor. 
Except that there's nothing more to say, as it is a very good hotel with excellent localization. ",4,2017,05,08
47,Only if smile's were the answer to our problems,"This hotel has many negatives but only one positive and that is the staff, they are welcoming and pleasant. A great service is offered to try and make up for the defects in this building which is falling apart. We had 2 rooms for 3 nights, our key cards failed to allow us entry in to our rooms on 4 occasions not good when your on the 4th floor. The sockets on the walls are coming off as is the lacquer, the sound of old pipes in walls and floors don't allow for a good nights sleep. The spa service is unmanned so it is extremely unlikely you will get a booking. The list is endless and i no long have the patience to continue... ",3,2017,05,06
47,Perfect Location!,"This hotel is in a great location, metro stop, train to Montserrat, hop on/off bus stop and Las Arenas shops and restaurants all within a few steps.  The rooms were clean and spacious and the breakfast had many options for anyone including a gluten free station.  I would suggest bringing your own iron or small steamer, the entire four days we were here the iron was not available to use and the toiletries were limited only offered shower gel and shower cap no shampoo or lotion etc.  I would definitely recommend this hotel especially if you plan travel on metro/train/bus.  Cabs were always available day and night right in front of the hotel.",4,2017,05,05
47,Convenient location,"Right on the place d'espanya, you can easily hop on the metro and get to the main tourist areas yet it isn't crazy as it would be if it was in the Gothic Quarter.  It's very easy to navigate to the hotel because every cab driver knows where the Place d'Espanya is.

Breakfast featured good variety and lots of space.  I never felt as though we were running out of food.

My room was comfortable but not large although it did not feel cramped.  Had I needed to do work in my room, this might have been a problem.  The desk is very small.  There are a number of different formats of rooms.  Our senior guy had a huge suite.

The pool bar was rowdy when we arrived but settled down through the week as tour groups transitioned from students to seniors.

We hosted about 150 customers for three days of meetings in this modern hotel.  The meeting space was very large and had everything we needed.

Workout space was limited, but who needs it when you're walking all over this great city?",4,2017,05,05
47,Luxuary!,"This hotel is the best. Seriously, the location and the price! Wow, along with it rooftop pool and bar, Its more Than luxuary Its perfect, We stayed for 3 days and the service is flawless, the rooms are so clean, it feels like they Are New, so wonderful job by the cleaners! 
We also used Both the spa and the rooftop, and prices very good and recomended. 
But seriously, this is the second time We chose this hotel, and We Will do it forever. It cant be better, you go to that rooftop, lay down in one of the sofas and look out over Barcelona, you Will see this is the best place in all of Barcelona to be. Its a 5 star hotel in My eyes, or at least better Than the 5 stars. I been to, and i have been to a few. 

",5,2017,05,04
47,Great hotel--,Great hotel- friendly staff and very helpful.  Great hotel location. Rooms were comfortable and plenty of room as well.  I would recommend Catalonia Barcelona Plaza hotel to anyone wanting to visit Barcelona.,5,2017,05,03
47,Solid 4 star with great metro access,"Impressive breakfast .  Modern comfortable bedroom and bathroom .   Great location to catch the Metro from
Espanya stop and connect to the rest of the city and all major attractions.  Buffet breakfast had all the things a North American would want .   There is a rooftop bar but it was closed for private function.  ",4,2017,04,30
47,No reason to choose it,"It might have been better once; today it is only a big hotel, where terrace bar closes on 20 tourists at 12, where staff is indifferent and not involved, where my minibar was never working and even if they replenished it, nobody cared to repair it, where if you look up in the bathroom you see fungus... Barcelona can be better",2,2017,04,25
47,Exellant stay 👍😜❤️,"Definitely come here again xx
Lovely friendly staff and exellant location beautiful Barcelona recommend the Metro 4 stops at the ramblers xx 
Hard Rock Cafe is a must meals and staff again very helpful and friendly xx
Superb beach lovely and clean overall stay was exellant xx",5,2017,04,25
47,Personal experience while staying at Catalonia Plaza,Guests should not be expected to wait in the Lobby for Room to be prepared.  Need to strengthen the House-keeping and maintenance department to handle the rush of Guests and increased volume of business. ,4,2017,04,25
47,Sal,"Plazas Espania what centrally positioned hotel the is simply breathtaking especially from the rooftops probably one of the best rooftop I have been in a long time. 

3 nights stay cost me 320.00 euros including tax so not bad. 

Breakfast 20 Euros not worth it.  
You can get good Spanish breakfast on the side roads either side of the hotel for less than 7 euros. 
I booked a large bed through my APP BOOKING.COM 
unfortunately not available when checking in. 
Ok never mind next when I requested and insisted that I get my room changed and they obliged. 
When I came back later in the evening I approached aggressively by security asking for my room number 

Well hardly a security question?????
I refused to give out my room number so they said you can go!!!

Whatever ever guys. 

Please management you need to look into that?????
THESE GUYS ARE NOT DOING YOU ANY FAVOURS. 
BIT RUDE I THINK LUCKILY I WAS IN A GOOD Mood SO LET THEM OFF. 
ON MY LAST NIGHT I GOT WOKEN UP TWICE FROM RECEPTIONIST SAY I WORDED ESCORT AND SHE IS WAITING DOWNSTAIRS I WAS ABSOLUTELY APPALLED. 
THEN I RECEIVED ANOTHER PHONE CALL TO APOLOGIES. 

WELL FOR GET IT. ..........",3,2017,04,24
47,perfect place for a stay in BCN,"we spent a week at this hotel before Eastern. Due to the advises here on tripadvisor i booked a superior room on the 7th floor (where although the Spa and the Gym is). The rooms are very nice and clean, but due to the bad quality of the windows you still hear the noise from Placa Espana. What ist outstanding, is the pool with bar on the 8th floor, overlooing BCN!! We although enjoyed the Japanese restaurant (see separate comment). All in all, if we come back to BCN, we would stay again at that hotel!",4,2017,04,24
47,A  nice experience,"Last week I was in Barcelona for business and I slept for 2 nights in this Hotel.
The Hotel is in a strategic position, nearby you can find the Exposition Building, a tube station, a big mall, sone restaurants and is not far from Olympic Venues.
Rooms are big and comfortable and staff is very kind . The hotel is often fully booked but staff is always kind i wish to thank all reception staff especially Cristina",4,2017,04,23
47,Great location ,"We spent 4 nights in this hotel , the pool was very good (rooftop) with awesome view , open at night with a nice bar.
Food by the pool ( lunch) simple but good.
Rooms are really comfortable , nicely decorated and modern 
Breakfast buffet is poor and chaotic ( staff not very friendly) 
In house restaurant( sushi place ) was average,
Expensive , okay-ish food and bad service.",4,2017,04,20
47,"Great hotel, location and staff","I was amazed by the welcoming at the hotel and how they did their best to suit my family needs. It was great at every stage. The only thing I think could be better is a little softer beds. This is of course an individual case. It is near by great shopping, olympic parc and the catalan museum. And a roof pool which the kids loved. ",4,2017,04,19
47,Beautiful views,"We stayed here on a recommendation from someone else.  Would have preferred to stay near La Rambla but it was only about an hours stroll away or four short stops on the underground train which was right outside the hotel.  The hotel is on one of the stops on the hop on hop off bus which is really good.  There are great sites around the hotel to visit as well.  The rooftop swimming pool is amazing at night, unfortunately it was a bit cool (in April) to swim.  I would recommend this hotel in summer.  Though having said that you need to put the air conditioning down to 10 degrees Celsius for it to cool the room down.  The airport bus is located conveniently right outside the door..There are computers in the lobby as well as a printer (which we needed to print tickets) but it ran out of ink so the lovely front desk staff printed them for us.  We were in a superior room and really liked the nightly turn down service (with chocolate).  We had breakfast included and it was really nice with a lot of choices.  .",4,2017,04,18
47,Nice hotel with amazing breakfast,"I loved the Catalonia Barcelona Plaza. The rooms are large including the bathroom. This is rare in Europe. The only quirk is getting the shower to work (note - you have  to pull the knob up after you have started the water a little). You're welcome :) The location is good. Things are spread out somewhat in Barcelona. The hotel is near a mall, museums and other attractions. It is also very convenient for public transportation. The bus from the airport has a stop in front of the hotel. Oh and the highlight is the most amazing breakfast. I'm talking: omelet station, crepe station, make your only freshly squeezed juice from fruits and veggies station. The staff is great. All in all great stay.",4,2017,04,13
47,Bad value for money ,"
We got the suite with champagne included, great. But that's where the good stuff ends.

Night receptionist was very rude

We were dispatched abruptly by the receptionist without them providing any assistance with luggage .

Me and my friend bought a bottle of wine and we asked for a bottle opener (no bottle opener in the suite?) we had to order ice (3 euros) for them to come and open the bottle of wine which I find, frankly, ridiculous.

Classic lack of good management and employee motivation let this place down.",2,2017,04,12
47,2017 Strategy Meeting,"We had a large meeting of over 65 people, the conference rooms were very nice, spacious and clean, AV was in each room and everything worked flawlessly.  The catering was top notch, food everyday for 4 days was changed up by the chef and was so delicious.  The hotel rooms were not overly large but very well laid out.  Large bathroom which worked well for two people to get ready at the same time.  Wi-Fi worked all the time.  Convention staff was truly professional and always accommodating with any issues, which were few.  We had a large dinner and the service, atmosphere and food was truly fantastic.  Location, Location, Location! Close to everything, metro, food, shopping, sites.",4,2017,04,12
47,Brief stay,"Excellent hotel, from service and location. The first hotel which had complimentary snacks and beverages in the hallway floor. The convenience of being in the heart of the city was great, given the proximity to the locations one could visit.",4,2017,04,11
47,No Air Conditioning,"Stayed here for five nights on a business trip.  The staff was friendly and the rooms a good size.  Breakfast was very good with a nice selection of eggs, fruits, and breads.  The location is excellent with easy access to much of the city.  I would give them a higher rating except for two things...the air conditioning did not work and the room got very hot.  The staff told me the A/C was broken but was not fixed during the entire week I visited.  The room could only be cooled by opening the window at night but the hotel is on a busy street and the noise made sleeping difficult.  The other annoyance was the shower temperature control.  The shower itself was good sized but the temperature varied between scalding and cold which I assume was whenever another guest turned on their shower.  If they had turned on or fixed the A/C my stay would have been much more enjoyable.",3,2017,04,07
47,Excellent,"We had a family trip to barcelona and we select this hotel for 4 nights for first, after that we extend our trip to 8 nights, because this hotel really was good, I believe that every things was excellent, but breakfast's price is a little expensive, ",5,2017,04,04
47,Convenient location,"Centrally located at plaza espana. Quite big and unfortunately packet with kids/youth groups during my stay. Room was clean with great bed and great views to mont jouic. 
Although 5th floor traffic was noisy. Very good breakfast selection, unfortunately in a big, loud unpractical hall.",3,2017,04,03
47,Mr Anthony Roberts,"I was there for one night and had the best views in the area. Nice hotel and good service. Breakfast was good as I had a freshly made omelette which is always good at breakfast times. 

Barcelona does not have an Uber service but there is an equivalent called Cabify which is just as good and provides exactly the same level of service.",5,2017,04,03
47,Nice place,"This hotel is in very nice place. The biggest crossroad under hotel rooms are although noisy, but the rooms are soundproofed. View from the window becomes attractive. Hotel rooms care about cleanliness could be better. Staff was very friendly.",4,2017,03,30
47,Not as good as expected,"The hotel in has a great location and helpful staff. The breakfast is above average, and should please most people. The rooms however could clearly need some renovation. Cleanliness was below average. The ceiling above the bathroom shower had large black, stained areas (mold?). I could not use the air-conditioning, as several of the times I turned it on, my room started smelling like a smokers room. Ended up with having it turned off, window open and trying to sleep despite the noise from the city below. All in all, this hotel did not live up to my expectations, and I would choose a different hotel for my next stay.",3,2017,03,26
47,thank you for your service,"Consistently, this is a very comfortable and friendly place to stay in; the staff is friendly, the place is not pretentious but discreetly classy, the rooms are well equipped, comfortable and up to date.
I reward such service by faithfully coming back and not paying attention to the competition. I hope to come back with my wife in June. This is at the top of my price range but well worth it.",5,2017,03,20
47,Spotty Service but Excellent Location,"The bad: Hotel phone didn't work; had to go to reception desk to request extra blanket and towels, which never arrived. In-room safe broke. Hostess at breakfast buffet prevented me from getting an extra cup of coffee. I never was able to get hotel wi-fi. Very expensive. The good: Breakfast buffet was outstanding actually. Building is beautiful and conveniently located near Montjuic and the art museum as well as start/finish of Barcelona Marathon. Cabs and shopping nearby. The pool deck is nice with wonderful views.",3,2017,03,17
47,Nice hotel near palau de congressos de Barcelona,"Under 500m Walking to this smaller congress centre. Metro was also very close. Breakfast was supergood, rooms nice and service normal. Only minus was elevators, Slow and broken, we needed to ring a bell to be able to get out..and it happened twice!",3,2017,03,17
47,Great location at Plaza Espania right on the metro and bus,came for Barcelona marathon which was right there in plaza espania so the location was very comfortable. regardless - this is a great location for touring the city with a metro station and many buses running right there and a shopping mall and restaurants all around.,4,2017,03,16
47,One night it Barcelona,"The hotel location is perfect. Close to all you want to see. The room had outstanding view and it was very well equiped. Subway (metro) was steps from the front door. 
Generally speaking, for my very short stay in Barcelona, I had an awesome experience! I will come back for sure and I already recommanded this place to my friends.",5,2017,03,14
47,Shopping time.,"Hello everyone, 
We really enjoyed the visit. It is perfect place to enjoy  shopping, food and some quality time with family. 
I recommend this place. We will definitely go again. 
 We had very good time out there",5,2017,03,13
47,Company Conference,"I had a lovely stay at this hotel staff friendly and helpful, location is great it is central to everything, view were excellent, would stay there again. rooms are nice very spacious, roof terrace was lovely. ",4,2017,03,13
47,OK,"i have submitted my feedback to the hotel. My last day's stay was charged to my card without my knowledge or consent. Its only when i asked, i was told that my company had paid upto the penultimate day and as an individual, I had to pay for the last day. Funnily, this was done 12hours after my departure from the hotel. I dont appreciate this ""surreptitious"" charging!!",3,2017,03,10
47,Business Stay,"The location is great with the proximity to the trains, restaurants and stores.  But the rooms are in need of a serious update. Since I was here for business, the hotel was a good choice and made it extremely easy to get around.  The breakfast room is large and taxis are easily found waiting outside the hotel.  The hotel is rated 4-stars, but the star rating is very different than in the US or Asia, where this hotel would probably fall to 3 stars.",3,2017,03,09
47,MWC 20107,"Excellent as in previous years, it is always nice to come to the familiarity and the fact the quality remains consistent speaks volumes. I will always stay there when ever I am in Barcelona. I highly recommend",5,2017,03,09
47,We had an excellent stay at Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,"We had a business meeting at the hotel for 30 people. The amenities, service, catering, hospitality, cooperation were very great. Every outstanding request was provided with grace and good will. Very professional and customer oriented. The location is excellent, rooms spacious, clean and nicely decorated. We will certainly come back. Thank you all for helping us have a successful event.",5,2017,03,07
47,Great hotel ,"Was here for a conference and the service, staff and food was excellent. Beds were comfy and the rooms spacious. The views from the hotel are excellent too. Easy access to the Aerobús as the stop is outside is a bonus. About 30 mins walk to the centre so well positioned for those who like walking too.

This hotel definitely looks better inside than from the outside!!

Would definitely stay here again!!",4,2017,03,01
47,These guys are crooks!,"I ask for a reservation change 4 days in advance to the 3 night minimum because I can no longer stay there -- they say ""no"". Ok, fine, can I let someone else use my room I ask? Yes no problem...until I go to leave and they change their mind because the person staying in the room was not up to the standard. Shame on them.",1,2017,02,28
47,Good old charm in nice location,"Room was clean and cosy with good Wifi connection. Staff was very pleasant and helpful. View from the roof top terrace is magnificent!! Lobby furniture has a timeless style and charm, although everything (outside the room) has seen better days. However beautiful. Next to the hotel is a huge shopping mall with long line of high end restaurants and bars. Will definitely stay in this hotel again!",3,2017,02,28
47,Excellent hotel with super staff,A very good location. Clean with excellent facilities and services. Very easy to reach from the airport. Super staff. Our room had views over Monjuic. Easy access to that area and great transport links to the centre.,5,2017,02,27
47,A wonderful base for exploring the city,"The Catalonia Barcelona Plaza hotel served me well on my recent visit to Barcelona.  Below are a few of my observations:

The Rooms - were comfortable and mine was recently renovated.  The beds were firm, but comfortable.  The AC/fan must not have been operational given the season, so the room got somewhat stuffy at night.  The bath was spacious and clean.  Housekeeping was prompt and did a great job.  There was a lack of outlets for charging devices, but that is common across many hotels, so I can't fault this hotel.

The Breakfast - was amazing.  They had several stations where you could get cooked-to-order eggs and fresh waffles, but I tended to stick with the fresh rolls, meats, cheeses, and other dairy (yogurt and kefir).  They had wonderful coffee and fresh juices.  This was a fantastic way to begin the morning and I would recommend adding this to your stay.

The Staff - were friendly, but I honestly didn't need much from them.  I was only in the hotel overnight, for breakfast, and then maybe once in the afternoon to freshen up for an evening out.

The Location - was very good.  The entrance to the Metro (Red and Green) lines is right out front of the hotel and was very convenient.  I acquired a 10-ride ticket and used the metro to make my way to the Gothic Quarter as well as other famous landmarks.  The subway was easy to follow and the signage was very clear.  Plus if you just wanted to stay near the hotel, you are near the art museum and other well-known city sights.

I highly recommend this property and will stay here again if my travels bring me back to Barcelona...and I hope that they will!",5,2017,02,26
47,Fantastic New Year stay!,"We specifically chose this hotel for the views it offers of the fireworks on the 31st December. We had a great stay and would highly recommend this hotel.

Check-in was smooth and efficient. The receptionist was welcoming and friendly, furnishing us with lots of information about the hotel, our room and the planned celebrations on the 8th floor poo area on the 31st December.

We had booked the suite with terrace on the 8th floor and it was absolutely amazing. Although some of the furniture is a little tired, overall the space is tremendous and the views are stunning. It had a sitting room and large dining table and a coffee machine and small fridge. The lounge area flowed out on to the terrace that wraps around the side of the building with a balinese bed and 2 other sun loungers. The only thing missing was a table and chairs - but a very minor point.

The room had a small toilet near the sitting room and a massive bathroom with walk in shower, separate loo, double sinks and a sunken bath. All with lovely toiletries. The shower was a bit dark and the fixtures could do with being updated - but everything was spotless. Slippers and bathrobes were also provided. 

Hanging space; not a problem. 3 double wardrobes with mirrored doors offer plenty of space! There is also a complimentary safe. The separate bedroom was also huge and had an extremely comfortable bed and large windows looking out to the side terrace and over the the Arenas shopping mall. 

Shortly before midnight on new year's eve, crowds gathered in the Plaça Espanya. the atmosphere was jovial and fun. But we took up our vantage point from our room to enjoy an amazing firework show. My only issue was that when we wanted to get to our room, it was quite difficult because of the number of people trying to get to the 8th floor to watch the fireworks from the pool area. The queue for the lift was horrific, the security guard and receptionist couldn't tell us where the stairs were. When we found them there was still a horrific queue. We eventually had to force our way past, which wasn't very pleasant.

We enjoyed a lovely breakfast in the hotel. The choice was fantastic and food was replenished very quickly. The quality of the food was also good and the coffee lovely! Don't miss it.

The bar area is a little odd and trying to get served it he lobby area is a challenge - but there are so many lovely places to go outside.

If you love walking, this is a great hotel to use as a base. To walk to Plaça Catalunya or the Colón statue, you are looking at a 20-30 minute walk. Taxis and the metro are right outside - but we always walked. So if you want to be in the thick of the main tourist sights, this may not be the best choice for you. 

The pool area is lovely. The bar up there was sadly closed, but it's worth a trip up to enjoy the views and watch the sun going down.

WiFi worked really well in all areas and was free of charge.

We had a fantastic stay and with the exception of a few VERY MINOR niggles, everything was excellent. I would definitely return to this hotel at any time of the year and would highly recommend.",4,2017,02,26
47,Dated and definitely not 4 star,"I was booked into this hotel because my booking in another hotel of the same chain had been cancelled. Staff are friendly, but the hotel has seen its best days some time ago.  Furniture in the reception hall is worn.  The bathroom featured various humidity stains.  Should not happen in a hotel that claims to be 4 star.  There must be better places to stay in Barcelona.",2,2017,02,25
47,Has seen it's best years long time ago,"Location is quite ok, close to many attractions. Metro in front of the hotel.
But the rooms are very old, and need some renovations.
Breakfast is ok, but not on international standard.
Over all, not really good value",3,2017,02,25
47,Busy Busy Busy.....,"The main square in the centre of Barcelona and naturally, it is very busy. This is the best place to board any of the Tourist Buses as this is their Terminus. The Metro is nearby and Las Ramblas a minute walk away.

A cautionary note - Beware of Pickpockets who operate here due to the crowded nature of the place....",4,2017,02,23
47,Birthday trip to Barcelona to see the fam,"This was a flying visit with a friend from London Luton to Barcelona to visit some family, whilst also gaining the sunshine for my birthday (Valentines Day). We arrived at the hotel and were watched on by the bell boys as we struggled with our luggage over to the reception desk. We were greeted by Veronica, who was extremely helpful in giving us information about the hotel and advising us on some basic tourist spots. The reception seems nice, clean and modern, with a pop of colour - natural browns with purple and greens. we then made our way to the room which was fine, very basic, slightly annoying having no plug socket next to the bed and no dressing gown but needs must. on the whole a pretty average hotel, debatable whether i would choose to stay there again but amazing location.",3,2017,02,16
47,Our Saviours!,"We had been robbed at the roadside in Spain.

We had to stay in Barcelona while we reported the crime and waited for a new ferry.

We needed somewhere to stay with our sat at very short notice. The hotel was superb and saved our lives. We would recommend them to anyone.",5,2017,02,16
47,Excellent,"I like the most location and stuff service.Very Comfortable room with perfect cleaning.Amazing view from the roof top. Everything was perfect i do not have any issues with the hotel ,maybe only the room view i preferred a front view.",5,2017,02,15
47,My recent visit,"My entire comments are in the survey. The hotel was one place I would not ever go back to. Maybe if I was a low budget traveller as a student but now? No not at all. Amenities lousy, breakfast one huge room with food scattered all over 4 serving stations totally uncoordinated. Why not have one breakfast corner? The food served at the Congress was bread with bread! Note great experience. I even had to carry my cases to my room! No porter in site. At the Congress Reception the waiter who was there was standing by the wall and when we asked him to serve us wine he said it was not his duty. All he did was collect empty glasses? ",2,2017,02,14
47,Short trip to Barcelona,"Overall, a well above average experience and hotel. Location is very good, many restaurants and shops in the immediate area. staff was friendly Convention facility was quite good for a smaller size conference.",4,2017,02,14
47,Stay away from this hotel,"The hotel is beautifully located, but poorly maintained and managed.  Room was intolerably hot, and they could not or would not look into it--I had to open the window in wintertime, making it very noisy, and I didn't get a decent night's sleep the three nights I was there.  It took a day to replace the broken phone.  It took two days to replace the missing desk chair (how does a room lose a desk chair?).  Staff was very friendly, which is useless considering they were completely ineffectual in dealing with the many problems I had.",1,2017,02,13
47,Good for 'just a place to stay',"We loved our weekend in Barcelona because of the sights and bus tours. This hotel was good for us as it was purely just a place to stay. Realistically, if you're a sightseeing tourist, you shouldn't be spending much time in the hotel. We got a lovely room with the best view after a polite request. The bed was amazing, huge! And the toilet was nice with a lush shower! The hotel was clean and a lovely lady on reception gave us a map of the city and told us how to get to the centre where all the shopping and restaurants were - this was about a 30 minute walk. But we didn't mind walking as that's what we went there to do! The bus tour was amazing, 30 euros pp, and the stop is just outside the hotel - you can hop on and off all day as much as you want! We never had breakfast at the hotel as we wanted to explore other places, the view from the 8th floor is lovely but too cold to use the pool at the time we went. So all in all, this hotel was perfect for just a place to stay.",4,2017,02,10
47,Nice hotel - Easy access to AeroBus,Nice hotel that is situated right beside the A1-A2 Aerobus stops. The view view from the 8th floor pool / terrace was nice. I had a dinner in one of the restaurants in the first floor and it was very good. ,4,2017,02,06
47,"Good but dull, good staff but hotel lacks imagination and investment","Overall a pleasant and good value stay in a great location. However the hotel is slow and tired, nothing is special, no innovation. The hotel where time stood still. Requires some investment in technology, facilities and bedroom decor to justify a higher rating.",3,2017,02,06
47,Poor maintenance,"Due to faulty windows and air conditioning not working, along with a radiator that couldn't be set to anything but maximum heat, we had 4 nights of very poor sleep. Shame as the staff and the room quality were good.",1,2017,02,06
47,Out-dated,"We stayed at Catalonia Barcelona Plaza for 2 nights. Retrospectively, is was a really bad choice, given Barcelona has loads of good hotels. Our first room on arrival was about 30 degrees hot. Despite air condition it didn't cool down. The maintenance man couldn't fix the problem and afterwards we were told that the air condition is turned off during winter time?! So you don't have any air circulation at all. They offered us another one looking inside the hotel complex, so at least we could open the windows. The rooms are out-dated and the bathroom sinks are rusty. 
Staff is ok - not everyone can speak English. Breakfast ist nice offering everything you need incl. locale products and delicacies. The location is great - and I think this is the fact why this hotel survives. Near to the metro and quite close to the Inner City. 
",2,2017,02,06
47,Great hotel,"I stayed only for one night so I can't talk about some of the facilities the hotel offers (gym, pool, spa) but overall it was a great experience for me. Close to the Arenas shopping mall and the Mont Juic, and with a lot of public transport offers to get you wherever you might need in Barcelona. 

The breakfast was great (eggs, for example, are prepared right in front of you so you can ask how you want them) and the staff was kind. 

The room was great, big and really confortable. It also had some beautiful views of the Mont Juic.

Bonus points for the amazing rooftop area, with delightful views of the city that beat those of the Arenas mall.",5,2017,02,05
47,Suit Reloj!,We had a blast at the suite! The shower was heaven (I love good showers!) but they are really strict with check-in and check-out. Service was okay at the reception. Location was perfect. Not too many options for the breakfast though.,5,2017,01,29
47,Good business hotel,"Decently sized rooms, modernised with taste to a cosmopolitan sophisticated level even though in some places, you can tell that refurbishment focused on some areas more than others.

Breakfast is served under a spectacular dome, location is pretty good and servide too, check-in and check-out is efficient, less noisy than expected despite the central location.

Business premises, meeting rooms and catering facilities were also good. Left wanting to try the Filigrana restaurant and the japanese one. Who knows? PErhaps next time

Overall, 4 stars, probably 4.5 stars",4,2017,01,27
47,"Location, location, Location","It had a great location, was a beautiful hotel. The beds were very comfortable, there is a huge shopping mall right next to the hotel and a taxi bay and metro.  Our room was impeccably clean, very spacious and the facilities were perfect. The staff were friendly and helpful. 
We would definitely stay here again if we visit Barcelona again.",5,2017,01,27
47,Review,"Nice hotel. Good location,which is close to the Ramblas. Greatservice from informed staff. Was there for a business trip, so this hotel was perfect in terms of location. The cleanliness of the room was a standout. ",4,2017,01,23
47,Business trip,Good central location with a half an hour walk to La Rambla. Rooms are old and there was a hole in my bath. Over priced for what you get. Breafast was average. Reception area was not an indication of what the rooms wolud be like. Having stayed at other hotels in Barcelona you can certainly get better value for money elsewhere,3,2017,01,23
47,The four star hotel that has passed the expiration date.,"The initial impression of the hotel was good. Large reception and good looking conference rooms. The room I was staying in looked good at a quick glance but if you looked a bit closer you could see all the faults shining though. Tiles in the bathroom that had grime in between, the holder for the shower was broken and the paper towel holder was loose. My fellow colleagues had either a to cold room or a to hot room, the AC didn't seem to work. The public restrooms didn't have the floors properly cleaned in four days. The staff was OK. When asking for coffee during the seminar sessions the initial response was ""Coffee is served at 10:30 and 13:30"", whilst the staff was running and drinking coffee constantly. To sum it up, I'll avoid this hotel, you can test it. :)",2,2017,01,18
47,"Conveniant stay in a spacious, well equipped room at a very central place","no full points because of minor negatives (maintenance status of bathroom: mold on grout, broken shower head, tv programming beeing mashed up, cold eggs sunny side up at the breakfast bar, long queue at cooking bar)",4,2017,01,16
47,Thank you for making Barcelona unforgettable,"Location TOP - room view TOP -  WiFi TOP.

Highly appreciated that aerobus and metro are right in front of the hotel.
Japanese restaurant at the hotel worth the experience, great food and service.

E-Mail Response time before Arrival was slow.",4,2017,01,16
47,Wafer thin walls and toilets that don't flush,"This is an awful place, utter waste of money.  i woke up at 3 am convinced someone was walking round my room.  only when i heard the light switch next door it dawned on me how thin the walls were.
when i went to go for a pee i noticed toilet paper in the toilet, flushed the chain and the toilet filled up.  I couldn't even use it.
The food was no better at breakfast than that.
On a positive side - great location.",2,2017,01,12
47,Great Stay at a Great Hotel,"I have stayed in this hotel for the last 4 days during SAP congress in Barcelona city. This city is beautiful, the hotel has a great location, Subway and buses just in front of the hotel, so it is very well communicated. Even though the hotel is quite big, everything was perfect. The rooms are very good, breakfast is awesome and has everything you can expect...( breakfast room very cold and too big?!) All the staff is quite nice. Reception was great and helpful all the time, special mention to Cristina who was so helpful, nice, qualified and has a smile always in her face!",5,2017,01,11
47,Can't ask for a better location,"The hotel is very clean and has everything you'd expect from a hotel of this standard. Buffet breakfast, although pricey,is very good The only thing missing was tea and coffee making facilities in the room, but that isn't unusual in Spain. The roof terrace is definitely a must as the view from there is amazing. Despite previous reviewers finding the reception staff less than helpful, we found them very informative and one in particular (on duty afternoon/evening) speaks excellent English. 
The location of the hotel couldn't be better. It's very central with the Metro on the doorstep and the old bullring shopping centre opposite, which has shops (even a reasonably priced supermarket) 
and restaurants galore. 
All in all I couldn't recommend the Catalonia Barcelona Plaza more.",5,2017,01,11
47,Stunning Hotel,Great hotel for all types of people. The rooftop pool and bar are amazing especially at night. The rooms were very comfortable and had everything we needed. The breakfast was great also. I would stay here again!,5,2017,01,08
47,Countdown for 2017,"The location is great.
Subways  are just down the hotel. Renfe station was only 10 minutes walk from there. Location is nice to go around.
We stayed there for countdown for coming 2017 coz it was really close to the monjuic park to walk there. But the hotel has the place on the roof to see the fireworks and the show which was hard to see. So we went to the rooftop and celebrated the new year there.",4,2017,01,05
47,3 day visit,"It was very busy at reception when we arrived but we were greeted by a most pleasant and efficient receptionist named ""Laura"".It was the start of a wonderful stay. The Hotel is modern,very clean and has a great staff. The Breakfast was very good. The location could not be better. The metro station is outside the front door and the airport buses are less than two minutes away. Excellent!",5,2016,12,29
47,Perfect location. Wonderful staff,"Highly recommended hotel in Barcelona. Location is perfect for key attractions at Montjuic, plus metro station is metres from hotel's front door. La Rambla and Marina areas are 4-5 stations away. The 10 trip metro ticket is recommended. The musical fountain is a must visit. The shopping centres on Diagonal Avenue are also worth visiting. These are where the locals shop. These are a 25 minute walk from hotel. the  hotel pool and poolside bar would be awesome in summer.",5,2016,12,27
47,great ,"not more than just GO to say what a great stato of spain just beautifull very turistic and great night life , enjoy the great food tapas the most and the beautifull rambla of Barcelona its just great u wont regreat .",5,2016,12,26
47,Good stay in Barcelona during IBTM World,"Conveniently located in between the exhibition (Fira Granvia) and city centre. Kind and helpful staff. Room was OK, even if other hotels close by provide better value for money. Wi-fi connection was effective.",4,2016,12,13
47,I'll Be Back!!,"A must to stay here when you visit Placa Espanya. The friendly staffs and the location of the hotel is just too good to avoid. With the Metro Train Station just at the doorstep and a mall just across the road, convenience is certainly an added advantage for any of the hotel's guests.",5,2016,12,09
47,CIS Forum in Barcelona,The rooms are quite outdated and the decor was damaged in places. The location of the hotel is extremely central and the metro is just next to it. Excellent bus service from the airport to the Plaza Espanya. The staff at reception were always friendly and helpful.,4,2016,12,06
47,Great stay and wonderful experience,"Great location, neat and clean hotel, very warm and helpful staff, good breakfast. 
Rooms are spacious with good interiors. WIFI connectivity is good, Big LCD in room with good channels. Well connected with Metro and Bus service. ",5,2016,12,06
47,Great getaway,"Reception service provided was excellent and don't miss the menu 1 in the mediterranean restaurant, where we got a 6 course fabulous menu for very reasonably price. very professional service in the restaurant.",5,2016,12,05
47,Great stay,"We were here with a big group of people There was absolutely no problem, everything worked the way it should. We had a room with a perfect view on the square. The staff was very nice and helpful, especially the receptionist Linda, who deserves a big thank you from us!",5,2016,12,05
47,Best Hotel in Barcelona,"I was very pleased. The Hotel was great and the staff very helpful. Miss or Mrs. Linda on the front desk was very nice to our group. She did a great job! Hope I see her next time. Thumps up! Next time we are staying here as well. I can't wait till next time. 
Best regards to the whole staff.",5,2016,12,05
47,Amazing,"Love this hotel! I booked 2 nights on Booking.com for 160€/night (breakfast not included). It was my first time here and the receptionist offered me an upgrade to my room (free of charge) - a suite instead of a double room, at the 10th floor, with an amazing view toward 3 parts of the city. Best view - the one to Plaza España.
A living room with comfortable sofas, a meeting table and chairs for 6 people, fully equipped minibar, flat screen satellite TV (TV channels in English, Spanish, Italian, German, Russian, French), a Nespresso coffee maker and coffee capsules.
I didn't find though a complimentary bottle of water. But there's a Mall right across the street - Arena Mall, so I bought from there.
2 bathrooms - a small one and a big one. Bathrobe and slippers, hairdryer, shower and round bathtub; toothbrush and toothpaste, shaving cream and razor blade, hair comb , shoe sponge, shampoo, shower gel, body milk, pretty much everything one might need.
In the bedroom - a very comfortable bed, another flat screen satellite TV, telephone, a sofa.
What else? Air conditioning, heating, safe deposit box, iron and iron table, free wi-fi.
From the living room window I saw a terrace pool, at the 9th floor, with a precious view to Plaza España.
I was offered breakfast at 10€ (instead of 16€). Cannot comment on the food because I did not take that offer.
Excellent location, in Plaza España, nexo to Arena Mall, Fira de Barcelona facilities, Montjuic, National Art Museum of Catalunya.
Metro (tube) and bus station right in front of the hotel. Buses to the airport every 5 minutes (5,90€/ticket, can be bought from the driver).
In short -wow! I highly recommend it!",5,2016,12,02
47,Bang in the centre of action,"Barcelona was our last destination of our 22 day tour of Spain. Portugal and Morocco.
Good that we chose to stay at this hotel.This place turned out to be a happening place.
Just next to the mall is a big Mall built out of an old Bull ring. Just in front is a huge circle leading to the famous Monjuic hill where you have the National Art Museum.
Bang opposite the hotel is the beautiful Musical fountain wnich lights up the week end evening.
      Hotel has modern facilities and the rooms are clean and comfortable",4,2016,12,02
47,Lovely stay at lovely hotel,Excellent hotel with excellent staff and location. Located in a prime location for the airport and metro the hotel and staff were excellent. Staff were friendly and always on hand to help. Overall a 5* experience ,5,2016,11,29
47,"Clean room, friendly staff, some cons though","Pro: Clean and friendly, central, quiet, wifi and flat screen TV.
Room nice and clean
Con: no coffee or tea in room and bed slightly uncomfortable, mini bar not working, exposed wire from the hair dryer in shower room",4,2016,11,29
47,Great hotel in a great city for a great price,"I had to go to a meeting in Barcelona on short notice. Surely this must be one of the best hotels in the city when it comes to service, room and they offer quality breakfast too. Taxis always wait outside and there is a shopping center right across the street with great brands.",5,2016,11,29
47,Not worth it for the price.,"Lack of amenities: no working safe, no water pot, lack of outlet, no complimentary water. 
Beds are uncomfortable. A double was literally two beds put together so one could only sleep on one side. I wouldn't stay here again. 

",2,2016,11,29
47,Rooms to warm for a winter stay,"Find another hotel,even if you enjoy the area you will not be happy with this hotel. The pool has limited access all dining requires reservations. Deli attached to hotel has decent food but limited options",2,2016,11,29
47,Very close to everywhere,"One of the most convenient location, close to metro stop (L3 Espana) and to Montjiuc/Magic Fountain/Arena on foot. The place is quiet even if it is in the middle of the Plaza Espana and easily reachable by the airport. Very nice staff and wonderful breakfast.",4,2016,11,28
47,My Stay,"Overall excellent. Coffeemaker in room would be nice and minibar. Quiet, clean, great shower! I would come back and recommend this hotel. The neighborhood has great bars and rests and the Arenas next door is a great convenience. For my work at the Palau de Congres, this was perfect.
",4,2016,11,28
47,3* Hotel with 4* prices,"Excellent location on the Plaza Espana, but a limited service hotel for the money. The Aerobus stops across the street from the hotel and picks up right in front.  An excellent and green choice to make rather than a taxi (there is no Uber in Barcelona).  For business travellers, this is a limited hotel--workout room is very small and is not open 24 hours. The room service menu is very limited as well and the 24 hr room service menu is even more limited.  I had a double superior room, which was very large and faced the Plaza. Some rooms face the interior and overlook the breakfast roof area, so limited in light.  It is located next to the Arenas shopping and across from the Fira de Barcelona, so the location is ideal for this part of the city.",3,2016,11,25
47,Work conference ,"I attended a work conference here , it was a stunning hotel with high quality finishes , the staff were friendly and I'm sure if I was to visit there again it would be highly likely I would stay here , food served was ok.",5,2016,11,24
47,Great Stay,Great stay and location. i would recommend people to come and stay at Barcelona Plaza. it is centrally located and has amazing view from 8th floor. the city looks beautiful from there. Easy accessibility to the market area and the city.,5,2016,11,23
47,Post Cruise,"Perfect location!  Taxi from port to hotel < 15€, Aerobus stop right out front for easy direct ride to airport.  Easy walks to art museum, event center, former bull arena turned mall, restaurants, hop on/off buses.  Will stay here again - the room was fine but the treasure is the pool terrace with the amazing views - especially at night watching the magic fountain light show.  Caveat being this is not a heated pool so go when it's hot to get the most from your stay!",4,2016,11,22
47,a good business hotel. But nice looking bar.,"I travel a lot for business and the basics for me are a comfortable room (good sleep and good shower) and a good gym. 

Room issues:
1. A business hotel should be able to find you an iron. I asked twice during my two day stay and they couldn't locate me one in the whole hotel, so I went to meeting with a creased shirt.
2. The shower had little or no pressure and inconsistent temperature. This didn't annoy me enough to complain on the first day. On the second day the shower didn't work at all, and I didn't have time to complain before I had to leave for a flight. 
3. The hotel decor is wood panel and stone, which looks nice, but makes the rooms cold and the hotel generally loud, so I stuggled to get a good nights sleep. 
4. A minor issue but pet peeve for me - only two plug socket sin the room. One under the desk and one hidden behind the TV. It means you struggle to charge multiple devices, and also can't have phone charging on a bedside table. 

The gym was tiny, probably fits about 6 people in total on the four machines and a stretching mat. 

Nice lobby, rooftop pool/bar has a spectacular view, breakfast was fine without being great. The location is great for the Fira as well. However for this price point I expect better in the basics and the extras on top. So all in all if in town again I would go for a drink in the bar, but stay elsewhere.",2,2016,11,22
47,My review,"Perfect stay in the best hotel I have ever been in Barcelona.
Everything was good - personnel, location, lunch room, bar, view from the top of hotel.
Sound proof rooms are excellent, you can barely hear any noises ( except for ambulance sirens )",5,2016,11,21
47,Lovely at Sunset,"The hotel park is filled with fountains,  fun statues and sites ... at sunset, it's amazing with colorful fountains.  It's lovely and worth the visit, it's a park, not too big and an enjoyable walk.  We enjoyed and will do it again, it's a main thoroughfare.",4,2016,11,20
47,"Okay room, excellent breakfast","I stayed at this hotel for one night while on a business trip. The location is good and there are always taxis available right outside the hotel, making moving around the city and to the airport very easy. Check-in and out was easy with friendly staff. No complaints there. The room was okay and clean, but could use an upgrade. My bathroom door could not close, for example. Do not expect extravagant design aesthetics, but but it does have all the amenities one could need. The bed was comfortable and I slept well. I could easily hear people talking in the hallway, but luckily for me, it did not last long. Wifi worked well too. The best part was the breakfast with a huge buffet where you can find both local and international selections of foods - it was a delicious start to the day. With such a big hotel though, the breakfast restaurant felt more like a canteen, not very cosy, but it's understandable. If a good breakfast is important to you, this could be a good pick. ",3,2016,11,20
47,Not bad if you need to stay in the area,"I chose this hotel after reading the strong reviews. I had stayed in the Ayre the night before which was a nightmare.  So when arriving at this hotel I asked for a quiet room.  They did give me one and get points for that.  The room was very quiet, also with no type of fan or blower or other extraneous noises that might keep you up at night.  The bed was also quite comfortable.  Desk people were all very helpful and friendly, things like room service came quickly and were quite reasonably priced.  I had the breakfast buffet every morning which also had quite a spread including a stand alone omelet egg station, fruit, all types of bread and a make your own pan con tomate station.  If I could rate this above average I would, but it doesn't quite make it into the ""very good"" station.  The rooms are a bit worn, especially the bathroom which had cracks in the walls, and the tub was in need of replacement.  The room was large but didn't feel luxurious.  Amenities were provided but they were basic in quality. Considering how expensive this hotel can list at I think you would do better for your money if you stayed in one of the more quiet neighborhoods or even in a more historic building.  But as I had a conference across the street it worked out just fine. I visited the rooftop pool, which was a nice area, but in such a busy/noisy area of the city on a smoggy day it would not be that enjoyable.",3,2016,11,19
47,Simple and not in line with the 4 stars,"Was a bit surprised the hotel was 4  stars:  the service is very low, ambience is quite ok but not good, breakfast quite low level and in a huge room looking a bit like a canteen. I ask asked to reception to book a restaurant, they told me they would have done and left in my room a message to confirm,  but no message and I will never know if they booked or not (I assume not!). On top, I had a room facing Plaza d'espagna, so good view but noisy. Only positive is that is super convincente to the fair!",2,2016,11,16
47,"Great Location, Great Rooms, Great Food","It's 1 shuttle ride away from the airport (shuttle is across the street) and a few subway stations away from Rambla and other tourists attractions.
Being in Plaza D'Espanya it will give you walking distance to Montjuic (highly recommend going up there for the view and to visit the museum - very nice Art from Roman, Gothic and Modern periods).
The experience at the hotel was pleasing. Rooms are clean with all you could need and the staff helps you quickly in case you need anything. ",5,2016,11,15
47,Excellent stay,"Very nice hotel, fabulous views and great Japanese restaurant.. Somehow I managed to bag a free upgrade, all I can say is wow and that I'll be back again in the new year for a personal trip. The room was always spotless, lots of bits and pieces in the room. not a fan of those tiny nespresso machines and tiny baby like cups. 

I love a mug of tea of coffee... otherwise, very good.",5,2016,11,15
47,"Clean, spacy room, good breakfast","Standards all great - very clean, big room, nice breakfast, wifi, TV, cozy bed ... Nothing to complain about there. 
Room on 1st floor was a bit noisy as you could hear the Metro at night. 

Room for improvement: I stayed in the hotel for a business trip. A large number of guest have been there for the same event. Would have expected that staff has a standard recommendation for transportation to the event venue in place. All guests were asking and it would have been easy to provide. 

 ",4,2016,11,15
47,Good hotel but need a brush up ,"Stayed at this hotel for four nights on a business trip to Barcelona. Check in was quick and friendly. The double room was good and clean, but the air inside was a bit thick. An open window fixed this quickly. Bathroom is a bit dated but functional and clean. Noise levels were acceptable. 
Breakfast was good quality and plenty of choice. We didn't have dinner at the hotel. The bar is a bit small for the hotel's size, and seemed to be a bit understaffed. The rooftop pool seems like a good place to hang out on warmer days. 
Check out was again quick and painless. The location right next to the arena and the many restaurants and shops in the vicinity also add to the hotel's rating. Would definitely stay here again without hesitation. ",3,2016,11,14
47,"6-days business stay in November, 2016 (single)","Great location (placa Espana and metro station by the hotel entrance; a lot of sightseeings close to hotel), excellent breakfast, fine wi-fi, fast elevators. I liked almost everything there except absence of free water in the hotel room.",5,2016,11,14
47,Pleasant!,"Great location! Easy to walk, stays just on a subway station. Tired rooms, windows that do not block the street noise, a broken shower handle with very weak current. Beds are very small and make some noises.",4,2016,11,14
47,Average,Not too bad a price but little old. unfortunately not tto clean either which was the big thing for me. Lovely friendly people and good facilities and very convenient for the centre but probably would not return.,3,2016,11,14
47,Never again,"I was at the hotel for five nights due business trip.

Check-in was really slow. The room smelled really bad, furnishings was out of date, the air conditioning was broken and no soundproofing. Room with a view of the backyard (slum). 

Every night the garbage came under the window and emptied the recycle glass bottles in the car. The noise was really loud.

My men colleagues met on several times in the hotel lobby and bar woman who openly offered escort services. They told that the same woman had been there also year ago when my colleagues were at the hotel the last time. It seems that this 4-star hotel allows this kind of ""extra services"".",1,2016,11,12
47,"Beautiful hotel, but dated","Here you can see that the crisis has it Spain. A beautiful hotel on the right spot in the center of Barcelona but they don't get it...
Every day the same breakfast.
Every day the same dinner.
The rooms need maintenance...
Beautiful rooftop pool with a bar.
The perfect spot for a business hotel.",3,2016,11,05
47,Smoke and Air Con,Room smelt badly of smoke the air conditioning did not work and piped music all night as the window had to be open.  No sleep! We were not able to move room as the hotel was full. The staff were friendly and tried to resolve the problems but ultimately they could not help. ,3,2016,11,01
47,Great hotel,"We stayed in this hotel for two nights. the rooms were really spacious we had 3 people sleeping in two rooms and two doubles. fantastic breakfast, one of the best I have had in Europe, although coming from Israel, and knowing how amazing the vegetables are in Spain, it was a shame there were no salad products to be found on the buffet. A big mall right across the street which was open till 2200.The hotel is opposite the Magic Fountain which works only in the weekends during the Winter months. It was far from Primark and Camp No but a fantastic metro station gets you to Les Ramblas in five minutes. I would definitely stay there again.",5,2016,11,01
47,I don't know how to review it!,"This is the first time I have stayed in a hotel that I don't know how to review! Maybe it's because everyone I worked with stayed at la ramblas and I felt I was far away! Let's talk about the good things!
Location - not bad especially for me who was working at gran Fira, I needed to get easy access! Do it offered me that!
Breakfast - they had a good breakfast option for anyone interested!
The not so good parts - my room was location below the kitchen so every morning at around 5 am- I would smell all the bakery that is going on! Not fun if you need sleep!
Smell - I don't know whether it is an old hotel but their was a funny smell on the hallways in the hotel - maybe do something?
Noise - whenever anyone walked, we could all hear it from our rooms! Also, the beds were not the most comfortable to sleep on!
Wifi was defiantly good - forgot about that one!",3,2016,10,31
47,The best hotel for the best trip,"You     shuold     try    his    best    hotel   at    the    best location and for acceptable price at least once in your life......    According    to   me Barcelona === Catalonia Barcelona Plaza or vice-versa.         Transportation, accomadation, workers and etc. were the best.",5,2016,10,31
47,Great central location in Barcelona,"We had a great stay here - loved our room and bathroom, modern and clean and the beds were so comfortable.  The reception staff were so helpful and friendly - we arrived about 9.30pm with small children and they pointed us towards a fabulous traditional tapas restaurant nearby which was exactly what we wanted.  They also helped me organise a visit to the Nou Camp and were just very helpful all round.  Great breakfast, lovely pool which the kids were in even in October.  Its very central and convenient - a bit of a long way to La Ramblas & beach if you are walking / driving but there is a metro station right outside.  My only quibble was the chambermaids - they were quite rude and when I asked them to come back in 10 minutes to clean so we could get ready and leave they said no.",4,2016,10,31
47,Modern rooms and good service,"I have stayed here before over a year ago as I travel the Barcelona regularly on business. I have recently stayed at the Vilamari which is nearby, but this hotel will become my regular stay from now on.

At check-in I realised I had just left my passport in the taxi. Luckily I had a printed receipt with contact details, and the receptionist (Christina) immediately went that extra mile by taking it upon herself to call the company in an effort to recover my passport. This took around 15 minutes of her time, (12-13 minutes on hold!) before she was able to confirm that the taxi driver could and would be contacted. It would take 1-2 hours possibly, by which time I would be out at a business dinner, but I was also informed that if it was returned in may absence, the taxi driver would be paid on my account - nothing more to worry about. I was checked in in seconds and went to my room. Within 30 minutes my passport was returned and exchanged for a hefty tip from me (it contains a visa for Russia, let alone it being a Friday night and no consulate support until Monday!) - Honest taxi drivers ARE out there.

The room was on the 7th floor (these rooms are above standard I believe), modern furnishing, desk space and large TV. Coffee machine as standard and large walk-in shower with monsoon shower head. Huge Bed and despite being on the Plaza, pretty quiet although I was at the front, there are rooms at the back.

Irons and ironing boards are available on request (not all ESP hotels do this in my experience) and there are two restaurants that are 'external' but accessible through the hotel. A pretty decent Sushi restaurant with an equally decent wine list, and a more contemporary restaurant - although there are a bunch of local restaurants all around from all price ranges and tastes, especially on the top of the nearby shopping complex (ex-bullring!).

Did not experience breakfast (left at 05:00 on Saturday), but from memory it is pretty decent and there is a separate breakfast room with more selection for guests who have superior rooms.

On the roof there is a swimming pool and bar, which is great and a nice place for sundowners - weather permitting, which is most of the time in Barcelona!!!",4,2016,10,30
47,"""Only location is good""","Location: Is opposite Palau Nacional and next to Arenes de Barcelona. (There is subway on the front of the Hotel: Pl Espanya)

Staffs/Receptions: There are not really friendly (some of them they are nice but some of them are not). Receptionists take quite a while to give you a keycards.  

A security on the main entrance not really helpful (I was ask him, excuse me where I can find the tobacco shop near the hotel? He didn't look at me and just say ""I have no idea go and ask reception"" where is service minded?)

Staffs at the rooftop bar and Japanese restaurant at the hotel they are very friendly. 

Rooms: If you got a room with ""Palau Nacional"" view is would be great than have a room with indoor view (you will see a roof of the breakfast room), room is clean but nothing special... (room a bit noisy, you can heard a room next door using toilet or the noise from the road)

Restaurants/Bar/Breakfast area: We ate 2 times at Japanese restaurant at the Hotel (Kurai Japanese Restaurant) is was so awesome! Bar (last week (14-16 October: bar still open and you can enjoy a pool and 360 view of Barcelona).

Breakfast area: seem more like  ""canteen"" for me. Food is run out, staffs are not nice, at eggs station she never smile. 

Amenities: 

Wifi: working very well.

Pool: Nice view but serving with a plastic glass not very impress.

Gym: Very small!!

Parking: There is parking service and can access direct to the hotel.",3,2016,10,25
47,last stop on our trip,"great room, very friendly and helpful staff, clean room...and the roof top pool/bar offered one of the finest panoramic views of Barcelona..  the breakfast was enormous...although not that tasty...but if you were hungry when you went in, you weren't when you left!!  The location was excellent and there was a metro station right outside the door!",5,2016,10,24
47,Excellent choice for business and leisure travel and stay..,This hotel is an excellent choice for business and leisure travel and stay. It is right on the Plaza Espana and metro entrance is just outside the door. Very close to Montjuic hill and Magic Fountain.,5,2016,10,24
47,Beautiful place!,The location is wonderful! Restaurants at the hotel are excellent. The terrace on the roof is worth the stay. Breakfast choices were expansive with well located espresso/coffee machine. Hotel is well located regarding bus transit to airport and underground.,5,2016,10,24
47,No buck for your money,"If you are expecting the Marriott look elsewhere 
I missed my coffee maker, decent gym and restaurant in the hotel 
I did not feel my belonging to be safe as thefts were taking place in the lobby 
The room were clean and the wifi worked and that is about it ",2,2016,10,23
47,Excellent location,"The location of hotel is perfect for both tourists and business travelers. Beds are confortable and the rooms are clean. Hotel staff is kind, too. You should definitely have breakfast at the terrace on a sunny day. ",5,2016,10,23
47,good stay,"we stayed in the hotel for one night, and were happy with the accomodation.  Staff was friendly (yet very busy), and the big entrance and hallway is what a business hotel needs.  Rooms was OK, but it has had its best time.
Meeting rooms are in the basement: spacious and modern(was recently renovated), but a basement has no windows, so staying in those the entire day gave us a headache.",4,2016,10,23
47,"Ok hotel, but a little run down","I recently stayed here while attending the VMworld 2016 tradeshow.  The first night I stayed here, I was put into a room with 2 single beds combined into 1 big bed - it was extremely uncomfortable and the mattresses were very hard and I barely slept a wink.  

I ultimately asked for another room and they were able to move me to the 5th floor with a more comfortable bed.  Unfortunately this new room didn't have a safe and any iron.  When I called the front desk and asked for an iron and ironing board, they said that they didn't have any available - disappointing.  

I would not choose to stay here again if given the choice.",3,2016,10,22
47,Would Stay Again!,"I had a great experience with this hotel. 
Let me start with the rooftop pool, WOW! The views are absolutely spectacular and give a new perspective of the city all from the comfort of the fabulous lounge chairs and cabanas. The bar was a little pricey but worth it!
The location was also very good with a metro stop literally right outside the door and a great healthy café with juices and salads around the corner. There is also a large shopping mall on the across the street with a huge selection of retail stores and restaurants on the rooftop. 
The conference space was also very nice and large enough to fit our group of over 100 people comfortably. 
My only complaint would be that the room was a little outdated and drab with lots of brown molding surrounding the walls. The shower also leaked terribly due to flimsy fabric curtains, so don't leave anything on the ground or it will get soaked. Despite this, I was able to fully recover from my jetlag with help from the quiet room and very dark curtains to keep the sunlight out.

Lastly, WATCH FOR PICKPOCKETERS in this area! A girl in my group had her purse stolen in the comfort of the hotel lobby after a man placed a map on the back of the couch as distraction and then took off.",4,2016,10,20
47,Great Location,"We stayed at this hotel for the second time, last time was 2 years ago. We booked because we were very happy with our room, the reception was very gracious, the room was roomy clean and comfortable. This hotel is located in the center of town accessible to restaurants, shopping center 1 block away and lots of amenities, bus metro and taxis are right outside our door. I would highly recommend this property.",4,2016,10,20

47,"Dirty, Bad Service","Arrived at the hotel and it took 3 hours to get the room.  The big surprise was waiting at the room, hair and roach.  Called reception and the guy did not even offer a solution.  he said wait till morning and speak to someone.  The only good thing is the view.....",1,2016,10,18
47,Pleasant stay,"Clean and comfortable rooms. Breakfast was very good, plenty of choice and lots of space. Staff were friendly and helpful. Poor bar was good although it was a shame it was only open until 9pm. Would definitely go back. ",4,2016,10,17
47,Business in Barcelona,"Not a good stay at the hotel. Great, central position with access to Barcelona at ones fingertips. Hotel however extremely 'tired' and in need of a complete facelift. Very disappointing and even more so because it's not cheap and because of an event the night after our last stay, the room price quadrupled. Breakfast poor - little selection and coffee appalling from some kind of commercial Tassimo machine. No ironing facilities in room. Staff good - as they should be - room cleanliness good.",2,2016,10,17
47,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,"Average business hotel.  Great location only steps away from a subway station.  Roof top pool and bar are very nice. Room was average for a business hotel.  The rooms do not have irons so there was no ability to refresh wrinked items.  The pass around iron was never available.  The safe in my room was broken, I did not request repair.",3,2016,10,17
47,Good location for Fira,"Hotel needs a refurb. Very old and run down in particular the bathrooms. Had a battle trying to get shower head to stay still every morning. Good location for Fira as only 3 metro stops away.
No concierge and always a long line of guests at reception.
When I come back to barcelona I would prefer a hotel closer to centre. 
Had a lovely roof bar. No table service anywhere in hotel. They seem to be short of staff. Could be a great hotel if they spent a little money doing it up over the next while and had a couple more staff to look after guests.
The hotel was clean.",3,2016,10,17
47,Great Location,"Hotel is located in great location with all public transportation available very close.  
Our room was viewing towards Tores Venecianes and Magic Fontain which provided amazing experience. Staff was polite but little bit cold. Not very friendly and cheerful.",4,2016,10,13
47,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,"Great location. Was centrally located and easy to use public transportation. Our room was spacious, clean and  had great views of the city. We loved the roof top pool/bar area. We were able to see even more of Barcelona from the vantage point. The service in the restaurant and pool area was excellent. We will definitely recommend this hotel to our friends and family                                                                 ",5,2016,10,11
47,Visit October,While the hotel overall was in fine condition I had problems with AC (full on or nothing) and a lack of iron/board in the room was not at the appropriate standard for a business hotel.  The location is a big plus for this property.  Easy access to the city.,3,2016,10,11
47,Value for money not there,"Better hotels nearby for this kind of money. Hotel did not excel on any one feature and amenities were below average. Specific examples are experienced significant challenge with noise, shower was poor and excercise room was tiny. Bar service very average as well.",3,2016,10,10
47,Thank you for our stay 25 to 29 Sept 2016,"We were very happy to return to hotel for my birthday this year.

6th floor room overlooking La Playa was perfect for fantastic view, especially of excellent firework display :)  

Great to be able to use pool (it was closed last time) though shame it did not open until 9am! :(  I want to swim before breakfast and not have it take up part of my day. 

There were few faults in the room: the safe was broken which we reported when we arrived but no one fixed it, even though we were told it would be fixed next morning :(  

The electric light switch had to be used carefully not to give a shock. It had a tendency to 'short' when switched on or off :( 

Main door to our room  badly making it difficult to open. From the damage to the door frame it had clearly been doing this for a long time :(  

The internal room door also could not be closed as it caught at the top:(

Excessive noise from neighbouring rooms and upstairs was intrusive at times, in particular we could hear conversations late into the night. Worse than this we could hear every detail of use of their toilet and feel we know their bowel habits much more than we would ever want to:(

The toilet flush system is also exceptionally loud and neighbours/ upstairs use of this woke me more than once :(

These things were disappointing in an otherwise beautiful hotel with extremely helpful and considerate staff.

Everyone was extremely helpful without exception. Andrea was especially helpful to me by helping me book tickets when we could not get lasting connection upstairs. Then found me email for me too and did everything to help get tickets booked - this was exceptional help on her part and she must be acknowledged and thanked

 the safe was broken which we reported when we arrived but no one fixed it, even though we were told it would be fixed next morning :(   didn't bother to mention the other issues as this was never addressed ( mentioned in our review)   Your survey asks 'male or female' but we are a couple with one of each your survey does not let us show this - booked in by male name",4,2016,10,10
47,Great hotel great view,"Really enjoyed my 3 day break at the hotel , room was nice and quiet and pool terrace exceptional with beds and loungers and great service. From the terrace you have a great view in the distance especially at night ",4,2016,10,10
47,Total disaster,"Stayed for three nights during my business trip. 

First of all the reception does not understand English.

They do not have iron in the rooms and they do not send to you because iron is never available. I had worn the shirts totally wrinkled during my meetings!

The room was dirty, smelling bad and very old that everything was worn out so i found myself thinking why I paid that much for this hotel.

I saw several people shouting at the reception therefore I believe it was not only my room with that low standards.

I totally do not recommend this hotel and I do not get how people rate it this high. ",1,2016,10,06
47,dont wast time in searching this is the best in barca !,"this is the best hotel in barca.
stay in the 6 fllor the best view .
every thing is in hand nad near .
the roof top pool is great .
servieces are great too.
stay at perium room this is the best for value .",5,2016,10,05
47,Poor effort,"2 stars from me, based on location (central and next to Metro station), but really disappointing. Four star hotel allegedly, but has poor quality food/drink for breakfast, very noisy hotel with wooden floors throughout & unfriendly check-in. As my visit was for a trade fair, I was obviously overcharged and found no relief from that pain from any of the services. Room wasn't cleaned well, shower was poor & there was mould on the bathroom walls. Really disappointed and certainly suggest you avoid it. ",2,2016,10,05
47,"Hotel ok, but could be better.","Hotel was ok. Room not a 4 star quality. Bathroom smelt quite bad/fowl! Room small! Good location, but could be too noisy, hence hard to sleep. 
Proper curtains could be used.
Internet quite slow and intermittent.
Staff helpful.",3,2016,10,04
47,Beautiful Rooftop Pool,"The hotel is in a great location within the city.  The rooms are nice, but not great.  The hotel serves a great breakfast in the morning.  The best part of the hotel is the rooftop pool.  There is also a gym to use.",4,2016,10,02
47,Very good business hotel,"Everything well organized, hygienic, friendly staff and beautiful roof top terrace. Could sit there every evening when possible. Room for improvement: attention of the staff at the reception and at the roof top bar. Roof top bar needs more staff and sufficient stock of red wine!",4,2016,10,01
47,Nice place,"I liked where is the hotel, and that s nice and clean and has pool (but i didn't have time for it). The breakfast was great but in my room was quite cold even if I was in the summer there. The personal is nice and knows English.",4,2016,10,01
47,Room amenities zero,The room was not bad but there was no iron in the room and no water boiler. We requested but they said it wasn't available at that time. The location of the hotel was perfect though and a walking distance from the arena mall,3,2016,10,01
47,Board Member ,"Excellent location close to the subway. Close to shopping and restaurants. 
Ok Roms. Bad wi-fi and Gym.
Nice bar on the roof ( pool and sun area ) with great view. Breakfast is ordinary. Conference area has in the -1 level.

47,Excellent Location,"Room perfect, lovely view.  Hotel staff very friendly and welcoming and speak very good english.  Location perfect.  Roof top pool a little cool but then the roof top bar made up for that !!  
Well worth a stay and will likely return myself.",5,2016,09,29
47,Over all experience,"already written in the previous pages. poor amenities and reception staff were not helpful and friendly
toiletries were not replenished , loud noise coming from outside, no slippers, no ironing board, no free  SAFE",2,2016,09,28
47,Perfect Homeymoon!,"This hotel is located directly and perfectly on the Plaza Espanya - you can get on the tour bus, local bus, airport bus and underground right outside the hotel so commuting is super easy! Opposite the hotel is the amazing art museum, which is both grand and beautiful looking! You will also find a huge indoor shopping building called Arena which has an amazing 360 view of the city from the roof top terrace along with a number of restaurants - perfect! 

One thing I would say is remember your hotel may be called Plaza Catalonia but your location is Plaza Espanya - when asking for directions this gets very confusing for locals as the biggest square attraction in Barcelona is the Plaza Catalonia! So remember to communicate this well if you get lost or need directions!!! 

We loved our stay - we had the perfect honeymoon ❤️",5,2016,09,27
47,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel, comfortable and clean. Staff very helpful and they spoke a whole range of languages. The roof top terrace and pool were an excellent bonus. The metro station is right outside the front of the hotel as well as a taxi rank. Only downside was there were no tea making facilities in the rooms and we expected this for a 4 star hotel. The breakfast was also excellent value for money. Would definitely stay there again.",4,2016,09,27
47,"Location, location, and architectural neighborhood","This hotel has nice rooms, good breakfast buffet, a few blocks walk to the high end shopping area.  The elevator is somewhat small, but there is an excellent central staircase with lovely wrought iron.  The art in the hotel is of Gaudi's building and other sites.  And near and dear to my heart good hot water pressure in the shower.",4,2016,09,26
47,City Holiday,"Short trip from the airport and in a very central location. MEtro station outside the hotel which was easy to negotiate. Plenty of shops and restaurants nearby. Breakfast was adequate but the hot food was nearly always cold.  Super roof terrace and pool with comfortable sun loungers.  
I would stay here again

47,Good hotel in Great location,"Stayed here during La Merce and had a great view of the plaza from the roof terrace which is modern and funky. Drink prices up there are reasonable too. I can imagine the noise from plaza espanya might be a bit much on a normal day, but we didn't mind as it was our front row seats for the festival and the hotel is well located for tube, bus and tourist bus services. Our rooms were large and spacious, but a little dated in design and in need of some redecoration. They certainly didn't match the roof terrace which is obviously where the money has gone. Bathrooms were nice enough but ours had a bad smell of drains which I would have complained about had we stayed more than one night, but for our short stay this was about the best we could ask for at the price we paid. Reception area was also a little dated and staff were attentive but not warm or friendly.",4,2016,09,26
47,HOTEL STAY,"Very Good place to stay with. Location is too good and the view from the rooms is excellent- check in counter has enough of place - start from the checkin procedure till check out i had a very good experience, breakfast was also good.",4,2016,09,26

47,Nice hotel in the main but.......,"Nice hotel in the main but there were a few points that dragged the hotel down.......

No safe at time of check in so felt like I would be safer carrying all our cash around with me which is not great in an area that suffers from pick pockets..... Asked again the following however and they gave me a lock barrel and key!

One of the waiters at the rooftop bar was purposefully overcharging people and getting away with it until I twigged on. He told me 16 euros for two baileys and ice when then menu said 14 euros, I know this isn't a lot but when the drinks are expensive anyhow it's not good. He also overcharged a friend by 5 euros so beware!

Lastly my girlfriend got stuck in the toilet as the latch would not move, I told the same guy about it, we got her out but he said he would fix it and then 3 hours later we heard other people had been getting locked in too........ (Clearly too busy stealing money from the paying guests)

Apart from that the rooms were fine and a nice hotel! 👍🏻",4,2016,09,25
47,great location!,"this hotel is simple yet perfect. the rooftop bar is stellar, great view and perfect to relax after work. seconds to metro station. constant taxis out front. easy to walk to other sites to sight see. wifi good. room was basic with limited view; but honestly if youre relying on youe hotel rooma view to experience barcelona yourw doing something  wrong. would stay here again",5,2016,09,25
47,poor money - quality balance,"nice location. great pool and bar on the upper floor of teh hotel. The room was very noisy even though I asked fr a quit one (travelling fo rbusiness) when I asked for another room , they gave me one 3 doors closer to the elevator, on teh same floor (6th) motivating that either way I will only be 2 more nights there. the towels in this new room were stained and unusable, had to wait 30min for someone to bring me new ones so I can shower.  the furniture in both rooms was very old and stained , it gave the look the room was not clean enough. teh same for the objects in the bathroom . the services they provide does don't comply with the 4 starts standard. I found the proce excessively high for what they offer!",3,2016,09,24
47,"Nice hotel, great location","Nice rooms, clean and up to date. Had a room on the 6th floor overlooking the inner courtyard which was ok and quiet.
Breakfast was fine, nothing remarkable about that. Staff was excellent, everyone I met was friendly and helpful.
Location is great with walking distance to Fira Barcelona and with numerous shops, restaurants and bars surrounding the hotel.",4,2016,09,23
47,Terrible services,"Terrible and unfriendly staff, order a laundry bag took 45 min, numerous phone calls and finally went down by myself. Nothing like a 4 star hotel at all. 

Also stinky room and very old furnitures. 

Will not recommend to anyone who wants a pleasant stay.",1,2016,09,23
47,great location and Pleasant stay,"Back to Barcelona definitely I will stay in  this hotel  
 The place overlooking the beautiful square , Plaza De Espania, the scene in the daytime very cool , and at night , if you are lucky to to get a seat around the pool  on the eight floor,  You will see the museum and colorful lighting and fountains . Enchanting view you will never forget. 
Transportation is very close, there are cafes and a variety of services around the hotel. 
I advise all my friends  to stay at this hotel . The Working Group at the reception very  cooperative , they serve you always with a smile on their faces

47,Very alergen cleaning products,"The hotel is very well located, it has a nice bar on the 8th floor terace. The rooms are oldish and they use low quality very alergen cleaning products. If you arrive in a busy period the prices are well above the level of the hotel",3,2016,09,22
47,Ok hotel a bit off,Room was ok and clean. Rooftop pool and area was nice and had a good view over parts of the city. Breakfast was crowded and noisy. The location is a bit off so need a taxi ride to more central areas or the beach.,3,2016,09,20
47,Needs work!!,"At first glance this hotel is First Class, perhaps it,s the giddiness of the local flavour, it is right in the center of an amazing area. Then after staying for a few hours it starts to settle in this Hotel needs work. Underneath its lustre It is getting old, you start to notice the flaws in the rooms, little things but you are left with a feeling of something being covered up. Then there is the scam to be put in a room with a view. The price list for upgrades is right on the Check-In counter, this didn,t click until we got to our room and saw that we had nothing but a shaft outside our window. So back down and amazingly after 30 Euro a room with a view comes available. It was a stunning view though. The Security is terrible, the Security guy a Manikin of a Gorilla and very likely looks away when anyone who wants to walks in off the street with easy access all of the Tours luggage left outside their doors early in the morning. All front entrance doors are wide open, most other Hotels lock the side front doors with only the revolving door open. The Buffet Breakfast was great as it was in every hotel we stayed in during our Tour of Spain.",3,2016,09,20
47,Great hotel with great location,"I was a bit worried about staying here after reading some of the reviews, but shouldn't have been. Booked this hotel for a 5 night stay. We had a room on the 6th floor with amazing views over Plaza Espanya & the fountains at night time. Air Con was great, sometimes we had to switch it off as it was too cold. Clean towels and bedding every day. We didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment. The pool area was my fav part, amazing views & a lovely area. Great location with the airport bus stop & a metro station right outside the hotel. Would recommend this hotel.",4,2016,09,20
47,"Excellent location, wonderful pool","I wouldn't hesitate to re-book here; the pool area is as good as it looks on the website photographs and we used it every afternoon.  We never had trouble getting sun beds or a cabana.  The views from up there are wonderful too- especially at night when the fountains are on along the opposite street.

However I think they may be in the process of refurbing rooms, as ours (333) was a bit of a disappointment. It was okaaaaay, but a bit tired. Our bathroom was ridiculous- the shower head was over the long wall of the bath, not one end, and was quite powerful. So the shower water blew the curtain (I HATE shower curtains) out of the bath and water gushed all over the floor.  So, ask for a refurbished room.

Breakfast here is really pricy but literally next door (to your left if you have your back to the hotel) is a lovely cafe where we had breakfast and delicious coffee every morning.

The hotel is on a roundabout with a Metro Station, a stop for the tourist bus and the first stop on the A2 bus from the airport, so even though it isn't smack in the middle of touristville it's an excellent location and despite the traffic our room was quiet.

We used the Metro every day, and if you plan to as well buy the 10-trip ticket for €9.95. Cost effective, saves the hassle of buying tickets for every trip, plus two of you can share one.

Barcelona is a wonderful city and this is a great base to explore it from, just get an updated room and eat elsewhere!

47,1 night but not enough,"stayed in this hotel on the last night of our trip (sept 17th 2016), hotel in a great location, check in v.easy, Irene on reception was excellent and very helpful with the maps and info, English was excellent too, room wasn't ready but she took our bags no problem, and gave us a welcome drink in the bar while we waited.  Bar and pool area was very nice, but there were too many sun-beds with towels and no bodies, we were sitting at the bar for about 90mins while waiting on our room and nobody came to the beds, and there were people around who would have loved them.  Otherwise this area is nice for a cold beer/glass of wine and city watching.  We were in room 707, lovely room, very spacious, bed was firm but comfortable, pillows a bit too soft for my liking, but I cant have everything.  Robes and slippers were a nice touch.  We stayed on a BnB basis, and the breakfast was lovely, great selection of pastries, cereals, and the egg station was worth the wait...  We had a late flight back, and again reception took our bags no problem while we did our final bit of exploring.  I love this city, 3rd time in 13 months, first time in Catalonia hotel, but wont be the last.",5,2016,09,19

The rooftop pool and bar area on the 8th floor was another highlight. The rooms were spacious, clean and the shower was decent - safe and fridge in room. Double bed was huge and pretty comfy. Only really had to deal with staff when we checked in and out. The woman that served us was pleasant. Metro station and bus stop right outside the hotel. Wouldn't be a huge walk to other places of interest as well. The wifi was free and pretty reliable. Would stay here again.",5,2016,09,19

47,Horrible Room Service,"I ordered a room service from the Japanese restaurant of the Hotel.
When I was ordering on the phone, I asked what the assorti sushis and maki plate included (type of Maki filling...). I was told that I had to ""wait and see"" because she didn't know.
The food came late and without soya sauce for the sushi and chop stick ... I asked the waitress if she could bring some ( my husband explained her in Spanish).. She did not know what it was and once she understood I was told that it would take around 20 minutes to come because she was busy. 
I had to call the reception 3 times to get some sauce quicker. At the beginning they told me I had to call back room service.

For a 4 stars hotel, in a suite ... that s pretty chaotic service.",1,2016,09,13
47,Check in issues,We've reached the hotel around 9:00am after 9 hours flight with our lettel dughter.. our check-in was 2: 00pm but we were tired so we asked for early check-in.. it wasnt possible and they didn't offer us any other options.. after we waiting until 2:00pm the room wasn't ready.. we had to wait another 30 minutes.. aftet going back and forth to the reception we were able to get our room.. very poor management..,3,2016,09,13
47,Excellent stay in Barcelona,"Good position, location for airport excellent. Pool area good. Breakfast could have been warmer. Good choice. Staff very amendable, we were upgraded to suite which had brilliant position and view. Would definitely return",5,2016,09,12
47,Amazing Hotel,"Spent five nights in the wonderful Catalonia Plaza Hotel returning last weekend.  This hotel is amazing, only 15 minutes by Aerobus from the El Prat Airport and located on the very busy Plaza Espana.  This was a great location for the week with La Ramblas only a €5-€7 taxi ride away.  The hotel itself is very busy however the staff on reception were very friendly and helpful.  The room was perfect, on the 4th floor with the most wonderful view of Plaza Espana, the Museum and fountains.  The highlight of this stay was the wonderful pool and bar on the 8th floor where the view was stunning.  You can see Sagrada Familia, the sea, the cable cars all from this floor.  The loungers are very comfortable (although be up early to get one!) with a great lively atmosphere all day long.  Hotel towels are also readily available and you can grab however many you need on the way in). We didn't eat breakfast there but had lunch one day which was very nice.  The drinks are quite expensive (€9 for two orange juices) but worth it while spending the day lounging by the pool.  At night the bar was great fun with a lovely atmosphere and we ended up finishing up every night having a cocktail or two.  There are two great cafes just outside the hotel one on the left and one on the right.  We had breakfast each morning in the one on the left (as you come out of Hotel) which was very reasonably priced and also good for lunch.  All in all my stay at the Catalonia Hotel was excellent so much so that I have booked again for next July and will keep returning to this hotel any time I am in Barcelona!",5,2016,09,12
47,Doesn't deserve 4*,"Stayed here last week, room is nice, bathroom needs some TLC. No tea or coffee/little kettle in room. The view from my room was nice. Staff could do with a customer care course in my opinion. Breakfast a bit disappointing. Location is good. 
Overall just an average hotel, probably wouldn't go back",3,2016,09,12
47,nothing special. very crowded and loud,it looked better on the Website than it was in reality. very loud in the breakfast room. furthermore not a professional Service at the breakfast rooms. pool was very small and too warm. no space to lie. external people are allowed at the pool.... standard of bathroom was poor. general the hotel is not state-of-the-art. the Location alone can't balance all that. please see what I wrote before already.,3,2016,09,12
47,Awesome!,Our 2 day stay was perfect from check in to check out everybody was friendly and helpful!!!!!! Location as well is perfect right infron of the magic fountain. Taxi cans are always available outside the hotel. Theres restaurants and coffeeshop outside the hotel too! ,5,2016,09,12
47,Infrastructure,The A/C did not cool at first. Reported at 4:30PM. Follow up at 5:30PM. Second follow up 10:30PM. Fixed at 12:30 mid night.  Ups and down in temperature on both nights. Problems opening the door Room 621.  Had to push the door hard to close. Metro stop is in front of hotel's entrance.  This hotel us huge. The buffette bacon and eggs were cold. Front desk was helpful and willing to show to explore Barcelona.,3,2016,09,12
47,Comfortable launching pad for all of Barcelona,The great attribute of this hotel is that the airport bus stops right outside the front door (6 euro fare) and there is an adjacent underground stop (Espanya) which means the rest of Barcelona is an easy 4 or 7 day pass away. The train to Montserrat also leaves from the Plaza. The Plaza Espanya has the old bull fighting ring and the Palace Nationale which houses the Museum of Catalonian Art. At night there is a spectacular music and fountain display in front of the the Palace. The hotel itself is comfortable and the breakfasts in the morning reasonably priced. The staff are very helpful and speak very good English.,4,2016,09,11
47,This hotel needs some TLC maintenance,Our room number 228 had water leaking from the ceiling some of the woodwork is rotted away.  Our toilet isn't even bolted to the floor.  The beds are some of the hardest we've ever experienced on the Iberian Peninsula. One third to half of the TV channels do not even work.   The hotel breakfast is good it did have something unique and had an omelette bar. The location is very nice it's next to one of the old bull rings  that is now a shopping center and it's also very close to the magic fountains. It does have a nice pool on the seventh floor that's outside in the bar with a nice overlook view. ,3,2016,09,11
47,Pleasantly Surprised,When booking the hotel I was not expecting such a high quality / clean / spacious hotel. The last time I came to Barcelona my room was tiny and so was the hotel. The hotel staff was very helpful and the rooms were very large and very clean. The rooftop bar was definitely the icing on the cake - the rooftop view is amazing!!!! One of the best in the city. The hotel is close to the metro station and conveniently placed around great placed to eat / shop. When I come back to Barcelona I will definitely be staying at this hotel.,5,2016,09,09
47,Lovely stay,Great staff at this hotel would definetly come back. The drinks were pretty pricey but the pool bar staff were lovely and made the stay more enjoyable. The only issue we had was that the room didn't have an iron which was pretty annoying. We had to request one every day and were on a waiting list for around an hour most times. Other than that great hotel. ,4,2016,09,09
47,Unfriendly place,"Old hotel with darkness room and an unpleasant smell in the room, very uncomfortable pillow. No slippers in the room. Horrible breakfast! If required some information at the front desk they give you wrong answers. They don't know a think about the town. It was maybe the worse hotel I ever stayed in my journeys",2,2016,09,08
47,Amazing,"Amazing view with extremely helpful and friendly staff. Very clean and the rooftop pool and bar was exceptional. We didn't eat at the restaurant. However, the food from the bar was great and the burger was one of the best things I ate whilst on holiday.",5,2016,09,05
47,Comfortable hotel in good location,"Friendly staff, good rooms (city view), good location in relation to airport. Easy to get to city centre, good restaurants and shopping around hotel too. 
Food by the pool could be better. 
I'll be back.",4,2016,09,05
47,good location but service does not match,the location is great if only the service could match this. The hotel seems to be understaffed with slow service at breakfast and long check in times. services are cut back to a minimum - eg no coffee in rooms and slow wifi ,2,2016,09,05
47,Simple yet Distinctive.,"The location is very good and convenient. It took me less than 10 minutes by taxi  from airport to hotel. Placa Espàna. The beautiful musical fountain (only happens once or twice a week) Mon juic, Fira, Arena shopping centre, Sants rail station for intercity express all within 1to 4  minutes walking distance. Lots of eateries around. The blue aeroport shuttle (paid) will drop and pickup right in front of the hotel entrance.  How better can it be. It's a no smoking policy at the hotel. But the rooms are comfortable. No tea coffee facility was provided in my room. But i believe if you really need one you can get it. The bath room was simple yet comfortable. The breakfast was not so lavish or great. Yet if you are not fussy you can enjoy it especially because they do have a live egg station. The staff at the front desk all speak english and are very friendly and  helpful. Wifi is complimentary. The 7th floor has separate lift access and is their premium rooms floor.  I was quite satisfied with my stay.",4,2016,09,04
47,Watch your luggage!!,"I was at this hotel as part of a Globus tour. One in our party had her luggage taken before it could be loaded on the bus. There is no security at this hotel. Anyone can walk in off the busy street, with a metro station right in front. None of the elevators or doors to the pool deck require a room key to gain entry. Also, there don't seem to be any sensors on the elevator doors. They will close right on you. Beware!! On the good side, the rooms are very nice & the breakfast is great.",3,2016,09,04
47,"Good location, horrid everything else","Worst 4 star hotel i have been in.
Only positive is the view and breakfast

1) Room is of a 1-2 star standard, small, old, room has 2 power outlets (TWO), one in bathroom other on desk, nothing next to the bed...
2) Bathroom, rusty bathtub, broken old showerhead
3) Bathroom stinks of sewage (room service regulary closes all drains to hide the smell)
4) Front desk manners... first they try to charge me something i didnt drink at the bar (i wasnt at the bar), the lady is intense in proving to me that i am wrong
5) Front desk manners again... after checkout, when picking up luggage the guy working at front desk after 2 minutes of looking cassualy tells me he cant find my luggage and dissapears in the back. I try to explain to the gorilla security that i am in a hurry and ask if i can help the guy out. Gorilla waves something, and i understand that as a yes, clearly it wasnt since reception guy started yelling at me that this is not my home and i cant go where i please....",1,2016,09,01
47,Real affordable luxury and stunning location,"Friendly staff, great location, really classy hotel.
The fascia outside and the reception don't do this hotel justice as the rooms and pool / bar / views are magnificent.
Right next to underground and taxi / bus / tour bus stops outside
Great aircon (which you need in Barcelona !!)
We had a corner room so TWO great views !!
Breakfast good and served until quite late.
Overall excellent",5,2016,08,30
47,Barcelona stay,Most of it was good just took a long time to get room ready..and last night there I was approached by a lady charging for sexual favors...the location is great and rooms are very nice so overall had a good stay,3,2016,08,29
47,"Average hotel, great location","We were group of 4 families and stayed here in last week on june. Just infront of the hotel someone barged into our bus and ran away with one of ladies handbag. We asked the security guard and hotel staff to help us with police, they were least bothered. Even hotel is very average. Average quality rooms. Location is very good. ",3,2016,08,29
47,Will not go back again,"Over all experience in this hotel was ok, but the room is terrible.  Never slept such a hard mattress, the pillow is so flat, and they don't give you enough blankets.  Shower is overly power and the shower curtain is too short and you have to stand at a certain to make sure you don't flood the bathroom......the room door wouldn't shut properly, unless you slam it really hard.  Overall, this hotel needs a lot of improvement!",2,2016,08,29
47,Excellent hotel!,"We booked a room with a view over la Plaza. Wonderful! View incredible. The magic fountain was just across the road. Wonderful bar/swimming pool facility at night! Room was amazing. Tea/coffee maker which you don't get in all Spanish hotels. Big long bathtub in the bathroom to relax in after a long and tiring day of sightseeing plus shower. Underground just outside, airport shuttles as well. Queen size bed. Slippers. All kinds of freebies. Quiet bedroom.  Free bowl of fruit. Breakfast was excellent. Hot or cold breakfast stations although hot food not so hot.
Downside: busy reception but nice friendly staff.
Very bad room service. Asked for something and we waited for an hour for it to come.
I would recommend but booking the right room with the right view!",5,2016,08,28
47,Poor hotel in great location,"Lets start with the good things. The terrace is absolutely lovely to spend a relaxing day, Although the views only nice from one side.  The back of the hotel overlooks a run down area.   The location is good with local transport with the metro and plenty of restaurants on the doorstep.
We booked a double room as it was a surprise holiday for my birthday, and although some would say it was not expensive, we certainly expected more for our money for a 4* hotel.  The view from our first room was absolutely dreadful with a falling down building with graffiti over it, and turned out to be twin rooms.  So to be fair the hotel did move us to another room on the sixth floor, (still not a great view) only to have an awful sewerage smell as soon as walked in, and this didn't disappear until we raised it to the hotel, who looked surprised and said they would sort it out either later that day or in the morning (the smell of sewerage is not something I want to sleep in).  After going back to reception that evening they sent a maid up with air freshener and drain cleaner, which did remove the smell of sewerage, only to have the smell of tobacco constantly. 
When we run a bath, the water was absolutely filthy and therefore we emptied and tried again, but to no luck, still just as dirty.
This is also not what I would class as a spa hotel, the only spa it has is beauty rooms and a sauna, other than the terrace, which is full of children (to be expected) but not what I would class a spa to be (peaceful and tranquillity).",2,2016,08,28
47,Well to relax and I got stressed about stuff," Didn't get what I booked 
 Room was late and  dirty 
 Breakfast staff was asleep majority of the item missing ! 
 Kids jumping allover in the pool , and pool is closing at 8pm joke !
 Asking for direct directions staff is sending you around like a proper tourist :/",2,2016,08,24
47,Overnight stay,One night stay for the football match. Our room had no view (this should be mention when you are booking) and smelt of the sewage. This was a shame we where looking forward to out 4 star hotel. For the rest it was fine!,3,2016,08,24
47,Very good experience,"Our stay was really perfect
Everything is around you , taxis near the door 24 hour ,, metro station is next door
Staff very friendly and helpful
The most beautiful roof top in the city
Just need a kettle in the room",5,2016,08,23
47,Tired hotel in ok location,"The rooms we stayed in was terrible. Old decor with mould in the bathtub. The roof top bar was attractive yet the quality of drinks were very poor and overpriced. The reception was extremely hectic like an airport terminal at times. We had to wait a long time to check in and out. Overall I would not recommend this hotel, although the Barcelona as a whole was amazing.",2,2016,08,23
47,Good location but not family orientated. Check in very slow,"Hotel is perfectly located for getting around & for the airport bus.

It has a great view from the pool / bar. But kids are not catered for at the pool as its pretty much a bar & crowded - more for young people to hang out/ party.

Check in experience was awful - such a long queue and inefficient and a take it or leave it attitude.

Room was ok but was surprised that the 3rd bed had no mattress protector just a sheet - didn't seem a clean option give multiple guests",3,2016,08,22
47,Dinner was delicious ,"Having just watched Barcelona beat Betis 6-2 we moved away from the stadium to eat.

Wandering in for dinner we all felt rather underdressed, we were however warmly welcomed.

Having then gone off piste with the menu we still received superb attention.

The food was delicious and the bill surprised us as it was so reasonable.

Well done to the team working here.

Go try it  

We're coming back :) ",5,2016,08,21
47,Not worth the price,"For the high price of this hotel I was expecting a place with high quality and standard. But it's wasn't. The hotel is quote big and it looks like they can't really manage all the customers at peak hours. I had to wait more than one hour to check-in. 
The roof terrace / swimming pool is great with a nice view and nice atmosphere but it's really busy at peak time . And there is no direct access from the bedroom lift to the terrace. You have to go downstairs and use another lift. 
This hotel desserves a 3 stars not 4 and there is better hotel around with a better value for our money.
The location is great just next to the tube station and on the Placa d'Espanya.",2,2016,08,21
47,Good start for our vacation,We stayed as a family for the first night of our vacation. Thanks to the friendly staff at the reception it was a good start because they helped us to get a lost item back. The view from the bar is great. The room and everything else was fine.,4,2016,08,20
47,Did not have a good experience,"We did not have a good experience.  We are newlyweds on Europe honeymoon trip.  After checking in, we were given a 6th floor non-smoking room, which we were delighted to have.  However, upon entering the room, a strong smell of tobacco permeated through the room, causing us great discomfort.  We immediately notified the front desk, and they told us that someone would be up in 5-10 minutes to check our room for us.  Thus we went back upstairs to wait.

We waited over an hour with no response in the hallway, because we could not enter the room.  After waiting for so long, I went back down to front desk to follow up and tell them that we've been waiting an hour.  We were then assigned another room on the 2nd floor, which was much appreciated after a day's train travel.  However, this was a smoking hall, and the halls reeked of tobacco.  We endured it, as we were tired and just wanted to settle into a room. The room was unremarkable, especially because our window view was completely overshadowed by the ""tent"" looking structure that covers the dining area.

A little later, we found that our bathroom door did not close due to wood warping from what looked like water damage.  We were informed that they would give us another room first thing tomorrow morning, but at the moment it was impossible because there was a Beyonce concert and the hotel was booked, which was understandable.  However we went a full day without any follow up. Thus I came to inquire the front desk again the morning after, and we were then informed that they will check the room.  A couple hours later, a technician came and fixed the door by shaving/chipping the wood off of the door frame.  While we appreciate the work, the wood shavings were left in the bathroom for us, which made it seem like a sloppy job, although the bathroom door was functional once again.  In addition we had to continually deal with the tobacco smelling hallways, which irritated our lungs after 2 days of staying.

The customer service was very friendly, but ultimately we didn't feel we were treated well for a 4-star hotel's standards.  We do want to mention that the breakfast option we purchased was superb and probably the best hotel breakfast we had throughout our whole Europe trip, but that does not make up for the lack of quality we had regarding our rooms.  Also, the hotel has a great location next to the metro.  

We were not given any compensation or extras for our inconveniences, so we did not feel comforted overall",2,2016,08,19
47,Great Location,"A bit dated compared to other hotels I stayed at while in Spain. The location however was excellent as it had access to the metro and airport shuttle bus. Great views of Venetian Towers and former bullring. Quick walk to the magic fountain. The last morning I did encounter a problem with the power in the room. Despite having the key card in slot, I had to dress and pack in darkness. It was not worth notifying since I had to depart early morning. ",4,2016,08,18
47,Zenos Lemis,"A disgrace , dirty , rude employees , terrible bathroom , I had 2 rooms booked and I arrived at 11:00 am at the hotel. I was informed the rooms were going to be ready at 14:00, I returned at 16:30 to  find out my rooms were not ready. When I asked why they told me the hotel is too big and it takes more time, When I asked for the manager , a lady appeared to say I could not see him and when I complained she banged the reception door on my face leaving a rude colleague there to inform me that if I did not wait they would ask their security to have me removed  from the hotel. The bathrooms were dirty (pictures attached) my daughters bed broke whilst my daughter (aged11) was sleeping, Not recommended to anyone visiting Barcelona.",1,2016,08,15
47,"Great location, good quality hotel.","First of all this review is based on our booking which was for an upgraded room...you get what you pay for after all!
Check in was easy, we were in the 7th fall & had a view towards the fountains overlooking the square - no balcony (I don't any of the rooms have).
The room was a good size, the largest bed I've ever seen, fabulous shower with a drench &/or normal head. A separate toilet & very good basin area.  Dressing gowns & slippers were useful too.
A free to use safe, payable mini bar etc.
The hotel gym is small & basically equipped with just a few pieces of kit (bike, cross, treadmill) some free weights (Dumbbells up to 10kg) an exercise mat & ball - sufficient for a mini workout.
The roof terrace pool was lovely, beds, chairs & stools - not packed but you will have to wait your turn.  The pool bar was typically priced for a hotel of this stature but with great views especially in the evening it was lovely.
I would definitely recommend & stay here again...but as always pick your room style wisely.
The location means there will be some traffic noise with your windows open, but you can't have a central location in a vibrant city without a little compromise.",5,2016,08,14
47,Wonderful Stay,"Just spent a wonderful week in Barcelona, the hotel was excellent and in a great location. Staff on reception were extremely helpful, room was very clean and the bed and pillows were  most comfortable. The roof top pool was idyllic with a fantastic view over the city. I will definitely stay here again and would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff for being so friendly and helpful.",5,2016,08,10
47,Awful hotel,"We visited Barcelona for the first time. The city is amazing but this hotel not. Everything begins with the arriving the staff of the reception are extremely impolite, liars and cheats. The room looks nothing like the pictures.The destruction at the hotel begin with the broken front door and the broken door of the room. The piccolo is just like the statues of La Rambla street, he just doing nothing.The room smells awful.  The waiters of the roof-top bar are extremely impolite. The breakfast was very poor and every day was similar. The worst thing is that the price is extremely high for that what you become. The only advantage of the hotel is the location. It is near a metro and bus station and also the hop on hop off bus and aerobus stops are near the hotel.",1,2016,08,10
47,Bad customer service in a nice infrastructure,"The hotel is in a nice location and is very convenient to reach: metro station and airport shuttle infront of the hotel door, and plenty of taxis available any time in plaza de espania. Also, the pool has a beatiful view. The facility is overall nice.
However, I had several problems with the way the hotel is managed:
- my booking resulted to be for 4 nights, while I booked only for 1 night. Good I had the confirmation with me. No apology from the person at checkin.
- the room was not clean as I would expect. I found hair all around the room
- at check in they insistingly asked for my email, which resulted in a nearly-spam series of emails from them with promotions I will never benefit of (how many times they expect an average tourist to go back to the same place after not even one week??). Unsubscribing was not straightforward.

For the same price, there are better options in Barcelona",2,2016,08,10
47,Nice,"Nice location; 15 minutes to city center or beach by metro. 
Nespresso machine made my mornings, nice minibar. 
Big balcony for tanning or coffer break or just sit out. Free wifi is also a must these days and it was awesome. 
Multilingual staff, efficient and welcoming.",4,2016,08,08
47,Hotel with potential,"Good, professionell and friendly reception in the reception, fantastic breakfast, among the best I have been served in Spain! Very neat and well-maintained outdoor pool with a bar and grill for lunch - but too small for all visitors, unfortunately.
And then we have the possibility til improvement, lack smiling and service minded staff - a little education and training would enhance the entire experience! And unfortunately, it was too much long black hairs in the hotel room to be pleased with städningn!",4,2016,08,08
47,Not a place to go on a family trip,"The location of the hotel is very convenient for visits but I would not recommend the hotel for a family trip. There is no charm at all in the rooms and in the lobby, it was impossible to swim in the pool (and to even sit around the pool) and there are a lot of groups of noisy (and sometimes drunk) adults. The staff is very friendly and helpful.",2,2016,08,08
47,20th Wedding Anniversary,"Having booked an overnight stay to celebrate our 20th Wedding Anniversary and visit our son who is attending the European Bar School, we were full of great anticipation. Unfortunately, we were badly let down by this hotel and lost almost half a day waiting on our suite being made ready. If booking a suite here DO NOT accept room 801 if you want to sleep as it is situated beside the elevator and next door to the pool bar which is open until 2am.",1,2016,08,08
47,Not a 4*,"We stayed here for 4 nights after carefully reading reviews on hotels I was disappointed with this choice. Most of the staff are rude, terrible service. No iron or kettle in the rooms they are very basic. The roof top pool is lovely but too busy so there was never space to sunbath or swim. Also the food was terrible & expensive, we ate there once after our experience. The fountains are beautiful & well worth a visit, other than that there isn't a great deal near the hotel so you spend an awful lot of time on the underground going from a to b. I would say the hotel is more like a 3*",2,2016,08,08
47,Poor service and very slow reception staff ,"Arrived at the hotel at about 10.30am. We were told that we could check in straight away but would have a room with two single beds. Or we could wait till 14.00 and then have a proper double bed. So we decided to wait till 14.00. We left our bags and went and explored and sat by the pool. No sun loungers even at this time. 
We returned slightly early hoping a room would be ready at 13.15. We qued for near enough 15 minutes to be told no the rooms not ready. So we went and got some lunch and came back. 
At 14.00 we returned, qued for another 20 minutes. We were then asked if we wanted a room with two single beds or a double bed. After we had checked in we then had to wait ten minutes to collect our bags which had been left in safe keeping when we could not check in. The staff in this hotel have no urgency and are extremely unhelpful. The reception staff need some training and some urgency it would seem. Totally unprepared for check in times and extremely slow. 

When we eventually got to the room it was an average size and of modest decoration. The bed was very hard with only two pillows. There was no tea or coffee facility. The air conditioning worked but didn't seem to make the room any cooler. The mini bar was stocked but we did not use this. 
There was no iron in the room so we called reception for an iron and ironing board. About half an hour later a maid dropped an iron off but told us there were no ironing boards. So we had to iron on a towel that was on the table. Each day the iron was taken away by the cleaners and we rang again in the evening for it again and each time waiting half an hour. 

Breakfast was good. A large choice of food and decent quality. 

The roof top pool was one of the reasons we picked the hotel. It was a nice size but not enough sun loungers. Unless you got there for 9am when the pool opened there was no sun loungers left. Drinks at the bar are very pricey. 

The gym is small. There were also children running around with what appeared no parent around. The staff clearly could see what was going on but did nothing to remove these children from the area. Unsafe and totally annoying. 

Overall I would rate this hotel a 3/5. Needs some training of the reception to make it more efficient at busy periods. Room basic although you could pay to upgrade to better rooms. Pool nice but need to get there early to get a bed. 

",3,2016,08,08
47,Bad service,"Our first room was terrible. The room was dirty, sink was clogged and hair dryer was not working. The bed is very uncomfortable and makes squeaky noise. The next morning we went down to the reception (stod in the awful long line for 30 min ) and was told to come back around 2 pm to get a new room. Instead of sightseeing and exploring the city, we were stuck in the hotel just to get a new room. Finally when we got a new room, this time with a nice view, the a/c was not working and the bed is as uncomfortable as the last bed. I told the manager twice about the a/c and he promised to fix the problem but that did not happen. We stayed at this hotel for 6 nights and for 5 nights we had an a/c that was barely working. They also charge an additional fee to use the safe and an iron. I guess the only good thing here is the pool area and that is it. WE WILL NEVER STAY AT THIS HOTEL AGAIN !",1,2016,08,07
47,A short break for my family ruined by aggressive security.,"The Catalonia Plaza must have the best roof top pool with amazing views across the city of Barcelona.    That's a memory that will stay.   
But for a 4* international hotel the staff are sadly lacking in customer relations skills.
We found the large suited security gentlemen   verbally aggressive when my daughter took her own plastic water bottle to the pool.   She was singled out twice and was confronted by 3 Security guys !   We were told that only food and drink purchased at the pool restaurant was allowed.    When we asked to speak to the Manager and that we would comment on Tripadvisor  they backed off.    (We noticed the Spanish and French were not challenged when they arrived with their Subway food and drinks). 
We did try the pool restaurant twice for lunch but the service was slow and the food very poor value compared to the excellent little restaurants a few steps from the hotel.   
Our room was spacious and clean  and the AC good but the ventilation system in the bathroom didn't work.    
There was a safe in the room but we were told all the keys had been lost !   
We love Barcelona and take regular breaks to 4* hotels in the city but this is one we will not be returning to.",2,2016,08,06
47,Terrible service!! We felt picked on by hotel staff!!,One the first day around the pool I ask for a menu for food and was told they didn't have one and they couldn't say when food would be available. As other guests had food with them from outside we went and got something from the local shop and ate it around the pool. The next day we did the same and a waiter came and aggressively to us to go to our room and eat our sandwich as it was not allowed to have anything even water from outside. Then he called 2 security guards who also had a go at us in front of all the guests which was really intimidating for me and my 75 year old mother. On our last day they started on me again for having a bottle of water with me. We continually saw guests with pizzas and subway sandwiches around the pool which had come from outside. At not point where they being treated in the same way. It totally  ruined our holiday. They don't provide a water fountain so they expect you to pay 3 Eros for water each time even though its's 28 degrees! There's not enough sun beds and lots of guest  plonk there towels on beds early in the morning  then Leave  and go off to breakfast. When I did this once on our last day to go and check out I was accosted again by a suited security guard who had a go at me again saying I wasnt allowed to leave my towel to secure a deck chair. I'm still fuming from the treatment of my family. We feel totally picked on. When my mother went to complain and ask to see the manager they just didn't care. The food they provide around the pool is sub standard and really expensive. We tried it twice as we felt we had no choice. If you leave the pool area for lunch outside you'll have nowhere to sit when you come back. I won't be going back. There are plenty of other hotels in better locations with roof pools! Also the vent wasn't working in out bathroom and the left broke down which I got stuck in which was not pleasant! Location is rubbish so we had to get taxis everywhere. There is a good shopping centre across the road though.,1,2016,08,04
47,Great hotel,"Hotel Catalonia was a great choice for my stay in this great city of Barcelona! Clean, affordable and luxurious I would recommend this hotel to anyone. The spa was very clean and relaxing and the rooftop pool and bar was very romantic, not to mention the amazing view!",5,2016,08,03
47,Ruined our trip,"Arrived to check in, and were informed we were unable to stay due to ""water issues"" and we would be transferred immediately. We later found out that actually the hotel had managed to over book...

The next day we returned and they managed to ""fit us in"". The room wasn't anything like in the pictures and needed updating.

The only good thing at the hotel is the rooftop pool, however the sunbeds are limited and the drinks were overpriced.

Awful experience staying in this hotel, didn't even receive an apology for mucking us around.

Not recommended.",1,2016,08,01
47,Don't waste your time.,"We arrived at the hotel to get told by the rather incompetent lady on the front desk that due to ""water issues"" we could no longer stay in the hotel, without further explanation or even an apology we got put in a taxi and moved to another hotel. 
The staff at the second hotel were lovely and I couldn't fault them at all, but that hotel just isn't what we wanted. Obviously, otherwise we would have just booked that one in the first place. 
After endless taxi's to and from the hotels we finally found out that the ""water issues"" was in fact a complete lie and that they'd just over booked us. Eventually after wasting nearly a whole day of our short 3-day trip, we were able to move back to the original hotel that we booked (Catalonia plaza). 
To top it off, when we finally got to our room, it was not as it appears on the website, and the beds were so old and uncomfortable, everything needed updating. The safe was broken, one of the lights was nearly hanging off of the wall, and the aircon barely worked at all.
We booked this hotel based on how much we liked the rooftop pool, and to be honest, that was the only half decent part about this hotel.
Thoroughly disappointed. 
Will not be returning.",1,2016,07,31
47,Good location,"The positives: Great location: you have a key Metro stop just outside the hotel, shopping, restaurants, and the Sants train station is only a short walking distance away. Some rooms are better than others, and the more you pay the better room you get. However they are all modern, clean, and confortable.The Roof Top is one of the BEST in the world, not to be missed. Two very good restaurants on site. The negatives: the hotel's location also attracts pickpockets that are so common in Barcelona. The hotel has a security guard but could install cameras in public places to deter the offenders. Lastly, the hotel is popular with large tours, if you are an individual traveler and arrive at the same time, go get a drink, relax and come back in 5 minutes after the masses have cleared.",4,2016,07,28
47,Fab hotel in an excellent location,"We cannot praise this hotel and it's wonderful staff highly enough. We spent 2 nights there prior to our Mediterranean cruise.  Nothing was too much trouble - they even allowed us to leave our luggage in their facilities when we returned as we had a few hours to kill before our flight home. Loved their rooftop pool bar with its fantastic views and great summer vibe. Bullring shopping centre is over the road, metro entrance right outside as is airport shuttle bus stop.  We visited from Mon to Wed so unfortunately did not experience the dancing fountains which were a 5 min walk away. We will return though!",5,2016,07,27
47,Fantastic breakfast & centrally located,"First visit to Barcelona- Came for the MOTO gp- Euro-bus (From airport and back) pick up and drop off in front of hotel Also within walking distance to station where you catch the train to MONTMELO for the MOTO GP.. City Tours also within 100m.Lots of bar/restaurants situated around the area  especially ""The Family Bar"" which serves cheap 'TAPAS"" but quality and beer just 4 blocks away! Rooms clean and tidy but lack maintenance as 3 of the lights didn't work. Best Buffet breakfast we had in Barcelona-Stunning views from pool /bar area on top of roof. Alcohol a bit pricey there.",4,2016,07,26
47,Almost 5 stars,"My wife and I had a lovely long weekend in Barcelona staying here. We had a large room on the top floor with views of Plaza Espanya and its a great location in that it's very central for all the places you're likely to want to visit. The hotel service was great and the food in the hotel restaurants was excellent. The rooftop pool is brilliant as well but it's just a little bit too small for the number of guests and there are nowhere near enough beds. We got lucky and managed to nab beds on the 3 days we were there after a bit of waiting around but a lot of people didn't and had to put their towels on the floor.
All in all though I would stay here again and would recommend it. Just buy some more sunbeds for your guests!",4,2016,07,25
47,Our first stay in Barcelona and what a week-end it was.,"This was our first stay in Barcelona and we chose this hotel because of its very central position. The underground is right outside the hotel so very handy and direct access to the Ramblas, Camp Nou (football stadium) or the Basilica de la Sagrada Familia. And it is only 20 minutes from the airport so again, very convenient. We had a suite as we have two teenagers and the interconnecting rooms did the trick. The big roundabout outside the hotel is very busy but with the triple glazing we had, we could not hear anything. Our room had air con which felt like heaven after a whole day out and about in the city with temperatures around 27ºC to 30ºC. The pool on the roof was fab. We had a relaxing time towards the end of the day enjoying some cocktails (9€ for a glass of sangria and 12€ for a mojito) and reminiscing what we did during the day. Yes, we had a lovely breakfast in a café next door to the hotel on the first morning and in fact, we even tried some tapas on the other side on our first night, which were very good. We also tried the slightly more expansive breakfast (buffet formula at 16€ per person) at the hotel restaurant as we knew we weren't going to have time for lunch. It was dear but the food was delicious and the restaurant very quiet and relaxing. We also enjoyed the Japanese restaurant one night and the food was out of this world. Again not cheap. The members of staff were very welcoming. The hotel was expansive (even more so because of Brexit) but it was a four-star after all. All towels provided by the pool. Contrary to other guests, we had no issues of bad smell and we were offered two complimentary bottles of water on arrival. The coffee machine in the room was a Nespresso with a good selection of capsules. The view from our bedroom window as well as the swimming pool was also stunning. So, in a nutshell, fantastic location, very comfortable hotel, good facilities, nice food and excellence service. But it comes at a cost.",5,2016,07,25
47,Hotel catalonia,"Very convenient location. Rooms are a bit spartan, with oddly oriented showers and the beds are not very comfortable. Pleasant, helpful staff with very good breakfast included. We traveled with a tour group so perhaps the more expensive rooms would have had more comfortable beds.",3,2016,07,25
47,"It was good, could be better","This is a good hotel, beds are good and we had a room with a great view of the city!
the breakfast was great!
so was the rooftop pool. great sunbeds, cabanas and the location is good! 
Barcelona is a busy city and the hotel
was constantly packed and busy, especially during check in/check out and I feel like there should have been more people on the floor. It was chaotic.
overview of the breakfast could be better! We got charged breakfast 3x because someone gave up our room number. 
Room service was okay! Love how it's 24hrs but if you make a 24hr room
service with a limited choice from the normal menu (which is understandable) then make everything available on that menu. 
The service was not consistent. One was better than the other... And you'd expect them to speak different languages but I watched as the reception and bartenders struggled talking to the other patrons...

But if you're really on in for a good comfortable hotel for a good price then this is good! 

I've seen a lot of hotels of all ranges and locations so I can be a bit difficult when it comes to details.

47,"Great location, not a 4 star room","First the good- the hotel is is in a great location. Barcelona is a beautiful city and simply walking around the area near the hotel is a treat. There is a mall diagonally across the street and the fountain with its fabulous display is right up the street. There are many shops and restaurants nearby as well as gardens. But, our room had some problems. The door to the bath wouldn't open completely, jamming on the floor, and the closet door didn't close all the way. Minor quibbles? Maybe, but not in a hotel rated four stars. The rooftop is nice but crowded when we were there.",3,2016,07,23
47,"Excellent location to everything, helpful reception","Higher floor rooms r better to avoid noise. We went in August it was amazing weather,  the view is amazing from window, in front of the hotel is the bus station n subway station as well..Delicious breakfast.",4,2016,07,20
47,Short enjoyable stay in Barcelona,"A lovely ,well located hotel. The room was very comfortable, especially the pillows, which is not easy to find! There is a great selection of food to choose from for breakfast, including freshly made omelettes. Nice pool bar with a lovely view. I would recommend a stay here. ",4,2016,07,19
47,Poolside,"We had a lovely stay in Barcelona , the hotel staff were great and the hotel was really nice.
If you are thinking of taking the open top bus then this is ideal as the red route drops you off just across the road, also the metro is under your nose.
Our only criticism would be the pool area , absolutely lovely view of the fountains , nice pool and good seating, however the behaviour around the pool during the day was terrible, lots of drunk adults making fools of themselves and spoiling the pool area for those we children or trying to relax, the staff did nothing to curb this, it did spoil our late afternoons around the pool area. 
",4,2016,07,19
47,Super Hotel,"Super Hotel with a wonderfull rooftop bar and pool, usually also visited by locals after work. We had a family suite for 5 people and the room was new, clean, nice, with a perfect view of the magic fountains and the plaza. Wow! Would definitely stay there again, however I hear the old not renovated rooms are not the same std. Breakfast options could also be better. Breakfast is served in a nice atrium restaurant with lots of space and the Hotel has a 5 start location with city tour buses leaving just outside the front lobby. A shopping center is located across the street (10 steps) in the old Arena, taxis are easy to find from there. Perfect location. Perfect rooms. Perfect view.",4,2016,07,19
47,Ok hotell,"Ok hotell, with a ok room.
The pool area was good, but not enough sunbeds. It took me 20min to order and get two sangrias in the bar. The barkeepers had no training what so ever. We also tried to call the hotell before we arrived, and the woman didn't speak english.. We would probably not book there again.",3,2016,07,18
47,Faulty Towers of Barcelona,"Terrible experience, broken aircon, filthy rooms especially under the beds, stench of sewerage, terrible service at the poolside bar which was incredibly slow and overpriced. No drinks menus with staff clearly making up prices.",1,2016,07,18
47,Stolen bag!!,"At 13/7/16 between hours 19-20 we were checing out. i and my wife were at the lobby. i put my backpack to the table at the lobby. there were hotel staff around everywhere. and in a few minutes the backpack is gone!!!! we couldnt found it. we must go to rome and then left. 
but the problem was the behaviours of the hotel staff. there was a camera directly seeing that table. but they said we cant look the camera, you must go to the police. we didnt have time.
we suspect from the hotel staff!! and we want to contact a responsible person from hotel. we want the cameras to be examined for that hours!!!
it was a terrible experience!!",5,2016,07,18
47,"Nice location, but questionable 4 stars.  ","Location wise it's in a great spot.  It's the first stop on the aerobus network so getting to and from the airport is really easy.  Theres even a subway station right outside the front door that will let you get to most parts of Barcelona.  
We were offered a discounted 10 euro breakfast rate when we arrived but decided instead to use the 'tapa tapas' chain 1 minute across the road,  selling croissants and the usual continental style breakfasts for just a couple of euros.  
The hotel was nice,  however I do feel it is a 3* hotel with well executed 5* branding.  Our room had nice cold air conditioning which was a plus and did appear quite clean,  however it was suffering from signs of age with scratches on handles and damaged light switches. There were even signs of mold in the bathroom which is far from to be expected of a hotel of this standard.  I'm sure there are nicer rooms in the hotel,  but on the cheaper rates it did look quite typical based on what we saw walking past other rooms being serviced. 
The pool (a lovely temperature) and bar area is great , you're even higher up than the adjacent building that charges people a euro to go up for a similar vista,  however exercise caution when using the bar here...  We waited ages to be served and then we were charged nearly 20 euros for 2 bottles of cola! We were not offered any explanation and when we took it up with the hotel lobby,  we were just told it didn't seem quite right!  The next time I go back to Barcelona (and I will go back,  it's a truly great city)  I'd probably choose to stay elsewhere. ",3,2016,07,17
47,Perfectly decent hotel,"Not a bad hotel. Great location for arena which has lots of restaurants, for open top bus tour which you can pay for on board,. No need to go to Columbus plaza. Also close to port for cruise ships and for the Barcelona Sants station. We caught train from London to Barcelona, taxi to hotel was 10 euros and 20 euros to cruise ship. Right out side the hotel is the bus stop for A1 bus to airport which will catch after our cruise. 
As for the hotel itself.... There is a lovely roof top terrace with a bar area, swimming pool. Hotel has a decent gym. Our room was by the lift room 601 but because the room has a small corridor and with the air conditioning on at night we had a peaceful 2 night sleep. We had a triple room with a huge master bed and single bed for our son. Bathroom is roomy than typical London hotels with a bath, large sink with lots of space for 3 x toiletry bags.,toilet and biday. Good wardrobe space. We kept one case in the corridor on a case stand, one in the wardrobe and one on a mini table (only stayed 2 nights and did not want to unpack everything) we did not eat or have breakfast in the hotel. There is a small cafe around the corner and the arena has plenty of shops, cafes and restaurants. My only issue and hence the 4 stars is there was a smell of sewage coming from somewhere but not the bathroom which we noticed on our second night. Not sure where the smell was coming from. Our room overlooked the middle of hotel. No view. We could only see other rooms and what I think may have been hotel facilities at the bottom... May be this is where the smell was coming from?",4,2016,07,17
47,Service-location-luxury,"We ended up here rather last minute after a bad experience at a vacation apartment rental. From the moment we arrived until checkout, we felt pampered. Check-in was professional, friendly, and efficient. The location is fantastic with great restaurants, transportation, and shops nearby. The room (709) was stunning. It was well-sized for our family of four. Loved the bathroom, especially the rain shower and handhelds. Great bedding and nice touches such as welcome chocolates and water. Lovely decor. I think we were in a recently updated part of the hotel as it was very modern. Security staff and cleaning staff also spot on with their friendliness and efficiency. The pool area on the 8th floor was excellent and so was the view from there. All we would expect and more for the price.",5,2016,07,16
47,Perfect hotel for a city explore,"First time in Barcelona and was drawn to this hotel as it was a little way out from the center.  Was the right call.  Hotel was spotless and the service was excellent.  When there was a short delay in the room being ready beyond the check in time I was given a free drink and the staff spoke excellent English.  The room was well appointed and comfortable (though the aircon was touch noisy) and there was a wonderful view of the fountains. Showers were excellent and the power shower was just that.  Did not use the gym but the roof top bar offered wonderful views but there was always a breeze to take the edge off.  Was early in the season so the pool was icy cold but was not a problem.

Great transport links with a tube station literally being outside the door and the airport shuttle stops there as well; first stop from the airport as well.  Food in the hotel was excellent and good value for money.  Drinks were reasonable for a 4* hotel though the spirit based drinks were more expensive.

Lots of restaurants nearby and also a shopping center with some high end shops.  Hotel was quiet in the evening.

Would recommend the hotel to anyone wanting to have that little bit of extra comfort for not that much more money.",5,2016,07,16
47,Amazing rooftop,It seems going to have drinks on hotel rooftops is very popular these days in BCN.. And you can see why... Drinks are good and the view is breath taking! Avoid it during windy days or you'll be flying out since there is no true protection from  wind! Worth the try. ,4,2016,07,14
47,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza,"This hotel feels more like a 5* than a 4*. Highly recommended. With an amazing location in the heart of Barcelona and just a short cab ride to the beach, the hotel won't disappoint. The rooftop pool/bar is pretty special, with amazing views of the city.",5,2016,07,10
47,Cecilia's birthday Holiday from Sweden!,"This was the best holiday ever ! We started out at Catalonia Plaza to be near The ""Magic Fountain"" for the amazing light show. The reception helped us out and gave us an amazing room with city views and breakfast included. We reserved a triple but they seemed to have kindly upgraded us to a suite! 

We set off the following night for Ibiza via Ferry at the port. Was very convenient after breakfast to go see Gaudi church and Joan Miro park is adjacent to hotel. 

The best things : Location , Cleanliness, Staff ( Excellent) 
Breakfast great, view amazing , rooftop pool amazing!!!

4 stars deserved!",5,2016,07,07
47,Good location and nice pool area!,"I took my boyfriend here for a surprise trip last week and we loved it. The room was basic but had everything we needed. The rooftop pool and sunbathing area really made it for us. The bar staff were quite slow, but I need to mention the bar tender called Miguel! He went out of his way and made a real big fuss out of us. The hotel is in a perfect location and we would return back to this hotel again but would probably upgrade our room.",4,2016,07,07
47,Great hotel near shopping and attractions,"I had a great experience at this hotel. The staff went out of their way to be helpful and the rooms are very clean. I had no bathtub, only an enormous shower, which I like but if you care, it's something to take into consideration, I could see part of the light show at the fountain from my window.",5,2016,07,03
47,Absolutely Amazing ,This hotel is very clean with an amazing location. The staff were very polite & helpful with excellent English. The roof top bar is absolutely incredible with the most perfect view of the stunning fountains! The old bull ring across the road is now a shopping complex with roof top bars & restaurants. Perfect ❤️,5,2016,07,02
47,Excellent,"Really loved this hotel. The upstairs pool area has magnificent views, the sun loungers and beds are fantastic. Drinks are expensive to be expected. At night time when it lights up its really magical.. And you can see the magic fountain show from the bar. The room was great, we stayed in the junior suite with lovely views. Had to ask for the coffee machine as it was not in the room. Staff are lovely and helpful, although check in takes a long time. Breakfast was lovely, there was a 10 euro offer when we arrived. Great transport links, taxi rank outside. Bit noisy but to be expected when staying on a busy roundabout. You get used to it. Would definitely recommend staying here in a junior suite",5,2016,07,01
47,great location,"Great hotel location. Excellent transport to major sights. A little tough to get space by the pool, but great to have that outdoor space after a day of sightseeing for a sunset drink or nightcap. Spectacular views from rooms and rooftop bar/pool.",4,2016,06,29
47,goo times,"good hotel with great location, easy to see why its popular with all ages.
clean modern room well laid out, very comfortable with Air Con, great roof top pool areas and bar over looking the city and you can see many land marks from the roof.
A good place to relax or go out and see the sights.",5,2016,06,28
47,Worst experience of 4 star hotels in 15 trips to Barcelona,"I don't normally review but this hotel does not warrant its 4 star rating. Room service was very poor with very little in the room - no robes, slippers, mimi bar (there was a price list). The room looked set up as a single, transformed into a double, as both could not sit up in bed without banging heads on over bed light fittings. It has an excellent position and breakfast was good.",2,2016,06,28
47,"Stunning view,decent hotel with great pool","We stayed here for 4 nights,a nice hotel with a great rooftop bar and pool with stunning views over the city,rooms are comfortable and clean and the sound proofing on the windows is excellent,the trip from the airport via the aerobus is quick and cheap and drops you off nearly outside the hotel.There is a taxi rank just outside the hotel which are very reasonably priced,although they can be driven quite badly at times and dont seen to know the streets of there city very well.
The one thing that was irritating was the private events that took over large parts of the pool area with very little thought for the guests,
overall i would definately stay here again",4,2016,06,27
47,Great location nice pool terrace ,"We stayed here for a business trip and decided to upgrade to a suite. 
Great big room, more like an apartment. With separate bedroom and living area. Stand alone jacuzzi tub with fabulous view , the pool at the hotel is great , wonderful view with large beds for lounging and suntanning and it turns into the bar and restaurant at night. 
Some fixtures in the room need repair i.e, the window latch in the bathroom , not quite 5 star quality as in North America but better than expected . Includes amenities such as robe and slippers. Quiet room on the 11th floor only 2 units per floor since they are large. Elevators are typical tiny European size. 
Nice helpful staff . ",4,2016,06,27
47,Fantastic hotel,"Would definitely return, great service, food and location. Nothing was too much trouble for anyone, always willing to assist. Rooftop terrace a big plus with great views over Barcelona. Metro & airport bus outside hotel, nothing to dislike.",5,2016,06,27
47,Very good experience,It was a very nice experience at Barcelona.the location is very close to the tube and taxi .the hotel was very welcoming.the food was very nice and different kinds of food was available. the room was so clean .the reception was so helpful. I would like to go there again,4,2016,06,26
47,"Average Hotel, ruined by private events and bad service.","The room itself was fine, this was the only plus of staying there. Very clean and spacious but it's not made known to you until you check in that unless you pay a lot extra per night your ""View"" will be a blue wall.

We mainly booked this hotel for the nice pool area but unfortunately for the entire time of our visit half the pool area and the lounge area were fenced off for a private radio event from mid-afternoon to 11pm. We were told multiple times we were not allowed in this area as it was for a private event. There was no mention of this when booking or checking in. This also meant the whole hotel and pool area was blasted with Justin Bieber music until 11pm every night. Not only did it mean you couldn't relax at the pool, but even in your room you could hear it loudly. We complained multiple times and were told there was nothing that they could do and it was only a one day event. This continued for 4 days so it clearly was not a one day event. The whole of the 5th and 6th floor smells terribly (another point we raised with staff and was dismissed).  When we checked out we raised this issues again and got the response ""So you booked this hotel just for the pool?"" before he rolled his eyes. Actually yes, the pool area was a huge selling point so before you go please check it's not closed for a ""Private event"" as it ruined our holiday!",3,2016,06,24
47,Hen do,"The hotel was lovely and clean the staff were friendly and view was amazing! 
The restaurant serves was very slow and didn't understand English much, a taxi is needed to travel places beach bout 10 minutes in taxi, night lift is excellent and restaurants too",5,2016,06,23
47,Great location but poor service,"I spent two days at this hotel, the location is great and it's right in the middle of the touristic area in Barcelona. However the service was very poor; we ordered an iron three times and never had it. Room service was also poor, it took 45 minutes to deliver an order.",3,2016,06,23
47,Great location at the bottom of the Montjuïc,"I stayed over Thankgiving holiday for business, and it was my first time abroad.

I'm in agreement with others about the star rating. It was a great hotel, but it's not the same as US 4-star rated hotel. While the rooms were clean and modern, I was severely disappointed with the beds. I think I was supposed to have a queen bed, but it was essentially just two twins pushed together, so I don't want to sleep in the middle of it or I'd be sleeping on a gap. And it wasn't comfy at all. Rather thin mattress, and the pillows were just pillows. The bathrooms were clean, but there were just small things that surprised me like rust stains and cracked tiles on the walls. One positive is that it's a very quiet and peaceful hotel.

Oh and another is the poolside, rooftop bar. Awesome views and the bartender doesn't mess around! Stiff drinks after a long day working is alright in my book.

What makes up for that is the location and the staff. This is right on the Plaza de España. So you walk out of the hotel and you're greeted with a magnificent view of the Montjuïc and Palau Nacional. It's absolutely stunning. I walked up the steps to the Palau (amazing views of the entire city!) and right behind it are some of the venues from the Barcelona Olympics. Travel to other parts of the city is easy since several buses stop in the Plaza, along with a subway stop. A mall, Las Arenas de Barcelona, is just across the street, with some nice shops. Fun fact, it was formerly a bullfighting ring!

As far as the staff, they were great. For us Español-challenged (or Catalan-challenged), they all spoke English very well. Whatever I or my colleagues needed, they were able to assist. The ladies who worked the conference floors were very, very helpful as well. 

Overall, for my first time in Barcelona, it was an excellent stay. The beds need some work, but other than that, I enjoyed my stay at the Catalonia!",4,2016,06,22
47,"Good location, great pool, does need a revamp internally","We stayed here for 3 nights for a low key girls/family hen do. The pool was the best feature of the hotel. Its a great size, gets the sun all day long and has enough space as long as you get a bed early. The views are also stunning. 
We were there during Sonar which meant the hotel was very rowdy so I would avoid going at that time of year again.
The pool bar was very understaffed, sometimes there was one lady and a queue of 5 people, they really could work to have more staff on hand. The pool food was OK and it was lovely to spend a few days relaxing.
The hotel location is great, a direct bus takes you to and from the airport in 15 minutes and costs 6 euros. There are also lots of bus stops, including the open top bus stops and metro stations close by. The location is such a huge plus!! 
The sushi restaurant on the ground floor is brilliant the food is amazing. The breakfast was OK and I only ate there once as felt it wasn't the best quality of food. 
The staff can be very slow and check in and check out take quite a long time as does collecting your baggage once you've stored it. 
The rooms were dated and tired. When we arrived the counter tops and tv were dusty and it could have done with a much more through clean. The paint was old, the beds were too hard, the decor was dated and the wall were dirty. The saving grace was the stunning view from the window over the roundabout and up to the museum. 
If i stayed here it again it would have to be in a much more upgraded room, and I would return just for the sushi restaurant.",4,2016,06,22
47,5 days in the beautiful city of Barcelona,"Our room 457 had views to the monument and fountains. Perfect location, friendly and efficient staff, comfortable and clean rooms, great breakfast. Close to shopping complex and plenty of restaurants. Aeroport bus stops outside so easy from airport. Rooftop bar and pool area great for late afternoon rest after day of sightseeing.  Well worth price for a bit of luxury.

47,Terrible,"Firstly, the room looks nothing like the pictures, no robes, no iron and the lamps had pretty much fallen off the wall. I turned up to the catalonia and left within 1 hour due to how terrible the hotel was in person. I would never recommend this to anyone! Never again! When I complained to the staff they told me if I pay 100 euros extra PER NIGHT I could have a better room.... what horrendous customer service.",1,2016,06,18
47,I would love to come back to this hotel!,"Read a few reviews saying that this hotel wasn't as good as advertised so I was very pleased when we arrived to find it exceeded my expectations! The hotel and rooms were extremely clean, staff friendly and helpful. Our room had an incredible view and the beds were very comfy. The bar/pool area is amazing - furnished luxuriously with beautiful bed loungers. Also an incredible view of the magic fountain from up here! The airport bus is also right outside the hotel and gets to the airport in about 20 minutes for under €6 so we would recommend doing this.

The only bad thing I could say about the place is that the drinks at the pool were quite expensive but we didn't really drink alcohol so I wasn't overly bothered. The location was a strange one - perfect location for the magic fountain etc but then I felt there weren't as many restaurants without getting a taxi somewhere.",5,2016,06,17
47,Good 4 star hotel,"I stayed at this hotel for a company offsite. Both for pleasure and business this is an excellent hotel.

The good:
-prices are reasonable.
-The roof top pool + lounge area is amazing. This alone upgrades this hotel immensely. And the view..... :)
-Business accommodations are very good. Cool, adaptive lighting, constant refresh of bottles of water
-The bus from the airport stops at the plaza. Also there is a metro entrance right before the door. 

The bad:
-breakfast. I know: spanish people don't do breakfast but the breakfast buffet was sub par. 3 star at most. 
-hotel rooms are OK but bit noisy. Spacious bathrooms though.

Ugly:
-I am still wondering why it takes 10 mins to check in at these kind of hotels. They already had my booking and thus my address/name/cc details. ",4,2016,06,17
47,Holiday in Barcelona,"I spent a few days in Barcelona with my family to celebrate my birthday. I liked the hotel's location: excellent connection to the airport via shuttle bus and next to the metro station. It is within a walking distance to the National Museum and Miro Foundation. Swimming pool on the 8th floor is nice. Staff is polite, food is good. We loved the Japanese restaurant best.",4,2016,06,15
47,Fantastic location,"Fantastic location, great hotel and awesome staff! Excellent hotel to explore Barcelona  from, thoroughly recommend it. Stayed for 2 nights in early June. Next to metro stop which makes it very easy to get around.",5,2016,06,14
47,Worn room,"The hotel itself is in a very central and good location. 
My room was very worn, quite loud and a bit dirty.
Maybe others are better, but i will not go there a second time. Also check in and out took quite long",1,2016,06,14
47,GOOD,"It's nice hottel ,I was there before and after they made some renovations. The room was super and I like it. This time I was with a baby, so it was a little hard, because the do not have special ways on stairs for a baby carriage. They have to do something.",4,2016,06,13
47,Was OK,The room was clean and checkin went fast. However there were no towels on the room and I had to ask twice after I had a shower. Bed was too hard and old. You could feel everything inside. Great location at Plaza Espania and good breakfast. All you need,4,2016,06,13
47,Rooftop Bar Staff Are Excellent,"In our recent stay me and my friend were made to feel at home by Christian, Sara and Mario. They worked at the magnificent rooftop bar. They made us feel at home and provided all round excellent service, it really made our holiday that much more special. We hope their management see this and praise them accordingly.",5,2016,06,10
47,"""Great location,great roof top view"""," This is my forth  stay in Barcelona but the first time at this hotel. I chose hotel by location and never regretted. From the airport has a direct bus service (Aerobus) that cost 5.90 euros per person stops right outside the hotel. In front of the hotel  has metro station with two excellent metro lines (L1 and L3).  
Hotel needs some renovation but is very spacious . I suggest a room with a city view for its wonderfull views on the central square, a museum and a beautiful fountain which from Thursday to Sunday evening from 9pm has its own well-known program.
Rooms are ok bed big and comfortable.
Toalets big and ok.
Cleaning service for rooms could be better.
Breakfast very rich and tasty-great!Price on web 16euros per person but on the spot we paid 10 euros per person.
Wifi ok works everywhere in hotel. 
Terasse on the 8th floor with pool and bar is very nice-I loved it. 
Gym small but ok and all machines work.
Staff nice polite.
I would come back to the hotel if I ever go back to Barca.
Good value for money!",4,2016,06,10
47,Good hotel but needs to be refurbished ,"Good:
Location 
Breakfast 
Friendly and professional staff
Terrace on the top floor with a nice pool and amazing view 

To be improved:
The furniture in the bedrooms looks really tired
The bathrooms can be renewed  (please remove the plastic curtains in the showers).

Overall a good experience but can be better.

",3,2016,06,10
47,Great hotel in a great location,"We stayed here on a hen do from the uk for 3 nights.
This hotel is ideally situated in Barcelona square which we got to by taxi from the airport but there is also a shuttle bus service from the airport to outside the hotel.
Surrounded by shops and restaurants with an amazing rooftop view of Barcelona including the famous majic fountains.
There is a an underground train service directly outside the hotel which takes you everywhere.
The hotel is beautiful, big and clean with a wide variety of breakfast selection. The staff are friendly and helpful.
Our favourite spot was the rooftop pool/bar for its views and space to relax.
I would definitely stay here again and recommend it for value for money.",5,2016,06,10
47,Nice location and friendly service,"We pre-booked two rooms about a week before we arrived as we made trip around the Europe by motorbikes. The rooms were supposed to be non-smokers. Well the other room I got happened to be a smoker room and non-airconditioned one (which equals to a horrible experience). The staff was friendly enough to arrange new room for the 2nd night. The hotel was packed full for the 1st night. The sight-seeing tours (as well as taxis) leave just outside the hotel and there are amazing landmarks to experience within walking distances. Overall nice hotel and staff, maybe fix the booking system just a bit for the future? :)",4,2016,06,04
47,Fantastic hotel and great value for money,"This is a great hotel and amazing value for money. It was so easy to get to and find, and is a great base for exploring the city. The metro station and bus stops are outside, and there is a great shopping centre next door for food and shopping. Just opposite the hotel is the National Art Museum with beautiful surroundings and amazing views, and you can't miss the Magical Fountain display from Thursday to Sunday which can be seen from the hotel. Breakfast is also great. Only down side is the busyness of the road but you do get used to it. The roof area is a bit tricky to get to but once there it was a lovely area to relax in. Would definitely stay again.",4,2016,06,04
47,Convenient  and pleasantl,Very handy for airport as direct bus stops just outside.  Friendly and helpful staff.  The decor is perhaps a little dated. Our room was large but air conditioner not working as well as it might.  Luckily the weather was not hot.  Breakfast costs less if you put it on bill rather than paying upfront in room. which is strange!  ,4,2016,06,02
47,Comfortable hotel in a great location,Very comfortable rooms and easy access to the city center through public transportation or taxi. Also very conveniently located close to a nice mall offering tons of food options. Friendly staff and excellent breakfast!,5,2016,06,02
47,Could not have asked for more,"Had an earlier booking at the Four point Sheraton which when we reached was not there so they decided to shift is to this amazing hotel( thank god for that). The front office was superb in welcoming us and especially a big thank you for Marina and Sandra for making our stay memorable. To our Luck we were shifted to an suite in the 12th floor, the pool access on superb and the view is magnificent. I surely recommend you to consider this hotel when visiting Barcelona. It is also well located with the Metro station right outside and four stops away is the Placa de Catalunya.",5,2016,06,01
47,Great stay in Barcelone,"great hotel, a bit dated but absolutely compensated by level of service. Great room (Clock suite) and absolutely great pool/bar. Onky downside wasthe lack of food service at the poolbar. Otherwise absolutely recommendable hotel even when located at one of the most used roundabouts in Barcelona.",4,2016,05,31
47,Very good choice,Centrally located in the city. Easy transition to and from the airport. Very good breakfast and dining options. High levels of cleanliness. Cheery and helpful staff. Very comfortable rooms. Very nice pool bar with amazing views.,5,2016,05,28
47,Lovely location but lack of access to pool disappointing!,"The hotel is pleasant and the location in Sants-Montjuic is excellent with perfect views of montjuic hill.
I would have rated this much better had I not just arrived back to the hotel after a day's sightseeing to find a sign stuck up in the lift informing us that the pool is closed to hotel guests as it has been reserved for a private function. At no point were we made aware that this was a possibility otherwise I would have booked a cheaper hotel without a pool. Disappointing! ",2,2016,05,26
47,Excellent excellent excellent,"Fantastic hotel in perfect location with stunning views and amazing rooftop pool and bar. Junior suite was good size, tidy, well designed, comfortable and had good views out to Plaza. Would definitely stay again next time in Barcelona. ",5,2016,05,24
47,Amazing!,"This hotel made our trip so perfect!

Started with so nice receptionist Linda, who helped us with everything! Continue with good room with amazing view, room was not so perfect but really nice and comfortable. 

We stayed for three great nights there! 
Locality is very comfortable, metro and bus to airport is just few meters from hotel, it was so comfy to get everywhere you need. 

Rooftop pool and view was just awesome. Really nice. Maybe little expensive bar, yeah, but whatever... 

Breakfast was also good and cost 10€ for person so that not so bad :) 

This hotel made Barcelona more perfect, really, it's so easy to find, easy to get everywhere and very nice. Really recommendend this hotel and room with view, you just never forget it :) it was so cool. 

Thank you Catalonia Barcelona Plaza for being so cool and made our amazing trip to Spain more perfect! I'll 100% come there if I'll be in Barcelona next time! Looking forward for this moment! 

Really recommend! 

Matthew from Slovakia.

47,Disappointing,"First the positives: The location is fantastic with great views of Montjuic and the fountains. It is also conveniently situated above the Espanya tube entrance/exit and next to a lovely cafe, which is ideal for breakfast (or you can cross the road tothe many eateries in Arenas shopping mall). The negatives are that we found the reception staff disinterested during check-in and check-out; we had a family room, which was so small that we had to remove the bedding and fold the sofa bed to give us room to move but on our return late at night we found that house-keeping had taken the bedding! Our biggest gripe however is that we specifically stayed here as a treat for our kids to use the rooftop pool and when we went to use it during a sunny few hours amidst a rainy weekend the entrance doors were locked. When I asked the receptionist to explain why, he advised it was shut to prepare for a private party. I asked why we hadn't been informed when checking in only to receive a shrug and reply that he hadn't been told either! They charge far too much money for a roulette style of accessibility to amenities and that kind of service, so be warned. As a frequent visitor to Barcelona we would not stay here again as there are far better value for money hotels in this lovely city.",2,2016,05,18
47,"Perfect location, first class hotel","Perfect location, first class hotel. roof top pool and bar is great, views are stunning across the city. Close to all the amenities and friendly helpful staff. Stayed for business. Great for a city break option as well",5,2016,05,18
47,convinient,It Is very good place for sightseeeing and attending conference. There are lots of cafe and restaurants. and close to the Metro station to approach every place. The staffs are very kind  and room is very clean. We Japanese want to set the box of tissue paper in the room. And we like to have the vegetable or salad for the breakfast.,4,2016,05,17
47,"Brilliant Rooftop Pool, but freezing pool","Excellent location - very central, the rooftop bar is fantastic and overlooks the main city fountains.  The breakfasts are very good and reasonably priced. Overall very good, but let down by a freezing unheated pool and extortionate bar prices.",4,2016,05,17
47,"Personal too noisy, doors slammed from 8:30am to 0:00 PM","Not informed that my room with terrasse was just a part of the commun terrasse of the swimming pool Personal noisy they slam the doors non stop. The room is close of 3 firedoors used the bar s staff for their sercice. The door at the back of my stay was just bloked by a empty bootles and was slapping all night long with the wind. I never had a such bad experience in catalonia hotels, they use to have a good service",3,2016,05,16
47,Wonderful hotel ,Although we stayed for one night but we really enjoyed our stay in this hotel especially when we had an upgrade to a family suit. You can see a panoramic view of plaza espanya and all the facilities near to you ( taxi .. Bus tour station .. Shopping mall .. Supermarket .. Pharmacy.. ect. ) ,5,2016,05,16
47,Nice and romantic,"Just amazing view from our room to Plaza Espanya.Very cozy and romantic room, good food in the restaurant, very helpful and nice stuff. We stayed 5 nights in the hotel, and we have nothing to complain. Good location to Montjuic only 5 min and to the plaza Catalonia 10 min by car. A beautiful view from the rooftop swimming pool and bar.",4,2016,05,15
47,Really disappointed.,Overpriced and disappointing. Expected a fantastic view over Barcelona but ended up with a view of a courtyard. The room was clean but had single beds when we had ordered a double luxury room. This was an expensive choice for my husbands 50th birthday but ended up being really disappointing. Not worth the extra that we paid for the last hotel we stayed at.,2,2016,05,15
47,"Spacious, clean and welcoming","I arrived after a long flight and was grateful that the room was ready. The rooms are spacious and clean and, more importantly, the bed was very comfortable. I would return to the hotel and have no problem recommending it to friends.",5,2016,05,12
47,Bad experience,"The hotel has a beautiful rooftop with a pool and is conveniently located. 
Aside from that, the experience there was not positive at all. We had some issues such as hair in the bathroom, a hideous room, too small for a group of 3 with a view on the internal wall.
Even though we requested (and had a confirmation) an early check-in at 11.00 am, the rooms were not ready and the staff we dealt with was completely unapologetic, unfocused and almost disrespectful. The day we left, reception knocked at 9am to ask us to leave in the next half hour. 
They are far away from the standard you would expect from a 4* hotel at that price.",2,2016,05,12
47,"Central Location, close to public transportation/restaurants","It's location makes this establishment worth the stay. The rooms are big and some are SMOKING ! So be sure you get a room that doesn't have smoking if you're not a smoker (many Europeans still smoke profusely..even the women). We reserved separate beds...but our room had two twin beds pushed together but with separate bedding...maybe this is a European custom...I don't know but it was surprising to me. The breakfast buffet is SUPER and more than you'll ever need. They have security around the lobby but since the lobby is so large, you should keep your eye on your bags and property. Barcelona is known as PICKPOCKET heaven...so beware.",4,2016,05,11
47,"""Good hotel with a great view from pool bar""","We stayed there for four nights, enjoyed the stay 100%. Staff was 100% and service minded. Location is excellent, 30 min. walk to Rambla - down town. Just outside the hotel is Arena shopping mall with various shops and good restaurants on the top floor.",4,2016,05,10
47,nice hotel,"Great hotel, metro stop outside. Clean and great views from pool bar. Slept well nice big bed. Had a room with a view. That nice we have booked to stay here again.  The hotel is next to a shopping center with places to get breakfast and on the top there are resterrauts but i would say some are not that good.",5,2016,05,10
47,Not bad.,"The terrace of this hotel is fantastic.
It has a beautiful of view of the Palace and is a great place to have a drink.
My only gripe is that the bedroom was poor.
I believe they are renovating the hotel slowly a bit at a time but it really was quite dated.",4,2016,05,10
47,Bad,"I was there last week with my wife and my daughter for 2 nights
Very bad receptionist ladies in the term of professionally 
Very slow and not efficient
Till 3 :30 pm  I didn't receive my room
Far from city center
",2,2016,05,09
47,Good hotel on great location,"Good hotel at great location, easy to get to from the airport with the Areobus. Several metro lines available, so very easy getting around in the city. 
Decor of the hotel could use some retouching, but overall a clean and comfortable room. Beds are really comfortable as well (but I like a firm matrass). Issue with toilet in bathroom was fixed within 15 minutes, good response!
Pool on the roof really nice, but could use some more sunbeds.",4,2016,05,09
47,"Beautiful hotel, thoroughly recommend!","My partner and I stayed here for 3 nights in a room with a city view and it was incredible. Everything was within a reasonable walk, the hotel being just outside the city centre but close to attractions such as montjuic! The views were amazing and everything was clean and modern and prices were really reasonable. The rooftop was my favourite part of the hotel - great to sunbathe during the day and to have some cocktails before going out for dinner and watching the sunset. Particularly good touch getting a complimentary drink on arrival. Absolutely loved it here, have recommended to friends going to Barcelona later this year.
My only slight issue was that the road was quite noisy from our room, a maintenance man was sent to fix this and unfortunately it didn't help too much so we were woken earlier in the morning that we would have liked! ",5,2016,05,07
47,Not worth the money ,"This is a very average hotel with a price tag it doesn't deserve. Decor is tatty and dated. I walked in and my initial reaction to the room was that it was not worth the money.
We booked through a website that states you pay on arrival. However on arrival we we told payment for the first day had already been charged to the card because the hotel had had an issue with other credit cards. We had Euros ready to pay for the room so asked for the charge to be refunded, which it was, minus £6. Not impressed. Staff are helpful but work painfully slowly. ",2,2016,05,05
47,Clean and comfortable,"This is a nice Hotel on the West side of Barcelona.  It's clean and comfortable, but could use some repairs and updating.  The breakfast buffet is very good, as well as the front counter staff is very professional and polite, willing to help in any way.",4,2016,05,04
47,Not 4 star.,"Rooms basic, cold with no facilities as expected from a 4 star hotel (No tea/coffee making facilities, no extra pillows/blankets) Beds like camp beds, very uncomfortable Unable to borrow an iron despite several requests and visit to reception.  Shower facing wrong way so soaked the bathroom. Room smelt of smoke which never went away for the whole of our stay.   Breakfast good selection but hot food cold. ",2,2016,05,03
47,"Perfect staff, great location","Perfect staff at a great location. A bit outdated furniture, but hey, who cares! (Ok, I was upgraded so that makes a review perhaps a bit more common :) ) But for sure there is a good internal or external hospitality training company that did some good work!",4,2016,05,03
47,Good service but ,"being a central 4 stars in Barcelona, not a great breakfast. nice room. great terrace. not quick service at reception. customer device to be improved especially from the breakfast's hosts. clean rooms.  prices are high. should add some more amenities in the rooms",4,2016,05,01
47,Poor service and shabby,"I am just leaving from what really should be 3 star! I arrived on Thursday with my 2 friends for a business trip, we had been booked into a triple room , the room was spacious enough but one of the single beds was falling apart , dirty and like laying on a lumpy floor, the rooms bedside tables where dirty, sticky, drink marks did not looked like it had been cleaned at all! So we asked reception to change us to a clean room and all beds the same , after a lengthy and frustrating discussion we where then taken to a room next door of which was exactly the same if not worse! After 1 hour and 20 mins another member of staff finally sorted our rooms however it was still dirty in fact I have pubic hairs on my bath! The furniture is shabby , it lacks atmosphere in the bar and eating area , there is no kettle in your room or iron! I needed an iron and had events to go too this took over an hour to sort they then took it away again so the very next day I had to go through it all again asking, waiting, chasing then after over an hour I manage to get it back! The customer service is awful , the cleanliness is awful, the food is middle of the rd , location is on a busy roundabout but us handy for taxis and trains, but very noisy. The roof terrace with bar and pool is actually very nice and could be a complete different hotel but the bar does not open until 3 pm?? I believe there are some refurbished rooms but who knows what they are like?? Will not be staying here again!",2,2016,05,01
47,My Boyfriend's Birthday in Barcelona,"Such a beautiful hotel in a great location. A big thank you to Francisco on the front desk for your help and advice on where to go in Barcelona and where to stay. All the staff were so lovely and friendly.. especially the lovely lady that welcomes you as you go in for breakfast.. she was always smiling early in the morning and was always willing to help. We loved the turndown service with the chocolate and fruit that were a surprise.. just wish it was a little bit warmer that pool was calling me.. can't fault the location of the hotel.. everything is RIGHT THERE.. or not far away.. The airport bus stops outside the hotel.. The city tour bus stops outside it.. There is a metro station outside, a short train ride to Camp Nou and the Barcelona Beach.. my first time in Barcelona and certainly not the last!",5,2016,04,27
47,"Central location, clean hotel but no air-con in February","I stayed here for a business trip with a colleague on 17th February, so bear in mind I wasn't at the hotel for 10-11 hours a day.  
The hotel was clean and I had a room on west side of the hotel where you could see the Plaza d'Espana all lit up at night which was amazing.  However, my room was like a sauna, I tried to switch on the air-con but couldn't and resorted to asking reception to fix it and was then informed that at it was out of season the air-con had been switched off throughout the hotel. I wasn't offered a fan as an alternative and just had to open the window.
Apart from that mis-hap, breakfast was varied and tasty.  The gym was literally a small room with 2 treadmills a rowing machine and an exercise ball which is ok but with no air-con, I wasn't prepared to use it.
The location was brilliant, taxis, buses and the metro line were right outside the entrance.  next to the hotel is an old bullring which has been converted into a shopping centre and restaurants. It wasn't clear if the hotel had a pool, as I couldn't find it, but it wasn't So fantastic location but hotel could have been a little more accommodating.",4,2016,04,21
47,Nice location but noisy,"The hotel is located in an ideal location in Barcelona.  The roof terrace is really nice and the japanese restaurant as well. However the room are really noisy as there is no carpet in the halls, hence you hear all the noise during the night. I also had somebody who tried to come twice into my room during the night, probably he got the number of his room wrong...  the area for the breakfast is also very noisy. If you want to get there for business, they have renovated the business rooms in the basement and they are amazing.  But for leisure I would advise another hotel.",3,2016,04,21
47,Good hotel but needs improving,"Stayed here 9-12th April booked as my birthday present.

To start off with the positives:
Staff are friendly
Good location
Roof top terrace and pool is fantastic
Rooms are clean
Bed are comfortable 
Complementary fruit platter in room was a nice touch

Negative:
Our stay was ruined by the air conditioning and traffic noise. Our room was so hot so when we got in we put on the air con, to our dismay the room was getting hotter, despite changing the temperature to the minimum of 5 degrees to see if that would work. Rang reception and someone came up to our room, he agreed it was hot in the room but the air conditioning at this time of year is set to heat only. The only thing we could do was turn it off and keep the window open throughout the night. The hotel is situated on a main road/roundabout with loads of traffic noises throughout the night. Worst three nights sleep we've had on holiday, couldn't wait to get home to my own bed. 

It's a shame for a hotel that is on the pricey side that their rooms don't cater to all guests staying there. ",3,2016,04,20
47,Nice room!,"Perfect located hotel, nice big clean room with fantastic view on the plaza España! Metro and busses in the front of the hotel! Walking distance to the rambla and sea! Lots of restaurants and bars in the area and nextdoor a big shopping centre!",5,2016,04,20
47,A great hotel and location,"The hotel is everything you would expect from a top city hotel. We stayed for 4 nights; day 1 and 2 we used the City Tour bus @ 39euro for a two day ticket. This gives 2 routes which cover the city and is highly recommended. The hotel staff were very helpful and gave us useful info re the metro which runs from outside the hotel, a T10 ticket (10 journeys) was only 9 euro and one we had our bearings was a great and swift way to get around.
The room was spacious and modern; the buffet breakfast plentiful, even if you were near the end of service, this included freshly cooked omelettes and pancakes.
On level 8 of the hotel is a pool and great lounging area, we didn't make it into the pool but on a summer day it would be lovely; but we did spend a lovely hour or so reading up there.
To the right of the hotel as you face the hotel is a round building, a shopping centre with a variety of restaurants on the top level and fast food outlets on the lower ground floor.
The hotel location is a perfect place to get around the city, by metro the journey is on the red line and takes about 7 mins with trains running every 2/3 mins.",5,2016,04,15
47,Location is beyond amazing,"Every night we could see the amazing fountain and museum (perhaps our favorite sights in Barcelona when combined with the music, lights and dancing fountain). The bus stop and trains are at the doorstep and malls and cafes surround the hotel at Plaza de Espana. Staff were attentive and always willing to assist. Definitely a hotel we will visit when we return to Barcelona.",5,2016,04,09
47,Good Hotel....,"The hotel is in a very unique , steps from Arenas de Barcelona and Placa d'Espanya. Magic Fountain of Montjuic and National Art Museum of Catalonia are also very near.

Plaza d`Espanya is a very famous place and has many metro stations which makes your transportation easy.

The rooms are not luxurious but can do it for a travel, needs some renovation specially that wooden doors that will let you hear steps in the corridor and if someone shouts next to your room.

The breakfast is somehow limited but has what you need, juices, cheese, bakery products, coffee, tea, pastry and fruits.

All in all it is a good hotel, not magnificent but good.",3,2016,04,06
47,Vacation,"Hotel location is perfect, conveniently located by the tram, the bus stops for around town and the buses that go back and forth to the airport. Our room was great, bed was comfortable, bathroom and shower were very nice. The staff was always very helpful, and polite. I thought the price was fair.
    The only downside was the noise. Our room would get very warm so we would open the window, which was very nice, we were 5 floors up and the road noise would be so load sometimes it was hard to hear the TV, and just when you would fall asleep, some load noise would wake you. The hotel only has heaters, no AC, so I am sure it can get really hot. 
     We ate breakfast at the little coffee shop which is part of the hotel just around the corner from the front door..",4,2016,04,04
47,Solid,"Great location for tourists wanting to visit Barcelona just outside the hussle of Las Ramblas area. Right on Plaza Espanya. 

Short taxi ride to Camp Nou (see a Barca match is you can, you won't regret it).

Reception a tad slow, but Receptionist Linda was super helpful & professional. I felt very welcome. Thank you Linda!

Room was very clean and spacious, quite plain but good.

Breakfast €10 buffet was also good.

Nice roof terrace & pool (I didn't use though).

I guess this is a great hotel for business, maybe not the coolest in town, but a proper hotel.",4,2016,04,03

47,Very nice hotel right in the heart of Plaza Espanya,"We lucked out that this was the hotel given to us for two days of our stay in Barcelona. We had a terrace room with a view outside of our window of Plaza Espanya, the lucky fountain, and MNAC museum in the distance. Even better, right outside our hotel was the entrance to the metro. The lobby was gorgeous, staff was nice, good breakfast, and the room was decent. Only bad thing was the bed. Man, was it lumpy. For 4 stars, they really need to shell out some money for better mattresses.",5,2016,04,01
47,"Fantastic hotel, fantastic location.","Beautiful hotel with excellent and friendly staff. 

The food is also amazing and very reasonably priced. 

The rooms are very spacious and comfortable. 

It was difficult to have shower due to the position of the shower head. The curtain was not big enough for the bath and there was water spreading across the floor.

47,Wonderful hotel,"The room is spacious & clean, the beds are comfortable. Service is excellent. Location is great.  
In general I find this hotel chain in Spain to be high quality. For a stay away from home it sure is nice to have such a nice place to stay in.",5,2016,03,18
47,Average,"Certainly not worth 4 stars.  Modern and spacious, but noisy as there are no carpets in the halls so you hear everyone going by your door!  There are no kettles in the rooms which is so frustrating.  The breakfast buffet is excellent but the room was freezing cold most days.  Apparently hotel has been refurnished recently, but the rooms are different.  My colleague had two pictures in her room, I had one and empty hooks! It looks bad.  Other guests kept me awake one night partying.  I can't really recommend it although its very convenient for shops & conference centre.",3,2016,03,14
47,Spacious & Old Style,"A four-stars hotel with big rooms, but old furniture and wared bathtub.
Big and good quality towels, but uncomfortable mattresses.
No coffee/tea facilities in the room.
Good basic buffet breakfast, but strict hours: not before 7 AM, not after 10:30.
Pleasant gym and courteous staff.
Fast and free Wi-Fi",3,2016,03,10
47,Room with a view ,"Just spent the last 3 nights at this hotel as a present from my hubby for my 40th birthday.  I was lucky enough to be in one of the suites which are located in the tower.  Wow the room was amazing we could watch the sunrise from the lounge and then watch is set whilst relaxing in the huge bath overlooking Barcelona.  The bed was HUGE and extremely comfortable.  Bathroom had his and hers sinks,  WC and bidet behind seperate glass doors within bathroom.  As stated earlier huge bath and also a separate power shower.  

Breakast was great we chose to eat in the gourmet restaurant so bonus that you practically had the restaurant to ourselves.  Good selection of hot and cold food along with some lovely pastries.  

Location - we loved the location helped by our fantastic views.  15min walk to Olympic stadium.  Would recommend the Bus tour which stops just outside the hotel,  it takes you to all the main tourist attractions and you can hop on/off at any point. Helped us decide where to spend our last day.  After sightseeing all day we visited a couple of restaurants in the Arenas de Barcelona which is just across the road. 

Loved Barcelona and loved this hotel cannot wait to return.  ",5,2016,03,02
47,terribly disappointed,"i received my credit card bill a week after i checked out from the hotel, i was shocked by a late charge EUR 40. 
after i contacted the hotel few times by email, they replied me and said i used  the whole minibar, therefore they charged my credit card after i checked out from the hotel.
it was ridiculous since i never use anything from the fridge. later on they email me and said it was a mistake and refund the full amount to my credit card. 
that's a scam and caused me lots of trouble. i would not recommend this hotel to anyone.",1,2016,02,29
47,"A lot to like, but ultimately disappointing","Located at Plaça d'Espanya and across from the Arena de Barcelona, Hotel Catalonia Barcelona Plaza is well situated between the city's business and convention districts and its tourist areas to the east and north. This central location along with prime access mass transit and the waterfront make it an excellent location to access the city. And a suitable location for either tourist or business travel. The property itself also features all of the things one expects from from a large, full service hotel: bars, restaurants, a spa, pool, laundry, room service, and an expansive European breakfast buffet.

Sadly, with all this hotel has going for it, my biggest complaint is the one thing I look for most in a hotel. Comfort. I want to be rested and refreshed and enjoy my room. And have access to amenities that will make my stay easy and enjoyable. But I really felt let down here. My ""king room"" was comprised of two twins pushed together. Which isn't a king when you can only sleep on one or the other. And the beds were very uncomfortable. I'm used to firmer European mattresses, but these were much too hard. And my room was really under equipped lacking an iron, mini bar, outlet adapters, Ethernet, blankets or extra pillows, or a coffee maker. And while Spanish modernism abounds in Barcelona, and the decor here reflects that trend, I found this hotel's aesthetics to be sterile and uninviting. 

On positive side I received excellent service while I was here. The front desk was always helpful, the buffet staff was good, housekeeping was reliable and efficient, and the laundry services were great. There was also free WiFi that worked very well most of the time. But many of these positives are undone for me by the rooms. I really expect a more comfortable and relaxing environment where I can rest and recuperate. And sadly this hotel made that part very difficult. There are many hotels that match them for service and am entities, but simply have better rooms. Personally, I wouldn't chose to stay here again.",3,2016,02,26
47,Upgrade! I'll be back!,"I booked into this hotel for one night only. I was attending a conference on Montjuic and the hotel was perfectly placed. Originaly I had booked a single room but on arrival I was up graded to a suite. Such a pity I had to go out to dinner and then get up early in the morning. However, I made the best of it by filling the circular bath and relaxing after midnight. In the morning a colleague joined me for breakfast - she went to get croissants and we took full advantage of the Nespresso machine in the living room. Living room, dining room, two bathrooms and large bedroom. Excellent! Views on three sides up Montjuic, Over the pool and out towards the airport and from the back I could see the famous Dona i Ocell sculpture by Miro. Can't wait for next year's conference.",5,2016,02,22
47,Suite with great value and view ,"Was in Barcelona for a meeting with 8 and needed a meeting room for the team the suite at Barcelona plaza was a great solution hugely comfortable room with the added value of becoming a professional venue to have a meeting in the room. Sliding doors close off the bed and you have a suitable meeting room for 8 in the same price as the suite 
",5,2016,02,21
47,Honeymoon,Nice hotel...nice rooms...and the resepsion very friendly with us.we had every day free sauna to use.the parking is very safe.the internet Was ok.when we arrived at the room we had inside the room one shampagne.i will definitely come again.,5,2016,02,17
47,Beautiful experience,"This was my third visit to Barcelona with my partner and by far the best hotel we have stayed it. We booked the Catalonia Plaza only four days before arriving, as our trip was quite last minute! We had a good value deal and upon arrival everything was so easy. The lady at reception Sandra was excellent, so polite, helpul, friendly and she spoke great English. We went up to our room which was gorgeous and very clean with the most beautiful view of the Olympic park, city and roof top bar.

Great staff and great value.

We have no faults with this hotel and will without a doubt book it again. It is in the heart of Barcelona, surrounded by great restaurants and has easy access to all of Barcelona's attractions and transport links. It is highly recommended for a few nights away.",5,2016,02,15
47,It is the heart of Barcelona,"This time we lived only 1,5 km from the Plaza Catalonia and visited it everyday. It seems  to be a peaceful and beautiful place on the background of the crowded city. Children feed doves. Mothers are walking their babies. This is also the beginning of the famous Rambla Avenue. 

Here you may take the hip hop bus of one of r lines :red, green and grey. The most picturesque places such as Sagrada Familla, Hospital, Park Guell and many other are arranged on the red line. Better is to take three day  subscription and enjoy all favorite places day by day without hurry",5,2016,02,09
47,"Hot room, Cold breakfast","Although the room was basically comfortable, it was far too hot and it seemed impossible to change the temperature despite the air-conditioning switches. The bathroom was fine, as was the wifi connection. The breakfast was fair and the staff were very friendly and efficient. The cooked breakfast items didn't seem to be kept warm on hot plates, though.",3,2016,02,07
47,Christmas break,"We spent Christmas in Barcelona, staying in the catalonia plaza.
Very comfortable hotel with probably the most friendly and helpfull staff.
The hotel and its facilities met all our requirements and its location for visiting the city is great.
It has a relaxing atmosphere and great and reasonable restaurants to choose from and fantastic choice of breakfast.",5,2016,01,31
47,Catalonia Barselona Plaza,Catalonia Barselona Plaza-nice hotel and nice locations!very good staff!!and super breakfast!i recommended for everybody-nice Fontaine near the hotel!here have a stop Barselona city tour bus and metro and to Monserat,5,2016,01,31
47,Average,"Pros:
- good location
- nice bar on the rooftop
- clean
- friendly staff

Cons:
- standard rooms are below expectations - go for the upgrade
- modest breakfast
- uncomfortable bed and a pillow that is a joke

",3,2016,01,26
47,"Perfect location, nice rooftop area, breakfast nothing special","Stayed here 2 nights and it is the perfect location for a tourist being very close to the museums and galleries.  Staff were friendly and the room was comfortable.  I would stay here again.  The breakfast was ok, but the dining room felt like a school hall and was rather cold.  The food was fine but from a vegetarian point of view fruit and cake featured a lot.  The gym is very small but the rooftop area is nice with a lovely view over the city.  The entrance to the underground is right outside the front door as is the stop for the airport bus.",4,2016,01,24
47,Misery,"Miserable beds- on wheels- so you travel during the night, bed linen of polyester, stuffy smell in the corridors, cracked tiles in the bathroom. Damn shame. Positives- decent breakfast, good position(Plaza Espana). Avoid in big loop as it will spoil your expirience of a beautiful city.",1,2016,01,21
47,"Great hotel, super friendly staff!","I stayed in this hotel for two days because I was in Barcelona for a conference and I really, really liked it. My room was spacious and I LOVED that it had a door separating the bed area from the entrance to the room, which made it all much quieter. The staff was super friendly and very ready to help with anything. Breakfast was pretty great and the hotel is, overally, very tasteful in its decor.
Highly recommend!",5,2016,01,20
47,Will stay again,"It is a convenient and very nice hotel with good breakfast, friendly and professional staff. Just 20 min. from the airport. I was on business trip when stayed at the hotel, but I will choose this hotel again for my holiday.",5,2016,01,19
47,"Great Location, excellent for short breaks","Stayed here for 2 days for sight-seeing and Barcelona game in November.
Staff are very attentive and helpful. Hotel is in a prefect location: easy access to metro, Bull Ring shopping centre (and a few tapas restaurants) opposite, and a short walk to the museum and fountains. 
The airport direct bus stops right outside which is a real bonus.
Rooms were comfy, not huge, but tbh most time was spent outside. Very clean, good bathroom, comfy beds.
Breakfast was a very good buffet with a really good choice - from a fried breakfast to continental type. Stayed in Barca 5 times now, would go back to this hotel.",5,2016,01,16
47,"Great hotel,location good","This hotel is in great location,metro just outside,first stop for airport bus which only took about 20 to 25 mins to get there.The rooms were clean and comfortable,our room had view of the national art museum,a spectacular building,situated on Montjuic hill,easy walking distance.The city sightseeing bus stops on the Avenue that leads up to the national  art museum on the left hand side.Las Arenas shopping mall is opposite the hotel which was a former bull ring.The rooftop pool  has amazing views of the city and a lovely place to enjoy a drink at night.We had breakfast in hotel only once but did not enjoy it ,not enough choice of cooked food.There were plenty of nice places to have meals in nearby though!Definitely would stay here again!",4,2016,01,14
47,"Elegant & close to metro, bus, etc",This was a very nice hotel. A few stops from Sants train station. Also aerobús stops right in front of the hotel. I recommend room with a view to Plaza Espania. Breakfast buffet with lots to choose from (10 euros). Room & bath very spacious. Front desk very helpful. Good quality customer service from the moment I arrived. 5 minutes after getting to my room I received macarrons & a bottle of water.,5,2016,01,12
47,Our New Year celebration in Barcelona,"We stayed at Catalonia Barcelona Plaza for 4 nights two of those nights were miserable because of clogged up sink and shower which was never resolved also the entire luxury bathroom in room 803 smelled like a ditch. We were not able to move to an equivalent room because nothing was available.  

On the third day, we moved to the clock room with picture windows obviously cannot be opened for fresh air, no bathtub and smelled like cigarette smoke, then moved again to room 902 with corner view windows which was awesome -upon opening two windows, unbelievable amount of dusts blew all over the place! Third time, we moved to an equivalent priced room which was just on different floor this time... Minus the dust, clogged up plumbings, stench of ditch and cigarette. 

On the positive note, one of the managers did her best to make our stay better. After our complaints about the stench in the room, we were compensated for two nights.  She was able to give us a room which we booked for ""one with a clean room, with a view, a firm mattress, a big bathtub and everything working right this time.""

The Nespresso in the room was great but word of advice... Run the machine through to check the water quality.  We always do this and we were glad we did because the water that passed through the first time was green!  We highly recommend the Japanese Restaurant at the hotel.  We liked it so much that we ate there every night.

From the hotel, there is a decent view of the Magic Font about 1/2 kilometer away but one of the Venetian Tower blocks the center view.  The perfect view is from the center of the Placa d'Espanya but that circle is completely blocked on New Years Eve.

We were told that the spa facility was closed on New Years Day because the contract people were off.

Not all staff spoke enough English and the staff are inconsistent or not sure with what they are doing requiring to double check on their work.",3,2016,01,10
47,"Excellent, value-for-money ","Stayed for three nights, rooms were clean and large, but rather old. Beds could have been better quality but no complains considering the other perks of the hotel. Metro line located right outside hotel and many cafes line the streets. Hotel staff were EXCELLENT, special praise to Linda, great food recommendations given!!  Convenient to get to and fro the airport (direct bus A1 or A2) that stops opposite the hotel. Mall and super market right beside hotel, great to keep everyone occupied. Stay at this hotel for easy transfer to Montserrat (must-visit in Spain), walking distance to the fabulous art museum and for the local flavours (cafes and restaurants nearby). Waking distance to nearby night market. A couple of stops from la ramblas and passeig de Gracia, you can consider spending a few nights here and move to the main shopping strip.",4,2016,01,05
47,Good,Comfortable and well located in the center of the city with easy access by metro or bus. Walking distance from shopping center. It has an amazing view to the Plaza and you can walk to the Music Fountain in the evening to enjoy amazing colors and sounds.,4,2016,01,05
47,Great hotel in a great place!,"Clean, comfortable, fresh, quite luxurious, well located in a beautiful place near the center of the city, buses and metro stations just outside to take you everywhere you should go, two great restaurants (Japanese and Mexican), a huge shopping center just around the corner, nice breakfast. What else would you ask? I strongly recommend it.",5,2016,01,03
47,1 NIGHT STAY FOR CITY VISIT,"Hotel was very nice upon arrival. 
Checked in room and proceeded to room to discover the room had been smoked in! We called reception who sent a team member up with a can deordoriser!!!!! No bed was made for the children. 

Not over impressed with price we were paying.",3,2015,12,31
47,Decent Hotel - Excellent Location,"Stayed for a long weekend in December.  Hotel is in a first class location.  Had a double room on the 6th floor to the front of the hotel so came with great views.  The room itself was clean although felt a little tired.  Minor in the wider scheme of things however.  The hotel staff were friendly and very helpful.  A steady stream of taxi's at the front door so no issues there.  Breakfast was lovely although the dining area (covered courtyard) felt a little clinical for my taste.  The pool, although open, was not really suitable for the time of year so if your looking for a swim in winter time, the lack of an indoor pool is frustrating.  All in all, a lovely stay and would stay again.",4,2015,12,27
47,Birthday in Barcelona,"This hotel is amazing! It doesn't look much from the outside, but believe me, the rooms are lovely. We had a double room, it was quite small, but very clean and modern. The hotel is situated quite central to most sights in Barcelona. We jumped into taxis most of the time. Outside the hotel is the old bullfighting stadium, which is now a shopping mall, there is a huge roundabout / fountain which apparently has a light show some evenings. Across the roundabout a walk up is a museum up the steps - if you walk up behind there through the gardens you will find the Olympic Village. 
We didn't have a B&B rate, but next to the hotel are a couple of nice cafes to grab a coffee and bite to eat.
The rooftop has amazing views, a bar and a pool! It is very snazzy. I highly recommend the hotel and would definatly stay here again.",5,2015,12,19
47,"Prime Location, Great Staff","English can be a bit problematic in Spain but not in this hotel. Friendly, knowledgeable & welcoming staff, clean and well maintained rooms, prime location that was close to everything I wanted to do, easy access to taxi drivers, wonderful view over looking the Plaza Espana. Wonderful experience.",4,2015,12,16
47,Best hotel location,"We visited in November as part of Gate1 tour and were very impressed with quality and service.Great breakfast and dinner at the hotel.Next door to a great shopping mall that used to be a bullfight arena, which has good dining options for lunch and dinner.",5,2015,12,15
47,Highly Recommended,"Best hotel by far on our 21 days in Spain. So glad that we booked this hotel. Location is outstanding. Close to the Plaza de España, Centro commercial Arenas, Parc de Joan Miro among others. Parking available underground but also bus stops were all around the area. Noise was bearable, we actually opened the window couple of times during our stay too enjoy the breeze. The room was very spacious, bed was very comfortable, had double doors, mirrors, tea pot, good size tv, robe and sleepers. Laundry service affordable. The view from the pool area was breathtaking. Definitely will stay in this hotel in our future trips to Barcelona.",5,2015,12,11
47,Mr. Daniel Litani,"We spent three nights at this hotel and I can only praise this hotel. The location is excellent in Plaza Espanya. We had a room facing the plaza which was amazing. The urban view was outstanding and the noise was bearable. The hotel is situated right near the metro station which made our mobility very smooth.

The room was very pleasant and the bathroom in particular was a big surprise. The water pressure is something that you don't seldom see in hotels.

The staff was very hospitable and all our requests were met with a big smile and efficiency. 

We tried the breakfast buffet which was also very rich and tasty. 

I will surely recommend the hotel to anyone who wishes to spend a holiday in this exciting city.",5,2015,12,07
47,Nice and Clean,"Nice and very central.
Everything Works fine. It might be more suitable for business travel. There is quick entrance to the city center using af cab, which is always nearby.
Remember the Pool at the roof when its warm. Its a really nice detail.",4,2015,12,07
47,Very Curious,"My husband and I spent a night after our cruise here and we were very pleased with the service at the desk.  We had to walk with our suitcases a good distance because of a marathon that was taking place, but when we got there Francisco at the front desk said he was upgrading us to a penthouse suite.  We were very appreciative.  The suite was lovely with a view of the fountain and plaza.  Robes and slippers were on the bed and a bottle of champagne on the coffee table.  Also a nespresso machine in suite.  We were in time for a nice full breakfast buffet.  We were afraid that since it was Sunday nothing would be open but we went across the street to the old bullfighting arena and it is now a huge mall with 4 floors. Very nice.  Now for the curious part,  we also had a visitor .  I had dismissed it as someone possible drunk beating on the wrong door and talking loudly.  My husband got up and looked out and didn't see anyone.  Knowing that this has happened previously to other guests makes me wonder if empty rooms are being used by the employees without managers knowledge especially since this was a change of room for us.  The hotel might check into this as this is a little unnerving .",4,2015,12,06
47,A staff member entered our room in the night whilst we were sleeping!!,"At 5am on the first night of our stay at this hotel I was woken up by a loud knock on the door of our room. I was disorientated and confused why someone would be knocking on our door and before I could reach the door, a Spanish man entered our hotel room using a key card. I shouted “hello?!” to make him aware of our presence and he quickly retreated and shut the door. 
My partner immediately phoned reception, and we were told they did not know why this had happened but that we should come down to reception in a few hours and report it again. 
We did this and the lady at the reception told us that this is “hotel protocol” - the security guard goes round at night entering rooms and checking on people, or she said that our door must have been open and he shut it for us. That is not the case. Firstly, if the door was open, he could have just pulled it shut, he needn’t have knocked and then entered! Secondly however, our door was not open. This man entered our room using a key. 
If this is “hotel protocol” it is very worrying. Why is he entering the rooms of guests and intruding on their privacy whilst they are sleeping? I felt very unsafe for the rest of my stay in this hotel. Thankfully my partner studies at the University of Barcelona and I was able to store my valuables at his student residence.
What irritated me more was the excuse that was given to us as to why this had happened. Evidently it was either an employee error or it was something very suspicious and worrying. However, we received no apology and no compensation for what was actually a very frightening experience. 
It was such a shame considering that the hotel itself is very nice and the rooms are large and comfortable.
I certainly will not stay here again due to this incident and the way it was handled. I cannot believe that the hotel staff expected us to be ok with a stranger entering our room in the early hours of the morning to “check on us” without asking our permission or forewarning us.",1,2015,11,29
47,Central Location & Las Arenas,"Quality rooms with the usual amenities except no coffee/tea making facilities.  Good restaurants and conference facilities.  Staff very helpful and most speak good English and try hard to be helpful.  Interesting outdoor pool on the 8th floor and fitness facility and Spa on the 7th floor - but remember hours are 10-10 so an early morning workout may not be possible.  Location is ideal for those flying to Barcelona as the Airport bus (6 Euro) stops immediately outside the front door making the transfer from airport to hotel and vice versa really easy,",4,2015,11,29
47,Superior service finest rooms,First time in this hotel but truly impressed. Rooms are spacious and nicely decorated. Good selection of restaurants. Tried Japanese and breakfast which were all good. I also had a health problem and had to leave the hotel. Had great care from front office staff (Anastasiyya). Definitely on my list for Barcelona,5,2015,11,26
47,A Romantic Weekend Getaway Made Perfect,"You know those times where you book a vacation and hope everything works out? you're not sure about the flights or the hotel's location, the rooms etc.
And then you arrive, and everything is perfect - right away you've got a better than average start to your stay.

My wife and I were due for a vacation, and this was to be a combined birthday/anniversary vacation for both of us, so I decided to surprise her and upgraded us to a suite.

From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty, which is always nice, there's no separate check in for suites, but once they saw our room number flash up, we were given extra nice treatment - is that pretentious? possibly, but i couldn't care less.

Our suite was huge, far beyond what we'd imagined, a dining room table big enough for 8, with 3 comfortable sofas, a bathroom that felt downright decadent with its sheer size and a bed we wish we could take home with us because it was possibly the most comfortable we've ever slept on.

Throughout our stay the staff was always welcoming, helpful and eager to help, no matter the request.

Breakfasts, while not free with our booking were about 10 euros p/p and well worth it - an assortment of breads, cheeses, sausages omelettes and juices - more than enough to start your day right.

A special thank you goes to Dario, that took extra good care of us a couple of times and was a joy.

The hotel's Mediterranean restaurant - Filigrana was also superb, and while it too is a little on the pricey end of the scale, the food was great.

In short - we have a few other places we'd love to visit, but when we get around to making our return to Barcelona, this will surely be the hotel we stay at.",5,2015,11,24
47,Needs refurbishing,"Great location, close to all major part of the city, metro station just in front of the hotel.
Breakfast OK, but it is served in a place which is actually a tent, so at 7 in the morning before going to the airport it was freezing inside.
The rooms are really big, but old. My sink didn't work properly, so I came to the reception desk. They fixed it immediately, but the other morning it was not working again. The rooms need refurbishment.
The views from the top are magnificent.",3,2015,11,24
47,IBTM World 2015,"What I say,, a 3*** hotel, location ok, rooms simple, bad chair for the desk in the room, bar ok, friendly staff, fast check in and out.
Metro is going under the hotel and you know when train is passing.",3,2015,11,23
47,Excellent location with a good price/value,"I've been here a couple of days ago for a business trip. The location of the hotel is excellent, not so far from the airport and close enough basically to everything in the city centre.
The hotel itself is not the latest greatest design, but the price is according to it. The room was OK, except the missing plugs (only 1 available in my room). The new from the room is perfect, specially in the evenings. The top roof swimming pool of course beautiful.
The breakfast are a little bit old school, but the staff tries everything to host you the best level. They are very fast and polite, it's even compensating the sometimes cold fried eggs :)
Minus: I would have liked to use the safe in the room, but the answer was ""sorry we don't have more keys are available"". (you should ask for the keys at the reception)
Overall a good hotel, I would recommend it whether for business or holiday visits.",4,2015,11,22
47,Amazing views,"We were fortunate to be upgraded to a suite and had amazing views from the room. Francisco and his staff were gracious, professional and accommodating. The pool deck also affords fabulous views. The room was very clean. The location is very convenient to the airport bus which stops in front of the hotel. The Poble Espanyol, Art Museum, Magic Fountains and Olympic sites are all within a leisure walk.",5,2015,11,20
47,Do NOT stay here if you want to enjoy your visit to Barcelona,"I can't believe this hotel is rated so high. If you don't trust me, read the following: 
- I arrive and they give me one of the worst rooms - garbage dumpster is right outside my room. When I ask for a change, I am told hotel is full. 
- I request for a safe deposit key as they have old boxes that require physical key  - I am told all keys are out and they don't have any to give me and to check tomorrow and said ""Sorry"". I check the next day, same story - they are good at saying ""Sorry""
- I ask for a hotel card so I have a card in case I need to show to the taxi driver - They have run out of cards!! they are sorry
- I am very cold at night so I ask why heater is not working, I am told, we don't start heater until two more weeks. Sorry. If you want a blanket, we can give you one.
- When I ask about blanket, I am told, since there is no one at the reception, and one person has to be at reception, they cannot get me a blanket until 11:30 at night. If I say, I am willing to go down to get it, I am told, that won't work as they need to look for a blanket and one person needs to be at reception all the time!!
- In the morning, when I want tea in a kettle, as I need more than one cup, they have run out of kettle! they are sorry!
- I booked this hotel as it was recommended for a world Expo and when I asked them about Expo, they said, they don't know! No one at the reception has any courtesy or friendly attitude. No one really cares. 

I had one of the worst possible experience at this place. 

Only good thing is, the location. Breakfast was decent. That's why I give 2 and not 1.

47,Barcelona hotel,Excellent location clean and spacious   Buffet breakfast for 10 euro with very good selection and convenient    In front of a nice rotonda also walking distance from museo national a must to see for free. Very near the airport also easily reached using public bus . Lots of coffee shops and restaurants around the area. Taxi always available in front of hotel and metro subway right in front too,4,2015,11,17
47,Not 4 stars and beware fake upgrades ,"We stayed here for 4 nights whilst my husband was at a conference. 
Room are basic and showing signs of wear and tear and cracked tiles and mouldy bathrooms predominate. 
The hotel on check in gave us a room with 2 single beds , we requested a double as was on our booking form and the hotel did change our room after one night. They said we have upgraded you to the only room available. We asked if there was a charge and there was a unanimous ""no"". 
On check out we were however charged for a premium room and due to the language barrier it was hopeless arguing with them. 

On a positive note the breakfast was good and the location excellent. 
Our view from our room of the plaza was excellent. 
However due to the faded state of the room we wouldn't stay here again. 

",3,2015,11,15
47,Perfect hotel to stay when visiting Barcelona,"I was here for a business visit of the Fira. Perfect location as the hotel is walking distance. But I found out later that this hotel is very well situated in Barcelona and will be my hotel for my next stay too.
Pleasant staff, beautiful hotel, superb pool and bar on top make the hotel also a nice place for relaxing.
Fira on walking distance, the arena next door. Most places reached within 10 minutes of taxi driving.",5,2015,11,14
47,Nice hotel in the heart of barcelona!,"Stayed 7 days in the hotel in august. 
The hotel location is amazing! just right by plaza espanya, a mall and a metro station. 
there is an amazing view from the rooftop of the hotel where the swimming pool is. 
the breakfast is great with a wide variety of food. 
there is a wide variety of attractions and restaurants near the hotel 24/7.

The hotel is Espanya Square. Not far from the fountain. In front of the palace. The hotel half an hour walk from Catalunya",4,2015,10,29
47,"Large rooms, extremely noisy","The suites on floor 12 offer great views over Barcelona at fair prices. They are large, modern furniture and good amenities, incl Nespresso coffee maker.

The design is modern and fresh. 

Unfortunately the windows don't block the street noise at all (I thought first that they are not closed at all), making sleep come late after all traffic stops and made me wake up when morning traffic commences after 6am.

The hotel has two good restaurants (international and Japanese), great outdoor bar (with lousy bartender). Breakfast buffet is modest and lobby /reception professionals but rather slow.

Good and central business hotel. ",3,2015,10,27
47,A very pleasant hotel with great service,This is the third time I stay in this hotel while attending a conference in Barcelona. The rooms are big and has all the things you need when on a conference.  The staff is very friendly and not formal and accept any requests from the visitors request. They serve a very good breakfast so one can go to his conference on a fool stomach. I will surely visit Barcelona again and I will surely stay in this hotel again.,5,2015,10,22
47,Not worth it!!,"The negatives way out weigh the positives with this hotel. The positives are location/view and the friendly, helpful staff. That's where the good stops. The place is run down and dingy - from the lobby furniture to the rooms. Our bathroom had mold in the shower tiles all around it and in the corners all around the flooring. The bed was so uncomfortable I couldn't sleep and I was SO sore!! It was AWFUL - we could feel the springs poking through. There was no iron in the room. There is a  dead bolt, but no chain - so anyone with a master key can come in anytime. There was no bottled water in the room. There was no safe key. We had to call and request a safe key and an iron - it took TWO days to get one because they were out!! The hair dryer smelled like it was burning up and was so weak it was faster to air dry my hair. Walls are paper thin, so we could hear people next to us coughing or sneezing and we could hear/feel every single metro train that came into the station near the hotel. The breakfast was atrocious... don't waste your money or time on that. Yuck! Several times we came in at different hours to find NO one behind the counter and no security by the door - no wonder security is a problem here!! Stayed here two years ago and it wasn't this bad... this place has seriously been run down. Avoid!!",1,2015,10,22
47,"Good place, poor staff","The hotel's location is very good. Reception guy (with desk) lied me and didn't pay interest when he arranged my room. Actually he didn't arranged my room, he passed me to another guy after 1 hour wait. Cleaning wasn't good.",3,2015,10,20
47,the forth star is coming loose,"at the entrance, and that's the general impression i got from this place. the room felt shady, the lobby has worn out feeling and so on.
theere were some good things though: the wifi was ok, the roof top pool bar looked good and the personnel was helpful.",3,2015,10,20
47,Good if you need a place to sleep,"My company booked this hotel for me during a venue.

The breakfast was good, but room are old fashioned and need renovation, beds are that hard, I couldn't sleep the first night until 2:30 am.

If there is any noise on the floor or a different room, coup can here everything.

If someone above or besides you takes a shower, or uses the toilette you can here it.

I know much better places to stay.",3,2015,10,17
47,Great access to congress & reasonably good services,"I stay at this hotel every year for congress attendance at the nearby Fira de Barcelona. Staff are polite and attentive, there is an eighth floor outdoor pool and spa, both nice and room service was good with good food choice. The rooms are spacious (I had a twin) though the beds were a bit hard for a four star and you could feel the springs a bit too much. Rooms were very clean. Ask for inner rooms away from the street then it is quiet.",4,2015,10,17
47,3 star hotel posing as a 4 star,"On arrival there was no doorman to assist with luggage (I am partially disabled).  On check in the reception desk REQUIRED that I PREPAY for my 6 day stay because I may skip out and not pay ... very insulting and there was no availability at other hotels so I could leave.  The 'bar' reminded me of my high school cafeteria, no ambiance, contained the breakfast buffet equipment, one option for red wine and never heard of it. You have to walk through the main lobby to get to the 7th floor pool.  You have to walk through one restaurant/dining room to get to the second one.  Sleeping was difficult with no sound proofing ... laminate floors in halls and rooms, staff vacuuming halls at 7:00 a.m., street noise.  There was a uniformed employee in the main lobby (security?) that didn't speak any English ... first hotel in our 5 week Southern Europe vacation where we encountered that.",3,2015,10,16
47,"Location, Location Location.","Planned a girlfriends' trip with a party of 12 for my 50th birthday. Great Stay. Hotel staff Alicia, Martha et al were very professional & flexible as I had cancellations and travel plan changes till the last minute. However, we had to wait till the 2pm check in in spite of arriving from 8 plus long hours of flight. The daily breakfast buffet was to die for. Some staff Tensee( hope I am right) and Dario were outstanding. The location was awesome. Central and accessible with Metro stop at your door step and the Airport AeroBus Shuttle too! Right adjacent to a mall, great places to eat all around and souvenirs are cheaper from the vending stations across the road than at LaRambla. The Flamenco Show in the mall next door (4th floor) though small,was very cozy and the dancers were excellent. Manager was very nice, professional and helpful. Threw in drinks for a discounted price. Had an overall wonderful and unforgettable experience.",4,2015,10,14
47,"One of the best locations, good breakfast","I place my review along with many 3 star reviewers. As a frequent traveller with discriminating taste I feel there are many aspects which keep the hotel from the truly superb hotels of the world. The location is unbeatable. Subway entrance in front of the lobby. Bus connections everywhere. A stone's throw from the national museum and olympic park. The building is a bit run down, though. Cracks, peeling wallpaper, dirty aging corners and the like. If management/owners put a couple of million into renovation got might become a top destination hotel. Breakfast was good, standard. Overall a good experience in a fabulous city. ",3,2015,10,14
47,Very satisfied,"First I want to mention the staff which is great especially all the people working at the front desk! Smiling and helpful all the time. The hotel itself is very good, the rooms are clean and spacious, the breakfast room is very nice as well. The subway is right outside the hotel door, so you can go anywhere within short time.",5,2015,10,10
47,Stunning city views,"Sited smack bang in the heart of this amazing cultural city. From the 8th floor rooftop pool you get stunning views of the most amazing scenery, and setting Sun; the Olympic Stadium is seemingly within touching distance, the beautiful fountains dance at night to a wonderful music and light display. All this for less than a 3€ bus ride from the Airport! Looking forward to breakfast on the terrace after a lovely sleep in my exceptionally comfortable bed in my very quiet room.....happy days!",4,2015,10,09
47,Great place to stay,"The location of this hotel is exceptional for tourists. The Metro is right outside, a shopping center is across one street, an beautiful fountain is right in front, and the site of a summer Olympics is just down the street. We had a little trouble at the reception desk when we checked in, but the manager of the front desk named Tenzin straightened everything out for us the next morning. The breakfast buffet was fine and the rooms were fine and quiet, despite the relatively heavy traffic outside. Oh yes, the rooftop pool and sundeck were wonderful.",4,2015,10,08
47,One of the best locations in Barcelona,"Hotel was very nice friendly staff, clean large rooms, very comfy.  Pillows not great.  Breakfast was good but unless its included I wouldn't pay for it - I would have gone next door to the shopping arena where there are a ton of cafes.",5,2015,10,08
47,Great for one night before flight out of El Prat as alternative to airport hotel.,"Stayed one night before flight out. Convenient due to the bus that goes to terminal 1 or 2 every 5 minutes. Hotel is large, a bit hectic due to large amount of guests and very busy area. walking distance to magic fountains show and decent rooms. Not inexpensive choice. Cafe to the left has great tea.",3,2015,10,03
47,Barcelona Plaza,"The hotel was ok. Room was nice, except the bathroom that was quite dirty. Laundry service really fast and great quality. Food (breakfast) was ok. The only issue was that the windows in the room were facing the view point in the roof of the shopping center, so curtains needed to be closed all the time unless you wanted to be watched via binoculars available.",3,2015,10,03
47,BRAVO for the Barcelona Plaza Hotel!,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 3 days.We were with a tour group of 35.The hotel has a very wide glass entrance and a large and beautiful lobby. The rooms were large enough and very well appointed. The hotel also had a daily breakfast that had plenty of anything that you might want to eat. Also,this hotel is very conveniently located in Barcelona with easy access to a lot of different places. All of the staff at this hotel were very pleasant and accommodating. We definitely will return to this hotel.",5,2015,09,29
47,Barcelona Plaza Top Hotel,"What a beautiful Hotel !! I stayed here during a working visit, so not exactly a holiday but non the less, the stay was perfect. A very well situated hotel, the roof top bar offers outstanding views of Barcelona, at night, when the waterfalls are lit up, amazing sight.The food was nice and the rooms very clean indeed.
The one and only very minor grey cloud was the roof top bar did not allow the drinks to be charged to the room, all over the world you can do this, even in the hotel itself, but the roof top bar, nope, so I was a little put out by having to go back to my room for cash/card.
Just wish I knew before hand is all I say.
Overall, top place and would happily bring my Mrs here for a few days in Catalonia !!",5,2015,09,29
47,One of the best I have stayed in - exceptional good reception service!,"I stayed there for five nights. The service is really good, breakfast nice and the pool on the 8th floor just fantastic. But I have to say that the reception service was really nice and personal. You could feel welcomed and I had the feeling they knew me all the time. Specially Dario - I have to say, ask for Dario and you will be really well taken care of. He is very knowledgeable and does more than you can expect from the reception. Rooms are clean. Lobby also.",5,2015,09,29
47,Outstanding Hotel,"I loved everything about this hotel which is located across from the Plaza de Espana and next door to Las Arenas de Barcelona Shopping Center.  The metro stop is also located yards from the hotel.

Our room was on the 2nd floor and large enough for two people.  The bath featured a tub and shower combination and had wonderful toiletries and a hairdryer. The room also had a flat screen TV and small refrigerator.  

Breakfast was included in our package and the selections were plentiful.  Omelette station, breads, meats, cheeses and fruits.  

Everyone from the front desk staff to maintenance were all extremely helpful.  In the event you do not bring a computer or tablet with you, there are three computers for use in the lobby.

We did go up to view the rooftop swimming pool and it looked spectacular.  It was just a little too windy on the day we went to have drinks but this would be an ideal spot to unwind on a warmer day.",5,2015,09,28
47,Unbeatable Location,"I was here for a conference but many other guests were clearly on holiday. It's an excellent, if slightly, expensive hotel because it's on the Plaza D-Espana at the foot of the steps down from the Palaa Nacional on Montjuic.

The rooms are very good and the restaurant serve a good breakfast with lots of options.

There is a roof top bar on the 8th floor which has really stunning views of Barcelona but beware because the bar prices are extortionate!",4,2015,09,28
47,Amazing Location,"Lets just talk about the location first. Right in front you have the Plaza de espana , the magic fountain , what else do you need. 
The hotel is clean and the staff both front and back end if very helpful. The hotel is clean and the rooms are big.",5,2015,09,27
47,Poor event management,"We purchased tickets to be on the rooftop terrace in order to view the fireworks show for La Merce.  When I called ahead I was told it would open at 8, when we arrived, we were told 8:30, and when we again tried to get on the elevators, were told 9.  We lined up at 8:45, and then the woman controlling access to the elevators let in a group of about 8 who appeared from around the corner.  More confusion involving wheelchair bound guests ensued.  By the time we, who had been first in line, were allowed to the rooftop, all of the chairs and bar spots at the terrace edge were taken.  We had specifically planned this in advance as I am unable to walk or stand due to a foot injury and needed a place to sit.  So, here I stand, awaiting the show.  Good view though.  ",2,2015,09,24
47,good location and great rooftop bar,"stayed here on the recommendation of a friend as being reasonably priced and good location.  Both were true, although I still thought it was expensive but then I'm travelling on Australian dollars.  Hotel itself seemed to be used by tour groups as there were always great numbers of people in the lobby.  Rooms didn't have balconies so not particularly nice to hang around in but then that's not what you are in Barcelona for.  A bigger drawback was no tea or coffee making facilities in the room.  That would have been great when you wake up in the morning.  Rooftop bar has great views and a lovely pool.  Location is very convenient - close to the tourist and airport bus stops and metro and walking distance to the Ramblas etc.  Around the hotel are cheap little bodegas and pastry shops which are much better than the offerings in the bullring next door.",4,2015,09,24
47,Great Location,"Stayed at this hotel for four nights.  Had stayed here before in 2004 and loved it.  Was't disappointed this time as although hotel has been refurbished all the great things about it still the same.  Great location, easy reach of airport by Aerobus (stops right outside hotel).  All the hop on hop off buses also stop in Plaza Espanya.  The Arena adjacent to the hotel (refurbished Bull Ring) now a shopping complex and cinema is great.  Lots of cafes and restaurants.  There is also a supermarket on the lower level.  The rooms are modern, clean and very comfortable.  Bathroom with bath/shower was lovely.  Few little niggles: no coffee/tea making facilities in room which was a pain but we brought our own just in case.  Hairdryer is wired in to bathroom so cannot do hair while partner using bathroom.  No mirror above dressing table so only option is bathroom.  Could have done with a couple more plugs to charge things.  Safe is in cupboard on floor so you have to get on hands and knees to use it - this was really, really annoying and impossible if you have mobility issues.  You have to get a lock from reception to use it but it was free to use.  On arrival we were asked if we would like to upgrade to a better view at a cost of 15 euros per day.  We declined this offer and were put in a side room facing the Arena which was fine.  Very quiet and a good view of the Arena.  We were really glad we didn't waste the money as the fountains were switched off all week while they prepared for the festival (erecting. Stage etc.) Breakfast is served in a large hall.  Feels a bit like a college dining room but the buffet is great and although it's noisy it's not a bad experience - lots to watch if you like people watching.  Although the cost of breakfast said 16 euros on booking it was reduced to 9 euros each per day for guests.  I used the wifi which was great and also the guest PC in the lobby to check in for the return flight.  The printer wasn't working but  staff were helpful and I emailed the hotel and they printed them for me.  Would I stay here again?  Yes, without hesitation.  It was a lovely holiday and the hotel was a big part of that.",4,2015,09,19
47,Good location for sightseeing transport,"The best thing about this hotel was the rooftop bar as it had amazing views both day and night.
The worst thing, in my opinion, was the breakfast.  The breakfast area looked like a school canteen with canteen food to match.  Save your money and eat breakfast out!
The rooms were adequate for a one night stay, very basic and I don't think were good value for money.",4,2015,09,16
47,Very good facility and amenities,"Room was good, although view was disappointing. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Free WiFi. Some of our party are not keen on metro preferring taxis - fares to some of the points of interest we wanted to see was under 10 euros with tip (group of 5 needing larger vehicle). Pool and bar service at pool was very good. Great views. Note that fountains nearby do not come on until late afternoon and evening - very beautiful when they do. Arena next door was interesting. Would definitely stay again however if I knew we would be attending tours etc related to old town and Gaudi may stay closer to that area.",4,2015,09,14
47,"located close to the tube, easy for join the ""ramblas"" or the congress center","the tube station is just front of the lobby, so easy for visit Barcelona by Tube, bus. Also easy for join the congress center by bus or by taxi (almost 6 to 8 €) .
The breakfast is very good, with a wide choice, and a good orange juce and other fruts juce. The swiming pool on the roof offer a nice view on the arena and the Catalunya art Museum.  Room are wide and correct, but there is a lack of renewing in the room. The fridge was out of order, the roof of the bath room has a water damage and has not been repaint. Although the team is friendly and well take care of you, the room are disappointing.",4,2015,09,12
47,"Loved Barcelona, and loved Catalonia Barcelona Plaza!","The location was awesome. Walking distance to The Arena (a shopping mall with a great food court, observation deck, movie theatre, supermarket and a Flamenco dancing show) and the National Museum of Art with a musical fountain show daily at 9pm. The Aerobus stand is right outside the hotel and costs €6 per adult one way to the airport. The Barcelona City Tour bus has a stop, a two minute walk from the hotel. 
The hotel, itself, was clean, comfortable and had all the extra amenities, like a gym, a spa, a pool, room service and the staff were all very friendly and willing to help with anything.
The best breakfast buffet I've had, outside of Sri Lanka, where the buffets are out of this world! 
It was just my husband and I this time around, but I saw many families with small kids and noted that they have family suites as well.
Although many places offer wifi, it can be patchy and sometimes, not work well at all, but at Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, the wifi was excellent and we were able to video FaceTime our kids at any time of day.
Will definitely stay there again, if I go back to Barcelona. Can be recommended for business trips as well as for couples and families.",5,2015,09,10
47,Bad management,"I have arrived there at 21h from London alone after booking and paying by card 200 euro. I was surprised to find that they are Fully booked!!! Two receptionist were wondering if they should give me a superior room but one of them refused forcing me to cancel my reservation after 2 hours of waiting. As a lady in barcelona for the first time, I refused. Some of the receptionist Were very nice (the ladies mainly) however one of the receptionist was very rude telling to his collegue in spanish we can not do anything for her She has to cancel we did more than we should and that all. As if i was asking the room for free knowing that the room is already paid. I asked for a manager or someone superior but in vain. No manager available to solve the problem. All what they offered is that i cancel and they give me back my money and they might call to find if there is any other hotel available. What a shame for a 4* hotel!!! And what a shame for the tourism in barcelona! ",1,2015,09,07
47,Perfect Location with Every Possible Facility,"My partner and I booked here for a 4 night stay in August. The location was absolutely perfect - right in the centre of town by the magic fountains, literally right next to the metro and directly opposite Las Arenas Shopping Mall which offers a 360 degree view of the city as well as numerous lovely restaurants. 

Whilst we didn't spend that much time in the hotel other than to sleep and shower (Barcelona has a lot to offer!) we thought the room was lovely. The bed was huge, it was very clean (cleaned everyday too), the bathroom was large and clean and it wasn't noisy at all. 

The two drawbacks were how expensive the breakfast was. $16 each everyday on top of what you're paying for the hotel is a lot but it also very good food with a great selection. Secondly, although the rooftop pool and bar was absolutely gorgeous, there were not nearly enough sun loungers etc for everyone which meant that you had to fight for your space or sit up on one of the bar stools to sunbathe - not ideal. The view from up there though is spectacular.

Would 100% recommend!",5,2015,09,04
47,Fair enough,This hotel is a pretty well 4 stars that has a friendly staff and a good position. The pool is a great plus and so is the gym. Architecture is basic for these kind of hotels. Luxury but no originality.,4,2015,09,01
47,The hotel of No,"The hotel management seems to have a ""No"" philosophy based on lots of rules. Definitely not the easy-going Barcelona type establishment. 

No to a hot water pot for our two year old, no to traditional room service (choices were tele-pizza and very expensive and error-prone Japanese), no to helping us out with our AppleTV connection, no to taking a beer from the pool to the room, etc., etc. You get the idea. 

Big hotel with zero personality. Many of the staff tried their best but it just felt like management runs the place by the numbers and the rules, not by the heart. A pity. 

Almost forgot: English language skills were generally poor. We try to speak Spanish of course, but basics such as asking for a hot water pot (answer was no!) were difficult at best.

Lots of other more friendly hotels in Barcelona!",2,2015,08,31
47,Amazing Roof Terrace saved the day,"The hotel lacked a few amenities but in general it was a good hotel for the money. The roof terrace bar and view was excellent and probably saved the day for me. One word of advice don't take creased clothes because you will struggle to get an iron and board. 5 attempts in one day to get one :(

PS go to La Roca shopping outlet village. Bus goes from Paseo Gracias I think it's spelt. Cost €20 one way and the best shopping mall for me outside the U.S.  Felt like I was in Vegas. Best Paella was 7 Portes, always delivers ",3,2015,08,31
47,Great rooftop bar,"If you like a rooftop pool, this is a great attraction.  The service was super friendly but was slow - they needed another team member at the bar! That said, the view was amazing and plenty of sun loungers and the pool itself was a good size.

The rooms were clean, a little dated / needing some maintenance. A door was missing off a cabinet and the shelving had seen better days.

The buffet breakfast had a good choice, but we have had better, the Japanese restaurant downstairs is worth checking out though.

",4,2015,08,31
47,"Great for bigger groups, location a little out of the way","I stayed here with a large group in August - the multiple elevators made check in and out a breeze.  Breakfast was very good.  Room was quiet and clean, though bed was like a rock. Bathroom was large as was bathtub/shower.  Pool area was beautiful - it was a bit rainy while I was there so didn't get to use it much.  Sangria in the downstairs bar was not very good at all - in fact I'm not sure if the bartender even knew how to make it b/c she kept checking recipe. Internet was very good and reliable.

Proximity was good to the 'dancing foutains' as well as a nice mall (transformed bull fighting arena) across the street, but it is a 10-15 minute cab ride to many of the major tourist destinations like Sagrada Familia and Las Ramblas. There is a subway station right outside though, and given more time to learn the system this would likely be a good solution.

Overall a very good stay, though if choosing accomodations for myself I would have likely stayed closer to the Ramblas or Plaza de Catalonia (speaking of - if you give a cab directions to hotel make sure they don't leave you there - this hotel is on Plaza Espana!)",4,2015,08,30
47,A first it seemed our holiday would be a disaster but absolutely over the moon with our stay....,When we arrived at the hotel we were informed our room had been double booked. As much as this at first seemed unbelievable the receptionist Lucie and Manager Tamazin ( maybe got the names slighlty wrong ) really did go out the way to compensate. We were put up right in the centre of the city for one night at a fantastic hotel where there paid our taxi's to and from and also have our room upgraded. This meant we could see another part of the city. We then returned to the Catalonia for our remaining 2 nights to find our room had been upgraded again along with x4 free drinks at the roof top bar which is breathtaking. The location of this hotel was perfect. Mistakes can happen and The Catalonia certainly made up for theirs. We will be back to Barcelona again and we will definitely booking The Catalonia Plaza again. Would like to say thanks to all the staff there they were very helpful and friendly which is just what you want.,5,2015,08,26
47,Perfect location with amazing views from the rooftop pool area,"Firstly it's worth saying that whilst overall I was very happy with my stay here, when I arrived we had issues settling in and the first 2 days were far good... And if it wasn't for a gentleman named Alex who saved the day my opinion of this place would have been very different!

Before I go into detail on the issue we experienced on the 1st and 2nd day of our stay I just want to say that despite that me and my girlfriend had an amazing holiday here and overall were extremely satisfied. We've since recommended it to others who have now booked their next holiday there.

I loved the rooftop pool and bar area which has amazing views of the Plaça d'Espanya. The food at the bar was also really good. And the location couldn't have been better for us, right in the middle of a known local attraction with a tube station right outside the front door and a very convenient shopping mall next door. However beware that the drinks at the bar are a bit overpriced.   

Ok so now into the issue we had at the start... It started when we were checked into a room that wasn't cleaned properly, so I asked if we could get moved to another room and whilst I was at it I also asked if we could upgrade to a room with a better view. We got told that there weren't any other rooms available but they would move us the following day. So come the next day we packed up our stuff and got moved to a room with a better view, however this one had twin beds.. As a couple it was obvious we wanted a double bed (and I had specified this) so I don't know what that particular member of the reception staff was thinking. So we then got told that if we want a double bed we need to downgrade back to a standard room. I reluctantly accepted not knowing that they were moving us to a smoking room (we booked non-smoking) with a terrible view of a graffiti infested back ally on the 1st floor... Long story cut short we got messed around, until I called reception and spoke to someone else (a guy called Alex - member of the reception staff) who came straight up to my room to speak face to face and vowed to sort everything out. And he did exactly that! Found us a upgraded room with a double bed and better view just as we had asked. His approach to the situation and mannerism was excellent and I was very grateful with how quickly he sorted everything out, great guy and fantastic service.

I would definitely recommend upgrading to a room with a view (or partial view) towards the Plaça d'Espanya. It's a beautiful view and really made a difference. 

In summary despite this issue I had a fantastic holiday and would definitely recommend this place. It helped that we also got a good deal as part of a package holiday.",5,2015,08,24
47,Great location for a city break,"We had read the reviews prior to travel and as such I asked for the safe key at check in .He was a very friendly and polite receptionist and continued to help throughout are stay,however he hadn't mentioned the safe key until I asked so a good tip to save a journey back down. Also the lock to the safe I was given did get stuck but unlike other reviewers when I called the reception they sent the repair man within ten minutes and it turned out I'd put it in upsidedown but there were no directions.Having said this ,the rooms were lovely ,the continental breakfast stated by BA  holidays was much more then I expected the pool on the rooftop was wonderful(admittedly bar prices were expensive) with fantastic views .",4,2015,08,24
47,good improvements,"We always stay at the plaza when we go to Barcelona, but we were very satisfied with the new improvements in the pool. The only thing it surprised us was the fact that we could not pay with our room card at the bar near the pool. Why????",4,2015,08,23
47,Great location but very noisy busy hotel with indifferent service ,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights & were disappointed in the noise & service here. Although it's in a great spot & right near trains & buses The hotel has floorboards through out making the place very noisy at all times of the day & night & because the hotel has a wide variety of customers, through out the night we were woken up by loud noises & footsteps. Although fellow patrons were not all that disorderly it was noisy due to the thin walls & floorboards. The staff were indifferent & quite unfriendly & breakfast very average - almost cafeteria like with line up for the coffee. Would not recommend this hotel. ",3,2015,08,21
47,Very Busy Hotel,"Our group of 50 stayed here for 3 nights.  this is a very busy hotel, with lots of groups during out stay.  The location was good, the pool and views form the roof top were very nice.  They served a better than average breakfast,  had good wifi service, and the elevators were very fast despite how many people were in the hotel.  great location by lots of restaurants and stores

The negatives:  Very weird procedure for using the safe in your room:  You had to have a special key from the front desk, that every time I asked (which was many)  there were never any keys available.  The clerk did offer to lock our valuables in their safe (which we did), but they didn't offer that to everyone who asked.

They also had very few plugs in the room, and none by the bedside.  I needed to use a sleep machine, and asked for an extension cord.  This request, and the request for more pillows were never filled.  We just got tired of asking....
An iron in the room would have also been nice, and a posting of the wifi password.  I don't think a guest should have to call down to the desk for it...",4,2015,08,20
47,Expensive for an average hotel,"Don´t get me wrong, the Hotel is okay. It is very well located and the staff is fine, they hardly notice you but do their job. However, when you are used to travelling in Asia, this is not 4 stars by any means and it is hell expensive for what it offers. Everything is just fine. It´s busy. Noone really cares for you. The rooftop pool and bar have an amazing view, but I ordered clams and they served me canned clams, in Spain... It is fine. It is enough and clean. But it is very expensive. Not worth the value for money in my opinion. And definetly not a 4 star hotel.",3,2015,08,18
47,Great views from roof,"The third hotel stay in 8 days.  Travelled from London (nice location nice service ) to Palma Mallorca ( nice but different, nice location. So so service) to Barcelona. Three different cultures, styles and locations.  Catalonia Barcelona was 1st in 3 lodgings. The view from the roof, day or night was undescribleable  the Fountain light show was like being in Las Vegas.  Very nice location for a 10€ cab ride for 4 to Old Town, the Casino.  
Many different types of stores around the area and the old bull ring converted into a mall was fabulous for shops and restaurants.  Many different bars and eateries for anyone's tastes.  
Bed size and comfort was questioned. Only had 2 electric plugs per room and had to 1 key in room to re- charge pads, phones and cameras.  ",4,2015,08,17
47,5 night stay,"The hotel it's self is wonderful, and lived up to our expectations. Staff at reception were really helpful and polite. Bar staff at the pool however came across rude and arrogant. The prices for drink at the pool bar also fluctuated daily and were not consistent or what was stated on the bar menu. We only had breakfast once due to there not being enough options of what we wanted to eat and the actual breakfast area where you self serve being way to hectic for that time in the morning. 
The hotel was a great location with easy access to metro and airport bus. Our hotel room was really clean and had everything we were looking for, only downside was our view which looked into private flats. I would stay here again and would recommend.",4,2015,08,17
47,Pleasantly Surprised,"Having just returned from a 7 night stay at the Barcelona Plaza, both myself and my partner were pleasantly surprised with this hotel. After reading some of the negative reviews on TripAdviser, we were naturally worried about our stay; taking extra precautions and expecting the worse. 

Our flight time and taxi journey meant that we arrived well before our designated check in period, but we were greeted with a smile and told that our room was ready. (Although I will add that the actual check in period looked much busier!)

The room itself had a picturesque view of the Plaça d'Espanya, with excellent air conditioning. The room had a luxurious feel, with a fully stocked mini bar and satellite TV (Channel 11 for Premier League football - much to my partners dismay!). The safe didn't have a locking mechanism, but we found padlocks on our suitcase were a suitable replacement. The house keepers cleaned our rooms daily, were very friendly and respected the do not disturb sign when we used it. 

The rooftop bar and pool area was very busy during the day, the beds were excellent but you would have to arrive early to secure one. It did, however, offer superb views of Barcelona in many directions. At night we were able to watch the magic fountain from here, enjoying a drink from a fantastic selection of beverages, which we found to be a real selling point. 

This hotel could have received the full star rating for the rate we paid, however there were some aspects of our stay that weren't great. 

Firstly, there were some staff at the hotel who were simply rude. (Although the vast majority were very pleasant!) Be prepared to prove you are staying at the hotel when relaxing at the rooftop area with two words: ""Room Card!"" 

In addition to this, don't except a warm welcome from man who works in the hotel lobby, he looked bored and frustrated. The looks he gave us suggested that he was unhappy at our presence rather than being happy the hotel was receiving our custom.  

It also seemed as if they made up the prices at the bar by the pool. A beer on the menu was €4.00, this changed to €5.00 and €6.00 on different occasions throughout the week. 

We also found it very strange that we couldn't purchase a bottle of wine on two occasions. The first excuse being no bottles after 8 o'clock, the next day no bottles after 7 o'clock. I have never experienced this before and felt very awkward trying to justify my choice in front of other guests.

We were excited to try the sushi restaurant on site, but this was closed on every occasion we wanted to eat there. I believe it's only open on a Friday and Saturday. 

Overall, we had an excellent stay here. The metro and tour of Barcelona bus is literally outside the door - meaning you can easily explore the city. The magic fountain is a short walk away and there is a shopping centre next door which offers a great selection of food and shops. Unless we were very fortunate, do not be put off by negative reviews of this hotel. We would highly recommend you give it a go. Thank you to the majority of staff at the hotel for our brilliant experience with you. Iron out the creases and you're onto a winner with this establishment.

47,Near metro station,"Their receptionists are good in speak english and nice to give explanation about must visit place in barcelona. This hotel very near metro station, only 10 step.This hotel also near main station, we pay 12euro (include tip) for taxi from main station to hotel. We love their restaurant for breakfast, the place is big with variation of foods and they also have good coffe machines. To go to la ramba, you can use metro station. Their room is good, big, and clean. Their swimming pool in top floor.",4,2015,08,15
47,Great place with the best pool ever ,"We stayed here for four nights bed and breakfast recently. Location was great. On top of a metro station. Near fountains. Across road from a pick up point for bus tour. Busy area and next to a shopping arena. Check in staff. Very helpful, no issues, not out of this world but did well. Rooms. Walls to thin you can hear people in corridor. Not the biggest problem as we were out until late but mornings a little noisy. Lots of room plus point. Big bathroom. No kettle in room be warned.....roof top pool. This was amazing what a breath taking view, so nice up there chilling early evening, nice music and nice setting all round to be honest. Loads of towels available. There was a man checking for room keys to get rid of people who shouldn't be there. He cleared away towels left on seats we which not in use so big plus point. Only issue was price of drinks especially gin and Tonic. €15 on average each.....rip off when you buy a 1 litre bottle for £13.50 from shops. Anyway don't let that put you off. Breakfast. Was ok not the best but not the worst. Lots of choice but like many places pick the wrong time and some food was cold and queue big for omelet. All in all I would stay here again the pros far out weigh the cons, ",4,2015,08,13
47,"Accessible, great rooftop pool and view","Stayed for a long weekend. Had a great time in the city and a nice relaxed time in the hotel. Drinks at the pool bar were quite overpriced but the view was wonderful. Location made it very accessible, with an aerobus to the airport and a hop on/off tourist bus leaving from outside the hotel. 

Guests are mostly in the 25-45 age range, making for a quite youthful atmosphere.

The standard room was nice. Only critique is that the bathroom was not well cleaned when I checked in, and had a light sewage  odour to it for the duration of my stay but overall it was not a big deal and I don't expect it's the case for other rooms.

Checkout is at noon, but was granted a one hour extension at no charge. I ended up paying 30 euro for late checkout at 15:30.

Would stay at the hotel again.",4,2015,08,12
47,"Very nice hotel, great location.","We only had one night in Barcelona, would have loved to stay longer. Hotel was clean, comfortable and had a great location. Easy bus ride from airport and short cab ride to airport. Bus to all the attractions was right across the plaza. Awesome view of the city from rooftop bar and the pool was great.",4,2015,08,11
47,Enjoyable experience ,"Clean room and facility. The location is superb.  We found wonderful restaurants nearby. The staff were friendly as well. But do your research and ask about the shower. Not all rooms have an actual shower.  They only have bath tubs. We had the Superior Suite with a Placa view. Bring your pillow from home. These are very firm. But most of all, enjoy Barcelona. 
Overall, good experience. ",4,2015,08,08
47,Perfect,"Great location- 25-40 min walk of most main attractions
Brill views- can stand on roof terrace/poolside bar and watch magic fountains
Great restaurants- quality and reasonably priced
Fab pool area- clean,  lovely seating areas. Not too busy. Welcome break from chaos of city. 
Great value for money
",5,2015,08,07
47,Dont go there,"The rudeness of the staff  and their treatment of an old disabled lady celebrating her 82nd birthday was totally appauling!

This was despite email sent to the hotel requesting the preparation and needs at least 3 weeks before arrival!

I was left speechless! Do not stay here unless you want a ruined holiday!",1,2015,08,04
47,"Nice hotel, shame about the staff ","Nice hotel within a nice area. Stayed at the catalonia barcelona plaza hotel for two nights. The day we arrived everything was ok we checked in fine. We got to our room and our safe deposit box didn't work. So we rang down and they said they would send someone up, we waited an hour no one came so we had to hide our belongings around the room so we could go out. We then asked reception again the next day they gave us a key we went up to the room to try it to find that there was no where for this key to go. We then went back to reception and she said that why didn't we tell her we had a digit lock safe and not a key one. It's their hotel they should know what safes they have in their rooms. Anyway she said she'd send someone up. We waited 2 hours no one came. I rang reception again and asked her how long and her reply was I don't know and put the phone down. We again had to hide our belongings. On checkout they tried to charge my card for the stay again when I already prepaid she said there was no record of this. She told me to wait whilst she searched for my details. After 10 minutes then told me yes I had paid. No apology for the wait. Overall this hotel was lovely. The staff were extremely rude this is what let them down. ",3,2015,08,04
47,Could be much better,"Good location, pleasant hotel, staff are unfortunately generally poor.
Arrived at Hotel, first impressions were good. Checked in, we had booked two rooms, and were shown to our rooms. One room was missing the mini bar, and when I say missing, there was a huge hole where it should have been. Contacted reception and they said that someone would come and look at it immediately; they never showed. After unpacking and relaxing for a bit we went downstairs to discuss a couple of issues with reception staff. Firstly the safe. The room had a safe but it was very unusual in that there was no locking mechanism, you had to pay a deposit to get the locking mechanism and a key from reception. Asked for a key and lock and they said that they had none, they had run out as people tend to forget to return them, asked that we try the next day in case any were returned. So we had no way of securing valuables, passports for the evening. Not very satisfactory. Then we told them that the mini bar was missing, eventually we managed to get someone to take a look, after much head scratching they managed to find another mini bar and fill the hole in the room.
We visited the pool area on top of the hotel. This had a fantastic view of the Plaza and the fountains, especially at night when the fountains are illuminated.  Very rock star. There were a couple of issues. Firstly the bar staff were useless, they seemed to be lots of staff running around but nobody taking drinks orders and serving people.  Secondly the issue of how to pay for drinks. We tried to charge the drinks to the room but the bar staff said they only accepted cash, I’ve never been anywhere in any hotel where a resident cannot charge to a room. Reluctantly we paid. We brought this up with reception who said that of course you could charge drinks to your room. That evening again we ordered drinks and when we offered a room key they said they wanted cash. I demanded to see the manager to discuss but apparently there was nobody available. 
Only ate breakfast at the hotel. This was a standard buffet, but the waiting staff were generally poor, disinterested and on a couple of occasions completely blanked my wife who was talking directly to them.
It would be 2* review, but I gave an extra star for the good location and fantastic view from the pool area on the top floor. Hotel has potential but let down by sloppy management.",3,2015,08,04
47,Good hotel,"My partner and I stayed here for two nights whilst attending a concert in the nearby  Poble Espanyol in July.

After a bit of a wait at reception to check in we made our way up to our room on the 6th floor.  The room was clean and spacious and had a king size bed which was firm.  I did notice however that the room was very hot, but fiddled with the air con and the temperature quickly dropped.  The hotel provides free Wi-Fi which worked throughout with no problems.

We didn't eat at the hotel so cant comment on the restaurant or the food as we dined out .  There was a small rooftop pool with ample loungers and a poolside bar.  The view from this terraced area was fantastic having a near 360 view of the city.

The hotel is centrally located and on a main bus and Metro route.  It is on a busy main road but soundproofing in the room was very good as I heard no traffic noise at all during my stay and our room was overlooking the street.

All in all I enjoyed my stay at the hotel and would return if visiting Barcelona in the future.  If anything my only criticism would be the sky high bar prices at the poolside bar, for example 15 Euros for a gin and tonic......a little ambitious.",4,2015,08,03
47,Fighting with the basic,"Our small family, stayed at the Catalonia Barcelona Plaza Hotel for three nights.   

At our arrival, we were given a room with a view on the Plaza Espagna at no extra cost.  The check in was a a bit slow though.

The room was good but not great.  We had two single beds pulled together to make one larger bed, but as you can imagine, it does not work that way, you still end up in two beds.  A third bed was provided for our son.  In his words, and I have to agree the bed is made of rock.

The room has a mini bar, air conditioning,a large flat HD TV with satelite channels.  There is a safe but you need to go ask the key at the front desk like in the old days.  There is no extra charge for the key and I am not sure why they don't provide it at arrival.   We found the hotel and the room clean.  

We also end up fighting with the basic.  You really need to be creative to not get water on the floor in the bathroom when you take a shower.  We were never able to make sense of the air continioning, it was too cold at night.   The magnetic room key was unlooking the door but you have to pull before you push the door to make it open.  It was so not obvious, we had to get someone from the the front desk come to help us.  This might be something just with our room (446).

Noise, if you have neighbors that are on the party, you will hear them, the rooms communicate the noise easily.

The hotel is well located, close to stores, restaurants and to the Metro.  It is also close to the tourist bus tour (red line).

We haven't been in the pool on the roof, but there is a bar with lots of space.  On the 7th floor, you will find a SPA, a fitness center.

Internet worked very well for us.

You can eat for 10 Euros per person in the restaurant in the lobby.  I suggest you get a package with breakfast included and wake up early, they stop serving breakfast shortly after 10h00am.

Overall, we were pleased with the hotel.",4,2015,07,29
47,Great location for our discovery of Barcelona,"This hotel was great for its location, train,bus and airport bus (20 mins to airport)right outside the door. Views of the fountains, showing Thursday-Sunday nights only. with the shopping centre beside and cafes nearby we had plenty of options for dinner. The staff were very helpful particularly the desk, very switched on. Although the pool itself was not that big the deck area was well set out with great views over the city for evening drinks. In a group of three couples we all thought this hotel was one of the highlights of our stay in Barcelona and one of the best on our tour of 5weeks.",5,2015,07,28
47,Reunion,"Nothing but positives when it came to our stay at this hotel. It's largest selling point is the view from the pool terrace: absolutely stunning! Almost a 360 degree vista of the wonderful city of Barcelona. 

The pool on the roof is a wonderful bonus, especially after a long day of sightseeing. The pool is clean and there is an unlimited supply of beach towels. Great music and lovely staff at the poolbar make it a welcome addition to the services provided.

It is well worth it to book the Premium room with a view of the Plaza. These rooms are spacious and newly renovated. And the views make you smile...

To sum up my review: a clean, efficiently run hotel with a lovely staff that cater to your every need. 

It may be a little pricier than the average four star but the facilities are well worth it.",4,2015,07,27
47,"Great location, few things weren't quite right but ok!","I should start by saying that this isn't the hotel I booked to stay in, I was meant to stay in the sister hotel across town (next to my office) but a burst water pipe brought me here.

The location is fantastic, it's busy/noisy and very touristy, but if that's what you are looking for then this is the place to be. Right on the roundabout with magic fountains and palace a short walk.

The reception is big with a pianist who sings, at least this is entertaining while it took ages to check in (problems with computers and programming key cards).

The room was fine, spacious enough but the bathroom was not great. The toilet didn't flush properly and the shower (over the bath) was in the middle of the bath not the end. why would you do this? So the water has to be kept to a dribble otherwise it sprays onto the floor!!

One of the reviews, which I looked at after I checked in, said to check your room is fully functioning before accepting it. I agree!

The restaurant was fantastic, the saving grace.

Overall, the hotel is fine, but I'm glad I paid the rate of my supposedly inferior hotel (which is actually much much better) than the rates I've seen this hotel charges. It seems it's a matter of location, location, location.",3,2015,07,25
47,Looking for honesty? Think twice before booking.,"Six months. That's the time I gave myself for a cool, fair review for you, guys.
If I had written this before, I'd be drift by emotion and anger, and I don't think this is  not eight.
There we go:
Upon arrival at Catalonia Hotel, we were told because the site we've booked, we were granted  a room upgrade. We thanked and went straight to our...room.
Boy, it was steaming HOT! In December, an atypical one, the sun hit wildly the closed window and angrily invading our room - with an impression of a supernova sauna.
Impossible to stay into a nearly 100°F room, especially for a cold weather lover like me.
I kindly asked for a room downgrade. My new room was on the other side of the hotel, darker, without the hideous light and heat, but it had no air conditioning, even though the attendant had guaranteed me that the fresh air would come in 10 minutes.
It didn't.
New room change and still no result.
Finally, after the fourth change, the concierge had finally admitted what I've knew: there was no air conditioning in December. Employees were trained to say it was working fine, she said.
I said I was fill a complaint and she said it was up to me to do what I pleased because the hotel wasn't hers.
Rude. Annoying. Lying to guests as if we were spoiled brats.
No, dear Managing Direction. This is not right.
Hotel itself is fine. A nice 4 stars hotel, well located and reasonably well equipped.
Unfortunately the staff behavior, from concierge to room attendant was the same, which makes me wonder if this is not their policy.
I spent the rest of my stay really, really peeved and resentful, not for the situation itself, not for the stupid cheap policy-not warned or remarked on the hotel site, by the way-but for being deceived, being made the fool by an arrogant, rude and disrespectful staff.
It is said that one little pebble into the most comfortable shoe may transform the most pleasant walk into a calvary.
That's what happened to us. 
Being deceived, mocked by someone who knows there's no way to defense (how could I book another hotel in December?) is dire.
Knowing that's practically nothing to be done is depressing.
Think twice before booking this hotel-if so, be prepared to deal with stories-lots of them-things may be different than they are told you.
A little research may prevent this.Look for the need to put a deposit in to get the lock mechanism and key for the safe. They will twll you this mechanism is being replaced next month, these are the last rooms with the old safe boxes...
Later I'll add some photos.
I'm getting upset again, just to remember.
To me, once is enough. Catalonia Plaza and their pretty little liars are history to me.",3,2015,07,21
47,Great stay!,"We stayed at the big suite with the magnificent view of Plaza Espanya, Barcelona Museum of Art and surrounding areas..... Just to enjoy the view is worth staying here.
The top roof pool and bar were  also great inhe heat of the summer.
The room service is quite particular, it comes from a take away kind rest, but its delicious and super affordable.
The down side to stay here is the need to take metro /bus to go to the center of Barcelona.... There isn't much to see around here..... But still worth it!",5,2015,07,19
47,Lovely hotel,Hotel is on good location and looks beautiful from outside and inside. View from hotel room window was amazing. Magic Fountains were extremely close and there is small mall next to the hotel. Only minus point was hotel staff. They looked clueless while handing keys. They had to ask each other to do this and that. And it took so long to hand over keys to us. ,4,2015,07,18
47,a great stay for the Harley rally,We recently stayed for the HOG rally  Great location excellent hotel but the pool bar staff in the evening were totally useless and extremely rude.Had to wait over half an hour for a drink and then they kept giving wrong drinks. We asked for coke light in our drinks but they kept giving full sugar  coke and they  wouldn't understand why we asked them to change it. Their view was coke is coke however we are both diabetic so it mattered lot..The girls on the pool bar in the afternoon were great and showed the others up.,4,2015,07,17
47,Check out the roof top bar!,This hotel is one of typical modern semi-grand Mediterranean hotels. Just enough splash  and dash to make it worthwhile and a good bargain but not quite 5 star. Good buffet breakfast. Highlight is the roof top pool and bar with 360 degree views. Set on Plaza Espana this hotel is not cheap but a good value and a great location. Staff is excellent!,4,2015,07,15
47,Very nice hotel,"This hotel is really nice. We stayed here for 7 nights in a big room with great view from the window. It was easy to get here, the aerobus from the airport had a stop right outside the hotel. The metro and bus is really near from the hotel. The bad things about this hotel was the early cleaning service, we prepare to sleep until at least 9:30 am. Also, the breakfast was really expensive, 16 € per day. Not worth it. Otherwise, we had an great stay at this lovely hotel. The pool is a big plus. ",4,2015,07,15
47,Fawlty Towers in Barcelona...,"On arrival they had us down for 4 nights but our reservation was for one night. Kept insisting that we were wrong until I showed them the confirmation from Booking.com, their first question was then if we had made two separate bookings - of course we had not! Then it took them 10 more minutes to change everything in their system...
We had a 3-person bedroom which turned out to be a double room with a spare bed, which was then cramped. 
The spare bed had no sheets and no pillow, but it only took them 15 minutes to fix.
A/C did not work initially, but was fixed (by me)
Room safe out of order - at least the printed instruction didn't work.
Only three power outlets (one of which was in the bathroom)
No power outlet near the bed so forget about using an electric alarm clock.
Having said that - the pool was great and the view from the 6th floor spectacular. So if you can just live with the bad things, it is not at all a bad hotel.",2,2015,07,13
47,Location but watch the shake rattle and roll,"Great location you can't get closer to plaza d'espana.  The fountains are wonderful and go off every 30 min on weekends.  

The staff are very helpful and patient.  

The pool on the top is wonderful.  Great views and overall the hotel is awesome.  

Except every 5 to 15 minutes the building will vibrate.  It could have been the side we were on ie the side with the amazing views but when a building shakes it is often not locked to one side.  It turns out the location to the train is a kid and a minus.  The minus being the rattle and roll all night and day. 

The location is wonderful though but given the size and metro of Barcelona I dont know if location is everything.  

",4,2015,07,12
47,Not a 4 star hotel,"The hotel staff are extremely rude. We came on the red eye from the US and wanted to check in earlier. We were told to check later for availability. We came back after touring the city but were told again to check in an hour. That would have been understandable if everyone that was coming after us weren't assigned a room immediately. The only way to get a room at 2 pm was asking for the manager. The manager never came. Then they claimed that our luggage was unfindable. Another 15 minutes trying to locate the suitcases that they had stored for us at 9 am. Needless to say that they don't even have a bellman. The room is OK on the 3rd floor, well equipped, minimal view . The bathroom is spacious but moldy. The location is central with lots of transportation options. The rooftop bar is very nice . ",2,2015,07,11
47,Great Hotel Highly Recommend,"We stayed here for 4 nights.  The view from our room was outstanding, overlooking Espanya Square.  Although we were on the busiest side of the hotel, the outside noise was minimal although there was traffic day and night.  The room was very clean and large and the bathroom was superb, the shower was so powerful it was to die for!  The staff were very friendly and we were allowed our room although we were an hour early for check in.  We didnt try the restaurants but we did go up onto the top floor with the pool and bar during the day and at night.  Again the view were spectacular up there and we enjoyed lying back on the lovely sun beds.  We will definitely be returning to this hotel it was excellent value for money.",5,2015,07,10
47,Very central hotel with nice view,"Three nichts in hot July Barcelona on business: Big hotel, very central, dead easy to get to and from with the airport bus, metro lines just outside the entrance, also pretty easy to walk to different downtown sites from. A lot of traffic on the square, but my room was quiet and otherwise perfectly in order. The pool bar on the 8th floor offers a great view of the city. The pool is not very big, so on hot days it's crowded - but the ocean and the beach are not too far away! At high season the reception can be somewhat slow, perhaps, but that's mainly because there are so many guests with bulky suitcases, eager questions and some lack of common sense, maybe. The staff is moderately friendly and speak English, if you happen not to be fluent in Spanish before visiting Spain.",5,2015,07,09
47,"Clean, Convenient","We stayed in this hotel while on a Gate 1 tour of Spain.   The hotel is located next to a former bull fighting arena, which is now converted into a fantastic shopping mall. (Our guide explained that Catalonia banned bull fighting.)  The hotel has a clean, modern feel to it.   Be sure to ask for a room not far from the elevators.  We were on the other side of the building and it was quite a hike to get from the elevators to  our room!  The breakfast dining area is huge with an extensive buffet.  It was an easy ride from here to the airport for about a $20 euro charge.  This was the only hotel where there was a mix-up in delivering  luggage to our room, so I ranked service 4/5.",5,2015,07,08
47,"Good value, but pretty average","It is good value for the location, and some rooms have great views - but in comparison to other hotels in BCN its pretty dated, and felt average at best. Check in / reception was totally disorganised with multiple queues, people cutting in, and lots of staff but no one really doing anything. Luggage assistance was similar. 

Our 'suite' would have been awesome (if it were 1985) but it now looked dated and dusty but for the price paid it was about right and the views were amazing. In the 2 room suite the bedroom had space for a TV but it had been removed which was disappointing. It just felt dated and needs a refurb (I think normal rooms might have been updated). 

Pool are was nice, and the small gym was fine. There is a big 'Metropolitain Gym & Spa' in the Arena shopping centre next door which was a thermal spa and massive gym for 30 euros extra a day - but the small fitness centre at the hotel is fine. 

I'd probably stay again, but not sure the queue to check in and general disorganised front desk is worth the wait.",3,2015,07,07
47,"Superb Location, Nice Rooms","The Catalonia Barcelona Plaza has a superb location facing the Placa Espana.  Free Wi-Fi in rooms.  The rooms are nice with a good bathroom.  The desk staff is very cordial and helpful.  But, the restaurant is basically a gymnasium with food.  Long lines for coffee at breakfast, as many tour groups stay here.  Most of the food was cold and they ran out of most things.  If you could just get a room with no meals, it would be a deal.",4,2015,07,05
47,Best view in Barcelona,Just returned from a two night stay at this hotel and we enjoyed it very much.  The 6th floor pool has simply the best view in Barcelona.  You can see across the city all the way to the Med.  It is a fantastic pool with a bar and food service that are both excellent.  Our room was very clean and modern with a large bed and comfortable chairs.  The location is excellent with many café choices in walking distance.  The food at breakfast was good but little ambiance to go with it.  Not a cheap hotel but a good choice in a fantastic city.,5,2015,07,05
47,Magnificent,Very nice and great location by plaza de Espana. Great breakfast buffet and a decent workout room. Conceirge service staff were also super. Near metro and easy access anywhere. Close to a former bull ring now converted to a mall with great views on top. ,4,2015,07,01
47,One of the nice hotel in city center,"The hotel is nice and luxury. Really helpful, the view from the room is really nice but they should have more thicker walls and windows so in the morning you can't hear the noise of the cars, buses and etc. 
the price is reasonable And it also near the shopping mall",4,2015,06,30
47,Business trip hotel,"If there wasn't a pool and bar on the roof, the hotel itself would receive a 3 out of 5. The location is very good, relatively good access to the downtown area as to the airport. The breeze of wind drinking a nice cool beverage relaxing next to the pool makes it worth staying. The rooms are okay, just like the service. Perhaps the hotel is just too big for my taste. ",4,2015,06,27
47,A Den of Theives,"This Hotel is one of the nicest in all of Barcelona. I have seen it rated as Four Stars. The stewards came into my room and went through all of my belongings and stole anything that had worth to them. don't be fooled by placing valuable in safe, they can get into those too. I am leaving this expensive luxury hotel penniless because their staff are thieves. Unless you carry your luggage around with you, you are subject to theft. The front desk didn't seem to care and made it my fault it happened. My steward is a theif and I will not be back, ever!",1,2015,06,27
47,A decent hotel in Barcelona,"I stayed 3 nights at this hotel recently. There were definitely some good points and few detractions.  On the good side the room was reasonably comfortable in terms of European size and amenities. The hotel was able to handle our group of 30 without any issues.  It is very handy to the subway, shopping next door, and has a nice view from the rooftop.  The rooftop pool was a little small but good enough to keep some kids entertained.
There were a few of detractors. The beds in our room were exceptionally hard; not just firm, hard to the point of discomfort. Second, there is a very loud outdoor party/bar (I couldn't really tell) in the area towards the fountain that ran each night until 11 PM.  Last the food buffet was very nice in terms of selection, but keeping the food hot seemed to be an issue.
I would certainly consider staying here again if the situation arose, but I would definitely ask about the beds.",4,2015,06,26
47,Overall great hotel!,"My partner and I have stayed here on our recent trip to Barcelona. We initially chose the hotel based on a few factors including that they allow pets, have a rooftop pool and parking. I was pleasantly suprised by the standard of the hotel. Location is great, hotel is very nice and the rooftop pool is such a great area. Bar drinks are very well priced as well which is rare for a 4 star hotel. When we arrived the hotel staff even set up bowls and a bed for my dog which was very nice.The rooms are nice and big and the bed is HUGE! My only complaint would be the pool bar service. the staff at the pool aren't very accommodating and some even quite impatient (we only speak english), the service is ridiculously slow for drinks and the food was horrible (the burger had no bread and was a reheated frozen meat patty - when we ordered the food they pulled the frozen patty out in front of us and passed it someone to take to reheat. Otherwise I would definitely recommend this hotel and we enjoyed our stay so much we extended an extra 2 days! Also the hotel wifi was the best we've had so far!",4,2015,06,25
47,tour group hotel,"I did like the location, very close to the Magic Fountain just up the parkway. 
The room was average but clean and all in working order. The bed was hard
but thats pretty standard in Europe. They like hard beds! Breakfast buffet also 
standard tour hotel fare; ham, runny eggs, sweets, good selection of juices, and cheese and sausages.  Internet very slow. Also, a large ""mall"" across street with rooftop places to eat, and 4 floors of shopping. Handy if you need or want something.",3,2015,06,22
47,Great location for tourists,"Located on Plaza Espana and convenient for shopping, restaurants, transport and the National Gallery, this hotel was clean and comfortable.  Staff throughout were helpful, providing additional pillows within 5 minutes of our request and assisting with advice re use of the safe.  The breakfast room, while light and airy, was extremely large and a little soulless but nonetheless offered a wide range of breakfast items.  We were there on the night that Barcelona played Bilbao for the Kings Cup and watched bemused as about 25,000 supporters marched past our window to the stadium.  However, the good window glazing and heavy curtains largely minimised any noise.  The only strange feature of our room was that for some unknown reason the minibar had been removed,leaving a cavity with a door.",4,2015,06,21
47,Great location,"This hotel had by far the WORST BEDS I have ever slept on .... Seriously felt like I was sleeping on a box spring.  Not even two extra blankets for padding helped.  Great location, superb staff just really bad beds.  The chairs could also use a good cleaning.......Sorry",3,2015,06,14
47,Nice hotel. Watch out for petty theirs.,"Petty theft problem. Don't expect help from hotel. Colleague had to submit a police report due to theft of his laptop by employee(s) at hotel. Nice hotel, but it should be a 3 star give he poor security.",2,2015,06,14
47,Clean and Convenient Hotel for vacation in Barcelona,"This hotel has a fantastic location.  Just abover the Plaza Espanya metro station.  Across a street, is one of the former bull rings of Barcelona, now converted to a modern shopping enclosure with 6 or 7 restaurants occupying the rooftop.  Great views from there!  The hotel is also located near Montjuic and the palaces of the world exposition held in Barcelona a good number of years ago, and the summer Olympic games site.  In the evenings the eighth floor of the hotel is absolutely magical:  a large swimming pool, LOTS of lounge chairs, a full bar AND.......fantastic views of ever-changing and colorful water fountains seen from the rooftop!  A real plus for this hotel!
There are two things which I would advise the hotel to improve upon, then it would earn an excellent rating.  The mattress in the room was hard.  Like sleeping on a board.  The other point of improvement would be to add about 6 more coffee stations in the breakfast room!!!!!  LONG LINES for coffee each morning.  Only coffee available was from individual cup producing machines with lots of buttons.  A bit frustrating.  However, this would not keep me from staying at this hotel again in the future.",4,2015,06,13
47,Great location,"We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights as part of a tour group hence it wasn’t booked by myself. It is a nice, clean and modern hotel. The location is great. The hotel was opposite the Placa D'Espanya, shopping and food were located very close also.",4,2015,06,07
47,Location & View,"We had a great view of the fountain in front of the hotel and the room was adequate. The bathtub was dangerously slippery, but the water pressure was phenomenal. I wouldn't say there is anything spectacular about this hotel, though I heard the pool was but it closed by 8pm so we never got to use it. The restaurant was overwhelmed if you asked for anything special, but once they understood and got past having their schedule not go as planned, they were great. Our tour group showed up and despite the front desk assurances, our rooms were not ready. So several of us went into the restaurant to eat lunch which completely threw off the staff. It was almost like they didn't know how to handle unexpected customers. It was surprisingly quiet considering the massive traffic right outside. Breakfast was adequate though they have coffee machines that take forever to brew each cup of coffee which led to a line each morning.",4,2015,06,03
47,"Great hotel, fantastic location, awesome roof terrace","My wife and I spent three nights here last week and were very pleased with the hotel.

Staff were all very friendly and the city view room was lovely. A good size, amazing view and well sound proofed.

The location is great being right on an equivalent to Trafalgar Square or something similar, with a shopping mall next door and a metro station about 10m away. Perfect.

All aspects of the hotel were clean and tidy, the breakfast buffet was pretty good, although some of the hot food was a bit luke warm.

The best part was undoubtably the roof top terrace. This was fantastic. The perfect chill out area either during the day or after a long day out and about.

During our stay the terrace was never busy and there were always sun beds available. Plenty of fresh towels, double sun beds with curtains to shield you from the sun if you're getting too hot and even power points all over the place so you can charge your phone etc.

The one gripe was the pool which was cold. I would have loved a swim but it just wasn't worth taking a deep breath and a cold plunge when the rest of the place was so fantastic.

Oh, and did I mention there is an underground car park below the hotel?

Would definitely come back here.",4,2015,06,02
47,Brilliant location,"Lovely hotel couldn't ask for a better location,the pool has the most fantastic views and out of this world sunbeds and bar,pool was cold I wouldn't call it heated ?
The hotel was very clean we had internal rooms so very quiet
The location was spot on step outside to cabs,metro.,buses and the sightseeing bus stops opposite...
Food was good we only had breakfast only compliant being the lobby bar closed too early and you then have to go up to the pool bar 8 floors up and carry your drinks back down ,not easy when buying four at a time.....unless you can wrap up and sit it out up there as very windy and chilly at 11 pm! 
Bar staff more than friendly,helpful and welcoming ,reception staff hit and miss some were but some were dismissive....
All in all a great stay and a well located spotless hotel",5,2015,05,27
47,Excellent Location!,"You can't find a better location, right on the Placa d'Espanya, with a wonderful view of the National Museum on the hill (a must see), and the spectacular fountains leading to it. Next door is Las Arenas, great for shopping and eating! There are free WiFi, comfortable beds and nice sized rooms. The service is top notch, but even with a significant presence in the lobby, a customer had his suitcase stollen while he registered! This city is well known for it's pickpockets, especially at La Ramblas, but you have to be extremely cautious EVERYWHERE. This is a busy part of town but the room was quiet. The food was very good but there is a 'head man' that is a bit of a tyrant! At night, be sure to go to the top terrace and watch the night show of the fountains all done in coloured lights, it is really a treat! PS...a great, little cafe just out the door to the left that serves great food for very little money....and be sure to try their chocolate 'bombe'! This is a very good hotel and I can recommend it with enthusiasm!",5,2015,05,22
47,Great Hotel,"Great central hotel overlooking the Placa D'Espanya with easy access to the tourist information hut across the square. Easy access to the tour bus, the metro, taxi and the airport bus all just outside the front door. There is a small swimming pool and bar on the roof. It is only a 30 minute walk to La Rambla if you prefer to walk. There is also a mass cycle hire scheme which operates all over the city. There is so much to see and do. Take a trip on the red cable car over the port. Of course you must visit Gaudi's masterpiece the Sagrada Familia. Also visit the Gothic Quarter which is stunningly beautiful. Visit the market just off the lower end of La Rambla with stalls selling everything from fresh fish, hanging hams, cheese, fruit and chocolate. It is very busy in La Rambla and you are warned to watch out for pick pockets. We never had any bother.",5,2015,05,19
47,Fabulous hotel,Had a brilliant stay here last week..very friendly staff and amazing room (suite) great place to stay in central Barcelona. loads of places to eat in the Arena next door..the rooftop terrace was open although windy it was still lovely to swim in the pool and sunbathe. The cost of drinks at the bar was very good and not over expensive.,5,2015,05,18
47,Great view of fountains,"Room was fabulous as well as service,  nice view upgrade if available worth the money!!!  Close to trains as well near the action good sleep.  Great view from the pool,  and food was great. Superior time clock room if you can.   ",5,2015,05,17
47,Sports visit,A great hotel situated seconds from the metro perfect for my trip to the Camp Nou to watch the Barcelona game. The metro links were brilliant for our weekend away and the bus outside to take back to the airport was also there to take advantage of. Lucy on reception was really helpful and gave us advice on were to go and helped us with all of our questions thanks for this stay Richard.,5,2015,05,14
47,Great Plaqce for a short break,"Great hotel. Rooms are very comfortable. WIth a metro station right outside, it is a perfect place to relax and yet have easy access to anywhere you might to go to. The roof top pool is stunning and there is always plenty of room to find a sun lounger. With a bar up there as well, its a great place to chill after sightseeing or working",5,2015,05,14
47,Mould in bathrooms,"Great location , close to subway. Central to everything. Bathroom, mouldy tiles, paint peeling off ceiling. Bed comfy.
Breakfast wasn't included, negotiated for $10 euro. Good breakfast. Some rooms have fabulous views, ask for room with a view, ",3,2015,05,11
47,Great location,"The hotel is located at the Plaza to Espanya. The metro is right outside the hotel so traveling is easy, unless you want to cab it. 
The hotel was meticulously clean. The dining area was large and it had the best buffet choices for breakfast that we experienced. They even made omelettes and had pancakes!
There is an old bullrink that has been turned into a shopping mall and is quite nice.",5,2015,05,06
47,"Very good location, great front desk staff","Good location near transport routes, a walking distance from restaurants and nice landmarks, very quick arrival ( using taxi, metro, ...) to city attractions (from Ramblas, Camp Nuo, Sagrada Familia to shopping malls ...). Mall next door with lunch options and nice city view from the top (also try the 8th floor at the hotel - you can walk outside for a great view, higher than the mall). The staff at the reception were great - any request for info was responded with a detailed and helpful explanation. The breakfast is average, and while the room is nice and comfortable it's air conditioning wasn't great (had to be reduced to the minimum to perform almost fairly). All in all a good stay, recommended.",4,2015,05,02
47,Overdelivered on expectations!,"We booked a good value room here, due to location. The airport bus stop is right out the front, so its just 15 minutes and a few euro direct to airport.
We were highly impressed with the standard of the hotel. Huge room, big king bed, quiet room even tho overlooking one of busiest boulevards in Barcelona. 
Good wifi incl. Large bathroom... it was a treat to stay here. 
 The Arena shopping mall opposite has good food hall and shops and awesome view from top with bars and the magic fountains right across road. 
Well located hotel",5,2015,05,01
47,Fantastic hotel,"stayed at the hotel on business and the place is absolutely fantastic. I arrived late in the evening and the staff on reception where brilliant, the hotel room i was allocated was magnificent and everything about my stay was first class. Breakfast was good with plenty to choose from ",5,2015,05,01
47,overesimated 4 stars,"Not very clean rooms, Average service windows not opening but good breakfast and location. Only 20 minutes from the airport and near landmarks. In rooms there was not possible to open windows..which I do not like",3,2015,04,27
47,Get a room overlooking the Placa !,Big rather impersonal hotel in fantastic location close to all transport routes and brilliant views over Placa Espanya - worth paying a bit extra for a room overlooking the square. Good service and breakfast.,4,2015,04,26
47,Wonderful hotel and staff,"The hotel it's great and have a lovely staff, specially the reception department the reception manager Tenzin was lovely and professional and make our stay unforgettable. We will come back soon, the location it's great in plaza de Espana and have a wonderful view and pool on the top, the Japanese restaurant delicious and the room provided us all for our needs. Thanks a lot for the welcome we were so sad to leave but definitely we will see us soon.  dani and Luca ",5,2015,04,24
47,Perfectly positioned hotel for Barcelona.,We were here for my son's soccer tour for Barcelona youth system and we were concerned about the hotel since we hears the year before that the people were not happy with the hotel choice. This hotel was perfect. Rooms were nice ( Not incredible but nice ) the help was nice but most of all the location of this hotel is what will have me come back again next year. I had my kids with me and the proximity to las arenas shopping mall helped keep us busy when we weren't training. The mall is an old bullfighting stadium that was made into a 4 story shopping mall with great restaurants and great quick lunch places. The view from the top of this mall is breathtaking. Also very close to the Ramblas ( street markets ) and to Barcelona's Camp Nou stadium ( in case you are there for a football match ) Also within walking distance to some great restaurants . One of them being Bodega Monumental. ( We ate there 3 out of 7 nights and i'm a chef by trade. Great tapas). As for the Ramblas. We were with a group and there were three people ( a woman and two men ) carrying around fake suitcases looking like tourists and they were trying to open this guy's backpack. Obviously they weren't tourists. I yelled at the lady to get her attention and the three scrambled in the same direction at first then swapped suitcases and rolled away with them in different directions. Just saying this so you know that pick pockets come in all different types. As with any crowded city as a tourist you should expect anything. Keep your valuables in your front pockets and your backpack in front if possible.,5,2015,04,21
47,"Nice, far from  action....","The air conditioning did not work, breakfast  was average ,staff friendly and helpful.
 Great view to the spanish square,  nice spa and gym. The lobby area and the other communal areas, are very clean and welcoming",4,2015,04,18
47,i will never stay here again.,"I think the good reviews here are probably written by those working for this pretending to be ""hotel"" place. The only thing is its location, and nothing. Staff were friendly, but that's all. I always had to wait at least ten minutes to talk to one of the staffs, breakfast place is equal to mensa, and menu was totally same. the facilities are friendly outdated including leaking pipe. Nobody listened to my request to fix that. Needless to say more, if i were you, i would never stay here wasting my money.",1,2015,04,18
47,The location is good if you come for a fair or counting on public transport - many organized groups,"I had booked this room through a deal that wasn't the cheapest expecting nice rooms and good location.  As I arrived at noon, I couldn' t get my room till 14:30 . After I got the room I was amazed. It was a small wear out room on the 1 floor that had a window facing the patio which is actually the dining room and the roof of this dining room is right in front of the window. (i attach photos of it). The mini bar was empty and dirty...... The spot of light in this event was a young receptionist named Monica that listen to me and try to help me by changing the room the next day on the same floor.  The hotel is right on a metro station and across the street is the Arena mall.",3,2015,04,17
47,"Good location, friendly staff, old tired room","This hotel was booked through an events company as part of a wider package. We decided to book a few extra nights to make the most of our trip to Barcelona. First and foremost, the location cannot be understated. If travelling to/from the airport the A1/A2 Aerobuses stop right outside the hotel; also, you're only a short walk from Barcelona Sants station, La Rambla and the beautiful magic fountain.

The staff were extremely friendly, and very helpful when locating our 2 separate bookings. The lobby area and the other communal areas, such as the Winter Garden, are very clean and welcoming.

Although our room was large and generally clean, unfortunately it was rather tired; the shower was broken (would spray water everywhere), the air conditioning did not work, and tiles/wallpaper were coming off the wall. Also, our room was at the back of the hotel (Rm 521) and due to the aforementioned air conditioning fault we slept with the window open. The environment outside was very noisy, and on the last night had to endure listening to a fight that lasted around half an hour.

We were fortunate to have breakfast booked for us on the first morning, but this was average; everything that should have been hot was luke warm and the fruit was soggy and wasn't very fresh. We didn't see it appropriate to pay for breakfast the following 2 days.

The pool was not open - which we were not informed of prior to the visit.

Overall, a good location for venturing out to see the sights, but probably not if you want a good nights sleep; communal areas comfortable and clean; staff friendly and helpful; and rooms looking old and tired with some maintenance deficit.",3,2015,04,17
47,Nice hotel!,I staid here for a full week for business. I had a beautiful room in a very quiet area of the hotel. No complaints or whatsoever. Hotel is beautifully located close to lots of things you can do in the immediate area. I'd definitely come back here. ,4,2015,04,17
47,We will definitely return.,"Very clean, good service, the rooms are big and clean.
The location was great and the breakfast was very varied and good.
The reception staff was overly friendly and very helpful.
We will definitely return.",5,2015,04,12
47,A great stay and a fantastic location! Bravo!,Stayed at the hotel in april 2015. The hotel is perfectly located in the center of barcelona at plaza espanya. The rooms are spacious And clean. The front desk staff were extremly friendly And hospitalble. Definitely one of the best hotels in barcelona And good value for money. And perfectly located to move everywhere so easily.,5,2015,04,12
47,Hotel to ruin your holiday,"We had a group of 16 people and each family had a horrible experience at this hotel. The staff was unfriendly and totally unorganised. The manager was uncooperative and bluntly lied to is on many occasions. dirty rooms, broken AC, and rude staff! Wouldnt recommend!!",1,2015,04,11
47,Worst hotel in my life,"Location is good. But that is all. I have stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. When i checked in, a hotel receptionist had a quarrel with a female guest. The woman seemed to need a 110v-220v converter for her phone. But the hotel guy said no with the nuance that she was requesting an absurd thing. She was very angry and said to her friend ""that guy was really rude."" Anyway that was none of my business. So i ignored it. But at the time i should have noticed that similar things could happen to me. When i entered the room i was disappointed. Everything in the room seemed very old.(hotel's homepage says there was a renovation in2013 but i cannot believe it) Outside view was only walls of other side of the hotel(i will post the photos). Worst thing was sink. The sink did not drain properly and the pipe was leaking under the sink. I asked the hotel to fix it next day. But it was not fixed. On the second day i requested it again but it was also ignored. I gave up. I stayed 4 nights with the wet floor. When my wife asked a pair of slippers, a hotel guy said the slippers are only for premier rooms. I have stayed at so many hotels with 1 to 5 stars. But nobody said like this. They always said ""sorry we don't have any"" or ""sorry we provide it only with an extra payment"". No hotels reminded me so clearly that i was staying at a ""non-premier"" room and did not deserve a premier service. And it was only ""slippers"". Breakfast place was like a mensa. With reverberating sound and so many people the atmosphere was really chaotic. If you spend additional 20 to 30 euros you can find far better hotels with great locations. Do not regret like me!!!!",1,2015,04,10
47,Just center of everything...,"The Catalunia Barcelona plaza, located in Placa Espania (and don't ne mistaken by the name), is superbly located just in center of everything..., Very close to Fira, Montjuic, Magic fountain, etc and in front of the Metro, it gives a perfect location, but also a good value for money as rooms are reasonable, clean, good service, and a very rich breakfast buffet. Rooms are quite isolated from the street noise.
Just for G_d's sake, change those horrible concrete pillows...;-) .. Also bed tend to the hard side.... 
Otherwise, is a very good deal... 
It's my third or forth time, and I'll probably continue to use their services.",4,2015,04,10
47,3 starish... but great location,"Great location. bus takes 20-25 min from airport. drops right outside the hotel. underground is also right outside so u can get anywhere. there are good eateries in a shopping mall next door and pharmacy etc..fira montjuic and some lovely fountains are nearby.

beware the pool is not heated, and there is noise and vibration from the underground. some other people said the beds were too hard/firm. but this is person specific. 

staff are very helpful, like everywhere in spain.",4,2015,04,10
47,Very good ,"We spent there 3 nights. 
Best location.  We prefer it over a location in la ramblas.  The crew is very helpful and the food is OK.  It is just next to Arena.  We had a good dinner on lalola and Cinco Jotas on the roof floor. ",4,2015,04,10
47,Very good!,"Wow, my staying in this hotel just wasn't enough! The location is amazing! couldnt ask for more! jsut on Plaza Espana where you have the National museum in front, a side you've got the Arena shoping centre where it used to be the spanish bulls scene that is not anymore legal in Catalunya.. Very good and spacy room with big shower, TV, WiFi, AC (wasn't working i donnow why..) very clean and quite. They serve a very good breakfast in a very nice area... they have a nice bar where you can see soccer matches, eat and drink.. 7th floor is Spa and gym- amazing you have to go and enjoy!!! Very good service! Thanks :)",5,2015,03,31
47,"Good place, easy access, excellent breakfast","I had an excellent week of Business trip in that hotel. Room was clean & enough big with a good internet connection.
The breakfast was excellent: all kind of fresh, cold & hot food available with fresh fruit juices. 
I appreciate this hotel & recommend to all people for Business or even family. 
This hotel is about 50 meters of Exhibition center too, for businessmen.",4,2015,03,25
47,Maraton weekend,"Excelent location. Comfortable room, nice spa and good sushi restaurant on site. Read a bad experiense on tripadvisor before trip and was about to change the hotel at the last minute. I am happy I did not change my plan. The stay was very pleasant on my experiense.",5,2015,03,23
47,Service level left a lot to be desired,"Had gotten a room in the hotel as part of an 8 day spain trip through Viator. First was disappointed when we were assigned to a triple room on the first floor with a restaurant canopy as a view. Second, the minibar which was supposed to be in the room was not even there. The room felt as though it was not occupied for quite a while.  As our daughter's medication needed to be kept in the fridge, we contacted the front office to request for a change of room with proper facilities but we were told that triple rooms were only at the first level without much view and there was no other available room. We were then informed  that a minibar would be brought into the room by the time we get back ( we refused to wait in the room for the minibar to be replaced). We came back at around 10pm and the minibar was still not there. Contacted the front office again and insisted the minibar be sent to our room quickly when they did, finally. Not a nice start to our holiday.",3,2015,03,19
47,Excelent Hotel near Barcelona international Fiera,"Excelent location, very good breakfast. Helpfull staff. So it´s a joy to make a international fair in Barcelona. Also room was straight to the colourfull fountain.
Free Wi-fi in all hotel and also 3 terminals to consult emails and acess the internet.

Try to book it with breakfast included because breakfast price is expensive but worty with choices for all the tastes.",5,2015,03,17
47,"Great location, lovely hotel","We have just returned from a weekend in Barcelona staying at this hotel.  We landed, got the Aerobus to The Plaza Espanya where the bus stopped just across the road from the Hotel.  Beautiful views of the Font Magica and the National Art Musuem from the front of the hotel.  Metro station/bus stops and taxis just outside so great for getting around town.
Next to the hotel is the Arenas de Barcelona shopping mall with plenty of restaurants on the roof.
The hotel was smart contemporary, clean and rooms were good although the bed was a little hard for us.
Staff were pleasant and helpful.
Breakfast was buffet style and good value.   
We would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2015,03,09
47,A hotel that wins with his location,"The location is the best of that hotel. Very close to all the convenient places.

I didn't feel that the service or the experience was extra ordinary great, but I liked the rooms with a small balcony and in general it was spacey.

The pool was still closed (March) but wasn't a big deal for me.

In general a professional, nice experience with some room to an excellent one.",4,2015,03,09
47,Great location and staff,"My wife and I travelled again to Barcelona for MWC and checked into the hotel to find there had been a minor error in our reservation. The hotel manager kindly worked with us to resolve even when the hotel was at full occupancy. The staff was friendly overall and eager to help with dinner, travel and other arrangements during our visit also. We asked the Bellman, Fernando several times for restaurant selections, and they were all excellent. The location on Plaza Espana is near shops, restaurants, trains, and an easy commute from the airport. The rooms are clean, and if you're a light sleeper, I suggest requesting an interior room with minimal street noise. The complementary breakfast is excellent with many choices.",4,2015,03,08
47,Roobery while alseep in this hotel,"While staying at this hotel during MWC my room was broken in to while myself and my wife were asleep, cash and an iPhone was stolen.

The hotel refused to taken any action or acknowledge any fault on their part, staff were generally unhelpful and unsympathetic.

My advice would be not to stay at this hotel and if do, ensure that your dead lock is engaged when in the room and never leave any valuables in the room.",1,2015,03,05
47,Might have been 4 stars,"During MWC at a going rate of 350 Euros per night the expectations are different than reality in room 105.
Outdated bathroom with small animal company. The tap in the shower does not work properly.
All three beds are like bath tubs.
The room is hot and he temperature cannot be regulated nor can one open a window.",2,2015,03,04
47,Convenient for business trips,"As other reviewers already mention, I agree that the hotel offers a very good option with lack of special features for a 4-star hotel. There is a very good connection with public transport (metro, bus, taxi) and the site is near the city centre. Rooms are comfy very clean and with basic amenities. Breakfast is probably the best feature of the hotel: great variety. Some reviewers stated that rooms may be noisy. I was on the 5th floor facing inwards with no problems at all.
I will stay in this hotel again, definitely.",4,2015,03,02
47,Convenient but not extraordinary,"Good central hotel location with airport bus stop and metro almost at door step at Espania Plaza.
Front desk staff very cheerful and helpful. Lobby area lacks comfortable elegance expected in a 4* hotel. Rooms basic, but adequate - beds comfortable, very clean bathroom. No street noise if on backside or inward looking rooms. Excellent breakfast fare with wide choice. Hallways very mundane and plain and somewhat noisy as floors are all wood. Good choice of restaurants in area especially in converted bull ring across street which is now a very upscale shopping mall and an engineering marvel. A good choice at a good rate for an overnight coming or going from a cruise.
Free Wi-Fi.",3,2015,02,24
47,a nice surprise,"I always stay in Barcelona near the ramblas and this time had a congress in this hotel.

the room is spacious the amenities good and the location was a great surprise a good one
2 metro lines just in front of the hotel make it easy to reach all parts of the city 
Breakfast is very good
drawbacks: the rooms are too hot and there is only heating in winter so it was too hot on a not cold day and if you pen the window there is 24h noise
so in summary I enjoyed the hotel and will return for sure",5,2015,02,23
47,"Not a 4 star property, but a gr8 hotel!","I stayed here for 2 days. The location is good. Its city centre on the main square of the city. Gr8 connectivity options. There is a metro station just infront of the hotel. Plus taxis can be found easily at any hour of the night and day. The hotel is well maintained. The rooms are small, but with all the basic amenities. The breakfast spread is also descent. Service was good and the staff was receptive. Also there is a shopping complex just next to the hotel.. Overall it was a great place to stay!",4,2015,02,17
47,"Good location, comfortable room, but some services lacking","Good points: location is great (a metro station with three lines is outside and the airport bus stops on Plaza Espana. It a short walk to the Montjuic fountains. Plenty of restaurants around.  The room was comfortable and very good value for the 70 Euro I paid. Wi-fi was free and worked well. Air-conditioning didn't seem to work at all, but in February this was not a problem. Staff at reception where very welcoming.

Bad points. There is no proper room service. Instead there are two menus (one Japanese and one pizza) from companies which will deliver. I tried both and the quality was poor. As the hotel has several restaurants in house I do not know why they don't offer proper room service from those. The hotel advertises a gym, but when I was there is was closed for rebuilding. Two machines (a cross trainer and a non properly functions bike) had been placed in a meeting room as a temporary solution, but this was really inadequate. There wasn't even an explanation or an apology. 

On business trips  always choose hotels with room service and a gym, so I felt this hotel had misrepresented itself.  I give it four stars since otherwise it offers exceptional value for money..",4,2015,02,17
47,Awesome hotel,"Hotel in a good location, with exquisit service. The rooms are really nice with all services. We will repeat, amazing hotel. They have two restaurants in the same hotel, a really good japanese and a elaborate food one! ",5,2015,02,15
47,Perfect in every thing,"Outstanding location, cleanness, kindness. Somewhat expensive especially if you select a room with Plaza Espanya view. Take the advantage of shopping the souvenirs from Parallel ave as they are much cheaper than those at Rambla.",5,2015,02,09
47,Great Stay!,I stayed here for two nights before departing on a cruise. Front Desk staff was excellent! Friendly and helpful at all times. Taxis are always out front and the hop on hop off bus is across the street. Subway access is right in front of hotel. Breakfast is a  large buffet and was very good. The Gaudi Church is about a 30 to 45 min walk away. A cab one way from hotel is $15 Euro.,5,2015,02,06
47,Poor,"Old dirty hotel that requires repairing. Very bad mattresses and bedding. Bad WiFi, only one power outlet available at desk area, you can hack another by plugging out TV, not enough anyway. Climate control not working. Cleaners don't take garbage out of the room, quality of the cleaning is very poor.",2,2015,02,04
47,not even nearly 4 stars,"Rickety hotel desperately in need of revamping: room was shabby (unclean, closet doors could hardly be opened or shut, mould in bathroom, window lock broken, no lock in safe in closet), wifi extremely weak. No electricity plug near bedside, forcing me to run to reception and ask for extension cord.",2,2015,01,26
47,Great hotel in a great location,"My wife and me spent a great 3 nights on a visit to Barcelona.The hotel is situated right at Placa Espanya. A central Metro station ""Placa Espanya "" (L1 and L3) is right outside the hotel.
There are  cafes and restaurants near by the hotel to choose from and a shopping mall is located right next to the hotel (Centro Comercial Arenas de Barcelona ), FREE WIFi all over the hotel and in the rooms.
The japanese resturant (Umo) at the hotel and the cafe are really good.
We got a room facing the shopping mall that was very clean, with flat TV, beds were comfortable and clean too.The bathroom was clean and with a bath - very refreshing after a day walk in Barcelona.
Breakfast was included and was good and fresh every day - could be more variant each day.
The staff was kind and helpful.
I would recomend this Hotel to everyone, and probably will come back again.
Even if price is a little more expensiv it's worth it",5,2015,01,19
47,An enjoyable and comfortable stay.,"I would start with saying that the airport is 10 minutes away by bus. The station is in front of the hotel entrance.
Although the hotel is not new and the room/surroundings show it, the overall experience is very pleasant. We had a room with a spectacular view, the bed incredibly comfortable and always looking forward to having breakfast. 

Barcelona was very kind to us. 
Many thanks.",4,2015,01,17
47,All about the money,Insincere staff at reception who just want your credit card details.Room was tiny wifi didn't work no welcome from reception.Its a busy hotel but the rudeness of girls on reception was off putting.At checkout they were looking for some tourist tax to make it even worse even though when I booked I was assured all taxes were paid -never again.,2,2015,01,17
47,Do not book this hotel!,"I was due to stay at this hotel from 1st to 4th December 2014.  Had a 6am start in the UK, a full day of work and flew to Barcelona arriving at the hotel around 7pm and was looking forward to checking in a relaxing.  Wrong - I was told, despite having the booking confirmation from booking.com that I had no reservation at the hotel.  I refused to accept this and again showed them the booking reference, this time was told they would call someone to ask

They returned and said they had found my booking reference, and had moved me to another hotel.  Would have at least been nice of them to contact me and let me know beforehand?!

They then said that they would pay for my taxi to the other hotel which was 2 minutes away.  Wrong.  They did pay for the first taxi, but it was 15 minutes away.

I explained that I was travelling with a colleague who was staying in this hotel, and will they pay for the taxis between hotels as we were due at conferences and meals together, and was met with blank looks.  Ended up costing over 150 euros in taxis between hotels.

Whilst the hotel they transferred me to was clean and fairly new, it was tiny and the location wasn't brilliant and probably didn't cost the same as the Barcelona Plaza, despite it looking a cheaper hotel, there was no offer of refunding the difference.

Such a shame, as the Catalonia hotels are usually quite good, having stayed at the Catalonia Plaza Mayor in Madrid many times and have already rated them as brilliant.

Ruined my opinion of how the booking system works and will only book Catalonia hotels in a case of last resort from now.",1,2015,01,04
47,"Great location, Amazing view, Noisy though.","The hotel has  very great location. The hotel is situated right at Plaza Espanya, walking distance to all major attractions with amazing view over Montjuic (e.g. Montjuic, Magic fountain, the night market along the street to Plaza Catalynia, Passage de Gracia, Ramblas, Marina etc). The metro station and airport bus are located right outside the hotel with less than 30 seconds walk. There are numerous cafes and restaurants closed by the hotel to choose from and a shopping mall is located right next to the hotel. The japanese resturant at the hotel and the cafe are really good. We had breakfasts at the cafe and dinner at the japanese restaurants with fresh seafood from Barcelona. 

We get a room on the 4th floor facing Plaza Espanya and Montjuic. The view is so amazing that you can't get a better location to enjoy the view of Montjuic. We can see the magic fountain show from our room at night. The downside is that it can be very noisy from the traffic if you have window open. The hotel switches off air conditioner in all room during winter season and we had to open the window to get fresh air at night. 

The location of this hotel is really unbeatable. The service is good as well, we received complementary welcome drink when we arrived the hotel which is a surprise! If we return to Barcelona, i will stay in this hotel again. If it wasn't because of the traffic noise, I would give it a five star.",4,2015,01,04
47,It is maximum a 3 star hotel. Too expensive for what you get.,"Rooms are old, but OK. Staff is nice but the front desk is clearly understaffed. It might take you 30 minutes to check in and if you call them from the room, you might never get an answer. The bathrooms need urgent maintenance. Do not even think about having a hot bath... if you do it, you will feel like you are bathing in muddy waters. If despite this advice you decide anyhow to stay at this hotel make sure you do not take the breakfast. There is a bistro ""Buenas Migas"" in the corner (less a than 50 m from the hotel door) and you pay much less for a 10 times higher quality.",2,2015,01,02
47,"would recomend to everyone, clean, easy to get to","Hi, we just stayed in this hotel and I must say we were pleasantly surprised. The hotel is very conveniently positioned at Plaza Espana. Very easy to get to from the airport, just jump on the train to Santa Estacio, change for green tube line L3 towards Trinitat Nova and its only couple of stop to Plaza Espanya. 
Staff was very nice and helpful, all spoke good level of English. Some spoke French too. 
We asked for a quiet room which we got. Good size room with very comfy beds, warm, clean with flat screen TV. The rooms which are facing plaza espanya have amazing view overlooking the Plaza, columns, fountains, and museum. The rooms with this view are on a very busy roundabout so might be a bit more noisier then the ones positioned within the cube.
We popped down for a breakfast too. We haven't pre-ordered this but were offered this at a special rate of 10 Euros on our arrival. There was plenty to choose from, all was fresh and tasty. 
I would recommend this hotel to everyone.",5,2014,12,30
47,Shame about the staff,"Just returned from a three day stay at this hotel and really can't fault the hotel itself. The location and facilities were great, the rooms spacious, clean  and comfortable. Sadly it was badly let down by the reception staff who were both unhelpful and bordered on the downright rude.",3,2014,12,19
47,Not for business...,"I travel a lot around the world and I had a better hotels for less money. Yes, the room is clean. Yes, the location is convenient (metro, buses etc.), but... a very big BUT...
1. If you got a room facing the Placa Espania, the noise from the street is unbelievable... the rooms ARE NOT sound proof.
2. The hotel is located near the metro... it's convenient, but you can literally feel a train going in the room... and I was on the 3rd floor. There were some toilet hanger vibrating when the train was passing by. Luckily, the last train was at 00:30 and the first at 05:30...
3. The floors in the rooms and the corridor are made of wood. You can hear a person walking in the room above you and people walking in the corridor. It is so loud...

The bottom line, if you are on vacation and all you need is to fall a sleep at the end of the day in the hotel that is located in a walking distance from the city center - go for it.
But, if you need a some piece of mind and some comfort in the room to finish you work day - I wouldn't recommend this hotel.",3,2014,12,19
47,Great View!!,"Fantastic location and an absolutely amazing view from the hotel room! The room was large, clean and comfortable and the staff extremely helpful. This hotel has everything on its doorstep... Would definately stay here again!",5,2014,12,18
47,Great location,"We had a very nice room facing the Placa Espania, amazing view of the placa, fountains, arenas, we loved it!
The room was spacious, especially comparing to others in Barcelona, clean and in good condition, although not perfect, due to water damages in the wood of the bathroom door and around the huge beautiful window...
The metro is just outside the hotel entrance, and the line is the best for all famous attractions, the bus to the airport two meters away, and 12 minutes from the airport.
The service was very good, the staff upgraded us when we asked for a room facing the Placa, with a smile and with proper English, which is quite rare in Barcelona...
The price was really good, and the only thing missing was coffee and tea in the room, but very close shops, cafes and restaurants covered that as well.
A lot of great attractions were a walking distance away, so again, perfect location in every parameter.
We will certainly come back!
",4,2014,12,18
47,good location,"I had a suite in the hotel so it was more than I expected. I booked a basic room.
Good location, beautiful views, good service.
The underground just in front.
Surrounded by shops and restaurants.
You can order japanese and pizza meals from the room",5,2014,12,16
47,Brilliant,Highly recommend. Nice rooms and amazing staff. Close to metro and bus lines. Overlooking arena and square. Clean rooms. Well looked after. Plenty of lifts. Nice bathrooms and facilities. It would be better if all the rooms had tea and coffee making facilities. Wold return to this hotel again.,5,2014,12,15
47,Worst hotel experience ever,Checked in with a large group of 50 people. Took hotel staff 2 hours to allocate our rooms to us even though everything had been pre-booked. Hotel staff never offered any safe storage for our luggage even though we were having to wait so long for our rooms. Any way to cut a long story short my laptop bag got stolen from the hotel lobby. When I asked the staff to review the lobby cctv they told me I would have to wait 2 hours to meet the hotel manager who is the only person who has authorisation to view the cctv tape. After waiting 2 excrutiating hours I finally got to meet the manager who informed me I would have to go to the police and file a report and they would come and have a look at the cctv themselves. When I asked her if she could have a look herself to see what happened to my bag she bluntly refused. Throughout this whole sorry affair there was no sign of any empathy or any effort to help me locate my bag. I was left to my own accord. Would not reccommend this place to anyone. ,1,2014,12,13
47,"Great Hotel , perfectly placed.",Just back from a 5 day trip to beautiful Barcelona. This hotel is ideally placed for eating and shopping as right outside the front door is the Metro and the large shopping centre built into the old Bull Ring. Across the road is the plaza Espana with its beautiful musuem and dancing fountain which has a light and music display not to be missed. The buffet breakfast was very good also the Japanese restaurant in the hotel was fabulous. The rooms are very comfortable with excellent wifi (free of charge). The tv had 10 English channels including 2 movie channels. Do not hire a car as parking is very expensive. A T10 journey metro ticket is 10.30 euros and you can use this for the buses and trams and the renfe train from the airport to city. The A2 bus from the airport stops across the road and the A2 to the airport stops right outside the hotel..What more could you want. When we travel to Barcelona again this hotel will be first on our list.,4,2014,12,03
47,Great Location + great staff = terrific stay,"What and opportunity I had to be there on September 11, 2014! I was staying here (I am a single, senior woman traveller) for 1 day post-cruise and hoped to be able to do the hop-on-hop-off tourist bus and have easy access to an airport shuttle so I choose this hotel from the internet mainly because of its location - the bonus was it also has great staff! The cruise line cancelled all the post cruise tours because there was going to be a ""protest/demonstration"" - some citizens would like Catalonia to be independent and were going to demonstrate to try an force a vote - Barcelona was ""adopted"" by the King of Spain 300 years ago - so this was a big anniversary. I was disappointed the tourist buses were not running but the experience of being right in the middle of this exciting event (the hotel was at the centre of the action) was a once in a life time. My room was on the 6th floor and faced the plaza - I could not have had a better vantage point - thank you front desk staff! Unfortunately the cruise line misplaced one of my bags and again, the front desk staff (thank you David) went above and beyond to help me contact their agent in Barcelona (closed because of the event), calling the hotel where the man who took my bag was staying and overall trying to ensure that I felt welcome. The rooms are large and were spotless and I had a room where the window opened. Because of the event, the hotel did have a person posted in the lobby who reminded festival goers where they could find public toilets - his actions were very gentle - there is a magnificent pool area on the 7th floor but be aware that it closes +- 8:30pm - the hotel does have food services, but I took the opportunity to wander and found two cafes fairly close - regrettably I did not see too much of the city but would recommend the Catalonia Barcelona Plaza to anyone who asked!",5,2014,11,20
47,"Safety hazard, no service, noisy","Currently in this hotel. Noisy rooms, you can hear everything in other rooms and in the hallway from heels and talking to toilets flushing and suitcases rolling. Room temperature preset and cannot be changed even though there is a thermostat in each room--- room temperature set at 23 degrees. Beds are very hard. Hotel towels have torn corners, stains and small holes in them. Shampoo, body wash and conditioner are all in one. Train shakes the walls slightly.

Worst personal experience thus far--- In the shower the pipe at knee level was scolding hot! I burned my leg badly. Called reception;  they don't have a first aid kit, and I have requsted ice for the burn five times. ...still no ice has been delivered to my room after 2.5 hours. Terrible service.  
Wrong food delivery men (1 pizza and 1 other) have been knocked on my door and asked me for directions to the correct room who ordered the food ....but again no ice! I would never put a group in this hotel! ",1,2014,11,18
47,perfect hotel!!,I love this hotel. from the location  to the rooms to the staff to the breakfast. I will stay there again and again. airport bus leaves you on the front door. Ask for Mateo concierge. awesome guy and javi the bellman.,5,2014,11,07
47,Not bad,"The location is good, not perfect, but good. Good transportation - Metro station is just 10 meters from hotel, taxi to/from airport took me 20/15 min. Room and common spaces are clean. Hotel staff were friendly. 
May be it was extraordinary time (3-5 November 2014) but hotel seemed a little bit overcrowded during breakfast period.",3,2014,11,07
47,"Comfy room, outstanding location, cool pool!","Our room was very comfortable. Big bed, air-conditioning, great view from the window. We asked for highest floor possible and we got it. Few steps from swimming pool with bar. This hotel was perfect to relax after all-day sightseeing Barcelona. We are highly recommending it! The service at the desk could be slightly more nice to us, but we understand - super busy day.",5,2014,11,04
47,"Great location, nice staff, but you gave my room away","The location is good. The hotel is smart and clean, and the staff were friendly and helpful. 
However
My room was not available when I arrived and I was sent across town to another hotel in the same town, massive faff getting a room there and had to be back where I started for 7:00 am to meet colleagues ... this was not cool",2,2014,11,04
47,WANT FABULOUS COMFORT YOU HERE !!!))),"People, this is the most convenient hotel in downtown Barcelona !!!!)) We are staying in it for the second time !!! I am very demanding tourists with the experience, and I want to say with full responsibility that this hotel is the price and quality !!! The rooms are comfortable clean, comfortable, of course wi-fi !!! breakfasts excellent all tasty and fresh at home! The service at the highest level !!!

47,"Superb location, quiet room","Easy access to metro and train station. Nice walk to Montjuic and Pobre sec neighborhood, easy metro to La Rambla and other sights. In spite of busy intersection the room (3rd floor) was relatively quiet. Bed was comfy with enough pillows. Breakfast was substantial with lots of choices. Other meals average. Sushi in Japanese restaurant was super expensive for what you get. ""Massage"" in spa was worthless. We would definitely stay here again. Lots of restaurants nearby, close to the convention center, magic fountain, art museum, park...  Wifi worked great. trip was for both business and pleasure (trip advisor only lets me pick one). travelled as a couple.",4,2014,10,28
47,Great Location,Great location on the lovely Plaza de Espana with good transport links by bus & metro to the city. Rooms where clean and modern. Nice roof top pool with great views.Plenty of bars & restaurants on the doorstep - nothing to complain about.,4,2014,10,27
47,Nice hotel,"Nice hotel with great location for the second (not first) stay in Barcelona (for the first it is better to choose a hotel near Rambla). But very touristic - very crouded! The pool on the top was also vety crouded snd seemed not very clean. Good food for breakfast and conference lunches. But I did not like a menu for the conference dinner - it was very simple, without local specialities.",3,2014,10,26
47,Robbed in Barcelona,We phoned this hotel to book a room for our teenage daughter who had just been robbed in Barcelona. They said they had one room left and weren't interested in taking a phone booking for a stranded traveller when another credit card bearing customer had just walked in the door. I was gobsmacked by their callous indifference to the plight of a stranded student in their town. No worries the Hotel Pulitzer took care of our daughter in stellar style. But the anti-good Samaritan attitude here left me saddened by human nature.,1,2014,10,20
47,Change of plan came up trumps!,"We didnt actually book to stay at this hotel, but a last minute change of hotel by our football travel company saw us booked into the plaza.

Getting here form the airport was a breeze with the bus from terminal 2C stopping on the plaza and getting back was even easier with the fast bus picking up directly outside the front door of the hotel.

The hotel itself was decent with a large entrance hall with excellent helpful and informative staff.  The rooms were standard, witha decent bathroom, hair dryer, large beds, TV, mini bar and storage, although the decor seemed dated and there was much to much wood panelling going on in the coridor.

The hotel has a small pool on the roof with excellent views, but we didnt eat or drink there so i cant advise on that.

The location is excellent and is close to many of the barcelona attractions.  You can walk to port or barcelona football stadium in about 25 mins, and the tube will get you anywhere else.  the main barcelona tour bus stops on the plaza.  There are dozens of bars and restaurants within a short walk all around hotel.

Tips:-
1. - ask for a room with an external view, not looking into inner  courtyard - too dark
2. - they are happy to look after your luggage when you check out and give a ticket for collecting later
3. - transport links are excellent - bus to and from airport and tube staion directly outside front door.
4. - dont pay 16 euros for breakfast, go out of entrance , turn right and cafeteria on corner does croissant and coffe for 1.85 euros.(does lots of other stuff too and is modern, clean and good value for money).",4,2014,10,20
47,"Great location, good experience.","We've been there for 5 nights. Family- 2 adults with 3 kids in two separated , but closed, rooms ( there are no rooms with connected door in the hotel ).

47,Great location!,"This hotel is located in a beautiful square called Plaza de Espana.  It is close to the old bullfight ring which was converted to a mega mall, and there is also a fountain in the middle of the square.  There are two bell towers at the entrance to the Montjuic fair compound which is also nearby.  At night, we walked from our hotel to the Magic Fountain of Montjuic for a  fascinating show of light, water and music.  It is free so don't miss it. The hotel provides free Wi-Fi and a big breakfast with our accommodation.  The room we got was bigger than average and it has a sitting room.  The hotel lobby was large enough and there is a bus stop in front of the hotel.  I'd certainly want to go back and stay at this hotel.  It is close to every thing!",4,2014,10,19
47,Great hotel,"This is a large, modern hotel, close to many sights, shopping and restaurants.  Also close to the metro.  Our breakfast was included n our tour, so I don't know what the price would be. It was an excellent, full buffet.  Eggs, meats and cheeses, toast and pastries, fruit, yogurt. Juice, bottled water, several types of coffee.  He hotel has a strong WIFI signal in the rooms. The rooms are good sized, as are the bathrooms.  A strong shower with plenty of hot water and an adequate hair dryer.  The only problem we had was that we did not get our wake up call 2 of the 3 mornings we requested it.  The staff was friendly, helpful, and proficient in English.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,10,12
47,"Impersonal treatment from front desk staff, musty room","This hotel is well located, but rooms are run down.  Bathroom was large and clean, front desk staff impersonal and not helpful.  I asked for instructions regarding the buses that stopped in front of the hotel, and only got a shrug from the guy standing next to the door (maybe he was a “security“ person, but it is truly unbelievable that someone that works there does not know if a bus stops there or is unfriendly enough to just shrug you off.)  I am a native Spanish speaker, so language was not the issue here.  There is something with older, larger “once grand“ hotels that stay behind in client service because they are always full due to their location.  This is the case with this hotel.  I stayed here on business travel, but I have been to Barcelona twice before, have stayed in much better hotels and paid much less than the prices this hotel charges.
The central location is deceiving, because public transportation in Barcelona is very good.   
Rooms are old and run down, the noise level is high.  

The hotel advertised it had wifi in the room, I was even provided with a password.  NEVER worked and no one helped, despite the fact that I went down to ask for assistance twice and finally gave up.  Terrible wifi connection in the lobby, but there were 3 computers that were busy most of the time and could manage to wait for one to be free to check mail and print out boarding passes.

The buffet breakfast, which was included in my stay, was extraordinary.",3,2014,10,08
47,Average Experience,"While a nice hotel the service was extremely slow, room clean and large bed, breakfast was about average for a hotel nothing outstanding. Probably would not stay again other hotels offer better service for price.",3,2014,10,03
47,Great Location and Efficient Service,"I stayed two nights for business. The location is great, right at the plaza espana, with the Arena (now a shopping mall) just steps away. The check-in and check-out service is very efficient. The air-conditioning, bedding and pillow in the room are comfortable, which are vital after long-haul flight. The Wifi is very strong and quick( unlike my previous experience in Madrid and Seville).  Moreover the room-cleaning is very efficient and of good quality. Definitely a good choice.",4,2014,10,02
47,Excellent and great staff,"Stayed here with my family on August 8th-11th.  Had triple room. king size bed excellent but third bed (not really a bed!) but a sofa, was okish. thought we would get a single bed.  Nevertheless, loved the hotel.  Staff are extremely excellent, helpful!!.  Big shout out to Francisco, Matteo and everyone for making our trip the best.  It was my daughters birthday on the 8th when we arrived. the manager kindly arranged for a birthday cake and champagne!!!  truly fabulous hotel and staff.  100% recommend stay here.  few minutes walk to Magic Fountain which we could see from our hotel room. The swimming pool on top of the roof was magnificent! Metro right outside the hotel which got us to all the attractions Barcelona had to offer. from the airport we caught the Aerobusbcn that took us right outside the hotel. easy, no hassle at all.  we sooo miss Barcelona! :)",5,2014,10,02
47,MY MONTH IN BARCA,"So, I got a room at  CATALONIA BARCELONA PLAZA HOTEL, this is rignt next to the magic fountains in Barcelona Plaza, as well as a great Museum. The view is fantastic. You might get some street sounds depending on where in the motel your room is. I got moved, that room was not as far as it should have been, they moved me again SO ACCOMODATING! This staff is the best I have ever seen, they speak English better than I do, and of course Spanish. The managers speak 6 each, so you get about 12 languages spoken or so, fantastic! I had no communication issues and they are so kind and warm you can't believe it. I asked some hard questions, and it was a breeze for them! I get to stay again next year, and you can bet I will stay here again. For the price average of 125 to 175 Euros a day depending on which level of room you choose. This is a 4 star hotel, but its more like 4.5 out of 5 for many reasons. I left money out for the keepers, they never took it. I don't undertand how to leave tips, but I left tips and they never took the money! I imagine you can leave anything out and not worry, such as my wallet, my laptop, my passport, it was all left there many times during cleaning, no issues. That my friends is priceless! I never felt so safe but I am from the USA and we don't have pick pockets everyplace in the USA, but according to myth, they do in Barca, I never had any issues. I walked around late at night, never an issue, never saw a pick pocket. Other than that, they don't have any crime that I could see, and the Staff ar just as friendly in the Hotel as out in the streets, amazing! I wish the USA was as friendly. I stayed at many hotels in the US and around, but this Hotel Catalonia has been the best ever far above any I've even heard about. They have an amazing buffet for breakfast, they can do business lunches for high executive levels, and they have 5 restaurants in the building, one is a Bar too and stays open very late. You can eat at midnight in and around the immediate area, if you like that sort of thing. The pool is fantastic, on the roof that's set up very very nice. The gym is minimal, cardio and a few weights, but its not Golds gym, but who is worried, you can go to the stadium accross the street and use the HUGE gym, and the ladies are fantastic if you're a single man, perfect 10s everywhere in this area! So summary, Perfect Staff, Perfect location, Perfect Views, Great comfort in rooms with Perfect room service, Perfect food, amazing breakfasts, and Perfect Pool, and Massage Center, Great TV channels, Awesome shower and bathroom facility in room, Frige fully stocked, Room Service if you need it, Modern, Air Conditioning that could freeze you out if you set it that way, Perfect firmness in bed, beautiful motel, great decore, and they have their own security, so if you had any issues that's always there. It can't be any better than this and for a 4.5 star, you pay 3 star prices, WOW. I was so impressed. Can't say enough good things! Oh, the rooms accomodate families with ease, large, very large for EU standards! Seriously!",5,2014,09,30
47,Worst service ever!,"We had a suite from the hotel for a long weekend in Barcelona. The room was spacious and had a nice view but that is where good things end. The floors had big cracks and the furniture had seen its best days.

DO NOT ORDER ROOM SERVICE! They do not bring the food from there own restaurant.They order it somewhere else and then bring it to you. We ordered a 30 € beef stake and a 20 € burger and they were cold when the food arrived and the beef was raw. The food was in plastic containers so there were no real plates, forks, knives or anything! We did not eat the food entirely and complained to the reception.  They told us to leave the food outside the door so the delivery boy could take it back. After hat the reception told called us that they will no refund the food because we had eaten a part of it. We told her to look at the beef that was RAW! They told us that we can settle this the when we check out. When we checked out the food was still on our bill. We complained and then they brought the 3 days old food to the counter in front of us and other guests and said that we were lying. 

In a conclusion do not go to this hotel!",1,2014,09,30
47,Excellent Hotel On A Great Location,"This hotel has roomy, modern, very clean rooms with good amenities.  And it is located right on the roundabout of the Plaza Espana.  From our room we look out right at the beautiful fountain in the middle of the circle, with the 2 towers which look like the San Marco tower in Venice directly across from us.  Yet we do not hear all the traffic  noise right below us.  
Right across the street is the former bull fight ring which has been turned into a shopping mall with the entire top floor (open to a walking and viewing platform) given over to good restaurants.  Just a short distance away are the fountains where they have the Thursday to Sunday night magic fountain shows.  Don't miss this!!!  The fountains dance with many patterns, brilliantly colored lights and all to catchy or beautiful music.  And it is free!
     Also, right in front of the hotel you can catch the Aerobus which takes you directly to the airport for 5 Euros.
     The breakfast at the hotel is also good, with many choices and also a worker making omelets to your specifications.",5,2014,09,29
47,Location !,"Stayed there for 2 nights.

Location: What can I say, PERFECT ! It's close to a shopping mall (it's an old bullfighting arena which they turned to a mall), It's right in front of Plaza Espana facing the mountain, 5 minute walk to the Magic Fountain and it's a 10 minute drive (around 6 Euros by Cab) to Plaza Catalonia. Taxis are just at the front of the hotel, very helpful.

Hotel: Reception and Lobby were great. Breakfast Selections were vast & delicious. Our room was facing the Bullfighting Arena turned Mall, and a view of the Mountains surrounding Barcelona, that was nice. And, we had Free WIFI",5,2014,09,28
47,Decent but wifi will drive you crazy,"I stayed here as my usual Barcelona hotel was fully booked. It is a decent hotel. The price is reasonable for Barcelona. The breakfast is nothing to write home about and is ok for a business hotel but if I was a tourist I would not be happy. Room was clean but if you are distracted by street noise then not for you. Note to hotel management - An exercise bike, an elliptical trainer and a broken treadmill does not constitute a ""Fitness Centre"". The wifi drove me nuts as every time you put your phone down and then try to use it again you need to log back in. Also my work computer rang all its alarm bells saying it was an unsafe connection. Staff were very helpful. Special mention to Sheila who sorted my out with quick food when I needed it. Fine for a business stay but I will be going back to my usual hotel next time.",3,2014,09,25
47,A long 12 night stay.,"I stayed at the hotel 12 nights on business.  The good:  Location, location, location.  It's perfect.  The subway and train stations are literally right outside the door.  The front of the hotel looks across the Plaza Espanya and up the hill to the Catalonia art museum.  The Arenas de Barcelona mall is across the street.  It's an old bullfighting ring that was converted to shops and restaurants.  The open air tourist busses stop right outside the hotel and it's a main taxi stand in the city; I had no problem getting a taxi at 4:15 in the morning to get to the airport.  The busses to the airport also stop right outside the hotel.  The rooms are good size and I had a real queen size bed, not 2 twin mattresses pushed together as in many European hotels.  The air conditioning worked great too.  The not so good:  The bed, while spacious wasn't that comfortable.  It was a thin mattress that sat on a platform, not a box spring.  My room and several others on my floor had metal plates on the exterior door jamb because the jamb was damaged, as if someone tried to break into the room and broke the wood.  Neither the halls or rooms are carpeted, they're laminate.  That makes the hallways loud in the morning as people walk by.  The floors in the rooms are probably a little cold in the winter too.  There is no alarm clock in the room and there were no electric outlets near the beds.  All the outlets were across the room near the desk.  If you want the great view across the plaza, be prepared to pay for it.  A plaza view is an extra €15 per night, a courtyard view is an extra €10 per night.  My room overlooked the apartments behind the hotel.  The room rates vary dramatically too.  Over the course of my 12 night stay, I was charged 6 different rates, from a low of €90.91 to a high of €181.82.  The price of the continental breakfast is a little high at €16, although that's pretty much the same as New York prices.  As you would expect, the exchange rates at the hotel are awful too.  The WiFi works well but it's not secure and, if you're using it on a tablet or phone, you get logged out anytime the screen blanks out.  Laundry is very expensive too, but returned the same day.  But overall, the good outweighed the bad and I'd stay here again.",4,2014,09,24
47,not the best location,"Hotel is very nice. Rooms are perfect. Distance to metro station is not very close and location of the hotel is not one of the best. Breakfast is average. Compared to price paid, better breakfast is expected. Staff is very friendly and nice. Interestingly, you have to pay for wi fi in meeting rooms even though you stay in the hotel and have right to use free wi fi.",3,2014,09,19
47,2 Nights in Barcelona – 8-22/24-14,"Wonderful view from the Swimming Pool Area to see the Fountain Show at night – a great plus as you do not have crowds.

4th Floor wonderful room view to the street.  Excellent windows did not allow street noise to enter. Room was Clean – loved the art work on the wall. Basic but comfortable.  Air conditioning worked wonderfully.

Excellent Security Hotel Guards – you felt safe – they guarded your luggage and were very helpful, friendly and professional.

Great Location – close to the hop on – hop off bus line for touring the city - along a nice shopping mail including a supermarket – (Las Arenas) across the street.

Excellent breakfast with a good variety of fruits, breads, cereals, meats and cheeses.  Excellent Dinner Buffet – the best pasta recipe we had on our trip.   One note – for large crowds the three coffee machines are not enough – long waiting lines.  Maybe a pot on the table if requested.",5,2014,09,12
47,Super choice when in Barcelona,"The fantastic view of Plaza Espanya is only one of the things that's great about this hotel. The location is perfect, close to restaurants and shopping and right next to a metro stop. The staff was courteous and accomodating and the room was large, clean, and comfortable.My husband and I have put this hotel on our ""A"" list.",5,2014,09,02
47,Catalonia Barcelona Plaza Hotel,"Great location!!!! big room
But -
The hotel is stinks with smoking
The facilities are old and sometimes broken.
Breakfast is poor and there is so little of what is offered. The restaurant is very noisy.",3,2014,09,02
47,definitely reccomend,"Super location right next to metro stop. Room had a beautiful view! Nice employees! 

We had a triple room and the king size bed was very comfortable (it was really nice) but the extra bed was the dreaded hard as a rock bed that you hear about in Europe. I wish that TA would add a category just for the beds, as a comfortable bed can make a huge difference.  And it is so much time effort and money to go on vacation you want to be able to sleep comfortably. I think if there was a category to rate the mattress quality, hotels would have a reason to invest in nice beds and at the very least travelers would have more information.

The breakfast buffet was excellent, many high quality choices and just made breakfast easy. Best breakfast buffet of our trip.",5,2014,09,01
47,The best location hotel in Barcelona,"I was in this hotel during Barcelona's game at the same time 
The hotel's location is amazing! Below the hotel has a metro station, the hotel close to everything, Espanya Square, singing fountains, restaurants, a shopping mall and a 10 minutes taxi ride from the harbor and nightlife 

I had a great time, fantastic holiday in this hotel is guaranteed!",5,2014,09,01
47,Good location Good Hotel,"This hotel is located in Plaza Espania which is a good location and has a metro station just below which makes commuting easy.
The hotel itself is good, but there is place for improvement . First I think management should send all front desk clerks to an English course, their English is very basic which makes communication difficult. Rooms are good very basically  equipped. A/C thermostat doesn't work so either you freeze or you need to shut it down. The doors need to be noise proofed, we could hear everyone in the corridors.
I would suggest to replace towels as they are rather worn down, and also to replace sheets at least once during a guests stay....
Breakfast was ok.
One thing that really got me p***** off was that they charge 5€ a day for using the safe. This is really a rip off taking advantage of guests concerns from Barcelona's pickpockets",4,2014,08,25
47,Room with a view,"We stayed 3 nights in this hotel and our room was great with a view straight out over Plaza Espanya.  The room itself was clean, well maintained and quite large.  In-room wifi whilst free, was very weak and should be upgraded.  The in-room safe was fine although guests have to go down to reception to obtain a lockset - a more up dated safe with a key pad in the door would be a good move.  Because of the location there was some traffic noise, but this was alleviated by the excellent windows and did not cause a sleep problem.

Location was great - just outside the front door was the entrance to the Metro and the stop for the Aerobus to the airport was a few steps away.  The area has several shops and restaurants, including the Las Arenas mall just over the road.

Front desk staff, while busy most of the time, were very helpful if not overly friendly.",5,2014,08,25
47,"Great value, fantastic location","The pool was a lovely touch, after a day of sightseeing it was perfect for a rest.  Great cocktails, gorgeous view.  Room was great, location perfect.  Aerobus stop outside, Metro next to the hotel, shops close by, perfect.

Room service was pretty average, burger arrived cold and noodles were tasteless but apart from that everything was great.",4,2014,08,20
47,Beautiful suite and gentle staff,"I was at Barcelona Plaza Hotel with my boyfriend during August. Even though it is a huge hotel, I was sourprised by the close and kind aproach of its staff anytime. The pool on the 6th floor was awesome and the outstanding view from the suite allowed us to see the hot spots of Barcelona. It is very conveniently located (metro station in front of the hotel and a taxi lane, too). High standards for a reasonable fare.",5,2014,08,19
47,Very beautiful suite,"I booked a suite to surprise my boyfriend in our anniversary and the pictures of the room were as shown on the website. The room was big and offered breathtaking views of Barcelona and the bathtube was big enough for both of us to fit in.

As many others have said, I found the check-in system was pretty slow and the staff from the reception weren't as nice as they should have been according to a 4 star hotel. There was no queue system so some guests kept skipping it and then I even had to carry my suitcase by myself because the boy belts were just taking care of people who had more luggage than I did. 

In the morning, the cleaning lady opened the door at 9 a.m and at 11 a.m when I had the chance to stay there until 12 o'clock. 

Excellent place to go around the main spots in Barcelona as tourism is concerned!",3,2014,08,18
47,WiFi problems and two-star roof terrace facilities,"Only two days into a ten day break here but feel compelled to post about the state of the WiFi in the room. 

Am on a break but also need to be connected to the Cloud. But the WiFi is so inconsistent beyond belief this is virtually impossible. You attempt to connect, it times you out, you connect, then the signal drops and you have to reconnect, and so on. You get the picture. 

Haven't tried the lobby WiFI yet, but want the comfort of working in my room as I'm attempting to work early before everyone gets up and want to head out. Have already spent a wasted 45 minutes trying to get a (consistent) connection this morning. 

And there's no facility for the WiFi connection to 'remember you' so each you log on (this is on an iPhone) so you have to go through the whole tedious process of choosing the name, then choosing the web page you want to view, at which point you're taken to the hotel's log-on landing page where you (finally) click 'enter.' And you do this every time.

If you advertise free WiFi and expect people rely on it, then you simply have to have one that works and is fit for purpose. This one is far from it.

And don't even get me started on why there are only loungers right by the pool and not in the two massive areas behind it. For those not lucky enough to bag a lounger early enough the only option is to lay your towel on the astroturf strips behind the pool area. 

This is a two-star roof terrace crying out to be transformed into something that matches the four-star rating of the hotel.",4,2014,08,18
47,nice hotel,"We asked for two rooms with a connecting door. we ended with two rooms that were very far from each other. It was hard for the kids to be far from us at night. talking to the front desk did not help at all, I was very disappointed!!!
Breakfast was nice but we had to wait long time for refilling things that were missing from the menu, the staff were not forthcoming.",4,2014,08,18
47,HotelIs dangerous.... Staff extremely rude and unprofessional,Myself and my husband where staying in this hotel from the 12th to the 15th of this month. On the Thursday morning we woke up to find we had been locked into our room. We tried for approx 20 mins to open the lock and after that we called reception. The maintenance man came 10 mins later and took another 40 mins to get us out of the room. As you can imagine we were very annoyed being stuck in our room for over an hour on our holiday but we were frightened thinking about what a dangerous situation this could of been. If there was a medical emergency or a fire in the hotel we would of died. I complained to the receptionist explaining that it was a health & safety issue and her response was extremely rude. She told me these things happen and that we were only 5 mins in the room. When I told her it was over one hour the other receptionist interrupted me and said she sent the service man up. I told her he did arrive but it took him another 40mins to open the door. They were both extremely rude and unprofessional and clearly need a class in customer service skills. Another customer complained her room wasn't ready at 3 o clock and was told the policy was rooms would be ready from 2 so she would just have to wait. She also was extremely unsatisfied with their clear lack of empathy for tired customers who pay their wages. My husband requested to speak to the manager on the Friday and was told he wasn't there so the manger would contact him on the Saturday morning. We were not contacted! Again extremely unsatisfactory. The blatant lack of understanding and professionalism was actually quite shocking for a hotel who presumably rely on word of mouth,3,2014,08,17
47,Grea Hotel,"The hotel was awesome and fantastic .
Every thing was perfect. It has a great location and very near to metro station. The cleanness and hame service was very good. The staff was lovely. The bad thing that they was restricted about the chek-in time.",4,2014,08,15
47,Perfect Anniversary,"Fabulous hotel in the heart of Barcelona, it was our wedding anniversary so decided to treat ourselves to a suite....WOW we weren't disappointed it was everything and more, stunning views and a treat the evening fountain light show right outside our window.  We had a fantastic time there and will go back and would recommend to anyone.
Car parking was great underneath the hotel.
Only negative was breakfast was like a chaotic cattle market, searching for cutlery, just seemed under staffed, but plenty of choice",5,2014,08,14
47,"Excellent location, decent hotel but lacks 4 star qaulity","Hotel is in an ideal central location to everything that most people would be visiting while in Barcelona. Hotel is situated about 15 minutes from terminal 2 at Barcelona Airport. I would highly recommend getting the aerobus to this hotel. Cost is €5.90 per single trip or around €10.50 for return which is valid for 10 days. You will need to get aerobus 'A2' which will take you to plaza Espanya. This is the first stop and is just directly on the opposite side of the road from the hotel. When returning from the hotel the aerobus stop is literally outside the hotel door, again its 'A2' which will take you back to the airport (for T2) or else 'A1' for terminal 1. If you buy return tickets make sure you keep them somewhere safe as they are basically like a till receipt, I made the unfortunate mistake of throwing it out - mistaking it for an old receipt so I had to pay again for another single journey.

Once we arrived at the hotel, the reception area looked nice as you would expect for a 4* hotel. However, the reception staff were exceptionally slow in dealing with people at the reception desk. Checking in at any hotel should be pretty plain sailing, but unfortunately at this hotel it seemed to be an unnecessarily long process. They also do not have any queuing system or barriers in place so people with other inquiries were skipping the queue left, right and centre and the staff did nothing about it. The check in staff however were friendly and helpful but this was overshadowed by their slow attitude. 

Once we got in to our room we were initially satisfied as the room was nicely decorated and was just what was expected. However, there was a strong smell of stale cigarette smoke in our room for the entire 7 days we stayed there. We also noticed a large clump of long hair by the window (one presumed maybe from the housekeeper) but this didn't bother us too much as the room appeared generally clean. Bed was comfortable - although I personally found the pillow uncomfortable, it was bearable.
Wifi in the room was surprisingly good and 99% of the time it worked fine for us. Room had no kettle for tea/coffee making facilities which I feel is not good for a 4* hotel. I rang reception to ask for one and was told these are not available. I rang down to reception on Monday evening for an iron as these are not provided in the rooms, and I didn't get it until Wednesday. After 4 phone calls to reception for an iron I resulted to asking the housekeeper who kindly got me one straight away. I would recommend bringing your own travel iron if you have one as it seems the hotel only have a handful to give out. 
On our second day the mini bar in out room wasn't working properly and we noticed a smell of sewer coming from our bathroom. We reported this straight away and went out for the day, when we came back these had both sorted promptly.
The hotel TV lacks English speaking channels. There is 2 news channels and 2 poor movie channels so we didn't get watching any TV when just relaxing in the hotel room.

The pool and the 'fitness' centre at this hotel was very very disappointing! The fitness 'suite' is a small room with literally 3 treadmills in it along with a solarium. There is NO weights or any other piece of fitness equipment. what you see in the picture is literally all there is! The swimming pool is not as small as it looks in the hotel pictures but unfortunately there is only 15 sunbeds in the entire pool area. For a hotel of this size it is absolutely ridiculous. Pool area is overcrowded with people waiting on sunbeds. On one day we witnessed an extremely heated argument among guests who were fighting over sunbeds. This could have easily been prevented by the hotel if they supplied more sunbeds. In the entire week we stayed here we were only able to get lying on sunbeds once. On the same day there was a huge pile of dirty pool towels and no clean ones to give out to people. When we arrived there was already over a dozen people around the pool with no towels. After waiting over 20 minutes and still no towels, we went  in to the hotel and asked the housekeeper who was more than happy to help us. This situation at the pool fell well below any hotels standards let alone a 4*. There is a huge roof top area with some fake green which people were lying on with towels due to sunbed shortage. Staff at the pool were not actively managing the sunbed situation. Guests were 'reserving' sunbeds and leaving the pool on some occasions for over 2 hours and staff did not move any towels for other guests.

Getting around Barcelona from this hotel is an absolute breeze as the metro (underground subway) stop is roughly 10 steps from the hotels front door. If you don't fancy the metro there is ample bus stops and taxis right outside the hotel. We purchased a 'T10' card for travelling around on the metro. It is the best option as there is a metro stop at all main attractions. The 'T10' card costs €10.30 which is an absolute bargain!

Hotel is located right beside the 'arenas' shopping centre which is a great place. Full of national/international stores plus has a rooftop viewing deck and plenty of restaurants. Also directly opposite the hotel are the magic fountains. If you're lucky you might get a room at the front of the hotel with a nice view of these.

There is a cafe on the ground level of the hotel called 'plaza cafe' which does good deals for breakfast which include a coffee and croissant for €2.85 plus a range of other good offers. We ate here for breakfast as it was significantly cheaper than anywhere else. 

There is also a supermarket in the shopping centre across the road which we purchased our water and snacks from. 5 litres of water for €1.10.

Overall this hotel is just OK. Main good point about this hotel is it's location. However, I would not stay at this hotel again.",3,2014,08,14
47,"Silly little quibbles , great location","This hotel would get five stars from me if 
1.they moved the small room safe from floor level (lying on my stomach to find objects that had slipped to the back was uncomfortable and would have been impossible for my husband who is less mobile!)
2. they upgraded the wifi.( no worse than a lot of places but irritating and husbands ipad would not connect at all; real irritation was the front desk staff resigned agreement that it did not work well in the rooms)
3. they provided more chairs or loungers on the roof terrace and kept it open when the magic fountain was playing; it has to have the best view of the performance in town but closes at 9 p.m. when the fountain starts!
That said the front of house staff are very helpful when they can be and the extra payment for a room with a front view is well worth it. Beds are comfortable, air conditioning works . No reason to avoid staying here and you can expect to have an enjoyable stay so long as wifi and somewhere to sit out are not essential to your experience.",4,2014,08,10
47,Great Location,"Fantastic location on the Plaza de Espanya with superb views of the magic roundabout and up the avenue to the magic fountain (ask for these rooms if you can get them). Family of 5 stayed in 2 rooms which were good without being fantastic. As stated by others this is a very busy hotel which handles a lot of tour groups but staff at reception were helpful most of the time (special mention of Tenzin who is particularly helpful). Some problems with late check-in and room availability and late check-out so book these in advance if you need them. Safe is also a little tricky to use.

There is not a lot of detail provided of the hotel facilities when you check in (ie no useful guide in the room) but the pool is excellent (hard to find on 7th floor but use lift to 6th & go up the stairs). It can get crowded as there is a relatively small no of loungers & chairs but sun-bathers can lie on the 'green mini golf surface'  at the back & sides of the roof. Great view of the city from the roof also.

Breakfast is strange as we had not booked (€16 seems too much) but after a few days we used the gourmet bar / cafe on ground floor as they were just charging €10. Not sure of diff between this and the atrium (seems to be for tour parties) but the service was very good in there and the food throughout the day is also good and reasonably priced.  We didnt use the other restaurants in the hotel.

Wifi is terrible in the rooms (keeps on dropping) but very good in lobby (comfortable seats).

Bull Ring shopping mall next door is good with supermarket on lower ground level plus cheap cafes etc with lots of shops and good restaurants on top floor with amazing views.

Metro location right below is very handy and bu an all day pass or 10 tickets. Connecting transfers between lines at some stations can be quite a walk.

Top tip is to take the sight seeing tour buses at the start of your trip (add a 2nd day for a small extra cost) and do the whole tour and then decide where you want to go. Our favourites were

Sagrada familia (amazing but crowded so book tickets in advance inc audio )
Cable car to Castle de Mountjuic (we walked to cable station from hotel). Best views of city and very interesting
La rambla is busy & dirty but worth seeing particularly in gothic qtr on cathedral side
Barca FC stadium tour (even for a Man U fan)
Aquarium
Happy Pills sweet shop
Beach + waterfront (water has a lot of rubbish floating and beach is stont apart from at end near jetty's)
Magic fountain show (Thur to Sundays from 9.00)- quite crowded but worth walking up from hotel
Millions of parks/ squares",4,2014,08,09
47,Great Location - Busy Hotel,"Situated on the Place de Espanya this hotel offers good value, comfortable (if simple) rooms in an excellent location to visit all of the attractions that Barcelona has to offer. The hotel feels geared up a fora large groups rather than individuals or single families - but the staff are pleasant, eager to help and always trying to provide that personal touch. 
The hotel has a basic gym and a nice rooftop pool and bar, although with so much to see and do in the city this is somewhat superfluous.
The room service was a nightmare but Tenzin has assured us that it was a blip.
Wouldn't hesitate to recommend it as a base for Barcelona, but if you are looking for a luxurious hotel experience you will be disappointed.",3,2014,08,05
47,"Excellent location, great hotel. Average customer service.","Just returned from a 5 night stay here. The hotel is in an excellent location; about 10-15 minute ride from the airport (you can get a bus direct from the airport), right near the shopping centre and the musical water fountains, metro station right outside.  
On arrival we were very impressed the guy who checked us in was polite and welcoming, he even gave us a free gift- a mug and spoon. Our room was on the 6th floor with a massive king size bed and an amazing few of the city- the room had robes, air conditioning (which was a god send) water, and a mini bar.  The tea and coffee making facilities were a bit poor- only two cartons of milk and two tea bags which weren't replaced throughout our stay (tried to ask for me but only housekeeping have access to the milk cartons- bit disappointing since it was their mistake and I was told to ask housekeeping in the morning) not what we expect from a 4*. 

Breakfast was ok- I've seen better in a 4* but there was plenty of choice. 

Anyway we had a lovely stay regardless and would visit this hotel again due to it's fantastic location and lovely views. ",4,2014,08,03
47,Disappointed,Very disappointed in this hotel. Checked in today. Seemed like a nice place but it was problem after problem. First off you need to put a deposit in to get the lock mechanism and key for the safe. For a hotel of this caliber the safe should be ready to go. We have been to other hotels in Spain and never had to do this.  And they didn't inform us of this during check in. The refrigerator was broken and we had medication and they refused to fix it that day and told us we would need to wait until tomorrow. All they had to do was replace the thing but instead they said too bad but you can store it in the hotel reception fridge. That doesn't work for medication you need every few hours.  Then we tried to use the sink and it wouldn't drain so I contacted the desk about this issue as well. I would expect this in a low class motel and not a hotel such as this.,2,2014,08,02
47,City break,"This hotel is the perfect location to visit Bacelona located in the beautiful Plaza Espana beside the metro and Aerobus. Bedrooms adequate size and spotless. Excellent breakfast and helpful courteous staff. Only one small minus point - bar prices very high by Spanish standards and if you want a beer they only have ONE large glass in the bar ( too bad if someone else gets there before you) and a variety of smaller glasses for small beers , all holding a different amount but the price is the same for all!",4,2014,08,02
47,very good!,"the hotel was great and clean.located in the center:you have a metro at the entrance of the hotel
 there are also a lot of shops,restaurants and a mall.
we were very much plaesed with the hotel nothing bad to say.",5,2014,08,01
47,First time in Europe,"The hotel is conveniently located near shops, restaurants and metro. The breakfast / buffet had a good selection of tasty food and drinks. Was a hassle to get your coffee as there were only two coffee makers for so many guests. The guest room was clean as well was the bathroom. It was sometimes difficult to keep the shower water from leaving the shower and tub area as they had only a small glass wall that covered a third of the tub edge. The beds were extremely hard and were two twin size beds that slid away easily on the wood floor, creating a bit of comedy during the evening. The view from our window was not inspiring. We were looking at a more depressed area of the city. The pool had a beautiful view of the plaza and fountain. The pool was only one depth, over 6 ft? Also not enough sitting or lounging chairs near the pool. Overall it was a decent hotel. We stayed here with a tour group. Would like to check out a suite here next time!",3,2014,07,30
47,Great views and swimming pool,"Very good location (metro and airport bus), comfortable rooms, beautiful views over Plaza de Espanya and a gorgeous swimming pool, all for a very reasonable price. The hotel restaurants are also very good.",5,2014,07,29
47,Good location and nice service,"we stayed there for 4 nights. good location, very close to the expo area and not very far (walking distance) from the port. the rooms are very clean, comfort for couples, they served nice and healthy breakfast with fresh juices and good coffee. another advantage is that the hotel is not located on the Rambla. we are recommending to stay in this hotel during the stay in Barcelona.",4,2014,07,29
47,"Tired, old furnishings in suite","Stayed here just for a night before the end of our 18 day trip.  Booked a suite for my 14 year son and I as a treat.  Boy, was I disappointed.  Check in was a bit slow and as the porter tried to enter out suite his key did not work.  Upon first glance it looked okay and the view to the Las Arenas and the Magic Fountains was lovely.  Upon closer inspection though there were gouges in the bedroom furniture, and the clear casing around the brass doorknobs was peeling.  There was a giant tub overlooking the arena but unfortunately the doubled paned windows had moisture issues and you couldn't get a clear view.  There was a lot of damage to the trim around these windows and there was a lot of dirt on the tub surround.  Also my son was in the living room while I was taking a bath and a member of the housekeeping staff entered our unit without knocking.  Not impressed.  Would never stay here again.",2,2014,07,29
47,"Great location , great pool !","Stayed 5 nights in the Suite Reloj and thorouly enjoyed this hotel. As usual with the Catalonia Hoteles staff, they are well trained, efficient and courteous with an excellent attitude towards customer service. This makes all the difference to a good  hotel stay and an excellent one. A special thanks to Pedro on the Rooftop Pool for his professionalism and humour, an excellent member of the team. The view from the pool is stunning and the ambience makes you want to spend a while there every day, even though there is so much to do in this fantastic city. The hotel is also ideal for transport links with the metro adjacent, Aerobus outside and Estacio Sants a five minute stroll away. You also have the Arena centre next door and a wealth of restaurants nearby. What more do you need.:-)",5,2014,07,28
47,Lovely hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for 7 nights and really enjoyed our time here. The staff were friendly, the rooms were very clean and well decorated. The room has a lovely walk in shower which was great after spending the day walking around Barcelona! We used the swimming pool a couple of times and the pool area is very nice. The only criticism of this is there isn't enough space to sit at the pool for all the guests wanting to use it. There were people waiting quite a while to use a sunbed so if you're coming for a relaxing pool/sunbathing type of break it's probably not the best hotel to stay in. However, the location is perfect for seeing the city. The metro is right outside and there's a shopping centre next door that has some lovely restaurants at the top. Overall I would definitely stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to others.",4,2014,07,25
47,A great location and fine hotel,"We went to this hotel during a school trip. The hotel is huge and mainly accommodates groups, the service is fine even though it could be better, the rooms are clean and tidy, the standard 4 star room. It was overall a nice experience. What I particularly enjoyed is the breakfast (It's usually like that in all hotels in Barcelona). Although we had one bad experience which is communicating with the staff: while ordering sushi the host did not understand our order and we had to repeat it for a good 15 min... And what really disappointed us is the fact that we did not receive our order and were told multiple excuse when we called back the main one was that we ordered  10 mins before they close which is false because we ordered well before but the attendant took too much time to understand. But I agree this kind of incident may occur but it was an overall good experience.",4,2014,07,23
47,"Best location , great service","I happened to stay at the Catalonia Plaza hotel in Barcelona just few days ago ; the hotel was always crowded ( I guess because of the summer holidays ) and full of students and tourist , as well as business people all over. Is not that expensive and the mall is just in front of the hotel ,",4,2014,07,22
47,Best hotel.Best services.Best location.,"I stayed at Barcelona Catalonia Plaza for 6 days and I can say that it was an excelent experince.The location was awesome,in Plaza Espanya,easy to reach the most important attractions of the city.(metro station is exactly at the door).Room was very comfortable,with a modern design and a perfect view of the Magic Fountains.Breakfast was really tasty and varied.The staff was helpful and friendly.The Aerobus stops right there,in 15-20 minutes you can reach the airport(Terminal 1&2).Arenas Espagna,one of the best mall in Barcelona is next to the hotel,it has a lot of good shops,like Mango,H&M,etc and also good restaurants and a supermarket with fresh and cheap food.Free Wi-fi in the hotel,you must ask the staff at the reception for the username/password. If i will be back to Barcelona,i will definetly choose Barcelona Catalonia Plaza again.",5,2014,07,22
47,Really nice stay,"I used to live in Barcelona and I have been back there for visits. This hotel is located in the middle of ""Plaza España"" which is a very good area of the city. There is metro, train and bus stops just outside the hotel. There is also a shopping center in the same square, where you can find many stores, a supermarket, restaurants , etc. 

It is a nice and quiet area during the night, and if you are out of time with the metro service, there are several bus stops where you can arrive with night buses. One of the BEST things, and one of the reasons I selected in the first place, is because you can take a bus at the Airport which stops just in the square, so you wouldn't need to run with your luggage on Metro statios without elevators, etc... it is a big plus for me.

It is close to Montjuic, where you can see a beautiful show with the illuminated fountains during the summer. If you are lucky, you can have this view from your room (I got it!)

Rooms are very nice.There is a lot of space, it is comfortable and clean. It looks like a business hotel. 

Recommended!",4,2014,07,20
47,The city view rooms are superb!,"Hi. First hotel on a 2 week stay in Catalonia and Costa Brava. Stayed here for 2 nights on a Saturday and Sunday end of June 2014. The Barcelona Airport bus works a treat (once you find it outside the Airport) and drops you off across the road from the hotel. 5 Euros each one way it is very cheap. City view rooms are great, I would highly recommend. Magic fountain very close (you can see it from the bedroom window) and the highlight of our stay. Breakfast a bit pricey at 16 euros but they had a deal for 10 euros while I was here so had it one day. Good for 10 euros. Not so good at 16 euros. Café next door does coffee and a croissant for less than 2 euros. 
Loads of bars/restaurants near by and around hotel. Main train station (Barcelona Sants) is 5-10 minute walk away. Rambla is about 10-15 minute walk away. Rooms are great. Staff were great. Rooftop pool is very nice although did not use it.",5,2014,07,18
47,"Great location, awesome room","The view of my room was outstanding - montjuic and plaza espania right out of the window, many bars and restaurants around the hotel , metro and rail station near the hotel. The service was not perfect.
Room safe terrible and they ask for extra fee to use it.
Great wifi all round the hotel fast and easy connection.",5,2014,07,17
47,Barcelona,"This hotel is centrally located, very close to the subway station, shops and restaurants.  Hotel is large, first impression is that the lobby is rather dated and the furniture has seen better days.  Room was a good size, bed was very hard, also the pillows.  Breakfast which was included was served in a large cafeteria type dining room, not much atmosphere but food quite adequate.  Staff  on front desk were professional not over friendly, at times the front desk was very busy either that or not enough staff.",3,2014,07,09
47,Nice hotel; great location; bit old,"The hotel is perfectly situated next to the espana circle and montjuic. It's possible to see the fountain show from the hotel's rooftop pool. Service was very good. Maintenance is not perfect as the building is old. Food isn't great but who wants to eat in the hotel in Barcelona anyway?
",4,2014,07,07
47,Very nice lacation!,"Stayed here 3 nights and generally, our stay here was lovely, considering that the most of the time we were away for visiting Barcelona's beauties.There are positive and negative points. First of all, the location of this hotel is central and with a beautiful sight, if even is surrounded by principal and noisy streets. The beauty of Espana Square, the Magic Fountain, Montjuic... offset all of this noisy inconvenient. We had a room at the sixth floor with the view to this splendid attractions. At reception we was received with politeness and until they verified and prepared our documents, they gave us welcome drinks. (we had some problems with the credit cards, that I will mention at the end of this review.. maybe it help other travelers that encounter same problem). A valet took us the luggage until our room that honestly wasn't a 4 stars room but the beautiful sight from the windows, almost compensated this inconvenience... if at the first look seems to be very chic, at a closer look the furniture is old, we seen the dust that wasn't cleaned up on the floor and table. Found hair in the tub and the sink was not cleaned well. We spent 25 euros extra per day, to have view to the square and to have bathrobe and slippers, a bottle of water, newspaper and chocolate ""pearls"" :)))) ... I still not understand if should have this ""chocolate pearls"" the water and newspaper every day or just in the first day :)).... because in the first day we had just a bottle of ""hot water"" and four little balls of chocolate (that was the pearls :)) ) then nothing till the last day. The newspaper I  had it once after two days and some calls and reclamations at the reception. The wine/water glasses, the teaspoons and the coffe cups we found it very dirty and have remained the same, dirty until the last day. But on the other hand, the hotel is nice, with a large reception hall that is elegant. Nice pool with terrace and bar on the roof from where you can see the surroundings of the hotel, nice and large dining hall where can take tasty and plenty breakfast. Free Wi-Fi that was pretty faster in all the hotel.The restaurant is good also. The Spa center is ok... we were at the sauna and the massage was well done .They have fitness center also. Per general the reception staff was very polite but very busy, the hotel is nice with beautiful sight and except for the cleanliness of the room that was disappointing, everything was ok.
Now, an information that maybe it help other travelers... we had a disturbing problem with the credit cards when we wanted to pay our stay, and it was only in this hotel and some other places like the ticket machine and some ATM. For  the rest, in the restaurants or other shops we didn't had this problem. So if you have PIN code with five digits like italian credit cards or other , you may be unable to pay because in Spain the credit cards have the PIN code with four digits. So, some POS will not recognize your PIN. For this try to digit only the first four digits and it works. We waited half an hour with some calls to our bank that after some contradictory discussion a lady has the idea of trying to digit only the first four numbers, and it's work finaly and our heart has come back :)))",4,2014,07,07
47,Exceptional,"Great, great location.  Very nice and POSH.  The hotel room, lobby, restaurant, pool area, everything was exceptional.  The staff were EXCEPTIONAL too! NO complaints. Very convenient to metro, a few steps from the front door of the hotel.",5,2014,07,06
47,"Location,Location","Stayed here 2 days after our 7 day Cruise.
As the saying goes Location is everthing and Catalonia Barcelona fit the
bill very nicely.located very close to the Art Museum and fountains where theres lot of restaurants and things to do.
The staff was courteous and friendly.I even had a staff member on the front desk,remind a lady with bad manners not to cut in front of me.Since I was in line first.
Rooms were nice and a good value for the money.My wife and I would choose this Hotel again.",4,2014,07,03
47,Lovely stay,"Just arrived home from a 3 night stay at this hotel. We decided to go with a city view room and definitely think that made a huge difference. It was lovely to sit by the window and admire the scenery both during the day and night. Although, it can get quite noisy at night so might not be suited to young families. 

The location was excellent with a metro station just outside and a big shopping centre with many restaurants. For that reason we decided against eating breakfast at the hotel and went to a nice cafe serving croissants, fruit etc. We were able to use the metro to visit Camp Nou, the beach, Sagrada Familia, La Rambla etc., which were at most a 20 minute journey away. 

The pool area was a nice area to relax. We liked how the area wasn't too busy and sun loungers or nearby seats were available on our visits at 9am and later in the afternoon. 

One disappointment though was that we had been told before arriving on more than one occasion that it would be possible to extend our check out time from 12pm to 6pm. On arrival we were told to return on the day of checkout to confirm this. However, on this day we were informed that the hotel was fully booked and that this would not be possible. It wasn't too much of an issue in the end as we were able to leave our suitcases with the hotel until our flight in the evening. A warning in advance would have been helpful though.",4,2014,07,03
47,NICE BUT BE CAREFULL,"Hotel have wonderful location on Plaza Espania. Rooms are clean and comfortable, breakfast is excellent. Big problem is noise of traffic, you can hear ambulance and police almost every night. As hotel is big, is normal that all the time there are many people in the lobby. Unfortunately it means: prepare  your self and be patience, as you have to wait for any question on lobby desk at least 10-15 minutes. 
What to be careful!!!!: During my staying (4 days), two persons were robbed in the lobby area:
both men, wear jackets: one man approche and tell you- you jacket is not clean (as before he put some white stuff on your jacket), please i can clean it for you. As the thief wears nice dress, people think he is hotel employee. Result: your wallet is gone! I think hotel management should take care for security.  People who were robbed told us that in the hotel.",3,2014,07,01
47,My first time in Barcelona ,"As it was my first visit to Barcelona I will say staying at the Plazas was a very good choice if you are not familiar with the city nor traveling with someone who is. It is located in the center of Plaza de Espana  one of the many city center plazas of the town. From the airport you take the L3 bus from A1 to the plaza and it is right across the street from the bus stop in the city center. And once you leave the the bus stop back to A1 is literally right outside the doors of the hotel. Super easy! 

It seems to be a popular stay for tourists from all over the country. If you walk outside and turn right there are streets full of markets and great shopping. Not to mention the Soccer arena\mall is across the other way which houses many restaurants atop the roof. From there you will see a gigantic building that resembales a cathedral that is right down the street on another one of the turns inside the plaza. A very short walk and a few escalator rides to the top and you find it is a museum. Great place for lots of pictures! Not from here is the La sagrada de familia as well and the gottic park. The metro has multiple entrances outside the hotel which is the best means for traveling farther than you are comfortable to walk but be prepared to walk regardless. 

As far as the hotel itself it was not as modern looking and new as the pictures online make it look. The lobby is pretty and they have lots of restarants inside and around the corner as well but the room was smaller than appeared online. Though I'm sure many are. It does have wood flooring throughout all of the halls I guess that's where the modern comes in. And if you like AC this one is cold! Constantly. The bathroom was a pretty decent size with a good size shower as well. While over seas you are not expecting to be in the room much however so size isn't too much of a problem. 

Like I said great location for new bees! ",4,2014,06,27
47,Great stay stunning location,"Just back from 5 days at this hotel and have to say it is in the best location.

The view from the roof top pool is stunning and to see the fountain all light up was impressive and a must for all. We didn't realise it is only on certain days so thankfully we caught it before we had to go home.

Room was clean, large with plenty of storage. Didn't have much of a view with a tree at the back so would be looking to stay at the front of the hotel in future. The flusher on the toilet is very loud and you can hear the other rooms throughout the night/morning. Bed is quite hard but you get used to it after a few days. Some more english channels would be great. Air con is good, wifi is perfect great connection no issues and no noisy neighbours.  

Entrance is very grand with the chairs, pillars and piano. The gourmet restaurant looked good and had large tvs showing the world cup which was ideal. 

Our room was on the second floor could hear a small rumble from the metro but only when in the bathroom. No street noise to keep us awake throughout the night so we slept well. 

We used the tour buses across the road for a day or two to see the sights which was fantastic. 
If getting the aerobus from the airport you get off at the first stop which is outside this hotel it cost 10 euro each for a return ticket which lasted several days.  Metro is also right outside we didn't use it this time but will look to in future. 

Several small cafes surrounding the area and takeaways which is good late at night and early morning if you aren't eating at the hotel. 

Shopping centre is across the road with a lift that takes you up to the roof where you can walk around and enjoy the view. Several restaurants are on the roof we ate at a nice Italian restaurant which was reasonable and food was good. Also loved the happy rock bar and grill.  Shops are good for picking up bits and pieces some presents etc. 

We didn't use the safe in the room i think you need to pay for the key but all our belongings were untouched. 

The hotel has a spa and small gym, i also spotted some tanning beds. The pool is up the stairs from the spa which isn't too well signposted from the corridor. 

I think the hotel is missing out by not letting people sit up by the pool at night and have a few drinks. Not sure why this is...possibly due to safety but if staff were around i don't see the problem. The view is amazing and with the fountain lit up at night it can be busy it'd be nice to enjoy the view from the hotel roof top. 

Not related to the hotel but after reading several reviews etc on barcelona i was concerned about pick pockets we had no issues all week and did not feel unsafe in any way.",4,2014,06,26
47,Brand new designer hotel…..everything provided,"On my last visit to Barcelona I stayed at The Arts and thought it was becoming a little tired. I heard about Catalonia Square, booked and stayed two days and it greatly exceeded expectations. 

Staff are all extremely helpful (having said that, most people in Barcelona tend to be helpful and friendly…a great City)……design throughout hotel is quite exceptional and refreshing. They haven't spared any expense. The location is wonderful……hotel has a small swimming pool and gym…..breakfast outside if you like.

Car park: On arriving…just drive in and via the usefully placed intercom, ask them to come down to help you park, which they will do instantly…with a smile. Car park is under hotel.

My junior suite was superb, bed comfortable…..all extras one needs were provided including some I didn't need (Toothbrush/razor/comb etc). TV was superb (there were two giant TV's in junior suite)…..and the shower is one of the best you can hope to find in any hotel….very important…..book here just for the shower.

There's a free buffet all afternoon and evening…..which I used for two meals…..perfectly decent.

All in all, this hotel is just about perfect……..and it offers great value. Why stay in a fading dump with poor showers when you can book here?",5,2014,06,26
47,"If food has been better, i would have put a 5/5","We spent 2 nights in this beautiful hotel and enjoyed its great location: just next to it a historical monument (corrida) that was turned into a mall and on its top you can enjoy a 360 panoramic view of Barcelona, facing the hotel there is the great National Palace with its stunning dancing foutain show every saturday (summer season) and last but not least Espanya metro station is just in front of the hotel entrance, you are 3 stations far away from the city center (~4mins). We had breakfast and dinner at this hotel both were buffets, dinners were poor, breakfasts fine but both were repeated (what makes them boring). Staff are very friendly and speak many languages including English and French. To sum up, yeah I advise you to stay in this hotel on a bed&breakfast basis and to request a room with the stunning view of the national palace (+amazing nightlife near the hotel) ...",4,2014,06,23
47,Great location,"Due to unforeseen circumstances with an apartment rental that did not work out, we spent one night at this hotel. What a treat it was. It is very well situated. The room was large and comfortable. They even had robes! The subway is right there. At night the Plaza Espana comes alive. The Waterfountain Show was spectacular. There are nice stores @ the 'Arena' next door. The view from the pool level is fabulous. You are in easy walking distance to the Olympic installations (they have many escalators if you have trouble walking up). The breakfast buffet was excellent, the reception workers are multilingual and very friendly. The fact the the airport shuttle stops right there was a big plus as well. Definitely would go back.",5,2014,06,21
47,Fantastic hotel and great value for money,"What a great hotel!

My girlfriend and I are staying here at the moment and so far its great! Our room is lovely, clean and has incredible view (ask for a view of the fountains!!)

The staff although we haven't had to speak to them much are very friendly.

The rooftop pool is incredible but they could do with a few more sun beds (there aren't enough).

Locations is great and its very easy to get a cab as they wait outside. 

All in all a lovely hotel!!",5,2014,06,21
47,Perfect location for the City,"The hotel is 1 stop by airport bus from the airport (about 15 minutes), so very easy to transfer to from the airport. There is a taxi rank outside (if you every need one) and the metro station entrance is also right outside. The Plaza Espana is a central point and there are many bus routes that converge here. There is also a shopping centre next door (the old bull ring) with a great food court for a quick bite. At the top of the bull ring are some nice restaurants with great views, but there are so many good places to eat in Barcelona, why stay locally!

The pool on the roof is small but great to swim around in while catching some sun, though there is a beach a few stops away on the metro if you prefer. The gym says it has some weights, but there weren't any when I was there :( The hotel staff are very helpful and always on hand if you need something. The hotel is clean and generally quiet, and the buffet breakfast is a good spread too. If you're staying in Barcelona, I'd recommend this hotel as a great central spot.",4,2014,06,18
47,Wonderful Hotel,"Just returned from a 7 night stay at this hotel and could find no faults.Excellent location,wonderful customer service,lovely view,really good varied  breakfast with plenty of choice,nice clean room,lovely pool etc.Areobus ,Metro and Hop on and Hop off  tour bus on the doorstep.So very easy to get around the city.We used the Aerobus to travel to and from the airport and it was so much cheaper than a taxi and very straight forward.Drop off point was directly outside of the hotel.I found the hotel staff very pleasant and helpful.Quick check in and check out.I have read some of the negative comments re hotel being situated on a busy island and it was noisy but i hasten to add that we were facing the island with the lovely view of the Palace and  Fountains and once we closed the window it was very peaceful.Perhaps these people should read reviews before they travel ?? Overall we had a wonderful, pleasant 1 week stay in The Catalonia Plaza and we would not hesitate to return. Well done to the management and their team.",5,2014,06,15
47,"Big, busy and noisy","A big budget hotel for tour groups - I counted 3 more tour coaches in the couple of hours after our group had settled in.  Settling in took a while due to the number of couples requesting a room change, as the rooms either face onto one of the busiest roundabouts in Barcelona, or look onto a noisy internal courtyard that hosted a function each night we stayed.  I listened to the relentless sirens and honking horns all night.  The very hard mattress and paper-thin pillows didn't help my sleep.  Good shower and reasonable bathroom but every toilet flush sounded like an overhead jet.  The rooms on each side of me woke me up twice (and I probably did the same to them).  Good, free wi-fi and room safe for security (with €40 deposit for a key).
Reception staff seemed frazzled by the constant, hectic activity and customer requests but they tried to do their job, probably with little room to be flexible as the hotel must be at capacity in season.  We felt a bit 'cattle class' at times.  The lobby was always bustling with people and their luggage.
Location near the Metro and a shopping mall (The Arena) adjacent were convenient, but it's a good walk to most of the sights this lovely city has to offer.
I might have been generous giving an 'average' rating as I'd look elsewhere if I were to come back in the future.",3,2014,06,14
47,Booked in as part of a Globus tour.,"Have already been in this chains Atoch hotel in Madrid  which was excellent & expected same quality.just been served the worst meal I have ever had in any hotel.Globus had arranged the meal for 8pm in a certain room...40+ guests arrive and the room is not even set up. We knew there was a problem.then we were moved to a room which normally seems to be used for conference guests.food selection and quality was poor.Food was served from a hallway????I had better pastry offerings for breakfast than this hotel offered as desert and don't get me started on the main meal!!! Poor quality hake-which was cold- in a country that as excellent fish and sausages!!!!-served from a banmarie was cold - give me a break.Went to bar to watch soccer and had better quality food there. good staff at reception and tried their best. Good experience in bar.but all staff seem over worked and not enough of them.room good with exception of shower which is leaking on to floor....not safe or ideal. It is so hard to believe this is same hotel chain as the hotel in  Atoche, Madrid.if we were treated this badly and with such little respect when booked in by a major tour group like Globus I wouldn't like to check in as an ordinary member of the public.",3,2014,06,13
47,Great location and breakfast!,"We arrived early than expected to the hotel and the checkin was made 2 hours prior the check-in hour without any problem. We received a high-floor room as asked. The room was really big and comfortable(except poor and thin pillows - we asked another 2 pillows).
The location is perfect for traveling around the city,the metro is just outside the hotel front door!
Magic Fountains and Montjuic is nearby as well.(5 minutes by foot)
The breakfast was the best we've experienced in Europe,rich selection of food  besides good choose of pastries and fruits.
I recommend to stay there.",5,2014,06,02
47,good choice,"I would definitely stay in this hotel again.  The hotel seemed modern and the rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable.  The staff was helpful and printed off reservations for us.  However, the best thing about the hotel was the location.  We were across the street from the old bull ring which is now a shopping center with shopping and restaurants. We ate there several times.  The hotel is across the street from the metro station and we walked to the site of the 1992 Olympic Games.  I think the area is safe but we were warned to be watchful of pickpockets at all times.",5,2014,05,28
47,Nice location,"Pros. 
Location. Metro station feet away from the front door. 
Big buffet room for breakfast.  Was able to easily handle large groups. 
Room clean. Bed ok. Powerful water pressure. 
Cons:
No view as was in an inside room. 
Long. Long. Long. Corridors. 
Lousy pillow. What's with Spain - not one good pillow all trip. 
Very hectic city atmosphere. 
Food ok. Nothing special.

47,Worst experience ever! 4 stars Hotel and totally unsafe.,"My first travel in Barcelona (and Spain) was a nightmare: we arrived in early morning (9 am) and we got our room at 3:30/16 pm! In the meanwhile we was waiting for the room, someone stole us all our bags with documents, money, and phones (at 14/14:30 pm). We've been told to pay attention to snatchers in Barcelona, but we couldn't imagine that a moment of distraction in the Hotel could have been that fateful. Moreover, the hotel crew was really rude to us (apart from an italian guy which was not always on call), and the hotel has cameras and guardians too, but they didn't get any responsability. They didn't do anything to help us, we were really lucky we  have some friends there. We felt like we were totally abandoned.
I have almost nothing to say about the hotel structure (nice, apart from cleaning service, we could clearly smell cigarette smoke when we get into our room at evening, I'm not a smoker, and this should be forbidden not only to hosts but also the all the hotel crew), but what I expect from a luxury hotel is the total devotion to clients. They barely got the ""know how"". A total fail and a deep disappointment.",1,2014,05,21
47,"good hotel, good location","nice clean room, nice staff, ok breakfast (although almost no vegtables and no salads).  there is a bidet. metro station very close. a shopping mall right across the street with many restaurants. the fountain is a walk away.",4,2014,05,16
47,Practical and wonderful location,"It is a big hotel, with all the long corridors, but the style is  nice, the view from the rooms (Plaza side) is wonderful, and I had a great room, with a working space and a sofa. The location is central to the many attractions yet not too crowded.",5,2014,05,12
47,Excellent hotel!,"We had a lovely room with a great view.
The staff were helpful and polite.

The hotel's location is excellent! there's a metro station right outside the hotel for easy transportation and a tourist bus station.

We really enjoyed the hotel and would go back with pleasure!",5,2014,05,06
47,Good hotel for business as well as city trip,"The hotel is located at the Placa Espanya, so somewhat outside of what is considered the city centre. But the metro is just in front of the hotel, there is a shopping mall across the road with a number of decent restaurants (in the former bull fight arena). But since the weather was fine I usually walked into the city (20 minutes to the Ramblas and also 20 minutes to the harbour area). The staff was always friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean and efficient, but rather thin-walled and with the wooden floors there was a lot of noise and when doors were closed/slammed nearby, the wall of the rooms were shaking. The AC was rather noisy. My room was on a lower floor so I could hear and feel the underground metro that runs underneath the hotel. The breakfast room is large and the buffet is very good. Although I was here for business I would also consider the hotel for a city trip.",4,2014,05,06
47,"Great view, good location, lacking a bit of personality for me","This hotel was picked as part of tour, so I'll say upfront I can't comment on the value of the hotel since it was included in the price. 

We were fortunate to be given a room that is an upgrade - it has a view over Plaza Espana and looking up towards the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya. The view was just fantastic - it is probably the best view I've ever had from a hotel room.

My one problem with the hotel - and this is a bit of a personal preference - is that it was very generic.  I had no real feeling of being in Spain - it felt like so many other contemporary hotels.  I like a hotel that feels like part of the community it is in and has character.  This hotel lacked that.

The location is good - it is within walking distance of the above-mentioned museum and the Olympic park and botanical garden behind it.  There is a subway station right in front of the hotel, which was great.  I would have preferred it to be closer to the Gothic quarter.  It is right next to the Las Arenas mall - which is a disappointingly generic mall, but with a nice, outside roof area.  There weren't many restaurants around the hotel, aside from the ones in the mall (and least we didn't find any during our short stay).

Pros:
- Room view (but this is an upgrade)
- Modern, well-appointed room. Reasonable size.
- The breakfast buffet was quite good, including an espresso machine
- Decent wifi
- Beds were comfortable - nothing special

Cons:
- Broken room safe (I didn't bother to report it)
- The dinner buffet was not great, and very generic.  It was hard to tell you were in Spain based on the food served.
- No hooks to hang stuff up (a minor issue, but a bit annoying)",4,2014,05,05
47,Close to everything!,"This is a great hotel! From design to the distance of Sagrada Familia, Casa Batllo or Casa Milla, (around 10 minutes drive to any of those) to shopping, is perfect (regarding the shopping...Arena Mall is across the road from the hotel.
   
   Staff are very helpful and pleasant. I would highly recommend this hotel!",5,2014,05,02
47,Nothing to fault!,"I really don't have anything to fault about this hotel. We came here during a contiki and the hotels prior to this one were grose - so when we got here we thought we were in heaven! The rooms were clean, and comfortable and big! I really enjoyed staying here and would refer it to others for sure. It is in a great location! 15 minutes from the Ramblas. And the breakfast here was awesome! I loved the breakfast area as well.",5,2014,04,29
47,"Great hotel, but beware of Room 340","The most important thing to say about this hotel is that it is well-built. All of the rooms and the lobby are designed beautifully, and I love it.
The staff is very nice, always willing to help.
The location is amazing, right next to the magic fountains and the new Arena mall.

However: Please note that our toilet (room 340) was always stuck. Each time we called and asked for a plummer, the nice (really nice!) staff promised to send someone but they never came for at least 24 hours.
This is the only disadvantage I can think of, but it was really disturbing. p.s - the rest of our family in the other rooms did not had this issue.",4,2014,04,28
47,Perfect location for sightseeing in Barcelona,"I visited Barcelona in April 2014 with my mother and nephew (who both celebrated their birthdays that week), and we chose hotel Catalonia Barcelona Plaza Hotel - and it turned out that it was the best decision ever! 
First, the location is brilliant in every way - right in Plaza España, overlooking a beautiful fountain and the Montjuic mountain with the singing fountains. The airport shuttle bus stop is in 20m from the hotel entrance; the metro (red and green lines take you straight to La Rambla etc) entrance is in 7m from the entrance; the fountains are a 10 minute walk away. A big food market is in a 10 minutes walk too. A big shopping center is a 2 min walk away. 
There are also many cute places to eat nearby, including a Spanish and a Japonese cuisine restaurants, and a breakfast diner (around the corner) in the hotel building. 
The staff of the hotel was very nice, and despite the fact that it took quite some time to check us in, we felt very welcome. 
Our suite was on the 9th floor with a spectacular view of Barcelona from 3 sides (plaza España+Montjuic+singing fountains, Barcelona center, park+ Tibidabo), we literally spent quite some time by the windows watching the city life and feeling quite happy while doing it. :)
The suite had 2 rooms: spacious bedroom with twin beds and the most comfortable pillows ever; a common room with a TV, sofas and a big dining table; a small bathroom and a big bathroom with a shower, twin sinks and a huge bath. Lots of space for hanging clothes too. ;) 
The rooms are nicely furnished in a darkened color-scheme, and while the furniture looks like it's been there quite a while, everything worked fine. The only downside for me was weak water flow in the sinks and tub (shower and toilet were fine). 
The room was cleaned nicely every day. 
All in all, a perfect room if you're staying with family and need a bit more space. But i would have taken it again for the view only. 
Thank you and hope to return soon!",5,2014,04,28
47,"Excellent location, great price","We spent a weekend in this hotel and I must say I really liked my stay. We got a very good price (less than 80 EUR/night) and although the breakfast was not included, we were offered free breakfast by the reception staff. The hotel's position is excellent, for those who like to walk, it's about 15 min walk to the Ramblas, 45 min to Barceloneta etc. For the others, the metro is just at the entrance of the hotel and the city bus from the airport also stops just in front. 
The room was big, comfortable, with a nice view of the Plaza Catalonia (well isolated from the traffic noise), everything functional. The only small drawback that wi-fi was disconnecting and every time you had to connect with the password. But it was working well!
The breakfast was quite varied and good, only the place is a bit noisy, reminds of a canteen of a big enterprise. I wouldn't pay 16 Eur for it, but as it was free, it was greatly appreciated. 
It was too cold to use the pool, but the pool area is nice, just like in the pictures. The fitness area us nearly non-existent, it's only a room with three machines, just like in the picture.",4,2014,04,28
47,Excellent location,"A1 bus, which goes to Terminal 1 of BCN airport, stops in the plaza and picks up right in front of the hotel. There are two metro lines (red L1 and gree L3) in front of the hotel too. Barcelona Sants train station is ten minutes' walking away. So it is a great base to explore the city and the nearby area. 

The rooms facing the plaza were really nice -- we enjoyed the view immensely for our four-day stay. The downside is it is rather noisy at night too even with the window closed. But we are both sound sleepers so we even slept with window opened (in April) -- since fresh air beats air-conditioner and the added boom of traffic noise. 

Staff were very friendly and willing to help. It was a nice stay and it added charm to the city of Barcelona and we hope to go back some day!",5,2014,04,26
47,Perfect location and nice staff,"The hotel is in a perfect location, I cannot imagine a better one. The breakfast is good in choice and quality. The staff is really nice and helpful even if we were bothering them almost everyday. Especially Veronica and the bellboy Marc. They can suggest you any kind of place!",5,2014,04,20
47,"Great location, friendly staff, decent breakfast","This is a great location for a short stay in Barcelona. The 46 local bus and Aeorbus express both pick up and drop off in front of the hotel, so if you're someone who is worried about getting lost to and from the airport, this is the place for you! The wifi worked somewhat decently, you can have to log in often. Breakfast was adequate (although no champagne for mimosas!). The rooms are a decent size for 2 people, and you can get two twin beds or a king. Rooms with a view of La Arena are nice. The staff is really where this place stands out - Ariadna was amazingly friendly and professional! Will definitely stay here again.",5,2014,04,14
47,"Very good location, great view","The room was OK, nothing impressive, comfortable bed though. Average bathroom. Great view from the room of Plaça d'Espanya, the fountain, the Venetian towers and Montjuïc hill. Good location for public transportation.",4,2014,04,13
47,Awsome hotel,"Great location, very comfortable wuth the metro.
The rooms are very pretty and cozy, I was lucky to get a beautiful view.
brakefast is vey avarage, the coffee is pretty bad, the omlet isn't good and they don't have so many kinds of other stuff.
Very good service, very clean and welcoming.
The arena mall is adding to the value of the hotel, it's very nice mall. 
Not 5 stars but I do recomend the hotel.",4,2014,04,11
47,Average hotel,"This hotel was in a good location for access to the exhibition centre.  Queues at the desks were slow though and there was very little atmosphere in the hotel.
The rooms were basic - but reasonably comfortable. I ordered room service - which was awful.",3,2014,03,20
47,Good Location but not 4 star,The reception of the hotel was very promising and the checking-in process was quite prompt.  I'm not quite sure how to describe the rooms other than the fact that they are very wooden. They could definitely do with modernising but they were adequately equipped with TV and mini bar. Good sized bathroom although some of the tiles were cracked and the shower was lovely despite the bath being quite small. Breakfast was ok - lots of choice but very busy had to queue for a while to get served at the omelette station.  Great location as pretty much in the centre with a metro station/taxi ran right out outside.,3,2014,03,16
47,Super hotel,"This hotel one of the best in the city
Wonderful  rooms grand buffet breakfast
The staff is so helpful
Location is so good
Sopping center next door
The magic fountain is in front
The theatre district is just cross the road with night life and good restaurants pubs  and much much

47,Good location but terrible service,"This hotel is generally clean and the location is good. However it can get pretty noisy at night since it's situated at a high traffic area. The real downside is its staff and lack of a service attitude.  When my colleagues and I checked in, they asked if we wanted smoking or non smoking rooms and even if we said non smoking rooms, they sent us to smoking rooms. The waiter at the restaurant refused to get out from behind the counter where he was doing nothing even though there were 4 of us at one table with one menu. My colleague had a laptop stolen from his room. In all, a really lacklustre performance from the staff. Just bad.",2,2014,03,01
47,Mediocrity,"Overall, my experience at this hotel was very mediocr an me+my colleagues won't be using it again next year for sure. I was staying here for a conference just this week, and the rooms were VERY overpriced! €250 when the standard rate is €65. (Yes, it's the agency's fault but still, that's pretty steep!)

PROS: Staff were very helpful, polite and spoke good English. The ""Umo"" Japanese restaurant was AMAZING (Me and my colleagues must have eaten there 3 nights out of 5!)
Location-wise, very good (there's the fountain, gov buildings and shops, etc..) and close to the expo centre/airport.

CONS: Wifi, the slowest I've ever encountered! I got the best signal in the room sitting on my toilet. The rooms were not ""soundproofed"" as they say in the hotel description: several times I would be woken up in the morning either by cleaners hoovering the floor above or people walking down the corridor on wooden floors. Great! Even though I was staying in the Executive Floor, the quality of the rooms was very basic, definitely not worth coming back here.",2,2014,03,01
47,Stayed overnight in a suite before departing on a cruise,Lovely view from the suite very clean and well appointed.  Although it was only one night this was a lovely room and worth the extra money.  We stayed here the night before we boarded Carnival Breeze on a 12 day cruise and found the location excelllent - be aware this area of Barcelona is rife with pick pockets especially the station.  We were robbed the year before.,5,2014,02,26
47,"Expensive and over rated , By the way dont expect fresh sheets & pillow cases!!!","Located in the beautiful city of Barcelona , this hotel gives  quick and easy access to the metro and a shopping mall. However it disappoints on a number of basics. First the breakfast is served on stone cold plates . So if you do decide to have breakfast ,  eat immediately otherwise if becomes too cold to eat. More disappointing is the house keeping. While the bathroom is cleaned nicely , the sheets and pillow cases are not changed daily. I just had to call reception today 25th February 2014 at 4pm to get it changed and was rudely told by the receptionist  that the sheets are not usually changed . Often i got no apology for  the lady  about it .However i insisted and got them changed for fresh sheets. So my advice , if you don't want to pay for an over priced hotel with poor customer service and  the probability of sleeping in sheets left from other guests , look for another hotel. Having said that though, the location is great so for a one night stay , may not be bad, but for a long business trip or holiday, you are much better off else where.

Plus i think the hotel needs to add to its website the fact that customer should not expect fresh sheets and pillow cases daily that way we all know what we are paying for from the start. I would have changed hotel but this week its busy and other similar types of places are full and expensive . Not delighted , cant wait to leave...",2,2014,02,25
47,The only place in Barcelona for me,"I always take my customers to Catalonia Plaza as I know that the people working there have great capacity and interest to provide excellent customer service. 
Besides from its premium location, spacious rooms and 5* breakfast with great variety, I feel very well taken care of here and this is important when you travel with a big group of customers, following every single move you make.",5,2014,02,18
47,A good location and a very good hotel,The room was perfect and had everything we needed. We had a nice view of the busy playa and the interesting buildings beyond. The aerobus stops outside making easy access from the airport. The breakfast was a massive buffet style and gave lots of choices. Omelettes and pancakes were being prepared to order. We would use this hotel again. Linda on reception was extremely helpful and was a mine of information. Her recommendations for restaurants were all very good.,4,2014,02,12
47,A beautiful place to stay in the heart of the city...,"In November 2010 we visited Spain as a group and during the trip in Barcelona we stayed in Catalonia Barcelona Plaza Hotel. Rooms were designed perfectly, quite enough and the outisde view from the windows were beautiful ! We only got the breakfast so I can only tell about it. You are free to eat anything from the open buffet. Wide variety of food available. The most important thing is the hotel is located just in the heart of the city. Bus stops and subway stations are just 5-10 steps away from the hotel. So you dont have to worry about the trasportation. I really liked the hotel and if I travel to Barcelone again I sure choose the same hotel for accommodation.

Note: I had to choose March 2013 as our travel date because previous dates are not available to choose ! Thats a mistake of the website. Because not all members are travelled in 2013 or 2014. I travelled in 2010 but there is no such option in the box.",5,2014,02,07
47,City Break Barcelona,"The hotel was in a great location, easy access to all transport hubs and main areas of interest. The staff at the hotel could not be more helpful and polite, they are a credit to the organisation. We had a lovely break made more enjoyable by being lucky enough to have stayed at Catalonia Barcelona Plaza Hotel.",5,2014,02,06
47,arrogant staff & bad service,"This was one of the worst hotel experiences I've ever had.  

The staff was utterly rude, under-trained and unprofessional.  There was NO issue that was handled stress-free. To the extent that the receptionist helping me print out some business related papers that I urgently needed, first read the papers and then brought them out from their back office, and more, dared to question me about the content and expressed an opinion on it.  When i talked to the manager on duty i was met with total indifference  and was asked to pay for those days that i had stayed by that time, despite the fact that i was in the middle of my stay... 

The breakfast buffet was bland and repetitive.  Rooms had no noise insulation,  whoever walked by your door or down the corridor the steps would echo loudly.  The corridors were constantly noisy which made sleep almost impossible.",2,2014,02,01
47,A really good hotel for business travellers,"I've stayed here twice recently and was lucky enough to be upgraded to a suite both times, which was fantastic.  Extremely spacious and comfortable and with great views.  

If I needed to hold a business meeting I would consider hiring a suite here as there is a small business meeting area off the sitting room with a decent size conference table, and the bedroom is separated altogether by a corridor.  There is also a separate loo if you do have visitors, so they don't have to use the main bathroom.

The hotel is perfect if you need to have access to convenient transport links but it isn't so central for the tourist areas, it just depends on what you need.

The hotel staff have (with one exception) been excellent.  The reception staff have been really welcoming and helpful with everything on both visits, and the girl who took my room service orders during the first week was also excellent - friendly, suggested menu options, had really good English etc.  Unfortunately the man I spoke to on room service in the second week wasn't very helpful or friendly, I seemed to be bothering him.  

Aside from that, room service is one of my only complaints about the hotel.  Strangely they have a sushi menu and a pizza menu, both of which are ordered in from outside the hotel, and yet they also have room service from the cafeteria for which they don't provide a menu in the room.  I only want a light meal in the evening - a salad or soup or similar, but they only have one salad on the room service menu, Chicken Caesar, which has fried, breaded chicken drenched in dressing.  I'm sure they could do much better than that.  I was there for two nights each week and it will put me off staying there again because I will need to go out of the hotel to get myself something to eat and take it back there.  It just isn't good enough really.  

Wifi cover was much better than I've experienced in other hotels in Barcelona and it is well located for the metro, suburban train and the shopping centre in the old bullring opposite.  

The only other downside to this hotel is the cavernous breakfast room, which is fine if it's quiet, but if there are lots of people it is incredibly noisy and chaotic, and items aren't restocked quickly enough.  If it isn't too busy, then they have a fairly extensive buffet with all the usual plus someone making omelettes to order.  

Overall it's very good, particularly the service, and if they could improve the room service I would be inclined to rate them excellent, as I could forgive them for the breakfast area.",4,2014,02,01
47,Great lokation,"I stayed in this hotel three days. Purpose of my visit was to see the match  barcelona- real madrid. The hotel is in a wonderful position. Subway, taxi and bus station are opposite the hotel. Staff is committed to service and quality. The rooms have all the necessary equipment. had many opportunities near the hotel where you can spend time in the best way possible. The only problem you have to notes is very poor breakfast. Recommended for all types of travel.",4,2014,01,27
47,Fantastic Views- Great Hospitality - Central Location,"Well - Thanks for Hotel Catalonia Barcelona Plaza - Our first marriage anniversay was quite nicely celebrated in Spain....Barcelona.....

Views --> The Roundabout (front facing of hotel) is of the most favroite landmarks in the citys with view of Mont. Monjuic, (one of the top favorite and must see tourtist attractions of Barcelona). The spot is just 5min and you can walk up from Hotel in morning or evening and has entire city views with great fountains...

Location  --> Is Adjacent (actually Top) on Metro Station - Espanya, which means - you stay are junction of 3 Metros (I guess- L2, L3...pls check maps)..but amazing connectivity of Bus/Coach... Taxi avaliable 24*7 in reasonable rate in front of hotel (no need to cross road etc). I guess approx. 15-20 from airport..... and also 5min from Sants - Central Railway station in Barcelona. Arena -Shopping Mall is next building and you practially almost get everything there from fashion shopping to variety of restaurants....

Hotel is having Premiers and Delux rooms....we stayed in delux one...Good spacious with all facilities - TV, Clean, Hot n cold water and above all good room service.... Breakfast is very nice and welcoming staff....... Breakfast hall is quite big and dome shaped...gives a nice feeling....

Also a Gym, Spa and roof top swimming pool.....you will love that - especially during Summers  :) .....2 Restaurants are avaliable within the hotel but other wise plenty of restaurants are avliable in next building i.e. Mall....

All in all - a value for money-  great location - nice views - welcoming staff ! what else a Tourist need :)

47,Excellent location,"We stayed here recently for 3 nights. Great location for getting around Barcelona. Bus and Metro were very close. Great view of Museum and Bullring from our room and the veiws from the pool were also worth seeing. The staff were very helpful and spoke enough English that we could communicate easily. Breakfast was a good start to our busy days. Rooms were a good size and clean. We were a little worried at first about the noise of the large Plaza, but were not troubled at all.",4,2013,12,29
47,Perfect hotel for a Barcelona City break.,The hotel is in an excellent central location and right outside is the airport shuttle bus stop so it couldn't be easier to get too. The staff were very helpful and the hotel and rooms are very comfortable and always clean. We didn't eat in the restaurant so can't comment on that. To top it off it has a rooftop swimming pool with a small bar which although it gets busy is great when you fancy taking advantage of the sunshine. Considering the price would reccomend.,4,2013,12,26
47,Review from a local,"I was born and raised in Barcelona but I moved to 50 Kms north three years ago. I came on Dec 24th to have our Xmas eve dinner with my parents and we had to stay on the 25th as well to meet the rest of the family... So we (my partner and me) decided to stay in the city that night (our dinners end veeeery late -or early in the morning-). I chose Catalonia Plaza because it is near my parent's apartment (walking distance). The plan was to spend one night and that's it. Amazingly, the stay became another plus to our fantastic family dinner. Staff at the reception was one of the best in class I've ever met (and I do travel a lot abroad). Room (suite) was exceptional. Clean, comfortable (and huge) with impressive views to Plaza Espanya (Fountain, Palacio Real, Congress) and other Barcelona ""icons"" like Torre Agbar, Torres Mapfre/Hotel Arts, Funicular, Olimpic Stadium, etc... Also, just besides the hotel, there is the Arenas shopping center with lots of places to get some tapas which is great if you travel for business and you don't want to stay at the hotel for a light dinner and you don't feel like going out too far. It is true that is a bit far away from the touristic ""heart"" (a nice 40 minutes walk through La Gran Via), but you have all the options there regarding public transportation (metro + bus) that takes you to downtown in no time. Personally, I prefer being reasonably far from the crowds when I want to rest. This was my first stay in a Barcelona hotel in 50 years and I think I will do it again when I don't feel like driving back home. Of course, Catalonia Plaza will be my first choice. Molt bona feina i Bon Nadal!",5,2013,12,25

the hotel was very very clean and maid service every day staff where very friendly and even get a complenty drink vouchers the only down fall was i booked a double room and endup with two single beds together 
you have to get down early for breakfast other wise the eggs & bacon are cold
(thu they do make up omlettes as you wait)
and there was no tea or coffee in your rooms we didnt use the fridge as they charge your credit card
would i stay again yes",4,2013,12,13
47,"Its OK, nothing special. ","Good location because really close metro station - is an advantage. 
Rooms are clean. Breakfast is ok.  

We booked over hotels.com and we didn't get what we booked. :(

We were surprised to find out that our name wasn't on the booking list @ Reception because 'system was down'. 
It was sad and funny talking with receptionists about the problem. 
We waited until 18:00 after some room was given to us. 

Cons:
Bad sound isolation - you will hear everything from corridor. 
In my room water pressure was low. 
Also i missed refrigerator in my room. 

Bottle of water there would be really nice. 

Have fun.",3,2013,12,12
47,Great hotel,"Perfect location with great facilities.

Short walking distance to museum and also the neighbouring building is las arenas.

The room size really amazed me, much bigger than I ever expected.

Hotel staff really helpful.",5,2013,12,09
47,Nice hotel,"The pros of this hotel are:
clean, large rooms, helpful staff, very good breakfast (if it is not included, it is only 10 euros per person), excellent cappuccinos for breakfast. The magic fountain area, as well as Plaza espana, are right there next door, although I would not consider them a main attraction.

The cons:
Everyone keeps saying that the location is great, but to me, great location means ""walking distance,"" and this hotel is about 30-40 min walk from la rambla, bari gotic, etc...  There are buses and trains all around hotel, and that is what we utilized.
The restaurants in the area of the hotel are not very good.
Overall a nice place.",4,2013,12,05

Right next to the magic fountains, hop on & off bus stop, next to the airport shuttle stop & a very short taxi ride from the hotel & Shopping center is across the road. Staff were lovely & very helpful. I paid for a city view & when we arrived the lovely guy on reception gave us a free room upgrade. The breakfast was yummy & kept us full through the day. Definitely include this in your package if you can. Well worth it.

Will most definitely stay at this hotel again. 

My one & only negative comment...they are terrible at replying to emails!!! ",5,2013,11,21
47,"Nice hotel, but. ..","We didn't pick this hotel, the room was provided by an travel agency as part of a cruise package.The room is (we are still here at the hotel) clean, stylish and quite functional. I wish that there are charging outlet by the bed in stead of by the TV. The AC is basically a heater, no matter how low I turn the dail, it still blows hot air. Location, however, is perfect. Airport shuttle and Metro which stop right in front outside main door. Across the street, there is a mall with a well stocked supermarket and high end restaurants and cheaper alternatives. 
But it is strange that Marta (the lady at the reception) never offered the key to the room safe till I asked. It is even stranger still when I discovered that the couple who also purchased the same package, got a room on the 4th floor, while ours is on the second. The only reason I can come up with is that we are Asians, since this couple arrived a few minutes ahead of us. This makes me feel very uncomfortable because I feel that we're being treated differently, even at this international metropolis and at this time and age.",3,2013,11,20

Bus stop at the  door. Tourist info across the plaza. Former bullfighting ring across the street with great shops and restaurants. Easy stroll through pleasant area to La Rambla area and museums. Nice little family restaurants nearby. Within walking distance to the Olympic stadium and environs. Bus to airport at the door. Would stay again.",5,2013,11,11

47,Good hotel for a business trip,"This is a very conveniently located hotel - right in front of is the Airbus shuttle, and metro station. 
The Catalan museum is nearby, and the magic fountains of the Olympic park. There is a large shopping mall right across. 

The room was comfortable, and kept very clean throughout the stay. The Internet access is impeccable working well both in the rooms as well as the loby. The reception is very helpful. 
The breakfast is a huge spread - and everything I tasted was quite tasty. 
The hotel bar area is good, however, the hotel restaurant may need a bit of energizing - I had a good service, the appetizer was very good, but the main was on the salty side. 

I have not tried the gym, the spa or the pool, but good to know these options are available. 
Overall, this was a very pleasant stay.",4,2013,11,10
47,"Great location, great hotel","Stayed in this hotel for 5 weeks while visiting Barcelona for a movie shoot. As we were long stay guests, hotel took excellent care of us. Breakfast spread was huge though very repetitive. Needs to change more often. Rooms kept extremely clean everyday though the quality of the toiletry leaves us to expect better quality. Also one place where they can improve is the language skill of the employees. Being in a extremely busy central location, this a always a busy hotel getting guests from all over the world but they struggle at English which makes communication a bit challenging but their friendliness and willingness to help makes up for it. Will definitely stay here again.",4,2013,11,06
47,"Handy location, great value!","This hotel is in a great location, particularly for the first time visitor to Barcelona with lost of sights and amenities in the immediate vicinity including access to the Metro, Montjuic, the magic fountains and Olympic Park. There is a large shopping mall opposite the hotel, in the former Bull Ring from which you can get great views from by getting the elevator all the way to its roof, there are great bars and restaurants in the open on the roof with good views. There is also a great food market (prepared foods, not groceries) in the surrounding streets at night along with mojito stall and a street party atmosphere which we stumbled upon one evening - great fun! You can walk to La Ramblas in around 40 minutes at a very leisurely pace. The rooms are clean, modern, well put together with all the amenities you expect and a spacious bathroom. Breakfast is good with both hot and cold choices however the breakfast room is huge with a high ceiling which creates a bit of an echo giving a kind of cafeteria/food hall feel but this isn't a major issue. The cost of our stay was quite modest which coupled with the location, room quality, breakfast and service added up to a great value stay - will keep in mind when visiting Barcelona!",5,2013,11,06
47,Minor things is most important things,"I stayed at the hotel while I attend the Microsoft Dynamics Convergence 2013 conference. As a professional in Microsoft technique I need to work from my hotel room - but the Internet couldn't even stream a simple radio station, so working trough a Remote Desktop Connection was almost impossible.

The hotel didn't offer me a comforter, instead is a brown fleece blanket is in my bed covered by white linen. On every morning I woke up seeing this brown blanket because the linen isn't fasten around the blanket. In my mind, cleaning and purity in bedrooms is my top priority both my own bedroom and another's :)",3,2013,11,06
47,Brilliant view. Convenient place to stay.,"Everything about this hotel is good. Our room was fab. Good bed and pillows. Super shower and the layout of the bathroom with separate shower, and toilet with the wash bowl on its own is a great idea. Especially as I stayed with my daughter. It made it convenient to clean teeth etc while she showered. The only small criticism I have is the rather chaotic state of the breakfast room at rush times. This was improved when we went down for breakfast a bit earlier. Still they should be ahead of the game at all times.",4,2013,11,06
47,Reloj room is awesome,"Was staying in Reloj room for 3 nights.
Location of hotel in centre is very useful. You can reach everything by foot. Underground car parking is comfy and safe.
Room has 2 levels and great view to Spain Plaza.
Everything was clean and in good condition.
Door handle sometimes stays in your hand, but it's not a big problem.
One thing - room does not have any number and named ""S.R."" si everyone was knocking and sure that it was smoking room. 
I recommend you this hotel for Barcelona stays.",5,2013,11,01
47,Ideal Location for First Timer!,"Amazingly quiet on the busy Plaza Espana, the hotel was perfectly situated near a Metro stop, mall, restaurants and access to other transportation. The views of the Plaza Espana at night were amazing! There is an ATM machine INSIDE the lobby, which seemed safer than on a street corner. The staff was friendly and accommodating. Rooms were adequate; nothing special. The lobby furniture could use a makeover; a bit worn. Access to internet in the lobby. Buffet breakfast had great variety - the coffee machines (3) provided one cup at a time and there was always a line to get coffee (or hot water for tea) as they weren't all operating properly at the same time. A bit frustrating as there was no other option. If location is a priority, then this hotel is ideal. If you are looking for luxury or dining perks, not-so-much.",4,2013,10,31
47,"Great Location, Great Stay","This hotel was a perfect location for a first trip to Spain.  It is right next to a mall with tons of food places and right on the subway line.  All of the staff I encountered at the front desk were both fluent in English and Spanish which was very helpful.  The single beds were pushed up next to each other which was a bit strange but I have been told that is a European thing!  You also needed a key card for your room to operate your electricity box (again, a European thing I didn't know about).  But the front desk was happy to help.  The room was decent, but it could have been a bit improved in comfort, lighting, and modernized which is why I gave it 4 of 5 stars.  Still a nice hotel the furniture in the room seemed a bit outdated, and the interior of the room didn't have much lighting.",4,2013,10,28
47,Probably not again,"The hotel was fine.  Breakfast was actually pretty good with an omelette station.   The rooms were a decent size.   The downside was the lack if decent restaurants in the neighborhood.   We ended up eating pizza at lunch and dinner.   One night we were desperate for something different and caved for a hamburger and French fries.  We kept asking for restaurant recommendations and were told to take a cab to a different neighborhood!!!  There was a fun wine store that we found nearby where we were able to select wines from barrels.   That was the highlight of the neighborhood.   When we return to Barcelona, we will stay at the Melia on Av. Sarria. ",3,2013,10,28
47,Wonderful stay,"First of all it was the perfect location metro station infront of the hotel, airport bus too and taxi spot. Plaza arenas is next to it, parks and walking distance to plaza cataluyna and ramblas. Despite the busy location the rooms where very quite great sound proofing spacious clean. Breakfast was delicious and lots of variety. I had taken my reservation with breakfast include but because of work and jet lagged I could only go once to the breakfast so I ask them to change my reservation to paid breakfast as I go and no hassle from the hotel or booking extremely please and happy with the service at the hotel. Thank Linda for your wonderful attention thank you all the staff Great value for my money and in fact I would never stay anywhere else in barcelona that is not at plaza Catalonia is a guarantee. 
Thank you",5,2013,10,28
47,Centrally Located Good Hotel,"The hotel is expensive due to its location and quality. The rooms are decently sized, the reception is well manned. Rooms are clean.

It is located in a very good area, opposite to Arena. 

Airport bus service stop is in front of the hotel, takes 20 mts to reach, and costs less than 6Euro.

WIFI is available in the entire area and very powerful.

Hotel has a small gym and a pool.

The bathroom needs some work, tiles are broken, cracks are seen.

I wish they provide tea/coffee maker in the rooms. This was lacking and should been there considering the money they charge.

The breakfast was good, however, the coffee machine seems to produce Luke warm coffee.

We stayed in 555 and 558.",4,2013,10,22
47,Superb Location,"The hotel staff were very friendly, room was good size. Breakfast buffet was extensive with a great deal of variety. We stayed 2 nights here.
We had to use the Laundry service as we were about to go cruising and had just finished a week long bus tour around Spain. Laundry Service was very expensive at this hotel.
Lobby restrooms were very poorly serviced.
Next door is a Bullring that has been converted into a department store with heaps of levels & great views from the top.",5,2013,10,14
47,Hotel with a great location!,"The location of this hotel is just superb. It is right in the centre of the city with a metro station practically located inside the hotel! (I was joking - the metro station is immediately outside the entrance to the hotel). I had visited during the famous Merce festival and the hotel was generous enough to open up the terrace on the 7th floor and so i could get a grand view of the enthralling fireworks show accompanied by music and laser show. 
However the room as such was quite ordinary and did not have even a refrigerator or heating kettle - which is quite basic these days.",4,2013,10,13
47,Horrible experience!!,"Stayed at this hotel and find the staff are incompetent giving strangers key to my colleagues room, hot water was limited, and the water is brown, rooms are very small (ours looked into a vent shaft), and the bed is too short even for 175 cm man.",1,2013,10,12
47,visit to Barcelona,"excellent experience , superb service from staff, professional. beautiful, comfortable rooms. central situation, easy access to metro/ trains/ buses/ Red bus tour. food brilliant, spa and swimming pool really great especially in summer. lucky to see Catalunya celebrations with fireworks from rooftop on 24th Sep, simply spectacular.",5,2013,10,10
47,Very good and central,"This was excellent for our needs. A four star hotel with excellent breakfast, a good fitness centre and very courteous staff. The fitness centre needs an attendant however. Notwithstanding noise could be a problem especially in the early morning hours
",4,2013,10,08
47,Beautiful hotel; Great scenery,"Wonderful for business.  Located near great attractions - shopping mall that used to be bull fighting rink; national art museum and magic fountain among others.  Very professional staff and beautiful. Large, modern and clean rooms. We asked for a view of the traffic circle and museums which was beautiful but problem was the noise - could hear the traffic all night long.  Ask for a room in the back if you are a light sleeper.",5,2013,10,06
47,"Petfect location - ok hotel, but rooms too used.","The hotel is perftect located on Plaza Espana - nice vieuw from our suite. The suite a bit used and a double bed not according to international standards - too hard as lying on the floor. Two smaller foam madresses provided - ok!
We had reserved a suite on the phone with reception days before, but nobody knew about this on arrival. After a travel from home it was not perfect to spend almost an hour in the reception area! The reservation was found the next day - a bit too late.
Morning buffet perfect.
Dinner restaurant provided us with a perfect dinner of three courses - very nice. Next day they were not so hospitable when we arrived too close to closing time. We thought that 2100 hrs was ok in Spain???
So we had dinner at another restaurant.",3,2013,10,06
47,"Great location, spacious room","We traveled as a family of 3, and ordered a triple room. It was the biggest room we encountered during the whole trip. We initially planned to stay 1 night but we liked the hotel so much we managed to get last-minute extension with the same fare.
Don't take the breakfast option, just go across the street to find a mall where there's a nice artisan bakery down at the basement level.
There's taxi rank in front of the hotel and the evening tapas at the rooftop pool is very nice.",5,2013,10,05
47,Very Pleasant,"Hotel is a large multi level building on a major roundabout that overlooks 'the magic fountain' and the National d'Art de Catalunya.  Reception staff were very professional, friendly and attentive to needs.  Our twin room directly overlooked the 'magic fountain' area - spectacular viewing of a night. The room was very spacious, huge bathroom and very clean (serviced daily). It's right next to the Espanya Metro line which is very handy and easy to use. Good central location in a fabulous city. Be prepared for a cold dip in the rooftop pool.  Overall, good value - we stayed an additional two nights. ",4,2013,10,04
47,"Good location, just okay otherwise","We stayed here as part of a tour group for three nights. The hotel is RIGHT on the Plaza de España and there are excellent views from the rooftop; we were lucky enough to be there when the nearby dancing fountains were active, and it was a spectacular sight! Also very close to the converted bullring/ mall which had interesting shops, grocery stores, a movie theater, and a display documenting the building's transition. The Metro stop is right in front of the hotel and buses run through the plaza. 
Breakfast choices were excellent (omelets, fruit, crepes, meats, cheeses, pastry, yogurt, etc) but the staff was overwhelmed one morning when there were several groups arriving at once. It was like a tornado hit-- there were not enough seats, the coffee lines were 15 deep, and the food could not be replenished quickly enough to keep up with the crowd. To their credit, the next morning was much better but it was also less busy. 
Our room was pretty basic but fine. The bed felt firm and not very plush. Lots of wood everywhere, floors, hallway, cabinets-- kind is a sea of teak-Ish color. We were waaaayyy down a hall, and our room faced the inner courtyard, overlooking the ""circus tent"" top of the breakfast room. It was pretty quiet, but we felt disconnected to the great neighborhood. The fitness center on the 7th floor was fairly well equipped, with treadmills, elliptical a, bikes, and some weight set- ups.",3,2013,10,03
47,Blocked the door with a chair,"I usually stay in 3 star hotels since I am not fancy nor fussy. We stayed at Catalonia Barcelona because it was booked for my husband by the company he was assisting in a Congress.

However I do know that this isn't a 4 star hotel because I have stayed in many 3 star ones that were better than this. Reception is a confusion, there was almost always a line to speak to one of the staff. There are more than 150 rooms in this hotel and there were usually only 2 people at the front desk. There was always a weird guy in uniform standing near the doors just looking around and eyeing guests in a funny way. Maybe they should replace Weird Guy with another Front Desk Worker.

The room was clean and didn't have any strange smell, but some furniture was pretty shabby. The bathroom door was stuffed and coming apart near the bathtub but apart from that the bathroom was good.

However on our very first night we were getting ready for bed, already in our pyjamas, when someone opened the door. I thought ok, weird, but maybe something is going on and the staff came to warn us of something... No. It was another guest. Coming in with a keycard and a friend and their luggage. And with an envelope with the number of our room written on it! We stood there looking at each other, and she apologized, and I said but they sent you to THIS room, are you sure? (Dumb question, I know, since she opened the door!), and that was when she showed me the envelope. After a moment of awkwardness they went away and we closed the door. We tried to call reception but no one EVER answered the phone on that reception! Well almost never but I'd say 90% of the time it gave us an occupied line signal. My husband then placed a chair with a heavy bag to block the door just in case.

Is that how you are supposed to sleep in a 4 star hotel? I don't think so.

The next day I complained and the guy at the front desk mumbled an apology and that was it.

Also the hotel was very noisy. I slept late one morning because of a migraine and there was a lot of slamming doors around my room. The walls shook. And we could hear every voice in the corridors at night.

Pros:
-right next door to a shopping mall
-close to Museum of National Art of Catalunya, which I really liked
-on beautiful Plaza Espanya but we had a back room with no good view
-there's a metro station right in front of the hotel

Other considerations:
-Breakfast was good but expensive at 16 euros.
-Staff helped me ordering from a restaurant. I asked them, they called the restaurant and paid, and I paid later at checkout.
-There are some menus in the room but everything comes from outside the hotel. 
-Bring your own iron.
-The blowdrier in the bathroom is as weak as every other hotel blowdrier.
-No electrical outlets near the bed. There's one in the bathroom, and one on the wall over the marble (?) table/countertop and that's it. We disconnected the TV to get a third one and charge all the gadgets overnight.

Frankly I would recommend staying somewhere else with a better value.",3,2013,10,02
47,4 star? - dont think so,"don't stay here unless you get it for a room price of 80 euros or less.  It's dreadful.  The staff are stretched at the front desk so don't answer the phone and there can be long queues to speak to a member of staff.  It's cheaply kitted out in the rooms where there is no quality at all, the bed is like sleeping on a nail bed and the pillows aren't really pillows more like draft excluders.  They don't have irons in the rooms and won't give you one, nor is there access to an ironing room but they will iron it for you for 14 euro's per item! scandalous and another money making scheme.  The closed the pool when I was there so that they could have a function in there - I don't object to an earlier than usual closure but 4.45pm is too early for paying guests to not me able to use the pool after a day's sightseeing or working but this hotel does not care about the paying guest, it cares about the money.The food in the bar is dreadful and you can get much better at one of the local restaurants - however the staff in the restaurant are the saving grace of this hotel as they were great.",1,2013,09,24
47,Great hotel in nice location,"The hotel is located in plaza Espanya. The area is very nice. A metro station is literally right outside the door which is four stops away from plaza Catalunya. There is also a stop for a shuttle bus to and from the airport right outside as well as one for the bus touristic.There is also a nice mall next door. The view from the hotel is very nice. I was treated to nice fireworks displays at night and the magic fountain displays. The furniture in the room is modern and of good quality. The bathroom was also very nice. It is worth mentioning that I was upgraded to a superior room at no extra charge. However, the room did not come with a kettle and daily water bottles or even a box of tissues as with the regular rooms. The spa is pretty good with a nice sauna and shower. However, the locker room was pretty small and basic. They also offer treatments and massages, etc.. but I didn't try those.  There were also no locker rooms for using the pool; you had to change in your own room. The pool itself was pretty normal, maybe a bit small. The view from the roof where the pool is located compensated for this, however.The hotel claims to have a gym, but this is very misleading. The gym is simply a tiny area with a treadmill, a step machine and an exercise bike. The breakfast buffet was very nice with lots of options and the food was fresh and well prepared. I did not interact much with the staff at the front desk, but when I did they were helpful and friendly. They made a couple of restaurant recommendations which turned out ok. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel especially for its comfortable rooms, view, location and breakfast buffet.",4,2013,09,23
47,German at the reception,"Ad's
This is a great hotel especially Thursday,fridays when you can see the fountain display , the hotel cafe is a bit pricey but there are plenty local amenities around.

Spacious rooms

German at the reception sent us to the carpark at midnight then locked us in. We had to be for the sowna ...sorry Sauna",3,2013,09,22
47,WORST hotel ever- definitely NOT 4 stars!,"Catalonia Barcelona Plaza Hotel looks great in pictures but is the worst hotel I have ever experienced. The staff is too busy to help or answer the phone and there are few amenities. The furnishings are the cheapest possible - the desk chair is broken, the bed appears to be a hard foam mattress, the pillows and linens are polyester and the towels are scratchy. Every chance to save money is taken. The safe requires a 40 euro deposit, they do not have irons, no concierge, difficult wireless and a nasty room service menu. They will not connect you via phone to hotel guests. One decency: It is clean. The great location is not worth the pain!",1,2013,09,20
47,nice hotel friendly staff,"Nice hotel, friendly staff, room was very clean. View was awesome across central barcelona and the olympic park, was even treated to a spectacular firework display while I was staying. Breakfast was nice, bacon and eggs, omlettes cooked to order, pancakes and pastries, plenty of fresh fruit too. Only critisism was Shower had a mind of it's own, would occasionally blast scolding hot then cold.",4,2013,09,19
47,Nice location and perfect for city visit,"Stayed here on a business trip for 4 nights recently with a colleague.

The hotel is situated right on the picturesque Plaza Espana with a nice view out over Montjuic and the surrounding buildings.  The location is right next to the metro station and so the whole of the city is easily accessed from here.

We used the underground par park which I thought was a bit expensive for the week but very convenient.

We ate breakfast at the hotel each morning which was nice.  There are many restaurants and shops in the immediate vicinity including the former bullring shopping centre right next to the hotel.  

The rooms were comfortable with all the usual trimmings.  Had a look at the rooftop pool but was a little disappointed with that but there's a great view from there.

Overall, I would definitely consider staying here again assuming I could get a room for about €100.  Wouldn't pay any more than that as there are better options available slightly higher than that.",4,2013,09,17
47,Better than initially feared,"We were meant to stay in Hotel Vueling BCN, the more modern, centrally located sister hotel of this one but, unfortunately, they had overbooked and could not honour our reservation. Though they paid for our taxi down to the Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, we arrived in poor spirits. Our first impressions were not good. We had wanted to stay in a small, modern hotel; this is old and large. We were offered complementary breakfast as compensation for the issues but then shown a room that was very unappealing by a rather surly chap. We opted for the (unseen) alternative when that was free but left to wonder the city with low expectations.

Perhaps owing to Linda, who was very helpful at the front desk, we returned to find we had been upgraded to the suite behind the clock face. Though I agree with the comments re. the strange smell and old looking rooms, this suite definitely had its own faded charm and the view could not be faulted - out over the square and up to the fountains and gallery; absolutely stunning.

The location also ended up being good for us, as we were lucky enough to catch a Barcelona game and this hotel is on the right side of town to walk up (40 mins or so). 

Overall, our upgrade took us from frustrated travellers to happy guests and the breakfast was also very good. I suspect we got a bit lucky though!",3,2013,09,17
47,Very good hotel,"First the location of the hotel is awesome, it is overlooking Plaça d'Espanya (one of most important squares in Barcelona). From the rooftop, which has a nice pool, you can see an outstanding view for Plaça d'Espanya, The Magic Fountain of Montjuïc which is a must see, and much further in the view is the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya and some beautiful green hills, also it is just beside Les Arenes bullring which is now became a mall, and if you like photography you can spend hours either in the rooftop or in front of hotel.

Metro station is at the hotel door and from there you can get nearly everywhere in Barcelona.

We were a group of 11, and I was handed the key to my room in exactly 5 minutes check-in, only downside in that express check-in nobody helped with baggage. The room was tidy, spotless, and cleaned everyday, needless to say there are towels in room and pool from the spa (I just read some reviews said no) 

Comments for the room: no electricity source near bed, no boiler, no iron or ironing board and internet in room is intermittent for poor signal, they provide you with two logins for free internet one for lobby and other for room, never found the room one and the signal from lobby while in room is poor. 

Staying in a front room worth it specially if in a higher floor , to enjoy all the scenery above. also back rooms has no view at all, so if you have the option for a front room, don't miss it.

Reception is 24 hours (saying so because I stayed at another hotel in Barcelona which receptionist starts to sleep and closes hotel door after midnight!), I had an issue with room's AC which I discovered very late at night after I returned from touring the city, and the receptionist apologized that nobody from maintenance is available as it was midnight, and went to see it himself at midnight. And I didn't face any problem with the AC after wise. In general all reception was helpful and speaks good English, and they attended to all my questions without delay and with a smile.
 
I only tried the main restaurant as I was on BB, breakfast offered multiple options, and they have whole fresh fruits everyday.

All in all it was a good stay.",4,2013,09,09
47,Best Hotel Experience in Spain,"My friend and I have stayed in 4 star hotels all over spain and I had to mention that this was the best one. We witnessed great generosity and friendliness. It is with great pleasure for me to recommend this hotel as all the staff speak english and are very knowledgeable of the entire area. 
I would like to point out my deep appreciation of a receptionist called Linda. She has the answers to everything and we felt how  happy she was to help us. I already thanked her; but if she is reading this: Thanks again! You are the best. ",4,2013,09,08
47,Horrible hotel. Never seen such bad service,"WORST STAFF IN ANY HOTEL IN THE WORLD !

Strongly recommend all tourists to Barcelona to avoid ! 

Our terrible experience started from the first interaction when we reached the hotel. We drove in a rental car and when we reached the hotel, the first thing to expect from any 4 star hotel worldwide is a valet parking help and some offer to help with our bags. In this hotel we received none. No help to find our way to the paid parking even was forthcoming. We lugged our luggage through the most complicated and non user friendly maze of passage ways to reach from the parking to the hotel lobby. We have got help for parking and luggage from other city centre hotels in Europe like Concorde Hotel in Paris. So it is doable as long as there is any wish to help the guests.

We have never seen such surly and rude staff anywhere in the world. No smiles anywhere  to be seen. The room service staff take the cake for heights reached in rudeness, unhelpful behaviour and sheer unfriendliness. Never have we seen such behaviour in the service and hospitality sector. If people are rude, unfriendly and cannot smile at people they are a complete misfit in the service industry. The hotel does not understand this at all. We asked for a dish of pasta in the room, which was dry and did not have enough salt to our taste. So we called room service to ask for salt and olive oil - Imagine being told that we need to pay again for room service ! When I tried to reason with the lady on line, she simple told me not to talk back to her and cut the line ! 

 Many people say great location, but there are many hotels with easy access to the city metro, which has a great network, so don't go by location alone.

",1,2013,09,08
47,Never again!,"The hotel is located in Plaza Espagna, so location is nice and all transport means are close by. The Arena (located next to the hotel) is another asset, as you have good places for dinner or just good quality coffee.
However, if you want to enjoy the beach, or visit Sagrada Familia, Batlo House etc, location becomes a disadvantage - it is quite far from the centre.

This is where the advantages end. 
We booked the room via the hotel's website, where they promise early check in and late check out and champagne at arrival (sounds impressive, right?). We arrived at 9am, and we could not check in, they said 1 o'clock. We understood and came back at 1pm, but room was still not ready, as it did not have the extra bed added. When I complained and I mentioned the early check-in promise, in addition to someone at Reception promising the room will be ready at 1, the 2nd guy at the reception (Guillermo or something similar) became aggressive, saying that the website mentions early check in depends on availability (I rechecked my emails, and there was no mention of that)...that he didn't say room was going to be free at 1pm (as if his colleague was not someone working at Reception). We could hardly make ourselves understood in English and we even tried to communicate in Spanish. He was so aggressive, as if we were not in a 4 star hotel, but somewhere at the market place, and as if i was not rigt to ask why the room is not ready yet. I just gave up and accepted the room, as all clients end up doing eventually. He finished quickly with the introduction, and gave us the keys. I asked about the champagne promise, if this is just another hoax, and only then he gave us the vouchers, saying i did not let him explain check in. I doubt it was good quality champagne, and we eventually returned the unused vouchers anyway, but just goes to show the quality of service in this hotel.
  The rooms are clean, but not exceptional. The cleaners will keep knocking on the door to clean every half hour, until you get out of the room, or put the do not disturb sign. But after they clean, you realize they did not leave soap or shower gel. I had to buy a soap so that I don't  have to ask for one.
At the reception, i once asked what bus takes us to the beach. One lady at Reception said any bus takes you to city Centre. Folks, remember only D20 takes you close to Barceloneta. Don't ask reception, just use the internet.

Service is bad, I never felt as insulted and provoked as a client, I could not believe this is a 4 star hotel.
Location - depends on what you want, can be an advantage or disadvantage.
Rooms are small, but clean. however, you might end up buying your own stuff, especially if you dont know how to ask in Spanish.

Conclusion, would not go there again, to get insulted on big paycheck.",2,2013,09,08
47,Horrible Horrible Horrible Horrible,"I can't warn all of you visitors to Barcelona enough to stay away from this hotel. While the location is central, the service is Horrible, the smell in the rooms is Horrible, the beds are boards, the plumbing does not work properly, housekeeping looks like a 5 year old folded the blankets, no such thing as extra towels or washcloths. My room, which was promised when I booked to be a higher floor faces a graffiti laden ghetto alley on the second floor. Too bad they said when I checked in. STAY SOMEWHERE else!! I would like to give it zero stars but that is not an option.",1,2013,09,07
47,Would stay there again!,"We enjoyed this hotel very much, and the location is great. We were a party of eight people, and we had reserved suites. They were very spacious, had a great view, wonderful sleeping quality, good A/C, great cleaning, spacious and very good bathroom with a round tub with a view. The staff was mostly very friendly and helpful. Good restaurant, fine sports bar and piano bar. Breakfast was good, but the hotel is very busy, and at times there was the absolute anarchy in there. The staff did the best they could filling trays and cleaning, but a couple of times it was a very stressful experience. Consider going to breakfast either very early or after 10 am - it was better then. From our rooms we could see the Magic Fountain, which was a nice treat when it was all lit up at weekends. Location is great for shopping, metro, buses and walking around. The hotel could have had more sunbeds, though. Only 11 beds, but room for more. It would also help if they did not allow people to reserve sunbeds by putting their towels there in the morning, and then not show up for sunbathing before 11-12. This hotel is to be recommended.",4,2013,08,31
47,Amazing views and location,"Well when we booked this hotel, we were afraid from the location, rooms, services but when we got there ,we got surprised by the service they gave to us , the connected rooms and the amazing views of the rooms and so on and bottle of water when arrival and leaving and chocolate as well.
Well I would recommend everyone who is going for Barcelona to choose this hotel because it's located in a good area and easy to go to airport,city center by metro which it was In front  of the hotel.",5,2013,08,27
47,"Great location, comfortable and clean","I stayed in this hotel in early August with my husband and two young children. I can't fault the location at all - we were slightly nervous that it was a bit too far out but actually it was perfect. The airport bus stops right outside and the red and green metro lines run from stops in the Ramblas and Placa Catalunya through Placa Espana so it's really easy to get around. 

We checked in fairly late in the evening and unfortunately our first experience of the hotel was an incredibly rude receptionist who looked us up and down and demanded a passport! Once we'd got past her we were actually really pleased with both the room and the amenities on offer. We didn't sample breakfast, but we did use the pool which my husband and kids enjoyed. The rooms were cleaned very well each day - although some of the fixtures in the bathroom were a bit 'tired' the bathroom did the job and there was plenty of room to sort the kids out (the first time my boys had seen a bidet which prompted a few questions when we first arrived!!)

I'd stay in this hotel again. I don't think it was the best in terms of value for money but it more than made up for that in terms of its prime location. Staying here gave us a great opportunity to explore parts of the city that we'd not visited before and all in all contributed to a very enjoyable week's holiday.",4,2013,08,22
47,Not too much to complain about-overall okay,"We stayed here as not much choice as last minute booking and a little far out for us really-as always stayed up nearer to the Ramblas.. The rooms were good-but better with the lovely views of the Plaza Espana etc. We found the hotel clean and tidy- beautiful flowers in the lobby added a pleasing touch- the bar areas were also good.Somewhere to sit in the evening and relax-we like the Piano Bar. Also the Breakfast we thought had good choice and freshly made pancakes and omelettes. We did not pre-pay for breakfast as was cheaper to pay via the hotel  and we did not breakfast here every day so no booking required. The pool was great but the bar was not always open unfortunately so we did take our own bottles to the pool. The pool was also too deep we thought as should have had a shallower end especially for children and people who were not confident in the  water. There were also not enough sunbeds-really no explanation for this? What could the reason be- I mean there was plenty of room to house lots more sunbeds, and I noticed on a photo on Trip Advisor there were loads of sunbeds. Where have they all gone?????Not what I would expect of a four star hotel. We were overall happy with the Hotel though for the time we spent here. The beds were comfy for me anyway...some of the others said they were a bit hard. There is a mini bar fridge so we were able to house our own drinks as well. The safe is free which is also good. The area seemed safe and quite busy but a good shopping mall next door with cafes etc, this used to be a bullring-which is a bit bizarre and  the shops were not open all the time!But there are lots of restaurants on the roof with amazing views.",4,2013,08,21
47,perfecto!!,"My son lives in barcelona so chose this hotel as close to him and i knew the area well.It was better than expected...our room 644 had the best views....so good to watch the fountains display at night.
The bus goes from airport staight to arenas....and on way back too. metro outside too. lovely walking up to olympic stadium and all around...easy to walk and pleasant down to cataluyna plaza and to ramblas.
we took the train to beach before stiges all on one metro cards for 10eros 10 journeys in zone 1. 
Love plaza arenas for earing and shopping and resturants at top are good...love having my glass o cava on the ground floor for a mere 2.30 euros bargain.
easy to get anywhere in barca form this hotel. loved it.....",5,2013,08,21
47,"Clean, tidy, beautiful and modern!","I can not really fault this hotel, reception staff are ever so helpful any questions they are willing to help. All staff are smiley even late at night. Amazing views from the rooftop pool area. Hotel is next to the arenas shopping centre and not far from the airport cost us under 20 euros by taxi, alternatively you have got the aerobus which stops just outside. Also outside the hotel is a taxi rank very useful! I definitely recommend walking down to the magic fountain at night very good to see! La rambla costs about 7 euros by taxi to get too. Rooms are lush spacious, clean and modern couldn't fault these at all. Bar area always clean and tidy pretty reasonable too. We didn't eat dinner at the hotel we found bars and restaurants near by. Breakfast is okay, a huge selection from fry ups to fruit. All in all if I was going to go back to barca I would stay in this hotel. ",4,2013,08,19
47,Great hotel,"Lovely room with amazing view. Lovely bathrooms with large bath, haudryer and everything you need, dressing gowns, slippers, etc... Friendly staff
Great choice of breakfast 
Just nice all around
Cant find anything bad to say",5,2013,08,14
47,Clean rooms and great view!!!,"The view from the room's window is just amazing... The staff was good enough, the rooms very clean and confortable. This hotel is next to a metro station and a bus station. If you walk 5-10' you arrive to the square with the fountains which is great especially at night. The breakfast includes almost everything and lots of local species of food. There are security guard walking in the corridors which means that you can not hear noises from other people. If you can select a room between 3rd and top floor in order to have a nice view from your room!!",4,2013,08,08
47,Excellent hotel.,"The hotel is in a great location on Placa Espana, and the bus from T2 at the airport drops you at the door in less than half an hour ( taxi for less than €20 is even quicker) Metro is also right by the hotel, and the Barcelona tour bus stops across the square. good bus links ( it was too hot for the Metro) will take you where you want to go. D20 goes to the beach, and 150 will take you to Castell Montjuic. We had booked a room with a view of the square, and it was stunning.The staff were friendly and efficient, and the hotel itself was spotless. The air conditioning worked very well, and was very necessary in the searing heat!
The minibar was well stocked, and the complimentary bottle of water was a nice touch. Soap, shampoo, shower cap, comb, tissues, and shoe shine were provided. The breakfast had a good selection of cereals, breads,pastries, cold meats, cheeses, and fruits. Fried eggs, bacon, mushrooms, and sausages were also available, but on the two occasions we tried them, they were cold, so we stuck to the cold stuff! You can also have pancakes or omelette cooked to order. 
The pool on the rooftop was very welcome, and though there are only about a dozen beds and some chairs and tables, it was never too crowded. Towels are available from the spa.
I will certainly stay here on my next trip.",5,2013,07,28
47,NOT a business hotel !!!,"I chose this hotel because of its proximity to Espanya metro, from where I could easily get out of town to my client's offices at WTC Almenda, and into town for nightlife etc.

Unfortunately there is not much to recommend it other than its location...

(1) Arrived in the early evening to chaotic scenes at reception.  Getting checked in was like trying to catch the barmaid's eye in a busy pub.  I know this is Spain, but even so !  When I did elbow my way to the desk, the receptionist was surly

(2) Got upstairs, room was absolutely fine, had a shower and unpacked.  Thought it would be nice to pop out for a couple of hours on my first evening in town, so I decided to iron a shirt...OOOPS, big problem, there are no irons to be had in the entire hotel.  Instead, you are expected to use the housekeeping service... which takes an hour... and charges 6 Euros per shirt !!!  So instead of a nice, relaxing drink, I ended up slogging down to Carrefour and buying my own iron...

(3) When I got back, needed to do a couple of quick emails for the following day.  Got connected to the in-room wifi easily enough, but no way to log on and get internet access.  So down to reception I went again where the receptionist said ""Oh yes, it doesn't work with Windows 8, you'll have to use the wifi in the lobby""... I am fairly technical and knew this was BS, so I asked her for the URL of the hotel's login page and she looked at me like I asked for her phone number !! So I logged on in the lobby, made a note of the login page address, went back upstairs and used it to logon from my room.  Bandwidth was patchy but OK

(4) In the morning, I went down for breakfast.  They do this in a great echoing hall like a school gymnasium, indeed it was full of overexcited Brazilian teens.  Badly laid out and extremely noisy, the room was the last place you would want to start your day; and the food was unexceptional.

Overall, an OK place to stay if you have all the time in the world and are in the holiday mood.  NOT a place to find peace and calm and get any work done !",3,2013,07,28
47,Great location - iffy four star,"Good points - the location is fantastic: first stop on the Aerobus from the airport; right on a Metro station; shopping mall next door; huge range of cafes/bars/restaurants nearby.
But is it four star? We stayed for a week as we were supporting someone in the world swimming championships and the olympic complex was just a walk (up a long hill!) away, so suited us fine.
Room was excellent and glad we paid a little more for a room over Montjuic - anyone staying with a room overlooking the internal walls would have been pretty unhappy after two nights!
Breakfast was ok - buffet style - but it could have been in a company cafeteria - functional not atmospheric!
Reception desk was always under pressure - but some managed with a smile, some didn't. Concierges were less than useless.
Swimming pool on roof was not the best - far too loud music, not much space, but in Barcelona heat, the cool down in the water was welcome.
Overall, not bad, but not outstanding.",4,2013,07,27
47,Another great room with a view!,"Taxi from the airport to the hotel in no time at all. 
On entering the hotel, I could see this was a busy hotel. However, the service at the reception was great. They gave us information on what was around the area with no prompting. 
Our room was at the front of the hotel and facing the fountain. 
As we were there in February, they had a fountain show when it got dark. There was also a massive celebration which was well organised and officially closed the road. It was great watching this with a glass of red!
The sightseeing bus runs from across the roundabout. The standard stuff. 
I would stay in this hotel again. 

The food in the restaurant was amazing, but not cheap.
There is also a basic restaurant there and the breakfast area has a big seating area with plenty of choice. Well organised.",4,2013,07,26
47,Three our of Four nights were great,"This was our first trip to Barcelona and the aiportbus dropped us right in front of the hotel which was great. After a later check in and a very flustered Mata gave us our room key and informed us that the hotel was fully booked( seems to be the the hotel of choice for the departure point for cruise ships). We walked towards our room with no assistance with luggage and getting closer to our room the place wreaked of cigarettes and the rooms across all had there doors open and were really noisy. I walked into the room and it too stunk of cigarettes, being an ex-smoker it made it all the more offensive. The room safe had a whole in it and I went back downstairs to enquire what was wrong with it. Mata informed us that we needed to leave a 30 euro deposit for a lock ad key and it wasn't broken. I just didn't understad why that wasn'textended when we checked in???. I also asked if there was any chance to change rooms as the view was of a derelict construction sight, noisy neighbours (well into the early morning hours) and stale nictine stench. Mata advised in a rather annyoed manner that we would have to see tomorrow morning but there were no guarentees. This was really a terrible start to our stay. The next morning my partner had come to terms with the smell but I hadn't. After reakfast we went back to the room and itreally was unbearable. I even started to feel like having a cigarette. I went down and obviously there was a different shift on duty at the front desk andwe were greeted very warmly by ""Linda"". She was truly and angel, she advised we could upgrade our rooms to either non smoking, non-smoking with a view and the newest rooms on level 7 which were magnificent (some with views) for an extra upto 35 euros. When chose the non-smoking room with a view; after all it was our first visit to Barcelona. Linda went out of her way to show us all our room options, even showing us, up to the pool on the roof top, the gym and spa. It was a far cry from the way we were initially greeted upon checking in. Linda was wonderful through our stay providing maps and pointers for this to do The metro station again is just outside the hotel as is the Arena shops, food court, supermarket and laundry drop off. I understand Mata was overworked and stressed on our arrival but she could definately learn from Linda the importance of making a paying guest feel welcomed in her home city. Later on when I did ask Mata where I could go shopping and that I save all my money to spend there rather than shop the other European countries she smiledfor the first time and happily pointed the best places where the locals shop. I understand she may have had an off day but it did make me question would I come back. If not for the lovely Linda she really made the rest of our stay a wonderful one. The breakfast was good and thank god for the coffee machines. The wifi wasn't great except in the lobby.",4,2013,07,21
47,Location is not central or near most visited places,"I chose this hotel according to the comments on trip adviser, let me tell you exactly the negatives and positives:
1- Location is not central it is special as it is near the Arena Mall, and infront the fountain.. two places that you need to visit once, but other than that it is far from Rambla and Catalonia or the beach which are Barcelona's most lovely central places.
2- The only positive I see that the Metro station is right at the hotel door, and the TMB from and to Airport is across the street.
3- At first day even after telling the staff by email that it is our wedding anniversary they gave us a very bad room which is looking at the basement! I made a small fight and got a better room after the second day.
4-  Breakfast buffet is huge... but not tasty... staff working at the restaurant are very rude.They know nothing about service or customers.
5- About rooms are not as expected at all... no carpets, they don't change the sheets.
6- No wi-fi at rooms... you must stay at the reception to get connection.
7- We paid Euro 135 per night in double which is not worth it at all... I could pay less in Catalonia area and get better service, I stayed in Mercure Madrid with euro 80 per double per night with breakfast and was much much much better.

That's all.. hope this is will be helpful for you.",4,2013,07,18
47,best window view to plaza españa,The room is so clean and very comfortable.very nice view from the window you can see the very beautiful plaza españa and montjuic.very nice place.nice service.delicious breakfast.We want to come back together with my kids,5,2013,07,15
47,Location location!!,"Again, like many of my trip choices, was - location. Perfectly located. Many places in walking distance, metro meters away, buses on the doorstep, airport shuttle outside the hotel (not free!). Its noisy if you like total peace, but with closed windows is perfect. Had everything we needed and even the pool on the roof top. Rooms spacious enough and clean.",4,2013,07,03
47,Contemporary hotel in great location --- needs improvement to be 5 stars,"I booked at the last minute for a Saturday night and got about 50% off.  A very good deal at this price -- perhaps not quite so special at the regular price but still above average. 

Over all, this is a very good hotel with some plusses and some deficiencies.  The location on the Plaza Espanya is excellent, with easy access to Metro, cabs, and busses.  Unless you really need a room with a view, get a possibly quieter room on the inside of the ""donut"" design.  A large shopping mall, including a supermarket, is right across the street (take the elevator to the top for a 360 deg view).   

The desk service was helpful, even reassigning a room with full double bed instead of twins.  But checkout at noon took almost 15 minutes because of lines 10 deep. 

The overall decor is a clean, contemporary, stylish look.  The room was reasonably large and generous bathroom with tub/shower -- and unlike some hotels, actually had sufficient storage spaces in the bath and room.  The tub had a grab bar -- also missing in some hotels.  However, the floor of the tub was slippery even though there was a design in the floor of the tub suggesting non-slip (I guess it had worn off).  Also the bathroom floor tiles can be very slippery when wet. 

TV has many channels.   Wifi instructions given to me at check-in were confusing (and NOT CataloniaPlaza shown on my iPad list) and slow to log on.  When I finally got in, it was reasonably fast.  Note:  the wifi codes in the lobby are different!

The snack bar (Gourmet Corner) was convenient and reasonably priced.  A club sandwich was surprisingly good. 

The major deficiency was the room air conditioning, which took most of the night to cool down.  Thinking the dial must not be calibrated, I even set it at 15C. And it was still very muggy.   I don't know if this is characteristic of AC in Barcelona or a weak AC system (or possibly due to using water cooling system instead of true AC?).   For one night, it was tolerable but if I were staying a week in summer, I wouldn't book this hotel due to the AC. 

The room had some irritating problems:   a small red velvet chair (the only one) was only usable for children.  The seat actually was inches below my knee -- and I'm only 5'8"" -- so the desktop was level with my chest!   Why do designers put such ridiculous, impractical items in hotels?

There were no electrical outlets near the bed ---another ridiculous design.  I use a CPAP and had to run the cord across to the opposite wall (and remember not to trip on it during the night).
One bedside lamp bolted to the wall was loose and about to fall off. There was veneer missing from the edge of the bathroom door.  And drink stains not cleaned off one nightstand. The electrical outlets felt loose.   All this could be signs of maintenance neglect. 
I could hear a child talking one or two rooms away and also hall noises.  And I could here a vacuum cleaner running before I wanted to get up in the morning. 

Overall, it was above average and, in some respects, almost 5 stars -- but the AC and other irritations make it 4 stars at best. 

By the way, I overheard a desk clerk tell a couple that breakfast was 10 euros if they ordered when they checked in --- something I was not told when I checked in.  The regular price is 16 euros even if you choose this option on line -- shouldn't you get a price break on line? (I did not have breakfast.)",4,2013,07,01
47,10:42 PM And The Party Is Still Going On,"There is a party tent in the middle of the hotel.  I'm feeling badly for my friends who need to wake at 3am tomorrow for their plane departure as the bass from the party music and the mike announcements must make it impossible to sleep.

Also I was put in a smoking room.  With as many rooms as they have, this should never have happened.  There is no soundproofing in these hotel rooms.

Breakfast is good.

I will never return and am glad to be leaving tomorrow to another hotel in Barcelona.",2,2013,06,22
47,"Location, Location, Location","While this is considered a ""business"" hotel, we stayed several nights while on a tour. It is clean and comfortable and nicely appointed. The best feature however is the location on the plaza, in walking distance to a museum and across from a shopping center that has a great view and nice retaurants on the top floor. A  subway station is directly in front of the hotel.",4,2013,06,16

47,I want to go back!,"I loved the locattion. Through your windows you can see the MNAC (National Art Museum of Catalunya), which is a beutiful palace-like builging, with dancing fountains  and light at night, the Ex- Bull fight plaza which is now a super cool shopping mall, and you have the metro station just a few steps outside the hotel´s door. The rooms are super clean an modern. The bathroom is huge. I felt like I was in a US hotel as I entered my room. Super globalized, not a European old fashion hotel. Wifi in the rooms didn´t work but the lobby wifi worked perfectly. Excellent ambience in the lobby, Really Kind Service, helpful peolpe 24/7. I stayed there for 1 week for bussiness and I loved it because I also had the chance to get to the touristic places fast and easy. Visit the coffe and bread shop 1 block away called Granier, its delicious fresh bread and delicious sanwishes, and the coffee is so good too. Had breakfast every morning there for from 6-8 Euros a day.",5,2013,06,10
47,Well located,"Stayed once recently at this hotel - very convenient from the airport (the Aerobus stops almost at the door) - also, being situated at the Plaza de España, there is a major shopping centre next door as well as simple access to the underground (just in front of the main hotel entrance).  I find hotels in Barcelona to vary too much in price, but we managed to obtain a good deal - seems to depend on local activities such as Conferences, Fairs and Tourist seasons.  The hotel in itself is cold and good for accommodation only - too big to offer any individual service and also rather without character.  We did however enjoy our overnight stay and I have no negative things to comment.  The rooms are ok and equipped with everything needed.  We'll probably overnight here again if the price is right.",3,2013,06,10
47,"Good location, OK hotel","Hotel is located in a nice residential area with a lot of restaurants and cafe. Metro station is right outside the front door. Sants train station is 10-15 minutes walk away. Main attractions a short metro ride. Hotel is easy to access from airport by metro. Facing Magic Fountains and Catalonian Art museum. Our room had a beautiful view on the fountains and Montjuic. The room and the bathroom were clean, but in my opinion lacked the character. The hotel has a rooftop pool that was a nice touch. Have not tried the restaurant as it was tons of great places for breakfast and dinner nearby. If you are not looking for a central location, it's a good place to stay. ",4,2013,06,08
47,"Great Breakfast, Bland Hotel","We found this to be a bland soulless hotel, a large box containing many smaller boxes.  The decor is designed for easy cleaning and has little character. Same colour on the floors & walls.  Good points: passable standard of cleaning, comfortable bed, nice cotton sheets, quiet room for a good sleep, good towels, amazing breakfasts, pleasant staff, centrally situated.  Not so good: our room needed maintenance.  The window latch was loose and awkward to use when we arrived, then fell off during our stay, the bathroom sink was cracked, there were rust stains in the bath, the bottom of the bathroom door had rotted due to damp [probably because the extractor fan didn’t seem to work], the ‘minibar’ mentioned in the brochure did not exist, one of the bedside lamps was loose and falling off the wall, the writing pad was torn, there were stains and sticky marks on the wall and a cracked area in the ceiling.  Although there was plenty of hanging space, I lived out of my suitcase as there were no drawers for clothing.  The view from the room [at the back of the hotel] consisted of a demolition site, graffiti and what looked like a centre for down & outs or drug addicts.  The hotel “does what it says on the tin,” it provides accommodation for hundreds of people, is reasonably comfortably and close to the centre of Barcelona.  I am at a loss to understand how it gets **** and very glad I was only there for three nights.",3,2013,06,04
47,Good Touring Hotel,"We visited this hotel as part of a Gate 1 tour of Spain. The rooms are clean, comfortable and more than acceptable. But don't expect heated towels and terry robes or a balcony with a great view. It's the kind of hotel you need when you tour and spend only 9 hours or so a day in the room. Location was great: near metro and bus lines at Plaza Espana. If you want to nit-pick it: TV has few English channels (but who goes to Spain to watch Leno), no Kleenex (use a hankie) and they were unable to supply us with a voltage converter or any 120 voltage. Courteous, knowledgeable staff.",4,2013,05,30
47,Well placed and comfortable,Stayed for four nights for a birthday trip and enjoyed the ease and position of the hotel including the excellent customer service and great breakfast selection. The hotel is a scenic walk away from las ramblas but only a few short stops on the metro too.

The location was gret for us, not in the center of town but only 2-3 metro stops away from the port and rambles. The metro station is right outside the door of the hotel. The staff was very nice and helpful. The breakfest was very good with a nice variety of food as well as fresh fruit and juices.",5,2013,05,09
47,Nice hotel with great views!,"I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. Each guest is given a voucher for a free glass of cava in the bar, there's a free bottle of water and some chocolates in the room too. The hotel is very big, the rooms are nice and big. We had a great view of Plaza Espana! There's a swimming pool on the roof, although it was too cold for us to use in May. I don't think they can say they have a fitness room as it only consists of 3 machines. The breakfast is fantastic- it has everything you can imagine! Despite facing a very busy roundabout, it wasn't noisy at all. I would definitely return to this hotel.",5,2013,05,07
47,Not bad,"Me and my husband where there on first we of may. Anonymous hotel good for business travellers or big organized tours.

47,"A good hotel, with silly pitfalls.","I stayed here for four nights for business.  It is a good hotel, with a good buffet breakfast, quiet room, free internet and a very nice view of Plaza Espanyol. However, there are several small setbacks which can only be described as ""silly"".  They do not have to exist, and requires fixing by the management.

1) Reception did not have enough ""keys"" for the room safe deposit boxes.

2) The printer at the business station remained non-functional for the duration of my stay.  I pointed this out to the reception staff from the beginning.

3) Because of the printer problem, I sent my boarding pass by e-mail to the reception three times.  Although my e-mail system stated that the e-mail had been delivered, reception claimed that they never received it.  I clearly put my name and room number in the subject line.

4) My room key did not work on the 4th night.",3,2013,05,04
47,Dont stay here if you want service or sleep.,This hotel looks quite nice from the outside and lobby. It actually also has a great location. But thats where the positivity ends. This hotel is more like a hostel. Forget a restful sleep. You can hear every door open and close in your hallway and every knock.  The cleaners also like to slam these doors. The street noise is a typical city and can be quietened with the windows closed. But then you'll have to turn on the A/C and again not quiet. This hotel does not provide its own room service. Instead you order from an outsude vendor. If you want coffee delivered in the morning...this is not your hotel. The price and location is applealing but i would rather pay more for a hotel that is relaxing and provides great service. ,2,2013,04,29
47,"dirty rooms,poor variety of food,careless staff","We thought that this hotel is big ones of Barcelona.We went last summer with a travel tour ,including 25 persons.We have been waited by reception staff almost 3,5 hours.Their pretext was ""its Siesta time,The rooms are dirty and will be cleaning,you must wait "".But too many guests enterence to rooms were done before us, thought we went before. And they gave us a room incredible dirty, too dark and too bad sight.In the room there were hundreds of hair in everywhere (Specially on the chairs.) (we guessed animal hair,dog?or cat?) a dusty closet and bad smell sheet.We stayed here only one night and changed the room.And it was not clean enough but had a very good sight.Food were the same everyday,and breakfast were very poor and too expensive.",2,2013,04,27
47,Decent Hotel,"I should have been more impressed with this hotel than I was.. First off, it was incredibly busy with a front desk staff that wasn't all that friendly. Secondly, the breakfast room was pretty chaotic, primarily because it is a free-for-all, with dozens of tourists from dozens of countries going down the buffet line in a totally unorganized manner. Add to the fact that there's a cappucino/expresso machine required to operate to get a cup of coffee, so it was NOT a relaxing experience. I had purchased a phone adapter so I could use my iPhone in Espana, but it would not work in the room. I could, however, use the (thankfully free) computer in the lobby to charge it but the staff would not let me use a computer behind their desk to charge it so it took much longer than necessary. Also, the hotel is not centrally located to the tourist sites, despite what we were told. It's a metro ride or taxi ride to get anyway.. next time in Barcelona, I'll look for a hotel closer to the center of town.",3,2013,04,26

47,"Not forthcoming, extremely inefficient","We prepaid two (DOUBLE) rooms for three nights. Front Desk personnel who received us was not forthcoming, extremely inefficient over room assignments, we wasted so much time on room changes and lost a luggage in between changes!  

1.She offered an upgraded room (suite) for an additional amount, we agreed. After a lengthy time on her computer, she announced she the entire hotel has ONLY ONE suite (why did she even offer this to us?).  We then agreed that one room will be on a suite (room 701) and another in room 706 (what they label as SUPERIOR ROOM in their website), and the following nights, we were supposed to be moved from 701 to a room next to 706, same floor, same SUPERIOR room type with additional payment for the upgrade, AS LONG AS the two rooms are next to each other.  Reception accepted this provision.

2. The following morning, we followed up the room change and they confirmed a guest is indeed occupying 701 and we needed to move our luggage;  but because we had to leave for our tour, they advised us to leave our luggage in the suite and they will move them, as the new rooms were not ready.  Just the same, we decided to leave our luggage in Room 706.

3. After a long day out, we came back after dinner expecting to have our rooms ready.  RECEPTION informed us that we are assigned a room on the 6th floor, in another tower (you use a different lift for 6th floor: the lift across Reception desk), while the 7th floor uses the lifts on the right side as you enter the lobby).

4.  Turns out, they gave our assigned room on the 7th floor to another guest.

5.  They assigned us a room on the 6th floor which was dark, creepy and smells of old carpeting, and said there were no other rooms, we had no choice. The pictures (made brighter and looks cleaner) for these rooms are not a faithful to the real thing.

6. When we realized we were missing a luggage, we reported it and they informed us that suite 701 is still unoccupied and there were no luggage left in the room.

7. We asked to talk to the Reception personnel who caused all this confusion, we were told she was on leave and not available.",2,2013,04,10
47,"Convenient location, nice breakfast","I stayed in this hotel for a 3-day business trip in early April. The room is spacious, clean and tidy with free wifi. I was lucky to have a room with the view on the beautiful Arenas de Barcelona. The breakfast was great. The staff at the reception was nice and helpful, though the check-in process was a bit slow. 

There are metro station, airport bus-stop and the Arenas de Barcelona (previously a bullring and now a large shopping mall) next to the hotel at the Plaza de España. Despite its central and convenient location, my room was not affected by noises on the street.",4,2013,04,09
47,My Spring Break in Spain - The final chapter,"After touring Southern Spain and staying in a number of second-rate hotels I have to say the Catalonia was a welcome sight.  It's located on the Plaza Espanya, right near the Metro.  The lobby is bright and modern, the rooms, main dining room and baths were spacious. 

Lots of tapas bars and a shopping mall right across the street.

The Fitness center was a bit disappointing, with only one treadmill, elliptical machine and bike.

Again, no face cloth, iron or coffee maker, and you have a pay a 40 euro deposit if you want to use the security box - refundable on departure.",3,2013,04,08
47,Not sure if this is a four star,Me and my wife arrived at this hotel at 3pm but the system was down so the receptionist told us to wait but at the sametime everyone else was getting checked in. We waited for 30mins and asked wether there was any progress they finally checked us in only because I asked if I did not they did not look like they were bothered I do understand they have a lot of guests but they should make abut more of an effort. I finally got into the room to find there's no kettle or iron so I went to the reception to ask if I could have an iron I was told not today but tomorrow. The next day I enquired about the iron again this time I was told they did not even have an iron and you have to use their ironing service which was abit pricey. If your going to stay at this hotel take your own iron. The bed in the room was rock solid. The hotel is nice and in a great location you have one of the best views in barcelona but I'm not sure if this should be rated as a four star hotel.,3,2013,04,05
47,Good hotel & nice location,"Stayed in March for 3 nights with my wife, beds and toilets were clean, breakfast was great and was like feast, service was good, location is very nice if you get a room with a view on the Plaza Espanea and the museum of arts with the nice fountain and waterfall, shopping mall nearby with good sushi restaurant at top floor for dinner, bus tour stop just across the road, airport bus stop just in front of the hotel, metro station just steps from the hotel. Great value for money and Recommended and will stay back.",4,2013,04,04
47,Good Location,"This hotel has a good central location, and is only 10 mins from airport and next to metro. Hotel is basic but clean, staff are friendly. Laundry service was very good.
We stayed here with a large soccer group.  Shopping mall across street is helpful. After staying here for a few days we found the food to be bland and very repetitive.",4,2013,04,02
47,Great location & Top service,""" Bravo""
Perfect place to stay when in Barcelona. Only a few 20 meters from the newest shopping center situated inside an old bullring. We booked a suite with an amazing views to Plaza España.
The service is fabulous, from the moment you arrive at the front. Small Spa area, but one of best massages we have around Europe.  Splendid breakfast with plenty of choice and much better dinner in their Filigrana Restaurant.",5,2013,03,18

Good breakfast and very nice staff, big swimming pool on the roof
Room are good size, only thing is that airco didn't work and therefor the rooms rather warm at the front of the hotel....

Nice hotel for a weekend away to BCN",4,2013,03,11

47,Everything you need,"Good hotel. Room clean and comfortable. Location very convenient for buses and metro. Some traffic noise as situated right on the Placa Espanya, but didn't keep us awake. Staff were helpful providing extra pillows on request, looking after bags on check out day etc. Good value!",4,2013,02,23
47,"Very nice hotel, good location","Perfect location, close to the shopping mall and a metro station. 
You can watch the famous ""Dancing Fountains Show"" of the hotel window!
Delicious breakfast with good variety!
I recommend to buy a few day ticket for the subway, that will make it easy to explore Barcelona!",5,2013,02,17
47,A hotel in of the best locations in barcelona,The location is very good if your stay will be for participating in congress center .internet is free .rooms are big but some of the has not good view (back or openning to center lobby).for safe box you must say and has deposit extra.it doesnt have minibar  also.the rooms are clean.the staffs are helpful but some of them can not understand english.,3,2013,02,08
47,pleasent spot in Barcelona,"we stayed for 4 nights .The hotel is situated on plaza espanya not the heart of the city but 
on top of the metro station few stops and you are at city centere or the city touristic seafront.
Arena shopping centere is across the street in there nice varaity of shops , coffeshops , restaurants and cinemas.
very safe area for tourists walking by night  or early in the morning .
Rooms are modern quiet and clean . breakfast is o.k not superb.
Front desk staff and especially the reception manager are helpfull
and friedly 
overall good value for the money , consider coming again in the future.",4,2013,02,05
47,Fantastic stay at Catalonia Barcelona,"Stayed here in Aug 2012.  Great location and nice rooms.  The staff was not very friendly at first, although their manager straightened everything out.  Will stay here again when back in Barcelona.  Good hotel, nice pool upstairs and Arena mall across the street.",5,2013,01,27
47,Perfect place,"A 4 stars hotel in Plaza España. We stayed 7 nights and I really enjoyed!
Nice view, near the Arenas Shopping and the metro station.
I really like this hotel, very friendly staff and very nice room!
I will come back!",5,2013,01,23
47,Absolutely fabulous,"Stayed 3 nights in the Suite rooms on the  10th floor.  Cannot fault this hotel or the service of the staff, namely, Linda who was very helpful, and we commend the staff for their excellent customer service.  Most definitely return again.",5,2013,01,19
47,My new barcelona home,"I use to stay in Expo hotel near sants. Catalonia Plaza is just couple of 100 meters more faar from station but room are much bigger, internet much more stable, huge shoping center near by, ""arena"", metro and right on Placa de Espagna..

I like this hotel, it has an amaising terasse with pool, and a great bar and restaurant.
All i need basically in this part of barcelona.",4,2013,01,19
47,Excellent location and hotel,"We stayed at the hotel for 3 days beginning of December and 1 day in January on our way back to Australia.  We absolutely loved the views from the hotel.  We were pleasantly rewarded on the way back to an upgrade for being returning customers and were given a Suite at no extra cost.
The staff were friendly and courteous at all times and very informed as to what to see and do in Barcelona.  Don't miss a visit to the shopping center across the road in the former bull fight ring and at night take the lift up to the top where you can get a 360 degree view of the city and choose any of the restaurants on the top.  Also a visit to Montjuic is a must as well a day visit to Montserrat via a train which you can take just across the road from the hotel via an underground entry.",5,2013,01,15
47,Very good,"A 4 star hotel with all the services you should expect from this category.
The location is not too central, plaza Espanya is where the exhibition fair is, but the metro station is just in front of the entrance door and it takes 3 stops to get to Plaza Catalunya. 
It's perfect for business, rooms are quite big, it's very clean, there is a spa, a couple of bars, restaurants, everythinhg you may need. 50 meters away there's the Arena shopping mall and a tapas bar called TapaTapa that is pretty good for lunch. If you don't mind staying a little bit out of the center it's a good choice, overall.",4,2013,01,11
47,"pleasant staff, good location, but safety box need extra money?",my wife and I stayed there because hotel is very near tourist area and aerobus stop. it only takes 20 mins to airport so that its' perfect for last minute shopping. all staff at reception are pleasant and speaking good English. Room is spacious and good enough for 2 people and 4 baggage. garden resturant for breakfast is big and comfortable. food was fresh and well served although not many choices. in all it's a very pleasant experience to stay. The only unexpected thing is safety box need extra charge. it's a bit odd as we think this should be a standard room service just like a pillow.,2,2013,01,06
47,Acceptable,"As expected, a large international hotel catering for tourists in the main.
The reception staff were friendly. The room was clean and had everything one requires. It was starting to show its age however, furniture a bit knocked about. The bed was comfortable however and it was very quiet, facing to the rear away from the square. Good to see you can actually open a window for some fresh air, not sealed in an air conditioned environment. Asked for a key to the safe, no extra cost. 
The location is good, excellent public transport outside the door plus a shopping centre. Walking to the centre (Las Ramblas) only took half an hour along interesting and typical Barcelona streets. 
I had breakfast in the hotel, I really can't recommend it. Maybe eating under a large tent in the central courtyard is fine in summer but it felt like a large warehouse in December - no atmosphere, very functional. The food was very average indeed, the cooked breakfast was invariably cold, the choice was very average with nothing other than the pastries to recommend. The pancakes were the most bland I've ever tasted! There are lots of restaurants and cafés nearby.
The hotel is fine if you're just looking for somewhere to stay for a night or two; for something more atmospheric and  'Catalan' I suggest you look elsewhere.",3,2013,01,01
47,Good location,"We stayed at this hotel during the trade fair, the location was quite convenient for this purpose - at the middle between the city centre and the fair grounds. The rooms were quite spatious, they should be cleaner but this was still acceptable. The view from the room (Mont Juic with the museum bulding on the top of the hill) was breathtaking - unfortunatelly the square in front of the hote is extremely noisy so you cannot open your window at night. In summer time this has to be a nightmare as the air-condition was extremely noisy too.",4,2012,12,31
47,nice and convenient,"very nice modern room. spacious. 
the mattress is a little uncomfortable - the old spring type. 
great breakfast buffet - look for the small bit-sized sausages hiding near the jams (not where you would expect them to be).
you need to get a special lock for the safe from reception and they charge 4 euro per day !",4,2012,12,16
47,Excellent hotel,"We were at the beginning of December 2012. Excellent hotel, clean, tidy, good service, excellent breakfast. Located on Espanya Square, adjacent to the mall Arena. Have to commend the service workers. I would like to commend especially the service man named Walid who took care of us all room equipment was missing. Definitely when I return to Barcelona get to this hotel!",5,2012,12,12
47,"Very nice hotel, good location","The hotel is situated on Placa Espania, a very remarkable square and it is a central place with good access to buses and the metro, but it's not a walking distance from the Ramblas and El Gotico.
rooms were big enough for us and were clean and comfortable, only downside was that there were no balconies.
breakfast was great, large variety and everything was tasty.
the service was also very good, and we used the receptionists few times for recommendations (which were good).
didn't check the pool/spa as it was November",5,2012,12,02
47,Good Base in Barcelona,"The hotel is centrally located. Convenient from airport, metro and overlooking the Bullfighting arena converted to a mall. Friendly staff ,good breakfast and good service. Everything is good.If you want it is so much close by the mall one can spend lot of time there.",4,2012,11,18
47,Functional but 4-star?,"This hotel is grandly placed at one of the major intersections in Barcelona - Plaza Espana - public transport and the airport bus are at the doorstep, and the older Fira Barcelona, (congress center) is within walking distance.

From a location point-of-view, this could be a four-star location, but that's all it's really got left to warrant that kind of rating.  

Like other properties, it's been used hard and everything reflects that notion in this hotel  The elevators, the trim, the cleanliness, the patchwork of paint in places and a rooftop pool, while perfect for a night-bar overlooking some of the more impressive sights in the city, is sadly surrounded by pool chairs, and an appearance of an enclosure, with the equivalent of a Dasani water vending machine as the sole amenity.

It's not easy to run such a large property which is surely busy - but I sense a missed opportunity.  While sitting here in the ""Piano Bar"" writing this, the only notes I hear are those of the refrigerator's compressor, located behind the bar and a lonely and despondent man serving drinks, dutifully, but without any passion, (and it's the same throughout the hotel, I'm not picking on the piano bar man).",3,2012,11,15
47,location location,"friendly helpful staff on arrival and during stay. Metro train line and tour bus virtually at front door
decent buffet breakfast included in price, spacious rooms with good facilities.  would definatley recommend",5,2012,11,06
47,Broadly disappointing,"Good location, decent breakfast, clean hotel etc, but for a business hotel there are a couple of essentials: good reliable wifi and an iron/ironing board. This place has neither based on my experience there a couple of weeks ago. Trying to iron a shirt on a sideboard (they did eventually send me up a filthy iron, which stained my shirt) is not fun and is laughable in a hotel with pretensions to cater for people on business.",2,2012,11,03
47,Comfortable Stay,"I spent four nights at this Hotel and they were all quite comfortable. The Hotel is located just a few minutes by car from the Ramblas although just outside the hotel there is a Tube Station and there is a direct line to the centre of town. The rooms are comfortable, clean although in need of a brightening up. The breakfast choice is ample and the quality is top notch. The gym cannot really be called a gym since it only consists of one threadmill, one air walker and a Cycling machine with no weights. The Pool however is fantastic enjoying some memorable views. Would definitley repeat.",4,2012,11,01
47,Excellent location,"I spent only 2 nights at this Hotel but was sufficient to be amazed by it. I was travelling alone so I booked a single room, but the room was very big enough for 3people. The recepcionists weren´t very friendly, but other services offset this: I didn´t like to be retained 40 USDonly for the use of the safe, but they returned the value. The restaurant at ground floor was delicious. I recommend anyone who stays here to try the restaurant. 
The location is excellent, there were taxis right in front of the hotel, the metro station is close and also there is stop station for the Barcelona Bus Turistic right in front of the hotel. There is also a mall that is located close to the hotel, it isn´t very big but has a wonderfull view of the city. I recommend this hotel.",4,2012,10,29
47,Amazing hotel by any standard!,"Loved, loved, loved this hotel. Modern by any international standard. The shower was brilliant, love the stone work. The price was great and the decor and service fantastic. I would highly recommend this hotel if traveling to Barcelona. The location is also perfect, centered downtown LasRambla's. ",5,2012,10,27
47,Very Average,"I really cant find anything too good to write about this hotel. 
My room wasn't ready in time even when I waited to the maximum of 14:00oclock 
I kindly asked for a late check out on the day of departure but they told me that up to 4 or 5 hours will cost 60 euros and above that will be a whole night fare - 200 euros! They even haven't offered some kind of arrangement or discount, just pay or get out!
Breakfast is poor, no vegetables what so ever. No potatoes or hash browns, just eggs and ham. Coffee sucks. It's from some machine and you never know what button to press.
One of towels in the room was torn. Floor looks bad. Internet was slow on my floor (6), could hardly open emails.
Location is far from the tourist area of the Rambla down town. Lucky cabs are cheap.

The only good thing I can say is that its near the ""FIRA"" convention center if you're there for a conference and also there is a nice shopping mall right next to the hotel. Other than that, stay away. Sorry.",2,2012,10,20
47,"Great location, decent hotel","Stayed here recently on business with two colleagues and we found the hotel to be good enough for our needs. 

Great location for night time trips out for meals and parties and the hotel itself was clean, had friendly staff (admittedly the reception staff were v slow) and the roof top pool was a bonus and has great views. 

Breakfasts were average but very wide range and the two bars were very nice indeed. I'd stay here again for sure. ",4,2012,10,19
47,Excellent Hotel,"I had booked this hotel for a surprise weekend break for my boyfriends birthday.
I picked it because of the location, it was so easy to find getting to it by the metro from the airport and also because of the fountains, sadly they were closed for maintenance and weren't working.
The room we had was on the corner of the hotel which was great, we had great views of what should of been the fountains and the roundabout, the room was clean spacious and everything we needed. We also had breakfast on the two days we were there which had somethign for everybody and set you up for your busy day ahead.
Highly reccomend visiting Camp Nou and the Aquarium.
Would highly reccomend and would re-visit again.",5,2012,10,16
47,It's a good hotels with structurals problems,"Nothing to say about the quality of this hotel. Nice rooms, staff is really kind, service provided is fine. The problem of this hotel is structural. 
Noise. The fake wood parquet let you hear footsteps of people walking in the aisle or in the room over you at any hour. God bless the dirty moquette! Door locking mechanic is really hard that makes people slam the door. 
Walls Are really thin or badly isolated. You can hear everything happening in the rooms next to your.
Breakfast. Food quality is good, but the breakfast hall seems an hospital restaurant, with 140 people all sitting in a huge room.
It's very well connected. Airport bus in front, metro in front. Ferrocarriles in front.  ",2,2012,10,16
47,Excellent location,"Barcellona is not a place to stay in the hotel. This hotel has huge, clean rooms, with huge bed and spacious bathroom. But here is a shame to stay in the hotel instead of visiting the amazing city. The hotel has an excellent location, the metro is just in front of the hotel, the surroundings are fantastic, 5 min. to the Magic Fountain. The breakfast is very good and rich. What can you ask for more ...",4,2012,10,16
47,"Good, convenient and great for the airport","A good value business hotel which is also used by many tour parties. Getting there is easy because the location is good for the airport buses which is a big plus point, whilst still being in the city. The check-in staff are  used to dealing efficiently with big groups so my check-in was handled quickly and effectively. A good, comfortable clean room ensured a great night's sleep and I checked out before most people to get the early airport bus.",4,2012,10,08
47,Reccommended,"Very decent hotel, no faults really other than easy to hear what goes on in the corridors. Otherwise very good smart standard and right next to the metro. The area is very close to the national musuem, a bit of a commuter hub but lots going on as well.",4,2012,10,03
47,Amazing view and location but disappointing overall.,"I stayed in this hotel with a friend in July for 5 nights. The location is very central and the airport bus stops right outside the door. On first impression was very pleased with the room as had paid extra for a city view which was well worthwhile as you can see the Placa Espanya, National Palace, Magic Fountain and The Arenas from your window.
Unfortunately we had a number of complaints during our stay. On the first night the leg on my bed broke. Although we were offered a new room it was midnight and too late to be bothered moving as everything had been put away. I slept on the mattress on the floor however the next day all was rectified.
The following day my friend and I went to use the pool after a day of sightseeing. We were only in the pool for 5 minutes when we and all the other guests were told to get out of the pool and leave as they were having a private functiion in that area. 
We were not impressed as had been looking forward to relaxing by the pool and duly complained.
We were assured all would be fine the next day.
Much to our amazement we tried to access the pool the following day only to find that the pool area was locked. As you can imagine we were extremely upset to be barred from this facility two days in a row.
Reception were not very helpful and we demanded to see the hotel manager who was sympathetic but said that there was a problem with the cleanliness of the pool which was why they had closed it. We believed her but later found out that this area was being used again for a private function which was why they had closed it.
Overall a disappointing experience staying a this hotel and would not recommend it due to the issues that we had and length of time taken trying to sort out our complaints.
Cleanliness of bed linen and bathroom was also not of a very high standard.",3,2012,09,29
47,Can't wait to go back,"After changing to this hotel at last minute and reading mixed reviews , I had lots of mixed feelings so when I arrived I was pleasantly suprised and couldn't believe my eyes. The area was fantastic , we had booked a room with city view (for only extra 15 euro) . Everyone on reception was friendly and spoke good English , and held our luggage until our room was ready while we explored Barcelona and even gave us a little map.
  Room and bed was very big , with lovely views and could see fountains at night. Room clean , bright , good lighting , and although on main road was very quiet as good air con in the room . 
 Felt very safe within the area , great location right next to las areas de Barcelona full of shops , ice cream shops , supermarket ( which we didn't find until last day) and some fab restaurants at the top and excellent views . hotel right by all forms of public transport inc aerobus, tour bus , taxis , and underground and tourist info across road .
 Safe was refundable 40 euro. Pool was nice touch but only got to spend 1 half hour in it as we were very busy during day.
 Already planning to stay on our next trip hopefully next year but going pay little extra and have breakfast . Room came with plenty of toiletries and hair dryer also a couple of English tv channels.
 Would highly recommend . 
 :)",4,2012,09,20
47,Simply Great!,"Everything about this hotel was great! The location, the area around, the facilities nearby! Everything! I booked a room through an offer on booking.com and when we arrived I was kindly informed that the room we booked was at the back side of the hotel and if we wanted to upgrade with a room that had a view to Plaza Espanya with no extra charge! I was very delighted to hear that. The view we had from our window was astonishing, the room was very clean, the furniture were all new, the bed was very comfortable to rest after a vivid day of sightseeing!!! The hotel is located exactly on top of metro station which helps you move around the city pretty easy and gets you almost everywhere you want! The noise troubling other travellers that I read about on other reviews was not a problem for me, as it was nothing more than I expected in a city so alive like Barcelona! You have anything you want around!!! Supermarkets, a mall and even cafes and restaurants with a view on top of Arena Shopping Mall..(don't miss it!). The hotel is exactly near the Montjuic palace and the dancing water fountains (also worth to see, you 'll be amazed!!), and quite close to Poble Espanyol....an enclosed traditional ""village"" where you can see the architecture and culture of the main cities in Spain represented in each house an crafts/souvenir shop. The only thing I cannot comment about the hotel is the breakfast or food because I had no! There is also a small pool on the roof if you are keen on swimming, and the hotel offers wi-fi, and three free pc points where you can surf. I also had my boarding passes printed with no charge when I asked at the reception desk!",5,2012,09,19
47,"I'd recommend, but......","Book with fountain view. Excellent location. Excellent transportation connection - 2 metro lines, Aerobus, bus N46 to airport (T10 card is allowed). Good breakfast. Close to Las Arenas Mall. September is a good month for Barcelona visit.",4,2012,09,19
47,Very good,"We enjoy our staying very much, bery clean very good' close to the metro station and to amall. And it made our trip very pleasing",4,2012,09,16
47,bed smelling in the holl,"Location is very nice, little pool on the roof, room is comfortable, good service but they have bed smelling in the holl",3,2012,09,01
47,"Exactly not 4-star hotel..great location, but awful hotel","The hotel disappointed me completely. For the 4th stars hotel it was inexcusably dirty: dust balls on a floor, hair in a washbasin, a disgusting smell of the sewerage in a bathroom, the drain of the washbasin was littered and water didn't go through. This hotel doesn't suit people with a light sleep, because there is very strong audibility. It was too much noisy in the morning (rooms cleaning, rooms repairing ect.). In hotel is 340 rooms, but on a roof there are only 10 sunbeds, so people were compelled to sunbathe on a floor or to turn and go away. WIFI-internet was very bad and slow, was done with some middle authorization and wasn't functioning all the time. Exactly not 4-star hotel.

One thing that was really great is the location. The location of this hotel is fantastic if you don't mind being a little distance from the centre of town. Near the hotel is all necessary: Aerobuses (go to/from both terminals T1 and Т2), excursion buses CityTours and BusTuristic, big shopping center with grocery shop on the first floor, undergroung and other city transport's stations. The Magic Fountain and national art gallery MNAC is 500 m away, the park Montjuik and the Olympic stadium is located less than a kilometer. The Catalonia Plaza and Kamp Nou are at distance of the foot walk (2-3 km). To other sightseeing (La Sagrada Familia, Barcelona Zoo, Parc Guell, Tibidabo, Barceloneta, Mar Bella and Bogotel beaches) is possible to get very easily on excursion bus, that goes every 5 minutes.",3,2012,08,30
47,What a location,"This hotel is right at Plaza Espana, next to subway station and Arena shopping center. We were lucky enough to have a room (Rm 151) facing the plaza and the fountain. Room was spacious with a door you can close between the bathroom area and the bedroom. It offers free Wi-FI in the room and we had BBC and other TV programs. Sound insulation was not as good though. I could hear the subway. To avoid that, you should ask room at high floor.

The dining room was large, but the layout needs improvement. It should have separate areas for different food rather than a single serving line. First floor bathroom was not easy to find (perhaps by design). The stairway was also not easily accessible. 

Unlike other reviews, I thought the front desk was friendly. I got change here and Barcelona map with no problem. 

For location alone, we would stay here again.",4,2012,08,26
47,"Good hotel, excellent location but not a 4 star hotel","The hotel is really good, nice building nice rooms, but the cupboard were broken and the wardrobe doors were broken but all in all is really nice hotel.

We stayed in the premium room which has an EXCELLENT view, so beautiful.  They always topped up the coffee and tea and the turn down service was excellent, I particularly enjoyed the chocolate they left for us every night.

I would recommend this hotel for sure, I think paying extra money is definitely worth the view, so definitely recommend the premium room.",4,2012,08,26
47,Excellent value for money. Great location.,"I see some people really like to complain about just everything. I hope to provide a very balanced review. We stayed in the hotel for a week from August 5-12 2012 in rooms 640 and 641. I found the reception staff to be friendly and helpful, especially Linda. I noticed there are at least three front staff in the day and for sure they are busy but they are attentive with your needs. They all speak English well and they are helpful. I did not see any tourist information in the lobby but the reception staff was helpful in this regard. They did provide me with a area map (with a hotel marker on it) and they helped set me up with the hop on and off bus. There was an older gentleman who worked at night and he was not very friendly and was quite grumpy when I needed help.I noticed there is usually two front staff at night.
 I asked for a ""Fountain View"" room on a higher floor and I highly recommend this as the view is brilliant. You will see the fountains and lights in front of the national museum at night and it is beautiful. The fountain and light show on the weekends is spectacular! It is true that there is a busy roundabout right in front of the hotel and it can be noisy. I think being on a higher floor helped mitigate this problem. Also, make sure the windows are closed tightly. We did'nt close one of our windows tightly and we found out that that was the source of excessive noise. We actually needed two rooms and got Rooms 640 and 641 which are independent rooms but there is a common entrance with a common hallway to both rooms. This was very convenient for families as the common entrance could be locked and the other doors kept open. We left all our shoes and lugguage in the common hall area and it freed up alot of space in our rooms. Just make sure you have reception program the key card to allow for this your entire stay. You have to put the card key in a slot at the entrance of your room so the lights and all the power points will work. We were surprized at the large size of the rooms in this European hotel. We felt it was more North American standard size. The rooms were clean and made up daily. We did'nt have any problems with the maids when we put the ""do not disturb"" sign on the front door and the signs never went missing. The corner rooms are nice because we got a view of the fountain and the arena, and they both lit up nicely at night.
 The location of this hotel is fantastic if you don't mind being a little distance from the centre of town. The hotel is at the centre of a major transportation hub for the airport bus, the train, buses and there is a taxi stand in front of the hotel that is constantly serviced. You can take the A2 Aerobus from the airport to the hotel for 6 Euro. If you want to get to the top of Las Ramblas (placa cataluna station) it is only 2 Euro and just a few stops away. If you want to go to Montserrat, the train starts from Placa Espanya station which is right in front of the hotel. The hop on and off bus also has a stop in front of the hotel. Transporation from the hotel is very accessible and easy to navigate. 
There is a bullring arena that was converted to a mall right across the street and it was very convenient. There is a supermarket in the basement and I suggest you do your shopping there as the prices are cheap compared to the convenience stores in the surrounding area (we checked). There is an excellent gelato place in the basement as well and good restaurants in the mall. I would suggest having Tapas at Bodega Monumental at 87 Creu Coberta for real nice euthentic fare and we had breakfeast almost everyday at Conesa sandwich shop at 80 Creu Coberta. The coffee at Conesa was excellent and these places were a 5 minute walk away on the side street of the hotel. I had the breakfeast buffet at the hotel two mornings and I found the food to be really fresh, good variety and the covered room the breakfeast area was in was beautiful and airy. There was a special on the breakfeast buffet on the weekday for 10 Euros and I found this to be a good deal (usually 16 Euro) for what you get. I asked if we could pay 10 Euros on a weekend breakfeast and they allowed it which was a nice surprise. On the weekend we had a three course set menu weekend special one evening at the hotel restaurant and it was excellent and a real good value. For $28 Euro, you get a three course meal including wine (the red wine was excellent). The meal was real high quality with good choices and sevice was excellent. The only catch is that everyone at the table has to order from the set menu for the deal.

I was pleasantly surprised to find out there was free internet in our rooms (wireless) and in the main lobby. There was also three computers with a printer in the main lobby you could use for  free internet and free printing. I found the internet speed was fine and it was never down when I stayed at the hotel. 
The pool on the hotel roof was real helpful to have, especially for the kids after a long hot day. The pool area was clean and the views from the pool were amazing. I took some really nice pictures. The only issue was there were'nt enough pool chairs for everyone. I noticed you could order drinks at the pool but we never did this so I cannot comment on this.
The only real issue I have with the hotel is security. One night we were in the lobby at around 10:30 pm and someone asked my mother to take a picture of him sitting in one of the hotel lobby chairs. As soon as my mother got up from her chair to compy, his accomplace who was sitting behind my mother snatched her purse and they both ran out of the hotel. There was no security at the time in the lobby. I do notice that there is a security guard in the front lobby all day long but he is not there after a certain time at night. We were quite rattled by this incident, especially since there is a police station just across the street on the roundabout (we reported this incident the next day). In general, we felt secure in our rooms and in the area of the hotel. When told of the incident, one local told us at least there was no violence involved. I suggest you be vigilant in Barcelona in general. In general, I found this hotel to be excellent value for what you pay and I would definately stay at this hotel again the next time I am in Barcelona. Hope this helps you. Bon voyage.",5,2012,08,26
47,This is not a 4 star hotel,"We just returned from staying at this hotel.  Good location and on first sight the hotel looked lovely but this is never a 4 star hotel.  Two people working on the reception, no local area maps and info about sightseeing.  The room was clean enough and the air conditioning worked well but the drawers inside our wardrobe fell apart every time we opened them.  There was no English language news channel on the tv. The lobby area is constantly FULL of people lying around the sofas and on the floors waiting for one of the MANY coaches depositing and collecting large groups of people from the hotel. Every time we wanted to speak with someone at reception it was impossible as there was always at least 10 people waiting to be seen by the two people working.  

The entrance doors were always lodged wide open after 10pm at night with no guard on the doors.  The area outside of the hotel, maybe because there is a subway entrance a couple of feet away, always seemed to be busy with very shifty looking people just hanging around.  As soon as we arrived at the hotel we wanted to go to the football stadium to collect our tickets to watch the Barcelona v Real Madrid match.  We went downstairs to reception to collect the 'drum lock' to fit into the safe in our room as we didn't want to take all our money with us, nor leave it in the room, but we couldn't get near to the reception for the amount of people wanting to speak with the two reception staff.  We waited as long as we could then decided to go and collect the tickets and sort out the safe when we got back.  We left the hotel, walked into the subway station and onto the platform, this took approximately 2 minutes.  By the time we got to the platform my husband's wallet had been stolen from his bag, which was closed with a clasp. All our money was gone.  In my opinion we were targeted by someone hanging around outside the hotel who followed us down into the subway.  My advice if you stay here is to be very aware and careful as you leave the hotel.  I know what happened isn't the hotels fault, but it would be good for the reputation of this ""4"" Star hotel if they made some attempt to move people on from directly outside the doors who are there for no apparent reason.  They even come inside and stand in the lobby occasionally and never seem to be questioned as to why.  We even found people walking around the floor our room was on (3) when we returned in the afternoon, smoking something very questionable with a very distinctive smell!!!",3,2012,08,25
47,Brilliant location,"Hi I stayed in this hotel for a wend abd it was perfect, I couldn't believe my luck when the taxi stopped outside, the view all the way up to mount juric is lovely and there is a lovely shopping centre beside plus loads of yummy tapas places to eat. The metro and airport stop is right outside the hotel, I will be back 
",5,2012,08,24
47,"Looks nice, good location, but DEFINITELY not 4 star.","I'll start with what is good.  The location is great right in the Plaza de Espanya.  The views on all sides are great.  The pool is on the roof, and is surrounded by beautiful views.  It is crystal clear water,  ph balance seems good and not overly chlorinated.  There is also a bartender up there with reasonably priced drinks.  The fitness center is actually just a treadmill, elliptical, and bike.

Now, the unacceptably bad.  The shower will randomly change temperature every 15 seconds and the pressure is terrible.  The drains are backed up.  There is no iron or board in the room.  I asked reception for an iron and received one with the water cap missing and tape holding the dial on one temperature.  There is no where to get ice, so the bar downstairs gave us a shopping bag full of ice, which was useful for about 6 minutes.  While lost late at night, we asked the hotel to hail us a taxi back to the hotel, to which they replied we should find a metro stop or train.  The problem is, the gates close at 12:30am (actually, they were already closed by midnight after the FC Barcelona match we saw).  The DND sign on our door kept disappearing.  The housekeepers open the curtains and turn the A/C down, so it would be pretty warm for the first hour back in the room.  I finally had to post a sign so they would leave the thermostat alone.  There is a stupid slot you have to put your room key in to use half the lights and outlets in the room.  Every night, randomly, certain electrical circuits would shut off, such as all the outlets, the TV, the bed lamps, and the bathroom lights.  I opened the circuit box near the door and found everything in working order, leading me to believe those circuits are centrally controlled.  I finally called reception to complain, and 10 minutes later, everything magicaly worked again...creepy.  The WiFi is on one of those stupid ""log in first"" websites, and occasionally wouldn't work as a result.  The housekeepers knock twice and IMMEDIATELY open the door.  One of them got a well deserved eye full of me changing into my swimming trunks.  The reception staff only has 2 people that spoke any respectable amount of English.  Any Spanish I knew was nearly useless because the staff apparently only understands the Catalan dialect.  I understand this is not an English speaking country, but if you seek a job in the travel and tourism industry, you need to learn it.  They also need to brush up on some of the more popular tourist destinations because they gave us information that conflicted directly with those destinations' websites.

This is NOT a 4 star hotel.  It looks like one, and has the fancy bar/restaurant gimmicks of a 4 star, but no ice bucket or iron in the room?  American 1 star motels have that stuff.  99.9999% of your customers just traveled, and thus, their clothes are probably wrinkled from being in tossed around luggage.  And when we ask for an iron, don't give me a busted piece of junk and expect me to iron my clothes on the bathroom counter.  I will never return to this hotel, even if it was free.",3,2012,08,21
47,Noisiest room I ever stayed in and a dodgy safe,"Stayed for 2nights on the 3rd floor facing the inner court yard.
The room was spacious enough but it was NOISY!!!
Constant noise from outside - coming from fans for air-conditioning which was placed outside. I am not a light sleeper - but as the noise was too big to ignore even the window was closed; it was impossible to have a decent sleep. Imagine a helicopter hovering above your house - and it continues 24/7 non-stop!
And the safe in the room was dodgy. You have to get the lock from the reception by paying 40EUR as a deposit (which is refundable on the return of the lock safely) - but the lock was not working anyway - whatever you do, it opens - and in the end I had to return it. 4star hotel???
If my party wasn't staying there I would have changed the hotel. Comfort of sleep and the safety are the top 2 priorities I look for a good hotel.
Location was good though and the staff service was adequate - but rather impersonal for my liking.
I would think twice if someone asks me to stay there again - never say never though - maybe just need to stay on the different floors or different rooms???",2,2012,08,15
47,Excellent Hotel,"the location was perfect, good transfer(they have many bus stations, airport bus station and metro in front of the hotel), bath room was very clean.

it was the best hotel.

",5,2012,08,14
47,Great Hotel and location,"After weeks deciding were to stay, i opted for this hotel. I am so glad i did. The hotel is spotless, the staff are very friendly and helpful. The rooms were cleaned every day and fresh towels were left. The location was perfect for us as we wanted to visit the magic fountains on the Friday night. These are free and well worth a visit. We were blown away by the amazing show.
The hotel is right opposite the Placa d Espana and the bull ring shopping centre. During our stay we visited Parc Guell and Las Ramblas. Parc Guell is so beautiful and free to get into. We felt perfectly safe in the area we stayed in (no pickpockets) much better than when i stay by Las Ramblas last visit.
Just outside the hotel you can get on the metro, the trains arrive every 15 minutes. We travelled to Las Ramblas and Parc Guell for 2 Euros each.
Don't bother getting a taxi to and from the airport, you can get the A2 bus from right outside the airport to the hotel, the cost was 6 Euros each.
All in all we had a fabulous holiday, we will definately be coming back. Can't comment on food as we ate out.",5,2012,08,06
47,"Good location, bad service.","Hotel was nice enough, but first impression of service was nothing to brag about. Beds was very hard. Hotel is under renovation so we had to endure a lot of noise just outside the room. No signal on television. Internet was non-existing two nights in a row. Three times somebody knocked the door before 11 am. Too expensive for the ""faulty towers"".",2,2012,08,03
47,Good hotel,"Hotel in a good place España Square.
Clean rooms and showers.
Reasonable level.
We arrived in the morning, the room was ready but we had to pay 10 euros to enter early.
If you want to stay after 12 noon, have to pay 30 euros until 15:00, 40 euros until 18:00 and 80 euros until 19:30.
The advantage of the hotel is close to the subway station.",4,2012,07,31
47,Great location,Was really happy with location and value for money.Abit noisy with  it being such a busy roundabout  but all other aspects of the hotel were fine.Its close proximity to the Olympic Stadium was a real bonus and having Metro stop right outside hotel was also great.The gym was pretty average but pool on top deck was fine and good shopping mall across the road was a bonus.I'd certainly stay there again.,4,2012,07,17
47,You can do better. Average on all counts,"To put this is perspective - I have just come back from 8 nights in Barcelona on my 8th visit to the city. I had booked the hotel Jazz and forgot to extend the booking 2 extra nights so needed another hotel quickly.  I found this on late rooms and i thought - great a 4 star when I was only in a (brilliant 3 star).

Sorry but the 3 star Jazz hotel ran rings around this one.  

Its set on possibly the most beautiful but noisiest roundabout in Europe!  The Plaza de Espana.  It's so noisy.  Add to this that the cleaners are banging around at the crack of dawn - you have no chance of sleep.

But we weren't in Barca to sleep.  Location - far far away from the action though.  If you are young and want to party - you will be a 10 min cab ride away from anywhere decent.

The rooms were a good size but crusty - like an old marriott.  There was nothing 4 star about them.

The picture of the roof terrace is incredibly deceptive.  It is half the size it looks in the photos, there is no bar or food during the day - in fact it is prohibited!  So what are you supposed to do with yourself?  You try and sunbathe but can hear nothing but noise.  

Also - where are the staff at this hotel?  Noone around the pool. Noone giving you the impression they are looking after you to 4 star standards.

It was ok.  But it was nowhere near 4 star.  I am an event manager and I book hotels all over the world.",3,2012,07,16
47,generic highrise hotel with amenities,"Great location right on the Plaça d'Espanya with comfortably sized rooms – ours had a great view of the plaza with the Palau Nacional in the background. We chose the hotel also because of its proximity to Barcelona Sants train station, just a ten-minute walk away. It isn't the poshest area of Barcelona, but we felt perfectly safe even at night (but we're also used to traveling in large cities). We didn’t use the pool, the bar, or have breakfast, but the location, the reasonable price (with no trade fairs going on), the room size, and comfortable bed  and free internet fully met our expectations. A benefit was being able to upgrade for various amenities like free safe or bathrobe or breakfast - nice to be able to make choices and decide when to pay extra for what items.",4,2012,07,15
47,Great Hotel with superb location,"Was there at 2010 (not as mention on 2011) and all was just great! 

It is a great Hotel and I highly recommend it to all. 
i still remember the coffee on it's roof near the pool and great view on the city. 

Cleanliness:
The room was very clean all the time as the rest of the hotel.

Service: 
We got directions and maps when needed and was very polite, also lobby stuff speck English.

Breakfast:
Was really tasty and good and keep as for almost all day!

Location:
Just superb! you got metro stop (we travel the city only by metro and taxi) 5 meters from the hotel and its the best.",5,2012,07,10
47,weekend trip,"We stayed at this hotel for a ""girlie"" weekend this week.
The hotel is located in Plaza Espana, very near the magic fountain.The location is quite good, with a Metro station on the doorstep, but it is a little out of the way if you are a tourist, rather than on business, as it is really in the more commercial district.
The Ramblas is a good 25 minute walk from the hotel, or a few stops on the Metro. Likewise the Gaudi architecture is a similar distance away.
The rooms are modern, clean and fairly spacious, but the beds are rock hard. Housekeeping service seemed very efficient, with rooms made up in a timely fashion. Breakfast had a good choice, but the restaurant does have a bit of a noisy cafeteria feel to it. However there does appear to be plenty of seating - no queues for tables on any of the days we were there.The reception staff are generally very helpful.
Our main gripe was the pool area. During the evening they set up a bar on the rooftop pool area, which is very useful. However, during the day, you need to call room service to order any drinks. Okay, that's acceptable, but the length of time, and number of phone calls needed to get drinks was ridiculous. In three days, we never managed to get served in less than 25 minutes and two phone calls. The worst time was an hour, including being told that the drinks were on the way in one minute, whilst concurrently having a conversation with a manager for at least 5 minutes, during which time the drinks still did not arrive.
Also, no food service is available at all, so don't count on staying all day. The final straw was when we went to get an early lunch, left our towels on the beds, and returned to find them GONE.
When we returned, beds had been straightened, suggesting some staff had been up there tidying. We asked the spa staff just down the stairs if they had cleared them to make way for others, and she said they hadn't. There were no other guests using the area at the time of us leaving, or returning, so they were actually stolen. Pretty poor in a four star hotel.
There is quite a large shaded area, should you require it, but there are no sunbeds in it, and obviously the sunbed numbers and space are limited being a roof top. Some umbrellas would be useful. The pool area does get busy during the afternoon, so more beds could be accommodated, and would be welcome. If you are a sun lover, the pool area is great, as it stays sunny until around 7.30 pm on the area where the beds are positioned.",4,2012,07,09
47,unsafe!!,"Hotel and area around it feels  very unsafe specially at night.  The hotel doors  remain wide open and  it does not have even a single security guard, so that many shady characters roam the lobby. My bag with a laptop, iPad  and documents was stolen (from my side) within 5 minutes of getting to the hotel, while I was checking in.   Sadly,  I can't recommend Barcelona these days. If you visit, avoid headaches by staying away from Plaza Espania. If you are attending a congress and must stay around this area, definitely don't stay at this hotel if you value your safety. Go to the Ayre Hotel Gran Via, down the road",1,2012,07,07

47,Amazing service & location,"I have to admit the Catalonia Barcelona Plaza turned our trip around and made a negative experience into something amazing.  We had originally booked at the H10 Catalunya Hotel around the corner and had one of the worst experiences & room products ever.  So we checked out of their & the team at Catalonia Barcelona Plaza Hotel where very welcoming.

Lenin at the Front Desk is a super star who took such great care of us and was very pleasant to deal with.  The location is fantastic & the rooms where absolutely amazing.  The hotel has so much charm and character & just unbelievable staff.  Thank you for making our Barcelona trip great.",5,2012,06,28

Excellent reception sevices , and really receptive to all my requests!!!",5,2012,06,27
47,Something Fundamental Missing,"While most reviewers here have talked about the location  and overall sense of satisfaction, there was something very disconcerting during the course of my stay. Soon after I checked in at around 10 pm, I turned in to catch a good night's rest. And as I lay down, I heard all kinds of creaks and a complete wobbly experience. I looked beneath and found a joke of a bed - downright cheap and rickety, a mattress so poorly fitted out, sagging and with springs playing music.. A hotel's fundamental product is a room for people to sleep in unless you consider a resort or a special theme hotel where other aspects come in. Else the most rudimentary aspects is a good bed. SInce this seems to be of least concern for the hotel, I am presuming that there is very little appreciation of what a guest ought to deserve. Sure the decor of the hotel is very tired but I wont blame them as a revamp costs money but to provide good quality beds, it does not take much other than a discerning management and their focus on clients. 

Well now that you understand the main grudge and I hope they set this right in every room before the end of this summer, onto other things: Breakfast quite adequate and with good variety, front desk not very organised but they do make an effort. Overall cleanliness good. I always reserve a compliment for all hotels who offer free wifi and so here's a star for that. In today's age if you charge for internet you are simply out of tune as that's almost akin to charging me additionally for water or electricity. Hope you get a picture of what to consider when you consider this as the place to stay. Hope some one is listening",3,2012,06,27
47,"Well located and clean, but have dinner elsewhere!","I was there last week for business purposes. Obviously, this hotel is well located and close to many nice places to visit. Good spacious and clean room and bathroom. Good wifi connection.
The only (big) disapointment was my in-room dinner: the worst club sandwitch ever! I can hardly figure out how they can make it taste so bad.
Oh, last but not leat: only two staff at the welcome desk at busy times, it's really not efficient and engaging.",3,2012,06,26

The only negative was the thin walls and very noisy plumbing. Overall a very nice stay.",4,2012,06,17
47,"great service, great views",The hotel is very happily situated in Placa Espana with easy access to the airport and train stations. I was among the lucky ones with a great view over Placa Espana and fountain lane all way up to the MNAC. The room was cozy but in need of some small renovations. The service is excellent from reception to the SPA everybody was agreeable and obliging. The breakfast was not the best however and the self service even for coffee is annoying especially if you travel alone.,4,2012,06,15

47,Good Location close to the fair,"The hotel is located in walking distance to the fair and the airport shuttle just stops in front of the hotel. I would rate the hotel at 3 stars instead of the 4 stars they carry. Reason: could get some renovation. Breakfast room is noisy and crowded, full self service during breakfast including coffee. you might have to queue for a coffee. we booked a meeting room for a business meeting. the room was below ground level and had no windows.",3,2012,05,25
47,Stay safe !!,"To be fair there is nothing wrong in the hotel as such only that it can be quite unsafe outside the hotel in the evenings. I stayed here for last 4 days for our business conference and three in our team either lost their bag inside the lobby, were robbed on street next to it or were conned guy some guys acting as police officers. If you can manage to stay safe then it is a nice place to stay as its located on Pl. Espanya which is quote beautiful and one can hop onto the touristic bus from this place.
The spread for breakfast can improve a bit otherwise the hotel is a nice place to stay.",3,2012,05,12
47,"Nice breakfast, shame about the smell","The hotel was nice, the choice of food was excellent, however the smell of sewerage in my bathroom was unbearable at times. The room was however well furnished, modern and of a good size. The bed was comfortable and there was an extra blanket if needed. The shower was a power shower and the bathroom was clean... it was just the smell :(",4,2012,05,04
47,"Uncomfortable bed, hot rooms","The location is fine, though we enjoyed L'Eixample and La Rambla area much more because of the nicer restaurants and more sights within walking distance. The bed was so hard and uncomfortable. Also, although it is advertised as having air conditioning, they did not have it on because they said it was off season (it was in May and warm). It was really hot in the room, and only a small part of the window actually opened which was not enough to cool off the room. The area is really noisy all night so with the window open it was hard to sleep. And with the curtain pulled back to let in as much air as possible, the street lights shone into the room all night. I would not stay here again and don't think it is worth the price fir the location.",2,2012,05,02

Metro station is right in front of the hotel entrance
So there is direct metro line to Camp Nou
It's unbelievable view from pool on the roof
Magic fountains in front of you!
The pool is small, but nice
The rooms are clean with modern furniture
Some rooms with new LCD TV and some of them with old models
But who cares…
There some pretty café in the Mall, near the hotel
I recommend bar called Frankfurt behind the hotel
There are very good prices, great beer and many, many sausages
The breakfast is good, but no vegetables and cream cheese
WI-FI is for free, but safe in the room will cost you 5 Euro per night
The stuff are very helpful

47,A dirty towel was ruined my trip,"The hotel is at good location in Barcelona. It is very central and metro is so close to the hotel. 
In the hotel, when I tried to use bathroom towel, I noticed some blood debris on the towel. Since I had to be hurry, I couldnt report this to the hotel management. However, It is still disgusting when I think this. I couldnt imagine this in such a big and touristic hotel.  
An hotel could be well-looking and its location might be perfect. However, this little detail swapped the all good things about this hotel. 
Healthy environment must be the most important aspect for an hotel beyond the other attractive features.",4,2012,04,23

47,Great Location,"I spent 2 nights in this hotel recently, it is decent however I would certainly not rate it 4 star. The hotel itself is very simple, it seems to be an old hotel, but relatively well maintained, the rooms are extremely small, so don't expect much in terms of spacious, however our room did have a rather nice little balcony. Just to be a little picky the floor could really have used a vacuum, besides that it was clean. The best thing about this hotel is that it is in a perfect location, very close to the big shopping mall, and to the plaza. I do recommend this hotel but be sure not to expect luxury.",4,2012,04,19
47,Great Hotel,"Location is the best thing about this hotel. You're right in front of the subway station and Plaza de España.Rooms are not so spacious (for triple room) but clean rooms with good breakfast. We did not use all the services of the hotel but overall we were satisfied with the hotel.

47,Always a communist-like hotel in the 21th century,"Nothing changed after my previous evaluation three years ago. My impression last March was still the same: I had the feeling to be in Moscow rather than in a Mediteranean city.  I still did not like the wooden-floor throughout the corridors and the rooms. It makes this hotel noisy and old-fashioned. The breakfast area is like a large railway station hall... In a few words, it is not a romantic hotel at all. OK for business because of the very closed metropolitan station and the bus stop for the airport.",2,2012,04,07
47,The most terriable I've ever stayed,"No heater, No refrig, No wine opener......
I can believe that they can get a 360 euro a day....

the best location - very close to the starting line. there`s a shopping mall just when you cross the street and on the other street the Metro which was also great to tour the city. the hotel is very clean and it`s staff is very very good and helpful. I would like espacialy to recommand Anna and Amy that gave a great personal service and they are human asset to the hotel !!!
The breakfast was very poor but that`s probably cause of the known Israeli breakfast we`re used to here... there wasn`t any salad or vegetables served but I must add that Amy and Anna took care of it personaly to our satisfaction.
The Jym is also very shabby and I think it`s better if they don`t advertise they have one.
The pool was closed and seemed like it has been during renovation and we were disappointed cause it was the begining of the season....
great value of money ! Merav",4,2012,04,03
47,Quite good.,"The rooms are very hot and the air condition is not working in the hotel. If you open a window, it is very noizy.",4,2012,03,30
47,Good location but I'm going to whinge about the hotel,"The location is good because both the Aerobus to the airport and a tax rank are right outside the doors of the hotel. Across the road is the Arenas Mall with a food hall on the lower level and a viewing platform and restaurants on the roof top. It's close to Montjuic too where MNAC (National Art Gallery) and the Olympic Stadium is. For those of you who don't enjoy walking up steps (like yours truly) be warned; the escalators only take you up part of the way but the views great.

The two things that I found annoying:

*The aircon only does heat. There is a window though which cools the room down after a while. This wasn't so bad but I'd definitely avoid this place in the summer.
*I had to ask for my bed sheets to be changed. 
*On the third night of my stay there was an event in the breakfast hall that went till 1am which was annoying. My room looked out over the atrium of this area so I got to hear the emcee making his announcements followed by rounds of applause. 

Again, great location but I think I'd stay somewhere different the next time I visit.",4,2012,03,30
47,"fantastic, Great staff",we have been to barcelona quite a few times and love it. The hotel and staff were great and very welcoming. I would recomend them to anyone :),5,2012,03,27
47,Great location for Marathon,"We recently stayed at this hotel for the barcelona marathon and it is the perfect location for this event. You walk out the front door and are virtually at the event start/finish!

Being in Place Espagna is a pretty good spot for the rest of barcelona also as it is a great city for walking around in. Having said that, it is a fair walking distance to places such as Las Ramblas, the port/beach area, Segrada di Familia, etc. fortunately we had great weather so it was excellent for all the walking! Easay to also get taxis or the metro.

The hotel itself was fine - we had a renovated room on the 3rd floor with reasonable view of place espagna.  ""Wood"" flooring, suficient space, good bathroom, double bed not the best but still ok.  Housekeeping was very good.

Two things that were not great was firstly the lack of AC which meant the rooms were really hot (seriously ridiculous, felt like the heating was on!!) - prolem also being that it was essential  to open the window which made it incredibly noisy. 

Second issue which was not as bad as the first was that the hotel has free wifi (which is very good, thank you!), however, it does not always work and we had one full day where it did not work at all.

Staff were all really friendly except one woman in reception who was surprisingly rude compared to all the other very helpful and polite staff.

Easy to get to/from airport - we got taxis both ways (about 16 euro each trip), the airport bus also apparently stops close to the hotel.

Would definitely recommend this hotel if in Barcelona for the marathon and also fine even if just there on holiday (it does have a pool on the roof which was closed when we stayed there but this would be a bonus in the summer!). 

Didn't use the spa. Gym is tiny with just a few peices of equipment.",3,2012,03,27
47,"Great location, Great accessibility, good service!","Brilliantly located in Placa Espanya, without a stone's throw to Montjuic!  

Aerobus A1 and A2 departs to the airport right at the door step of this hotel.  Right beside Arena Barcelona (shopping centre) which houses a cinema, boutiques, restaurants and the famous Amorino gelato!

Stayed in the standard room for one night.  Spacious even with a Queen-sized bed.  WiFi connection was strong and consistent.  Major downside is the air-conditioning! Read from previous reviews that the hotel does not turn on the air condition during winter time.  Proven right at night and had to leave a window opened!  

Service staff were very helpful.  They housed my luggage when I went to Paris for 3 days.  always smiling and ready to serve!",4,2012,02,21
47,Expensive but great treat,"Rooms are grand and great views of the music fountain poitioned right at the end of las rambalas .

Parking is not cheap in the hotel Carlton park .

",5,2012,02,12
47,"Great location, good hotel","Great location, tourist bus and airport bus stops right outside. Staff were friendly and helpful. Room was clean, had a room on top floor and the views were spectacular. This is probably one of the ugliest hotels I have ever seen, however once inside it ticked the boxes. Breakfast was usual buffet but fresh and good selection.
Only problem was, room was too warm, no aircon on in January and we were fortunate to have amazing weather for January (short sleeves and meals outside!) although once windows left open for a while, it was fine.
Found it to be very good value but it was January, I guess more later in the year. 
For a reasonably priced weekend break it did the job",4,2012,01,25
47,Great location and service but...,"...the room is terribly hot during the summer because the air-con is just not powerful enough to cool down the room. Otherwise the room could do a bit of renovation.

Location wise, it is well located on the Plaça Espanya, Montjuic is just next door, and the center of Barcelona is reachable by taxis, buses or TMB subways. The most interesting part of this hotel is that the Aerobus (shuttle bus) to Barcelona Airport stops right in front of the hotel.

In spite of the deficiency in the hotel comfort and decorations, I find the staff at the reception very courteous and efficient. Hotel security is good. El-Al pilots and cabin crew stay at this hotel when they transit in Barcelona.",3,2012,01,09
47,"Great Location, Comfortable Hotel",This hotel was excellently located in the Plaza Espana and there was a metro station right in front of the hotel.  The service was okay but could have been better since you always seemed to have to wait in line to get your questions answered and they never answered the phone when you called downstairs.  The breakfast was really good and had a wide variety of choices.  The bed was okay but I have had more comfortable.  The location was probably the best feature of this hotel.,4,2011,12,29
47,"Great location, and hotel",We went there to spend a weekend in Barcelona. We were very well  located and atended. There was a latín show too at night that turned out to be a fantastic experience. It is a great hotel in a great city,5,2011,12,28
47,Service lets it down,"I was working in Barcelona as I do every month and wanted to try this hotel out. My wife was coming out for the weekend. I'm in fact sat in the room bathed in sweat as I write.

I'd booked a Premium room which was a standard room which was refurbished and had some extras like tea / coffee making facilities, water, biscuits, dressing gown and slippers. When we checked in non of these were in the room. I informed reception and said that it was okay as we were popping out they could sort in the meantime. Two hours later, returned and nothing could be done. The girl I had asked before, let's call her sullen Melanie, refused to talk to me and a chap politely said he wold sort it, he'd have to tell house keeping. I asked if they hadnt already been told, why would they be? Because I spoke to you two hours ago.... Okay... It would've fixed immediately.  Meantime in the room, the airconditioning only blows out warm air so now ( the claim here is that they turn off the airconditioning facility in winter). The advertised soundproofing is now pointless as we have to have the windows open.  Firstly, the dressing gowns turn up.... Looking good.. Then the water and cookies turn up... Hopeful. Then a kettle turns up with one sachet of coffee and one tea bag... No milk... Back to reception... Ten minutes later I have two sachets of coffeeno milk. If I want to have milk I have to ring room service... Anyway, went out for the evening, sweated our way through the night and the next day went into the city. On return, the bed is made but no coffee, tea, fresh water, biscuits.. Can I be bothered complaining any more? No, I will never return and advise other travellers to do the same. ",2,2011,12,17
47,Thief,The house-keeper lady is a thief. My friend's and my moneys were taken from our bags whilst were not in our rooms during the day.,3,2011,12,11
47,Only for the price,"I stayed in this hotel for more than a week. There are good and bad things to say about it: 

Good:
- location is ideal, a metro station just outside main entrance, Aerobus station a stone's throw away
- rooms with view of Plaza Espana is splendid
- wifi available, very good
- i like the hard bed
- there is a mall beside which has many restaurants/cafes (but not much fashion stores)
- there are lots of convenience stores within walking distance so easy to buy bottled water and other necessities
- lots of pharmacies within the area, too
- food in hotel restaurant can be good if you order the right dish
- three ladies in Reception excel in their job (Noela, Linda and Lucy). They are friendly and service-minded.
- convention group very efficient esp Gina and Miguel
- Julio of snack bar/restaurant very service-oriented and friendly
- one of the best breakfast omelettes i have tasted esp when made by the filipina lady

Bad:
- I saw a cockroach in my bathroom
- rooms are quite dated, as other reviewers mentioned
- no aircon, i had to sleep with window open, which of course is noisy because it is in a busy part of the city
-  very long queues in the breakfast area (often very crowded) 
- in my 9-day stay, i only saw 1 bell boy. so if you are in a hurry to get your bags down, it will be better to drag it along with you by yourself.
- no boiling kettle in the room (when I was badly in need of hot water in thermos, I needed to beg room service). in fact, in 3 out of 6 requests, no thermos came.  
- one reception staff by the name of Sara treated me like a fool when I asked for help in asking the staff for hot water. I was completely voiceless and wrote in front of her my request, she replied to me ""this is the reception, we don't have hot water here"". i was really surprised at the daffness that she did not realise that if i had voice, i would have ordered room service instead. why would i go down the room just to ask for help in reception? her colleagues have been helping me days before and she was the only one who did not only refuse to help but even replied to me like i'm stupid. she holds the record as being the most rude reception staff i have ever met and boy, i have met so many receptionists in my trips.   

overall, i think it deserves to be a 3-star hotel. will i stay there again? if i have limited budget, i will. but with all the internet sites nowadays, i think i can get a better quality hotel for same price we had (75EUR/night, rate for a conference group). if i am forced to because it is the official hotel for the conference, i can live with it. it is not that horrible, but definitely not positively memorable either.",3,2011,12,02
47,Great view over Plaza Espana,Very nice hotel perfectly located in Plaza de Espana. The view from the rooms is really nice (if you get the ones facing la Plaza). Hotel is quite new and the rooms are nicely furnished. The staff was friendly and helpful. A metro stop is just in front of the hotel.,5,2011,11,21
47,One of the best places to stay in Barcelona,"I went to stay in Catlonia Plaza on a Business trip for two days. My stay was so comfortable and facilities were so good that my business meeting went absolutely fantastic. The staff are just superb and provide an exceptional service.
 Alvaro checked me in ( very polite, efficient and absolutely helpful receptionist ) I told him I was looking for an upgrated room due to I was going to stay up working the all night. He upgrated me to an amazing corner room for 15euros/night overlooking ""Plaza Espana"".Room 451 ( If I'm not mistaken). Just perfect!
From all the hotels I have stayed in Barcelona this is the best one. 
I'm sharing pictures so you can see what I'm talking about.
It deserves 5 start rating!",5,2011,11,19
47,Catlonia Plaza one of the best in wetern europe with a superb view,"Great hotel, good food and fantsatic view and logistically convenient what else you need for the affordable price.",5,2011,11,18
47,It was a pleasure to spend a week at this hotel,"For me and my family was a pleasure to spend a week in this wonderful hotel. The peopel were very polite, the food was delicious. It is the cleanest hotel I have ever visited. The Catalonia Barcelona Plaza is very good located, right in downtown of Barcelona, near to all sights. We're planing to visit it again.",5,2011,11,15
47,Good choice for a conference at the Fira,"This is a very well placed hotel for the Fira de Barcelona. If you are looking for a city centre hotel then look elsewhere, because it takes about 30 minutes to walk to the city centre from here. That said, I have stayed here twice for conferences and it is somewhere that I would choose again. There is free wifi which is useful, and the staff are helpful. I have not used the spa here yet because I was too busy with the conference, but will report next time! Because this hotel is sited on one of Barcelona's busiest hub roundabouts, and directly above a metro station, quiet it's not. Go for a higher floor and a room that doesn't overlook the road. And if you are a non smoker, make sure you get a non smoking room because the others absolutely stink!",4,2011,11,13
47,Great views of Barcelona,"Big rooms, competitively priced for a 5 star hotel

Front Desk personnel super, metro entrance at front door, dozens of bus lines, too",5,2011,11,08
47,Strange Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel, as part of a group for (1) night in early October.
It was a ""strange experience"".  The room was OK but it was on the 3rd floor which had some serious water damage. Hallway wall paper was peeling + other signs of water damage + it smelled very musty.
We had a group dinner the evening that we checked in and very poor quality and selection of food. They had bread but no butter. So we asked for butter and a waiter brought our table of (8), (3) pats of butter? Also, they got mad when we wanted coffee.  Breakfast was 100% different and wonderful. This hotel is on an absolutely beautiful round-about with a beautiful fountain in the center.",3,2011,11,07
47,"Good location, room and srvice.",The hotel is well located next to a metro and has a great rooms and great breakfast. A bit of a noise that you hear from outside if you stay at low floors.,4,2011,11,04
47,FOUR STAR JOKE,"Our bed was hard as rock so I went down to the hotel desk and explained to the concierge my concern and he explained that he could not do anything for us except offer us another room. I asked whether this other room had the same bed and he replied that it did. I explained that there was no point changing rooms if the bed was the same but it seems that he had a problem understanding this and got pretty rude with me. He then spoke to his manager and suddenly a new mattress appeared at our room. As the old one left the room I noticed a huge big hole at the corner of it, as if mice had eaten through it. It was also old, badly stained and had this hole. There was also mold on the bathroom wall, all this astonished us considering that this was being advertised as a four star hotel like (pictures attached to prove it). The new mattress that was brought into our room was the same as the old one, hard as rock. So, again I went down to the desk and asked to speak to the manager. We explained that the hotel either give us our money back or else upgrade us. So, in the end they upgraded us to a private suite on the top floor, which I think would cost around $400/$500 a night in other real four star hotels, but this one again had the same hard bed, the furniture was from the seventies era and had  a broken chair. By then we were both tired and pissed off so we decided to stay put. The next day, Sunday, at 9.00 am we woke up to a racket that came from above our room. We soon discovered that he room above us was rented out as a church. They had their mics turned full to an unbearing sound. At first I asked politely for them to turn this annoying racket down but they just ignored me and so we called the front desk to complain but it persisted and that is when we packed our bags and decided to leave. I believe this hotel should compensate us for all these unpleasant experiences that we had. ADVICE: PLEASE DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL.",1,2011,11,03
47,fine lacklustre hotel,"We booked as location suited our needs. Basic room was pretty awful so we upgraded to a suite (+ 75 euros) . IT was the Clock Suite and  was spacious with the bedroom up on a mezzanine. Bathrooms small and towels pretty thin. The furnishings were awful,  circa 1980s but bed was comfortable . There was no complimentary water or cookies , we just took from the minibar. 
Next time I would take more time to research a hotel  as this is certainly not somewhere I would want to stay again.",3,2011,10,27

Beautiful dining room and luxurious",5,2011,10,24
47,One night starting are wonderful cruise,"I was there only one night but it was Saturday night and the plaza area was a buzz with people and the Catalonia Barcelona was no exeption.
My room was cool on that night(september 17,2011) 
The room was very clean and bathroom  was wonderful.
I will be back.",5,2011,10,21
47,Smoker's paradise!,"Not too bad a hotel but a little out of town if you  want to be near the main tourist areas like the shopping strips and ramblas.  also reasonably quite despite being on the main road, as we were in a room on the side of the hotel opposite to the bullfighting ring retail building. Our main gripe is that they put us in a smoking room after requesting a non-smoking room (well the room smelt of smoke and had an ashtray in it). They would not change our room, saying that the hotel was full and that there were no smoking rooms in any case, with the ashtray being provided 'as a bin'! It was only when we saw another lady request a room change and our suggestion that we have here's that we got an unseemly room.  Looking at their website, it says that smoking rooms are available, so it appears that the concierge lied to us.  Very off. he was somewhat rude and dismissive as well - not sure how people working in hospitality can have such a manner, which unfortunately does not seem to be so uncommon with concierge staff after numerous reviews on trip advisor... 
Also hotel keys would not work after 1 day and had to be reprogrammed. Bathroom and bedrooms doors would not close.
Can i also add that hotels that choose to use timber flooring in the rooms and corridors amaze me, as they they can be a real source of noise.",2,2011,10,16
47,Very pleased,"We stayed here for 4 nights in October 2011. The room was always clean and the hotel staff was very helpful. The breakfast buffet included a variety of breads, cheeses, meats and eggs. I only wish that there had been more vegetables. 
The hotel is right across the street from a shopping center with a large food court and a few nice restaurants on the top floor. The metro stop links to a few different lines and it was very easy to get around the city. We also did alot of walking to sites in the area - Pueblo Espanya, Montjuic Funicular etc.   
I would definetly recommend this hotel to my family and friends.",4,2011,10,15
47,good location but that`s all,"Stayed 3 nights in October 2011. First night discovered wash basin blocked, wardrobe door stuck and made excruciating noise when opened, electric socket hanging off the wall, peeling paint and broken door frame in bathroom.I reported these faults and a workman appeared in my room in late afternoon next day. He removed two handfuls of black gunge from blocked wash basin drain, using a plunger ,which sent a swirling mass of black gunge around the basin. He then spent 2 hours (approximately) fixing the wardrobe and the socket. I phoned down to reception to ask for someone to clean the was basin. No-one appeared. 20 minutes later I went down to reception to ask for a cleaner. I was told that the cleaner would not come immediately and, in any case, why was I in such a hurry?  I explained that the disgusting black gunge that had swirled round the basin was a health hazard and that I wanted the basin disinfected. Cleanliness and hygiene do not appear to be a priority at this hotel, althogh the cleaner did eventually appear and was finally persuaded to apply what appeared to be disinfectant.",3,2011,10,14
47,Ecxellent,"I have been in this wonderful hotel during 4 days and I like it very much! The view from the room is amazing! Big Shop Centre in the corner. Direct bus to the airport. Very easy to go to the city center and tourist pleaces in Barcelona. Big variety in the buffet. The staff in the reception was very helpful and patient with us.
Recommended to every one!",5,2011,10,13
47,Solid expo hotel,"I've stayed at the Catalonia Barcelona Plaza for two nights and paid €145 per night, which I think is alright. My stay was confortable and the hotel ok. It has all the facilities needed, in particular free Wifi. I didn't choose to take breakfast as it seemed pricy to me. The location is good if one is staying for a exposition around Plaza Espana, if not it takes a couple of min to get to the destination. From the hotel to the main centre around Ramblas it takes about 15 minutes by underground, about 30 minutes by foot and about 15 minutes by (rental) bike. When I was there it was the city celebration of MERCE, which was a bit annoying as there were concerts until 3am, hence noisy! But I reckon if its not party time the hotel rooms should be calm.

Overall rating: Solid hotel to stay in particular for those looking for something close to all the expo places around placa espana",3,2011,10,13
47,"'Beware' very bad experience, not as committed on website","I booked a 'superior room' in this hotel via their own 'Catalonia' group website, which committed some standard facilites a little more than their normal double room. These included: bottle of water & oreo cookies free, tea and coffee making facilities apart from other services. On reaching the hotel there was no one to help with the bags as I got off the taxi in front of the hotel entrance, the reception lady took the entire payment right at the time of check in through my credit card. Asked me to wait fve minutes for the only single bell bot that they have. On reaching room the aircondition was not working, there was no water bottle nor cookies, nor any tea coffee making facilities. Repeatedly I had to call reception, there is no 'house keeping number to call' the 'room service' lady who answers your phone does not understnd english. After a long while a mechanic came who after some tinkering was able to start the airconditioning but said temperature control has gone bad and will not work. On knowing this as it would make the room too cold if the temperature thermostat does not work, I again asked the reception, which offered to change my room but to one which did not have the plaza view, as I had laready unpacked all my stuff, and as I had a conference to attend, I asked if I continue in this room will they get the thermostat repaired or replaced the next day, and they said yes they would do so positively the next day when i am out of the room. All these things wasted so much of my time that I just couldn't go for the conference on this day. Nothing was done about the temperature control the next day or even the day after, every night I am freezing to death till I wake up in the middle of the night to shut the aircondition off. The recption is again reminded but seems totally unconcerned. To my amazement the reception refused to agree to the fact that they had to provide tea coffee making tray in the room as is clearly mentioned on their booking website ( you can check:  http://www.hoteles-catalonia.com/en/our_hotels/europa/spain/catalunya/barcelona/hotel_catalonia_barcelona_plaza/index.jsp?cmp=tcm:42-4948&seccion=habitaciones ). On repeated argument after a long time the man on the reception said, that yes it was mentioned on the website but it was wrong!!!! but still they will send the tea making tray and that they send the water and cookies after the client arrives. Well I took it to be settled. To my amazement the next day my room was cleaned but no water bottle or cookies were replaced. I asked the recption (they are the only ones who speak english) they said call room service and therafter a water bottle came, cookies were still no where to be seen. When I searched in the tea coffee tray there was no milk powder satchet or liquid, on calling room service again they brought milk in a milk dispenser!! (without cover). I was very surprised at the standard of service. In any case I could not keep that milk for long and so I decided to have tea without milk!!. Today is the third day I am at this hotel, today when I came back from the conference, to my utter surprise I find no water bottle or cookies replaced and the tea coffee tray gone!!  On asking the recption says tea coffee facility was only for the first day (which is not true, their website says and we all know that tea coffee making facilities are not a 'welcome drink' but a continuous facility in the room for which we are paying superior room charges every day!). On the first night I reaqlised I had forgotten mthe electrical adapter for plugging in my laptop as the plug system here is different from my own country, I was asked to come down to reception, I waited for an hour at the recpetion without anybody helping and fianlly had to go and search for it outside, which I did with great difficulty as I dont speak spanish. I am amazed at how easily the hotel staff speaks whatever it likes, and is cheeky enough to dupe clients, is the management not concerned and just allowing all this to go on and on. I have emailed to their central office, but am quite shocked & surpirised with all this. Also note the minibar cupboard cover is broken and hangs, bathroom door gets stuck on the floor and doesn't open fully, wardrobe doors are stuck and are very difficult to move. This is not what one expects from a hotel where you pay so much!!!",2,2011,09,22
47,overpriced lack lustre 4 star hotel,"Had to stay at this hotel for a week whilst attending a conference (unfortunately the only one available for the time in the vicinity) & was extremely disappointed. Didn't compare at all favourably to another similar priced well located 4star hotel in barcelona that my husband & I went to after the conference & another in Madrid that we stayed at on this trip. Avoid the breakfast - overpriced & in a large characterless room reminiscent of school & hospital cafetarias. Room was slightly grubby & poorly maintained - TV initially didnt work; promised repair the next day didnt happen without additional reminder & TV reception  was appalling. Window handle on verge of coming off. Some mould on bathroom tile grouting. Had to pay 5 euros for inroom safe deposit. Seemed to have  bus tour groups staying regularly - perhaps that is how they get away with being mediocre as most stay only 1-2 nights. Would not stay here again or recommend to anyone. The only thing it has going for it is the location - very handy to all transport, Arenas shopping centre, fountains, MNAC & Montjuic.",1,2011,09,21
47,"Nice hotel, better than expected given the reviews","Sure this 4 star hotel has older bathrooms, a perhaps dated pool area, and lacks the amenities of a true 4 star hotel, but the price does not reflect a 4 star hotel either (I paid 135 Euros).  The metro is literally outside the door and the aerobus is directly across the street for EASY airport transportation.  There are nice cafes nearby and a mall directly below.  Also great views and free Internet.  My first 3 nights in Barcelona I stayed at the Eurpark Hotel and the last night at this hotel.  I much preferred this hotel given the view, pool, and location.  If I make it back to Barcelona, I would definitely stay here.",4,2011,09,12
47,PERFECT HOTEL FOR BUSINESS,"The hotel is in front of the Barcelona fair , the employees at the reception welcomed us with a big smile that did not leave their faces until we left. The room is very confortable with nice views , service is great and a very good breakfast buffet. highly recomended.",5,2011,09,11
47,Not worthy for Asian,"Agreed on those comments with good location, friendly front desk and clean room. But comparing to old building (there was one title loosen at bathroom floor and insufficient airconditioning) with 4 star price not worthy, also there didn't provide water heater. It means to ask guests to drink tape water or to pay €2.5 for bottle water or €1.5 for kettle of hot water at bar.  Do u think it is a tricky way to earn money? For same price, there are lots of choice at same location. For those not like to drink tape water, u may consider my experience before consider this hotel. Last, the room can't stop outside noise from street and corridor.",2,2011,08,18
47,We enjoy a excelent hotel for our purpose,"The best thing about this hotel is his FANTASTIC location.For people who come to see Barcelona is ideal.Buses, metro station and a huge mall under your nose.Breakfast is excellent, we prefer to receive fresh tomatoes, cucumbers on the menu.The room is OK, clean witha fantastic view to Plaza Espagna. The Reception people speak English and like to help. Despite the fact that we stay in a room facing the all day noising Placa Espagna, we didn't hear it. As General Mc Arthur said :""I shall return""",5,2011,08,18

47,Great hotel for city break,"I have stayed in Barcelona many times, this hotel was very accessible from the airport - aerobus A1 or A2 stopped directly outside for €5 euro return.  A bit impersonal but you will be spending all of your time sightseeing or out having tapas!  Great location as near the Olympic village & Miro gallery, fantastic less visited area of Barcelona.  If you make it up here, search out the cactus gardens.  Very good size rooms, didn't eat there as meals expensive & not too many local cafes in vicinty - might have to wander back towards city centre for breakfast, would suggest go to Boqueria market for good start to the day!  Overall, would stay here again, but don't expect to be pampered",3,2011,08,09
47,much too expensive for its quality,"Negative: I got a room next to the airconditioning system or something. A continious noise kept me awake and my bed was even vibrating. The room smelled like cigarette smoke. My television was broke and it took only after three times complaining (the first two times politely, the last time less politely) I received a new tv. 
The sink didn't run through smoothly and the toilet didn't flush well. 
At check in, the service was friendly, at check out not even a goodbye. 
Positive: breakfast was good and plenty, free Wifi, connection to the Airport.",2,2011,08,09
47,LOVELY HOTEL,"We had the opportunity to spend 5 days and nights at the HOTEL CATALONIA BARCELONA PLAZA in Barcelona during a recent trip. The Hotel was clean and spotless, friendly,  The metro station is in front of the Hotel .
Have a pool, good service, quite ...  they give you what you ask for. They offer a personal service and a professional service. 
I would defently stay there again if I get the oportunity",5,2011,08,09
47,"Very good hotel, Great Location!!","We loved Barcelona Plaza!!!! A great location at the Espagna Plaza only 7 minutes to the centre of Barcelona!! There is a metro station just outside the Hotel. You can also use tax which is not expensive (eur 8,00) or if you like walking it's a 20 minutes walk. Very helpful and polite staff, breakfast fantastic!!!!! We were leaving in the morning and coming back in the afternoon to find a clean and cool room waiting for us!! The rooms were spacious and the floor was wooden which I liked very much. I would defenetely recommend this hotel to my friends and I would stay again anytime!!!!",5,2011,08,08
47,Worth staying here,"It is my second time in Barcelona and I will surely come to this hotel also the 3rd. Perfect location:you take aerobus (blue bus) from airport, you pay 5.30€ and after 15' your first stop is in Plaza Espanya, exactly opposite to the hotel. In front of the hotel is metro station (red and green line) and you can easily and quickly move throughout the town. It is 4 stops from plaza Cataluna (red line) which is Barcelona's hub of commerce. If you choose room with city view you will have a state of art when you wake up in front of your eyes. You have an amazing view that certainly worths every extra cent (in relation to inside rooms). You have free wireless internet (also in your room), many choices for breakfast near to hotel (prefer cafe-bars at the basement of the mall which is left to the hotel), a mall and supermarket (at the basement of the mall). Staff at reception really helpful and polite, clean and comfortable rooms and taxi outside  the hotel. What else do you need?!",4,2011,08,04
47,Perfect,"I chose this hotel based on its location right on Plaza Espanya, since I was in town for a concert on Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys, the Olympic Stadion, on Montjuic. Since I knew that public transportations would be closed (it was a weekday) when the concert would end I wanted a hotel within easy walking distance from the stadion. As a single female traveller I felt safe walking from the Olympic Stadion to the hotel after the show - this is very important to me!

The room on the sixth floor faced the inner yard which meant that it was very quiet no noise from the traffic outdoors for example. The room was also clean and spacious and therefore I am very pleased with my stay.

Local transportation is also excellent, I used the metro to get to both Ramblas and Sagrada Familia and the metro is in the immidiate area of the square where the hotel is situated. 

Another positive thing: The blue airport buses stay here - across the square when coming from the airport but perhaps even more important when you leave early as I did - right outside the hotel on the way to the airport.

I had breakfast in the hotel one of the mornings and the selection of foods are very good and all in all it is a very nice breakfast. It is very pricey though and if I were staying longer I'm not sure I would eat there every morning perhaps just some of the mornings. There is a shopping centre right next to the hotel where you can find a store that sells sandwhiches for example to take away that are rather cheap.

All in all, this hotel fulfilled my expectations and I would consider returning again.",4,2011,07,29
47,"Thank God the city is rocking, otherwise the hotel would have pinched","No doubt, great location, right opposite Montjuic, metro station right at doorstep, bus stop next door and taxis always parked outside, and just unlike Ramblas street, which most prefer. Quite nice , not crowded, doesn't get on to your nerve. But the hotel, consecutive numbers does not mean adjoining rooms, the front office staff very curt, smile a mile away, pay for locker too, no electric kettle, just a place to sleep overnight. Breakfast - if eggs have finished, so what.",3,2011,07,26
47,"WONDERFUL, we will came back","Wonderful Hotel in front of the Montjuich fountains, the reception staff is very friendly and everything was perfect !!!! nice views !!!!!!!!!!!! high recomended for everybody
we loved it and we'll be back !!!!!!!!!!",5,2011,07,24
47,"Good location, but...","1.	Reception unpleasant
2.	Have to pay $5/day for in-room safe.  Hotel safe not available.
3.	No electric kettle or other means to make coffee/tea in room.
4.	Breakfast is $16
5.	Bathroom door broken
6.	Weak air conditioning",2,2011,07,17
47,excellent hotel - see you next time!!!,"we stay in the hotel for 3 nights.

pros: excellent location - 
                            metro station 20 meters from the hotel
                            on the spanish square.
                            the new mall just feets away
                            great view from the window
                            atmosphere...
cons: only one - we want king size bad and not 2 queen size.

the next time we go to barcellona - this is the hotel we will take!!

attached is the view from the window - this is the way to wake up in the morning...",5,2011,07,13
47,Request a Plaza View and Hope the Clerk's Mood is Better,"We stayed here as part of a tour package, and overall found it to be acceptable (the breakfast buffet was excellent! ) with a few areas of concern.  None of these concerns would cause me to not stay there again, but they seem worthy of mentioning to perspective guests. 

Busy Area: 
The hotel is located on a very busy plaza, but fortunately the hotel employs security people to watch the people coming into the hotel.  If you don't like hustle bustle right outside your hotel's entrance, avoid this hotel. On the other hand, the busy atmosphere made it a great place to catch taxis, and we found the busy sidewalks to be lively and interesting.  

Your Room's View: 
Our room was on the back of the hotel, and not on the plaza. Our room's window faced some apartment buildings, and one of them was in a completely blighted state.   We did not complain about our view, but just be advised that you may wish to request a view of the plaza.  Besides the view,  late at night a club opens up on the lower floor of that area behind the hotel, and  the noise of the club might prove bothersome to some people. 

Very Impatient Clerk: 
Sadly, there was one clerk at this hotel who was ruder than any other clerks we dealt  with during our entire stay in this beautiful country.  Her arrogant, impatient attitude was offensive. She seemed intolerant and dismissive  of  our use of Spanish (I guess she only wanted to use Catalan or English?), and wanted to use English.  Thus we switched to English.  Unfortunately, she did not  understand English vocabulary  (""grocery store"")  so we were forced to use Spanish with her again.  Communication with customers should never be a battle or contest of skills, especially when one works in a service capacity. 

On a positive note, the other two desk clerks were very polite, helpful and kind.",3,2011,07,06
47,"Fantastic view from a fabulous, modern room!","I did a lot of research when choosing a Barcelona hotel.  We were arriving by ferry and leaving by cruise ship so I wanted to be somewhat near the port, but not in a bad neighborhood.  I also didn't want to spend a ridiculous amount for our three-day stay.  This hotel's location on Plaza Espana was perfect.  We had a view of the plaza and the fountains beyond from our ultra-modern room.  The bed was comfortable, the bathtub was deep, the wireless was free, and the extra amenities (bathrobes, bottled water in a real glass bottle, and cookies--Oreos!) were a nice touch.  There was ample security in the lobby, and we felt safe day and night.  The metro is just outside the door.   We would definitely stay here again.",5,2011,07,04
47,Good Hotel - except...,"My daughter anbd I stayed at the hotel for 4 nights last week. Nice hotel, nice rooms - very clean - great breakfast - great location - except... the front desk staff were very nice but except for checking us in and out couldnt really help us with anything else. When I asked one of the girls to make a dinner reservation for me at a restaurant because I dont speak Spanish and NO ONE in Spain seems to speak a word of English, she agreed but made a face - isnt that what they are there for! Every question we asked about how to get places they didnt know or we were given misinformation. We asked to receive a map and were told that the hotel doesnt give maps and we can buy one outside. Even the late check out we ordered got messed up by them .",3,2011,06,13
47,Billing disaster!,"I stayed at this hotel for a few nights in May 2011, while my hotel stay pleasant overall and the location is quite good. The hotel is still holding my booking deposit almost 3 weeks after checking out despite my numerous telephone and email follow ups with the hotel staff concerned, yet unbelievably nothing has been done yet. 

This terrible experience and lack of professionalism will certainly make me stay away in the future.",2,2011,06,09
47,Nice hotel bad restaurant service,"We are staying there now.The hotel is located in a convinient location near the metro. Rooms are clean. Hotel stuff is polite and helpfull. The snack bar is awfull and the stuff doesn't care the food is horrible, we ordered pasta and connalony it tasted horible we couldn't eat it. The waiter didn't even ask if anything is wrong when after just a few minuts we wanted to pay and leave.",3,2011,06,07
47,"fantastic staff, location and quality","This is SO accessible from airport when you arrive  - blue airport bus stops right outside. Location for all sight seeing  great as metro stop right outside hotel. 
Staff really helpful and friendly. Room was clean and spacious. Breakfast was fantastic.
Great choice!",5,2011,06,06
47,it couldn't be better !,"fantastic hotel and such pleasant very helpfull staff.
my boyfriend and I went for a quiet relaxing break,
this was the place.....
hotel was everything the brochure said would be, special thanks to EVERY SINGLE MEMBER OF THE SATFF , they couldn't do enough to help. Magic breakfast and lovely Restaurant.",5,2011,05,31
47,Pleasant place to stay.,"My son and I were there and we each had a very clean room. We had inside rooms and they were very quiet and comfortable.  The reception desk clerks were very polite and helpful.  As said repeatedly, right next to the Metro which is a clean and efficient and amazing service. 

Previously I stayed very near  to LaRambla which was closer to most attractions but as the Metro was so efficient, the location of this hotel  was not a handicap and we could walk to attractions at Montjuic.",5,2011,05,10
47,"Good on the big stuff, fail on the small stuff","Stayed in room 628 between 19-23 of April

The good:
1. hotel is located 10 meters from the underground, though it is not on the ramblas.
2. room size - our room was very big (we needed it because of our 2 years old toddler, so she can run inside the room).

The bad:
1. breakfast staff service is horrible (see stories 1-3).
2. room had several defects: (room was noisy where the noise was coming from the hotel, the water flow in the bathroom wasn't good, the sink seemed to be clogged, the mirror in the entrance was broken).
3. everything cost money : internet, a key to the room safe (5 euros per day)

was OK:
1. breakfast itself.
2. information service was fine.

Story 1:
I wanted to get regular (not cold) water for my baby. Some stuff member gave me a bottle, so I can pure water to the a glass and place the bottle near the other bottles. Another stuff member thought that I took the bottle, and yelled at me that I shouldn't do that (like I was thinking to steal a bottle).

Story 2:
while having breakfast, 10 meters from us, a woman in her 20th dropped the small box with all the sugar bags, spreading the bags all over the place. 3 staff members were in radius of 5-10 meters and none of them offer help.

Story 3:
One day, we wanted a seat for our infant, and for 5 minutes we couldn't find any member to help us.",3,2011,04,24
47,We've been robbed and noone gave a damn!!,"We've been robbed INSIDE the hotel ten minutes before leaving with our group for the airport. Someone took my wife’s handbag, in which she had her wallet, mobile phone and our camera. Since we only had ten minutes before we leave there was not much time for doing anything. We informed our tourist guide and then we phoned and canceled the debit card (which was inside the wallet) and the mobile phone number. The theft was declared at the airport. During these ten minutes before leaving for the airport two more members from the group were robbed. The hotel staff DID NOTHING. They didn’t even ask sorry for the incident.  Also the security was absent and the emergency doors were left open, while they were supposed to be closed. Maybe this is how the thieves got away that easily. Maybe they were working together with some members from the hotel staff, who knows. One thing is sure: This definitely should not happen in a four stars hotel!! They should be more responsible and more helpful. And they should also try to learn some English, because we are not Spanish (we are from Greece) and we have no obligation to learn Spanish or catalan language just to visit Barcelona for 4 days! Otherwise maybe they should do some other business.",2,2011,04,22
47,unhelpful staff,"I was a group leader of a school group of 20 students. The quality of the rooms was standard, but the restaurant staff was rude and unfriendly. I asked for an espresso coffee for breakfast and the answer was: you want coffee you go to the coffee shop!!!; A simple sorry but we don't serve espresso for breakfast would have been enough. Also, on another day at dinner the head waiter turned two students away and told them that they were not allowed to eat because they were 10 minutes late. The dinner for our group was from 8 to 9. However nobody had informed us about that.",3,2011,04,20
47,"great location, 4 stations on metro from plaza catalonya-recomended!!!","trip fpr couples very nice, allot to shop around the catalunya plaza (4 stops at metro from the plaza espanya nest to the hotel), nice pakistan resturant on the right side of the hotel, opens till late. clean rooms, cozyly, very nice and good hotel breakfast, very friendly staff.e
allot to see and to shop, very recomended city :)",5,2011,04,20
47,Amazing service!!!,"The hotel is locate in Espania square , right in front of the famous magic fountain of Barcelona. If you have a window with a view to the palace, you can see the fountain directly from your room!
me and my friend had a room with this overlooking and we were amazed!

The service in this hotel was unbelievable! The people at the reception were so nice and kind. they answered about all our question and always tried to help us.

I have to say that there is 2 lines of metro that passing really next to this hotel and it's really easy to travel like this!
the lines are: L1 and L3.

I will advice everyone I know who coming to Barcelona to stay in this Hotel!",5,2011,04,06
47,A great place to stay,"First timers to Barcelona and booked the hotel through our carrier as part of a package deal. From the exterior the hotel has a NY 1930's look about it. Inside, there is a large reception and lounge area leading to the restaurant, snack bar and piano bar, all to be recommended.  The room was standard size for a hotel of this type, comfortably furnished with fridge, safe (extra) and sat tv.  There was also a good bathroom/shower equipped with hairdryer.  The room was cleaned daily. Without exception all of the staff were at all times friendly, helpful and always polite even when translation wasn't always spot on.  All major tourist and travel routes were easily reached from the hotel. Would we go back? Definitely, but I would book an inside room as if you like a window open at night the traffic noise can be quite loud. Other than that a brilliant place to stay.",5,2011,03,26
47,"Very good staying, hotel staff helpful, good location","Hotel located 1min from the metro station ""espanya"", near the hotel you got good 
restaurants (paralel st'). 
Hotel is clean, staff are helpful when needed, rooms are clean, we had a room without any view, next time or if you are coming, ask for a room with a view to the Font Montjoic.
* Free WiFi- ask for their user name and password.
* Room safe - cost 5Eur per day, but you need to deposit 40Eur as Collateral.
In the hotel you got a spa if you like which seems to be good. We didn't got the time for that.
If we will come back again to Barcelona we would defiantly return to this hotel, and yes, if you were my friend or family i would recommend you this hotel when staying in Barcelona.",4,2011,03,26
47,good standard,Good location just by metro station. It was nice to swim in roof-pool.,4,2011,01,20
47,great place to stay,"good hotel,very good service - the snak bar was so good - a food there is amazing..but in breakfast bar were not  vegetables..but we very enjoyed to stay in this hotel!",4,2011,01,16
47,"Friendly Staff, terrific breakfast and very nice location","This hotel is very conviniently located by the Espania Metro station (literally 20 steps from the front door), infront of a beautiful Plaza Espania and the Monjuik mountain and palace. During the Summer, this is the exact place where the famous Barcelona fountains are streaming. The hotel's staff is friendly and kind. The room-service is quick and the food they provide is fresh, reasonably priced and tasty (used them twice during my stay). The most strongest point of this hotel is the breakfast, which isn't a ""continental"", but rather resort-style. I could easily pass all other daily meals after having this one. Free WiFi is also a strong plus, with an extraordinary reception wherever you need it.",5,2011,01,02
47,Very enjoyable stay,My colleagues and I were very pleased with the services. I especially liked the fact that everything was so clean and tidy. I'm coming back to Barcelona for New Year's Eve and i've already made reservations for me and my boyfriend...can't wait !!,5,2010,12,22
47,"Once again, a great experience","I have been in this hotel a few times already.
Last time I was part of a member of EIBTM group. Barcelona was busy  at this time although  we were greeted by very friendly staff, and felt that we had been welcomed by family from start to finish. They were so keen and efficient as well. 
In addition to this i would  like to mention its amazing location. 
I strongly recommend this hotel to  any one who is looking for relaxing time in a business urban environment.",5,2010,12,15
47,GREAT LOCATION- A BIT NOISY,"Came back today fron 4 nights stay at the hotel.We got 3 rooms at the 3rd floor'at the back of the hotel.Some noise came from the kitchen downstairs,and a lot of noise was made by groups of teenagers who were on shcool trips. breakfast was great 'the rooms allthough their size was a bit small 'were clean and comfortable.
The weather in the last days was nice but the heating was allways on and there was no way but to open the windows in order to cool the rooms...
Free WI-FI worked perfectly!!!",4,2010,12,12
47,bad expirience,"Maybe the worst hotel I have ever stayed, no way a four star hotel. OCT 2010.
1)  They gave us a room on the first floor looking nowhere (please look at the picture the view from the window). I asked for another room they said it is not possible. I asked to upgrade my room and move us to another room no matter the cost they said again that it is not possible. Every solution I was trying to get there was always a negative answer. The reception manager impolitely said << we can’t do anything>>. I believe he is there to solve problems not to deny everything.
2) The breakfast was not good (baddish) in an unpleasant place. 
3) The ventilating system in the bathroom was out of order, someone came to see it but they never fixed it up to have a drink at the end of the day. 
4) The staff was not friendly; they act like they are doing a favor to you when they serve. 
  The only good place was the piano bar; no one played piano at least the hours I visited, but is was a friendly place and the bartender the only person in the hotel who was polite.
It is the first time I am writing something such bad things about a hotel I visited.",1,2010,12,10
47,"Great Location, but not worth 4*","Stayed at this hotel in Nov/Dec as part of a group that attended the EIBTM. As I arrived a day earlier in Barcelona, I wanted to book the hotel a day earlier, but it was ridiculously expensive, so I booked an alternative hotel. A few days before my travel however, I checked again and the rate had dropped, so I decided to stay. Therefore always look out for last minute specials at the Catalonia Barcelona Plaza Hotel.
The staff were friendly, the room was clean and spacious, but nothing special. Unfortunately I don't think that it does deserve 4 stars, but would rather rate it a good 3 star property. The location is excellent though! Direct train connections to the Fira 2 and also good underground connections. The airport bus (Aerobus) stops right outside as well as the hop-on hop-off sightseeing bus. There are also a lot of little restaurants within walking distance.
The internet in the hotel though is extremely slow. Rather choose an alternative option straight away! Very frustrating for a business traveler.
I would stay here again, but definitely not at the same rate.",4,2010,12,08
47,Great hotel,"We are staying here right now. A great choice! A wonderful location, great rooms, very helpful stuff, a brilliant breakfast! Very highly recomended!!!",5,2010,11,17
47,"Very good hotel,worth the money",I stayed there last april and i was really satisfied.The rooms were clean and comfortable and the staff were discreet and really helpfull.A great advantage especially for tourists like myself was the metro station right in front of the hotel.The highlight of my staying was the breakfast!!!!A really big buffet with a great variety was the perfect start of the day.,5,2010,10,30
47,"Great location, superb breakfast, efficient but friendly staff","I stayed for 5 nights for the EC-TEL conference, with a corner room (528) that had good views of the city and Parc Joan Miro, at a conference rate of 100€ per night, including breakfast. The room was clean and reasonably spacious, with reasonable sound insulation, a good bathroom and a typically Spanish bed (firm but comfortable). Wi-fi reception very poor in my room (hence losing one star), but better in other locations, and free, which was a bonus.  The hotel is very busy, but once you get to the front desk the staff are helpful and friendly. Breakfast is on an industrial scale, but excellent for the price, with an extensive buffet that includes an omlette chef. One other bonus: Plaza España is on two metro lines, and the Airport Bus stops outside the front door ( it's the only stop between BCN and Plaza Catalonya).  I've stayed in posher 4-star hotels, but this was very good value for the price.  Tip: check out the calm and shady Parc Joan Miro.",5,2010,10,05
47,Great Location & Clean - Perfect for tourists,"This hotel is perfect for tourists.  It is in a great location.  It is clean, and has all the basics.  Although the staff at the reception were friendly, it helped that we had already done the research on where we want to go and where we want to eat.  The staff are usually busy during the day, and are not very helpful when it comes to selecting restaurants.  However, if you have the names of restaurants they will make the reservations for you.",4,2010,09,28
47,Decent hotel - but at a cost,"Mostly I was pleased with this hotel - the rooms were clean, the staff were friendly, the location is very central, the breakfast offered extensive (albeit ""standard"" options). They have a pool at the top of the building, which I unfortunately did not have the chance to try, but it looked great. A bit too small perhaps for swimming execises, but great for having fun in the water. Moreover, there is a spa also located at the top floor.

The Internet connection was for free, but was at times unstable. 

The downsides was the training room. It consisted only of a bike, a threadmill and a leg extension and chest machine. No barbells nor dumbells.

Moreover, I found the hotel a bit ""unpersonal"" - the lobby is so big you will never get to say hello to the receptionist. The dining room is so large you usually also avoid all contact with the staff. No chatting or talking to the staff - so many persons were working there that I found this impossible. Maybe this is what most business people ask for - not to be bothered - but personally I prefer a smaller hotel where I can chat a bit with the locals and maybe get some tip on where to go and what to see. The hotel is built so that all gets down to strictly business. 

The last thing that annoyed me was that you had to pay $5 per night to keep a hotel safe. Honestly I would have expected this to be free with the fee I paid. I find it difficult to manage without a safe in Barcelona where theft is commonplace.",4,2010,09,16
47,Barcelona Plaza - Nice Stay,"We (wife, 13 yr old son and myself) stayed at the Catalonia Barcelona Plaza for four nights from Aug 22-26. We were very, very satisfied with our stay. The hotel was conveniently located (Plaza Espana) and on major metro and bus lines (also was first stop in and last stop out of Barcelona for convenient and swift airport bus). We are happy we did not stay on Rambla due to quiet and space here and short ride to there. We took a triple room due to having son with us...room was clean and good size - but none of the triples have views (unless the courtyard is you idea of a view). Staff was pleasant, helpful and knowledgable. We wanted wireless and a pool - and hotel had both. Former worked well and latter was a very nice addition...particularly due to very warm and humid weather we experienced. One caveat about pool - it is 2 meters deep at all points.....which can be a problem if one has smaller children. One thing that the hotel must work on is the beds....they are not very comfortable....But, overall would highly recommend hotel and return to it if I were to go to Barcelona again",5,2010,09,12

47,Excellent location,"We recently stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in two triple rooms.  The rooms were spacious and clean but the one room was in need of some repairs to its furniture and had no television.  I called the front desk the first day and they told me they would look into it.  This went on everyday for the four days that we were there.  Upon checking out I expressed my dissapointment with the TV matter and all I got as a response was ""so sorry"".  Other than that, the hotel is in a very good location with the metro station, bus stops and taxi stations right outside the front door.  The breakfast buffet is very good and plentiful.",4,2010,08,18
47,Room with a view,"Architecturally not the best looking of buildings, but once inside its very impressive and grand. The staff were very polite and smartly dressed.

The room was spacious and very clean, with a mini bar which was very reasonably priced. The bathroom was again, very clean and roomy. The view overlooked a Roman Amphitheatre/Arena.

The breakfast buffet consisted of a choice of everything you could possibly want, which stretched from one end of the large room to the other, very impressive. The quality of the food was very fresh, just found gaining the attention of the waitress was a little difficult at times for tea/coffee refills.

Guests of the hotel could enjoy a swimming pool on the roof, which was kept nice and clean. There were also some sun loungers to relax on. The view from the roof was just breathtaking.

The location of the hotel was really good, as it was not far from some of the main attractions such as the magic fountain of Montjuic which lights up every night and on the weekends the fountain moves to music, very impressive.",5,2010,08,15

The evening meals in the restaurant were satisfactory, the sports bar is expensive, but its standard for central Barcelona.Superb location for the Dancing fountains and museum.The aerport bus stop is directly outside the hotel.Be aware Barcelona plaza is diectly outside and its very busy with traffic.",4,2010,08,13

Great location of the hotel, everything very close, walking distance. Spaceous room and bathroom, great views. It was a pleasure to stay at your hotel and we will be back next year and bring our friends with us. Thank you for the wonderful experience.",5,2010,06,20
47,Well located and good value for money,"Very well located on Plaza Espanya which is a busy place.  The Magical Fountains are right opposite the hotel.  Also, the Metro station Espanya as well as the Barcelona Bus Turistic and City tour bus stops and the Aero Bus stop (for the airport) are all just outside the hotel.
Msot of the tourist places like Montjuic Park and La Rambla street are quite near from there and easily accessible by Metro.
The buffet breakfast at 11Euros is good value for money and very good!",4,2010,06,10
47,"Style, quality and location","Had one night in Barcelona and got upgraded to a Suite from a double! 9th floor amazing views, enormous bath, sep shower and two loos! Toiletries and settee in bedroom with lots of cushions, and enormous bed.  Other room had 8 seat conference table and leather settee. Location very good as Airport bus stops outside (5 Euros to airport, probably cheaper for a return) and Metro also.  Good quality hotel with all the facilities you'd expect from a 4 star. Rooftop swimming pool (didn't use as rained - unusual for June), gym, and left early so couldn't enjoy the breakfast.  Had a look at the restaurant and its cafe/bar, both looked very good with reasonable prices and classy decor and warm and welcoming staff.   You could have massage etc in room but pricey at 80 euros for one hour.  Would recommend to the traveller that needs comfort and location with great facilities or the business traveller/company that needs all it needs in one place with quality, as you couldn't want for more. The downside was rather official and 'cold' reception staff (apart from one helpful young lady) and didn't get the warm welcome when I arrived, nor when I asked later for information.   Also, bed was very hard, ceiling above bath was peeling (no ventilation) and only English news channel on tv. Would go again at right price as all in all ticked most of my boxes.",4,2010,06,10
47,Very good hotel,"We were with 10 adults, we came in this hotel because another was overbooked.
When we came there we were very surprised.
We had a very good time in this hotel, it is very clean, the breakfast was very good, and the service is excellent.  the hotel has free WIFI internet and it is very helpfull to find the hotspots in Barcelona.
we enjoined the view at the roof on the hotel by the swimmingpool. 
it is on a good spot, very easy to get everywhere quick with the metro.
Thanks to the staff for a good stay.",5,2010,06,02
47,An hotel like in a communist country,"This hotel is one of the worst high quality hotel I have ever been. It looks like an old hotel in a communist country. Everything is old-fashioned and terribly sad. You enter a huge access hall, a very inpersonel breakfast hall and you get very large but absolutely awful room with wood parquet! Not surprisingly, walking in your room is noisy... The location is probably the only positive thing (the subway is just in front of the hotel entrance). I am absolutely sure there is something much modern and better in Barcelona.",1,2010,05,24
47,"Great hotel with an amazing staff, Thank You Joel!!!!","First, the stats. Clean, modern hotel. Rooms are spacious as are the bathrooms. The rooms on the city side have an amazing view of the plaza and the Magic fountain. The pool is on the roof and also offers amazing views. The have a restaurant and a sports bar with pub food. The Metro stop is literally right outside the front door of the hotel.

The breakfast is huge, but it is not included in the price. You will be charged extra for the breakfast.

Now, the service. The front desk staff was very helpful (especially Joel). Joel took the time to get to know us. Joel was super friendly and informative. He went well above and beyond to ensure we were treated well. I have traveled a lot and stayed in many hotels over the years (both in the U.S. and Europe) and Joel provided the bet customer service I have ever had, hands down.

If you ever go to Barcelona stay in this hotel. It will not disappoint.",5,2010,05,17
47,Good location and nice hotel,"My company make the reservation for me at this nice hotel. the location it is excellent in front of the congress and very closed from Les Rambles. Rooms are nice, breakfast it is excellent.. the best for me.. the pool at the top, wonderfull view!!!!!!",5,2010,04,22
47,TOO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!,"I come for easter holidays at Barcelona and I choose Plaza hotel for the reviews. It is good located, nice staff and big breakfast. I will recomended!!!!",5,2010,04,18
47,Good Business,I am from Birmingham but I am living in Madrid since 2009. Last easter I stayed in Seville and they recommeded me Plaza Hotel. The location is good and the breakfast superior.,5,2010,04,09
47,"Excellent food, Brilliant Location, Helpful Staff. Great location for Sightseeing!!!","This hotel was amazing as base for sightseeing in Barcelona! The excellent location, less than 3 metres to a metro stop (key metro stop). With views from the windows across to the historic palace and the magic singing fountains (well worth a trip up in the evening), the views were amazing. The hotel pool was chilly but the views across Barcelona from the roof terrace were amazing. The hotel staff were friendly and polite, always greeting you and the room cleaners couldn't have been more helpful if you needed extra towels or pillows. The breakfast choice was excellent, ranging from continental pastries and breads, meats, cheeses and fresh fruit to an omelette station and hot 'fry up' selection of foods and traditional catalan sausages and bacon. If your wanting a hotel to use as a base for sightseeing then this is highly recommended, close to palace and ten minute metro journey to the gothic city and three stops to the ramblas then this is the best hotel for you.",4,2010,04,05
47,Exellent service,"I have been in Catalonia Barcelona Plaza Hotel a couple of times, and it´s certain one of the best hotels than I´ve never been.Hotel location is great for tourists, near many sites plus the hop on/off bus picks up in Plaza Espana. I was there last time with my family and they are really surprised for its services. Staff are friendly, polite and efficient. 
The restaurant is also amazing . To sum up, I would like to recommend this Hotel to anyone who is looking for relax relax in City Centre.",5,2010,03,11
47,simply the best,We stay in this hotel one week .It was very confortable.The room is very clean and spacious.We spend very nice time.,5,2010,01,27
47,A REAL 4 STARS HOTEL,"First of all, the hotel location is great, the Espanya metro station is just outside. I’ve stayed there one week last december with my wife and everything was great, the room was clean, the hotel staff was nice and breakfast excellent. we'll definitely come back soon to this hotel.",5,2010,01,22
47,Surprised,"After reading some of the reviews here, I was apprehensive about this hotel.  But our arrangements had been made by a third party, and circumstances made it inconvenient to consider changing.  So we figured we could suck it up and stand it for a few days no matter what.
Well were we surprised!  The hotel was very nice.  Our room was very comfortable.  The batrh room was clean & well stocked.  The restaurant was very acceptable.  And wi-fi in our room was free & worked fine.
I almost wonder if some people have perhaps confused this hotel with another with maybe a similar name.  We had no complaints.  It was in a convenient location for us to walk around & explore.  The fountains at the end of the boulevard were awesome at night!!  We got a very good rate, and wouldn't hesitate to return to this hotel again.",4,2009,12,09
47,Very good for business traveler,"The hotel is not charming and the room is really dated, but it is very comfortable. The room is nicely sound proofed and you can sleep really well. Service is excellent and room is very clean. The buffet breakfast is wonderful. It is not walking distance from the Plaza de Catalunya and other attractions but it is right in front of the subway Plaza de Espanya which connects with several lines.",4,2009,11,23
47,"Clean and pleasant, good location if you don't mind 2 metro stops, must get a room with a view",Problem was with the wooden floors in the hallways that echo everytime someone walks with heels or closes their door.,3,2009,10,22
47,"Location, location, location!","Great place to stay if you want to see the city. Metro, bus, tour-bus, taxi, all by the doorstep. The city centre, near the 'Magical Fountain' - a must see in the night time with music and light show.
Rooms: big and clean, mini bar was a mini heater in fact, at night you could hear the hype from the roof installation (but I believe it was only we stayed at the top floor (below the pool), the view from our room wasn't too impressive, but I didn't care at all. I wasn't there most of the day ;) Breakfast excellent. Staff very helpful.",4,2009,09,17
47,"Convenient hotel:keep in mind what you have read here,  then it's not that bad.","I have to start by saying I had no choice in hotels, the business brought us out for a convention picked it.  I read these reviews, and expected less than 4 star. So I went in not  expecting the opulence of a Hyatt Grand Manchester in San Diego, where I often stay. This is true.  Actually, because of the reviews, I expected things like no AC, smelly sewage, loud streets, and poor views. Go in expecting this, but here is an addendum:

The rooms were clean, and the AC worked, the internet free.  The metro station was right in front of the hotel and ideally 2 stops away from las Ramblas. I(n retrospect, I'm glad I didn't stay right on las Rambas.-too busy!)  If you ask for a view of the Plaza, you get a great view of the  lit up 1930's National Palace and convention center and the magic fountains. (This is just a walk away uphill and I highly recommend the view from the top wherever you stay, and the lit  magic fountains on the weekend.) I spent a lot of time looking out my window. If you are a convention attendee, this location is ideal- a walk away. I enjoyed the breakfast. Since I expected the staff to be rude, they were helpful, but not in a way that maybe those who are used to being kissed up to in travel would expect, but from what I have read, Barcelona isn't a kiss-butt kinda town. Didn't look at the pool- too much to see. We did have a choice of where to stay our last four days, and were content to stay there because of the conveneince of the metro.  ( much easier than NY subways)",3,2009,08,28
47,the staff behavior was terrible and not proffessional,"the hotel design is poor and does not fit a 4 star hotel.
the loby is not pleasent. The rooms are big and very clean a part of them are not in front of piaza espania but in front of other rooms of the hotel you see a very high wall with windows like a prison. and without aircondition it's noisy and suffocating.the staff of the hotel does not give you a very warm wellcoming  When I left she said that I paid only 1 day for the safe. I told her that I paid for 4 days and she had to ask another girl if she knows about it' even I said I have a reciet.
The consolation was a very good breacfast meal with a variety of food. fesh orange juice right  from the juicer and  baked cakes and scones that are baked in the dining room.
The pool was 3 m depth only for swimmers",3,2009,07,30
47,A very average hotel,"I stayed at this hotel in December on business. The public areas are acceptable and the bedrooms at first glance are ok. My room overlooked the stained central area of the hotel - but whilst only having fellow guests on the opposite side of the courtyard to gaze upon at least the incesant traffic noise which starts about 6am and runs until after midnight was not experienced. One of my colleagues had a room on the front of the hotel - which although had a (marginally) better view than mine, also had the noise from the v.busy roundabout located directly in front of thre hotel to 'enjoy'. At least breakfasts were ok - with excellent OJ! My bedrooms toilet leaked from the base, many of the bulbs were out and the air con was constantly oven like - regardless of setting.
Yes there are train stations very close to the hotel but really I would recommend staying closer in to the main city centre at a better hotel",3,2009,05,21
47,Good Location Medium Hotel,"Just back from Catalonia Plaza Hotel which I stayed with my partner for 5 days.
We went there to participate in the fair of Barcelona so the hotel was really convenient because you need only 4-5 minutes by feet to reach the fair.
In any case it is not far from the centre and there is a metro stop and a bus stop to the airport right outside from the hotel.
The room had nice size and nice view but needs renovation at least on the curtains and blankets.
The breakfast was the best part of our stay! Fresh orange juice and bread, plenty of choices in cheese, ham, omeletts, fruits and many others.
The worse part was the noise from the chambermaid and the price.
We paid 188Euros per night and it woth's the half of them.
So if you have to be in the fair, it's a really good choice but if you are traveller you can prefer an other area close to Plaza Catalynia , La Rambla or the Gothic area.",3,2009,03,31
47,A Pragmatic View,"With some recent mixed reports on this hotel, time I feel to offer a pragmatic opinion.  This is a large hotel and is busy and therefore it is easy to be left with the opinion that the desk staff are not caring as voiced by some but in my view the service provided is adequate. I visited in October and yes the pool on the roof was not welcoming but neither were the days when I was there – grey. My room was nice, clean and warm and I would describe as plush.  There was however a persistent smell of sewage in the bathroom – but I didn’t complain & therefore didn’t give the chance for staff to do something about it, so I can’t criticise them for that.  The large breakfast room provided plenty of choice, was bright and pleasant to be in. All in all I was more than happy with this accommodation (notwithstanding the smell).  It has the convenience of a normal (no hiked up rates) cash machine adjacent to the lobby and is within walking distance of the main station.",4,2009,02,25
47,this is not a 4 * hotel!,"the best days of this hotel are long gone! it is rated by many sites as 4 *, but it is definitely not.  

the roof top pool could not be used. it was not heated and the covering over part of it to make it an ""indoor pool"" had blown away.  the area was generally in a poor state!

wifi in the hotel was very expensive and it was also expensive to use the safe in the room with a rate per day. also, there was no free internet access even in the lobby - had to use a credit card, and the euros accumlated really fast while using 1 of 2 pcs available. 

rooms were clean and nice, although beds were rock hard.",2,2009,01,06
47,Nickolas from Greece,"We have just returned from a week at the Catalonia Barcelona Plaza Hotel.The hotel is average, the room it was so cold, the temperature it was always 18 degrease Celsius with no way to change it.",3,2008,11,17
47,Brilliant Hotel,"We have just spent three nights at the Plaza. It fully deserves its four stars. It is easily the best decorated, cleanest hotel we have used this year.
The desk staff were very friendly, very very helpful and spoke better English than the desk staff we encountered in Leeds last week. The desk staff explained how to use facilities in the city, they recommended and booked restauants and stored our luggage on the day that we checked out until the time to go to the airport.  Many Irish and British hotels could learn a lot from the friendly efficiency of the hotel staff. 
When we retrun to Barcelona, & God willing we intend to, we will stay nowhere but the Plaza.
Its central location and its value for money can just not be bettered.",5,2008,11,14
47,Warning - More poor star than four star,"Awful awful awful, it beggars belief how this hotel was awarded a four star rating. The staff are rude, the rooms are average, the internet is overpriced. This hotel and the staff are obviously so confident of business from the nearby conference centre that they feel they can treat guests as they wish. Unfortunately this hotel and it's staff were my first introduction to Barcelona, luckily after enduring the accommodation for almost a week we moved to another hotel in Barcelona, also four star, considerably cheaper with friendly staff, great facilities etc etc. Think before you stay here, I stayed with a very large group for business reasons and 99% of people had a negative experience mainly with staff attitude.",1,2008,07,24
47,Disappointing ... should be better.,"Our 3 night stay at this 4-star (self appointed?) hotel turned out to be below average with more negatives than positives.

On the positive side, the hotel is well located with the Espanya metro station and various bus routes literally at the front door, the main foyer is tidy and well maintained and the check-in staff are friendly enough if not overly helpful. Our room on the 6th floor was neat, clean and a decent size with a pleasant view toward the Parc de Montjiuc and the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya (particularly spectacular when lit up at night!).

On the negative side ... firstly, the air conditioning in our room did not work and then the next morning we found that the shower also was not working. We reported these problems to reception and were told that they would have to call in an engineer - why they don't have a tradesman on site to deal with these type of problems, I don't know. We returned that evening to find that the shower was now working and had apparently been repaired but the air conditioning was still dead. Reception were no help. We had to revert to opening and closing the window to regulate the temperature (and the noise from the traffic below) in the room. The air-conditioning had not been repaired by the time we left three days later, and we received no acknowledgment or apology for the inconvenience at check-out. 

A cheeseburger meal ordered from room service also failed to impress. The cheeseburger was dry and overcooked and the ""chips"" were packet crisps, not cooked chips/fries as you might expect when ordering a hot meal.

The pool/roof area has been neglected and is in need of some repair and renovation - it is certainly no longer of the standard shown in the picture/s on the hotel's website. 

As noted in an earlier review, you have to pay for any ""extras"" such as wi-fi and the in-room safe. These items and others things such as an iron/ironing board are included as standard in many good hotels. Common with other European hotels, there were also no tea/coffee making facilities in the room.

In summary, a disappointing stay and not up to the standard you would normally expect of a ""4-star"" hotel.",2,2008,04,20
47,very good hotel!!!,"we just returned from 4 days trip to Barcelona and the Catalonia Plaza hotel was great!

First the location(!!!)- you go out of the hotel & you have stairs to the metro in front of you. the Plaza Catalonia and la Ramblas is just 3 stations away, so it's very comfortable! In fact, all sites are within about 3-4 stations from you..., Poble Espanyol and the musical fountains is by wallking distance.

The staff of the reception were very pleasent, nice & helpful.
The hotel is very clean,  which was very important to us' and the lobby is comfortable and nice.

Our room was in the upper floor' the view was magnificent and even though the street was noisy, we didn't here it 'cause of the dubble- glassing windows.
The bathroon was very large and convenient, and cleaned every morning.

Breakfasts were very reach, with great variety of eggs, cheeses and sausages and even a health corner with soy milk & other healthy food.

Overall I would say this is a great hotel to be in Barcelona, great service and perfect location- great value for money!
Good luck",4,2008,04,14
47,Good 4x4 car parking - humourless staff,"The other reviewers have pretty much covered it accurately - but I stay here because it is a great location, and their car park takes a Range Rover with no problem which is not true of many european subterranean parking facilities.

Not one of the staff smiled once despite my best efforts in Spanish or English.

Cafe food was a bizarre mixture of things - maybe just down to regional cuisine expectations. However it was not particularly nice quality either.

You could do worse!",3,2008,03,24
47,Great Hotel Excellent Location,"First the location:  it’s excellent. Metro station is just near the front door and bus station 10 meters aside. There are only 4 stations away from the Ramblas. I’ve seen that some reviewers prefer to reside much closer to Ramblas. I think it’s not wise: there are a lot of noise and bustle, and at night it’s not a nice place to walk around. And of course it’s much expensive. So the location of the Catalonia Plaza is perfect: close to everything, but not within the tumult and commotion. Our room faced the Piazza Espana, the view is great, and the windows are very isolated, so the noise did not bother us at all.
The staff is very friendly and nice, speaking very well English and always ready to assist you.
The rooms are maintained very well, the janitress cleans even twice a day.  The room and bathroom are big enough for a couple.
The food is excellent; the breakfast buffet is rich and delicious. 
I definitely will stay here again.",5,2008,03,10
47,Good hotel in a good location,Stayed at this hotel at the end of Feb/beginning of March 2008 as we were in Barcelona for their marathon - for which the hotel is the perfect location being by the start/finish and near the Expo/Registration centre. Reception staff efficient and helpful. Room was fine. The aircon did not work ( previous comments have mentioned this) which was a disappointment given the quality of everything else. Breakfast buffet was very good - a wide variety and plenty of it. We were on the 4th floor and could still hear the underground metro. Had a very good meal in the hotel restaurant on our last night (from their menu of the day). Would stay there again.,4,2008,03,08
47,Wonderful Welcome To Spain,"This was our first trip to Spain and we arrived at this hotel after a red-eye flight from JFK on Thanksgiving Day.  We were confused by the use of your room card to work the lights, but what a WONDERFUL idea!  When you left the room, take the card out and all your lights are off!

The room was well appointed with a modern decor.  Yes, the floor was wood, but so was the floor of every hotel we stayed in Spain.  No dust bunnies!  We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights and did not have any problems with noise.  

The breakfast buffet was the best on our trip!  Great assortment of eggs, fruit, pastries, ham and warm milk for your coffee.  

The folks at the front desk were very helpfull at directing us around town.",4,2007,12,27
47,Good location but....,"The hotel has great location,in terms of Barcelona transportaion systems.
Only few places to eat or shop for food nearby.
The  size of the room (for 3 adults) was o.k.
The basic services were o.k:
breakfast,air condition,pool ,bath and the room was clean.

For every other thing -ice,key for the safe,Wi-Fi conection(22euro per 24 hours!!!),the hotel asked for more money.

The staff wasn't so helpfull,and we hardly got answers or recommendations for restaurants

47,Great Hotel! Great Location,"I never write comments on anything but I do read reviews. I have read the reviews here and had no expactations as most of them have rated this hotel with low ratings. I was in this hotel end of April for 3 nights with my husband in a group from his work so have no idea how much money did it cost. I think this hotel is in a great location. I had been in Barcelona some 6 years ago with my daughter and at that time we have stayed in a 3* hotel (package tour) with many metro stations to travel. This hotel is located some 3-4 Metro stations from the center. In the beautiful Plaza Espanya with the singing fountains. Huge rooms and bathrooms, clean and the staff is helpfull. The Metro station is just out by the entrance to the hotel. Have never seen ever before such variety on a breakfast buffet table, even in a 5* hotel. Fresh orange juice, on the spot bakery (in the dining room!) for fresh baguette, croissants, rolls & bread and lots of meat & cheese, pies and cakes, eggs and . Be sure though not to get an inner court room - where your window is facing the roof of the dining room. We had a room facing the side street which is a busy street with double glazed windows and the air-conditioning was working so there was no problem with any noise coming through. I would recommend this hotel for sure.
",5,2007,05,05
47,terrible terrible,"how disappointing - we were charge 150 euro  a night 

- we stayed there during the barcelona marathon - we booked at least 3 months in advance and we got the darkest room possible, no vierw - we might as well have been in the basement - not very pretty .

-there was no air conditioning in the room and we could not sleep both nights - when we enquired about the airconditioning they said that they do not turn it on until some time in late march- unbelievable for 150 euro a night - the temperatures were hot that weekend  so we had two nights of sweating and we were not in top form for the marathon.
i will be making sure any irish runners will hear about this hotel and ts no air conditioning policy  for the next marathon 08

if they were anyway decent they would have refunded us one night's accomodation - never again

47,OK But Not Great - Would not Stay Again,"stayed here on the 30th Nov and 1st Dec with my son.  I have stayed in Barcelona before at the 1898 - La Ramblas and this hotel just didn't come upt o the 1898 standard.  Like said previously the room sizes are superb and nicely furnished and spotlessly clean, BUT! don't expect a good nights sleep - the floors are all laminated and you hear every high healed step coming and going at all hours of the night from the floor above and also outside the room in the corridor, whenever your neighbour goes to the toilet you hear the toilet flush like it is in your room, the hotel is in a very busy square and as previoulsy mentioned getting a taxi isn't a problem they queue up outside the hotel which has it's benefits, but on the negative from about 6am in the morning the taxi drivers seem to play a game of beep the horn and they toot their horns like a chorus to each other - so if sleep is priority forget it, I got so little sleep that I felt jet lagged when I got home!  The hotel is lovely inside the decor etc., but it does lack in any atmosphere, when we stayed it seemed full of business delegates.  The staff are a little uninterested and although friendly enough they seem to lack any sparkle and certainly don't seem to want to go that extra mile to make you feel welcome.  We ate in the hotel restaurant fairly priced, although not a great deal of choice, and as previously mentioned although I can get by in spanish usually they didn't seem to understand any basic requests and our meals were not correct and when they come the second time they weren't cooked! So we drank our drinks and left - hungry.  Breakfast is superb - but not a good enough reason to make me want to go back though!  The hotel pool is freezing and although I love to swim and will swim in the sea anywhere this was by far just tooooooo cold for me to want to get in.
",3,2006,12,02
47,Just about OK,"I stayed here on business for two niight. On the positive side, I found the room size relatively good .The breakfast was also good. Wide selection of food and fresh orange juice. I hate the watery juice that is often served in hotels. It was also easy to get a cab from outside the hotel whenever we needed one. Staff friendly but incompetent.

Negative - Staff, though friendly, didn`t seem particularly well-trained. e.g. my colleague had to struggle to explain to the breakfast staff what decaff coffee is. The staff member on reception didn`t know where one of the main conference centres was. That kind of thing. You just expect better from a 4 star hotel.  Colleagues of mine ringing the hotel rang me several times on my mobile because they did not get any reply from the switchboard (!) 

The second big negative is the equipment. They seem to have one iron for the whole building. When I finally got it, they told me there was no ironing board. My female colleague ask for a replacement hair drier to be sent up and specifically NOT a maintenance man but still she got the maintenance man which is not what she wanted at 7am in her underwear. Maybe it is just the language barrier and they say they understand but do not. I don`t konw. They also have a problem with the heating  - it was almost impossible to turn off. Same with my colleagues room. 

Overall, the breakfast and size of the room - and comfort of bed -would make me possibly consider staying here again but there were so many negatives and so many other hotels, I would look elsewhere first. 

Tip: Try to get a room at the front or side - the rooms at the back looking onto the ""courtyard"" are very dark.

47,wouldnt go back,"I was going for to attend a conference, and it was my first time in barcelona. There was an offer for this hotel set up by the conference itself though it was my second choice it still looked and sounded pretty good! In reality it wasnt.. at all. Starting from the offensive looking exterior of the building. On the positive side the reservation and check in was pretty simple and quick and that was it! People working at the reception spoke very little to no english and when i wanted to change my room I had to wait for the bell boy to come and translate as the english speaking receptionist wasnt available. room preferences were not taken into consideration and so i had to change the room but of course my other room wasnt available, so instead of keeping my current accomodation they told me to leave my bags and return a couple of hours later! They took my luggage thankfully which I had been pulling myself up to my room then down again to the reception, and i went for lunch. Rooms are small and not very clean. bathroom was ok. The rooms at the back of the hotel have very bad view I imagine those overlooking the pz espana would be better but I didnt see them. after the switch of rooms as I came back tired and wanting to relax I was surprised by a friendly french couple opening the door to my room with their luggage in tow, it appears that the receptionist forgot to make the switch and still listed my room as available. limited TV channels, only sky news in english. bathroom was clean enough and comfortable but not luxurious. the shower's handle was broken and then it completely went out of order, they fixed it for one day then it broke again, we kept on like that till the last day when i left not taking a shower on that day, as i was so exasperated that i didnt bother to tell them. closet space was ample. bed was not comfortable and sheets are not cleaned everyday except if you tell them. on check  out they had charged a pay per view movie in a time when i wasnt even in the room and some other extra stuff, they deleted it quickly enough though when i told them so if ur there CHECK UR BILL. Breakfast room spacious and breakfast is good with a variety of choices. location is nice but as i found out not central to shopping area, it was very close to conference location though and pza espana by night is magnificent and thats right outside the doorstep, also Metro station is right out there. just a few nice cafes in the surrounding area so  that was a challenge as well. I have found that the staff to be friendly and have good intentions to help but have no idea what to do! I have found it be overpriced for the services and general outlook, wouldnt stay there again if they paid me, i like to enjoy my trips and this was the only downside of my trip so i spent all of my time outside of the hotel in the magnificent city.",2,2006,11,22
47,"Great location, average hotel","Like many travellers before me I highlight the location of the hotel as its main attraction. Indeed, airport bus stop literally around the corner, takes you 15 minutes to and fro. Metro stop at the doorstep. Conference hall - for those of us on business trip - at the same roundabout. A walk downtown though - for instance to Ramblas, port area - takes you at least over half an hour. Just going for a stroll and immediately be in the nicest area of Barcelona therefor is not what you should expect, you'll have to take the metro at least one or two stops. 
The hotel is huge, certainly not intimate and cosy. Large groups of tourists gather in the lounge. Breakfast ditto: wide choice, but one has to be used to eating with hundreds of others. Rooms are large, bathroom good, some repair and maintenance would not be bad. TV set for instance did not work, was only fixed after 24 hours. Very expensive Internet connection in the room (22 euro's for 24 hours, expensive considering that one at least sleeps around 8 hours of this time phrame). I rather favour the option of other hotels to give you IN TOTAL 24 hours surfing time (clock stops ticking when you log off). Rooms at road side to be preferred, fabulous view, bit noisy due to traffic. Health club very old, dark, not equiped with the latest machines to put it mild. Have not been able to find a sauna. Swimming pool is on the roof, small, not very well maintained, but nice to be in the open, with great view over the city. Not a soul seems to supervise that part of the hotel, one can be alone for many hours. All in all, I enjoyed the stay but things could be improved.

47,it's all about location,"this hotel is in a fantastic location on the placa espanya, perfectly placed for the metro, the buses and the airport bus (the stop back to the airport was right outside the hotel)

the staff were always very pleasant and very quick to sort out a problem with the room key

rooms clean and modern as was the bathroom

the pool on the 7th floor was small but more than adequate, never had a problem getting a lounger and the water was wonderfully refreshing

breakfast wasn't included in our room rate and was pricey at 13 euros but there was a reasonable choice and also the breads and pastries were freshly baked on the premises

will definately stay there again

47,"Excellent location, disappointing Hotel","Just returned having stayed 5 nights.  Excellent location from tourist point of view - airport bus transfer, entrance to tube station and tourist bus all on Placa Espanya just outside the hotel.  Room was all you would expect of a 4 star hotel - clean, comfortable and all the facilities you require and no problem with traffic noise.
Breakfast was very disappointing - plenty of choice if only everything was restocked on a more frequent basis.  Cooked breakfast choice was very limited and invariably cold.
Piano bar was closed throughout our stay therefore nowhere in reception areas to have a relaxing drink, apart from the coffee shop which wasn't ideal.  Views from roof top pool were super however no drinks or snacks available here.  Pool was closed for 2 days during our stay for maintenance without prior warning.
Staff in all areas neither helpful or friendly and certainly did not make you feel welcome or inclined to return.  The main convention / conference area for Barcelona is next to the Hotel and it would appear the staff are used to dealing with this type of clientele who are one off guests and unlikely to return.
Overall, would not recommend this Hotel for a leisure break which is disappointing in view of its location.  Used previous reviews from this website to finally select our accomodation and therefore disappointed it did not live up to expectations

47,Great Hotel Highly Recommended!,"First of all, the hotel location is great, the Espanya metro station is just outside. I’ve stayed there 4 nights with my wife and everything was great, the room was clean, the hotel staff was nice and breakfast was great.
",5,2006,08,13
47,Good hotel in excellent location,"Stayed here for three nights and was great. had room facing onto the magical/musical fountains oh what a site. really really fab. the one problem of having a room with this view is that all of these rooms have two singles pushed together as your double which was a pain but shor it was worth it considering the view. place was very clean nice enough pool with great views did  get busy up there alright and not enough decking chairs. bus touriste stops across from the hotel and the metro is right outside the station and also only 5-10 mins walk to Sants main station.

Had lunch in the hotel and wasn't great alright 

Well worth staying here considering its cost, location and newness and cleanliness.
",4,2006,08,09
47,catalonia Plaza -Great location,"Great location for public transport.  Bus from airport stops outside - journey only takes 15 minutes. Hotel is right above the Metro station.too.
The best thing about this hotel was the breakfast buffet - huge and well stocked.  the poorest thing was the standard of the towels and linens - I expect much better than the threadbare offerings we had.  Also, did not allow for you to have a shower early afternoon and then another later because the one towel provided did not dry off in time. Our room looked into an inner ""well"" and was never bright - may be OK if you ask for an external room.
Rooftop views are amazing.  Pool water was too hot to swim in - more like a bath. public areas very spacious and clean.  Corridors could do with some updating.
",3,2006,07,05
47,Very enjoyable stay!,"We stayed here for 4 nights as a hotel chosen by our escorted tour company.  While it was very crowded and full of young travelers (groups), the staff were helpful when needed.  Loved the location and so near the MNAC and the colorful water fountains musical display.  The food in the buffet was varied and tasty, though you had to plan a time to go there when it wasn't overwhelmed by ravenous youngsters.  We ate in the formal restaurant at the back of the cafe one evening (they open at 9pm) and were VERY impressed with the meal, the service and the low cost of the prix-fixe dinner (6 courses with extras, including a full bottle of decent Tinto and also bottled water.  I recommend that choice for dining at the hotel.
",5,2006,06,30
47,Not the bunker its portrayed,"arrived from a bad hotel experience from Sitgies, booked into a suite.  Nice boardroom/ sitting room, sepearte loo.  Large deep circular bath, another loo, double sinks and bed on the 11th floor.  Great view of the fountains in action at night.

However the hotel seemed more full of conference delegates so lacked that holiday atmosphere.  Breakfast was ok and we had lunch in the cafe which was excellent value.

It did feel a bit caught in a time slot (I think it will face more competition from the newer hotels).

Not a bad hotel, just not for us.
",4,2006,06,30
47,I recommend this one!,"I have just returned from staying at this hotel for 4 nights at the end of January 2006. I found the accommodation very good and the location excellent. 

If, like me...you want to be able to get to your chosen hotel cheaply, quickly, and easily from the airport, then this hotel could hardly be bettered...the Aerobus (3.6 euro each way) stops right outside. 
If you want to pop into the Metro to quickly access the city's attractions, without having to walk for 15 minutes to get to the nearest station first....the steps down to the Espanya junction are also just paces from the hotel. 
If you're interested in viewing Art, the Palau Nacional with its excellently presented collection...(particularly outstanding, from the Romanesque period) are an enjoyable 10 minute walk up to Montjuic from the hotel....which takes you past the Font Magica, with it's free Son et Lumiere type shows, which are great entertainment....currently showing on Friday/Saturday evenings, with a different programme of music every 15 mins from 7pm to 9pm. I saw all but one show from various vantage points on the hill...all except the last that is, which I watched from my hotel room, which overlooked a fantastic view of Montjuic hill and the busy Placa d'Espanya below. Thankfully, the double glazing and substantial curtaining was very effective at removing sound and illumination, ensuring a good night's rest.

The breakfast buffet was very comprehensive, lots from which to choose. And the staff I dealt with throughout my stay were pleasant and friendly. 
My room was  spacious, clean and comfortable and the bathroom, similarly so. The bed itself could have been better ...mine creaked (not responsible!) but it was sufficiently comfortable and more than adequate. I'm sure I could have requested a change of bed, as there was every indication that the hotel management want to oblige, to ensure an enjoyable stay. But as I was tired after long days sightseeing in the city, I was just too knackered to really notice!
My only criticism concerned having to pay a few euros to have the daily use of the safe deposit box in my bedroom. I declined to do that as it seemed a petty charge.
In conclusion, I shall be returning next time I visit the city....this hotel has got most things right for my liking!
",5,2006,02,03
47,Great Hotel - Great Location,"Just arrived back from this hotel.  I have always found this site helpful in the past so when I was taking my girlfriend to Barcelona for xmas I looked for good reviews.  I wasnt let down.  This hotel is superb.  Great spacious rooms, excellent friendly staff and plenty to eat @ breakfast.  The fast & efficient Metro system stops literaly outside the hotel and is four stops from Placa de Catelonia (where its all at)  Taxi from Las Ramblas = 6euro/ Airport 26euro.  The Airbus again stops outside and is 4euros to the airport.  I'll stop going on, but i hope this helps.  I'd recommend this hotel to young/old......anyone and everyone.  Enjoy!
",5,2005,12,05
47,Lived up to all the good reviews,"We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of July, and had a large triple room for the 3 of us (11 year old son). I had checked the Tripadvisor reviews carefully before choosing a hotel, and chose this one because it had a rooftop pool, and sounded as if a triple room would be larger here than in the older central hotels. 

It lived up to all the reviews and met all of our expectations. The metro is just outside the front door, and it is a quick journey into the centre. We also took a bus to and from the centre. It is also the first stop for the airport bus, which was very easy to use (and airconditioned). The breakfast buffet is huge and very varied. It was very hot in Barcelona, so an airconditioned room was essential. We can recommend the open-top tourist buses (hop on - hop off), which were a great way of seeing the city in very hot weather.",4,2005,08,10
47,"Helpful staff, busy hotel","We stayed at this huge hotel for 10 nights in June 2005. It seemed to cater for large parties, including schools, sports teams and business trips and it was exceptionally busy while we were there. The bedrooms are small but very clean and well equipped with satellite TV, hairdryer, minibar etc. There was maid service twice a day and all of the staff were eager to help. The snacks served in the bar/ cafeteria are good value and the Piano Bar is a lovely oasis of calm. The rooftop pool area is small, with around 30 sun loungers which didn't seem to be enough for the 300+ rooms.  We found that the pool and terrace area was quiet throughout the day but got really busy from around 5pm when the school trips etc returned and it all got a bit rowdy.
The views from the roof over Montjuic and the 'Musical Fountains' are amazing but there is always a lot of traffic noise and this means that it's not the best place to relax.
As other reviewers have mentioned the hotel is ideally placed for local transport and a late night taxi home from the bottom end of La Rambla is not too expensive (approx. 7-10 Euros). As a short stay city break hotel this is perfect but I probably wouldn't recommend it for longer than a few days.
",4,2005,07,27
47,i'll be back again next year,"excellent hotel! excellent location! excellent breakfast! 
i cant think of a bad word to say about this immaculately kept hotel! the staff were friendly and on hand at all hours of the day! 
the metro is literally less than a minutes walk away from the hotel so you can wake up in the morning, have a shower(which is very powerful, unlike a lot of hotels i have stayed in in the past) stroll down to breakfast, which is a variety of pastries, cooked breakfast, cold meat, cereal and fruit and then be on your way for a lovely day out seeing all of the sites in the town. if you want to go for a drink in the local area close to the hotel, i would recommend Club Ibiza, the staff are friendly and you will have a good night! i will be back next year.
",5,2005,03,04
47,Fab location,"I've just got back from a Business Studies school trip to Barcelona. We stayed at Barcelona Plaza & i have to say it was really good. It had an amazing location, with the Metro on the doorstep, literally. There were bus stops gallore within a short vacinity. The view from the front of the hotel and the rooftop swimming pool were spectacular, you could see the magic fountain & the Palace; along with the rest of Barcelona.

It is classed as a 4* hotel (not 3*) as this website suggests. It is exactly what i'd expect from a 4*. I'd reccommend staying here to anyone going to Barcelona in the future.
",5,2005,02,16
47,great service,"The hotel is in a great location.  First stop off from the A1 airport bus, next to a subway stop and next to a Barcelona Tourism bus.  

The only problem is that the room smelled of smoke.  Turning on the A/C didn't help so we left the window open most evenings.  

Although the hotel is next to a major intersection the rooms are insulated for sound extremely well.  

Exceptional staff - friendly and courteous.  If I were to grade the hotel it's about a 3.5 star hotel.  Rooms were very clean, it's the smoke in the air that bothered us.

47,Fantastic Value  Sept 04,"We stayed here for four nights and found all the facilities to be of the highest quality.
Although not in the centre of the city there is a metro station outside the front door and you can get to anywhere in the city wihin minutes.
Breakfast buffet was excellent and we had an evening meal in the bar on one occasion which we found very good value.
All in all an excellent hotel which I would have no hesitation in recommending to anyone

47,Not all rooms on the same level,"Great hotel, located in a really strategic position and well connected with all points of interest in the city.
Excellent breakfast buffet, with wide choice and excellent raw materials.
The property is dated and, unfortunately, not all rooms have been recently renovated. I happened to one of the old ones that, although the furniture was not new, was more than dignified. Here, however, come the sore notes: even the bathroom was not renovated and, as you can see from the attached photos, definitely not up to scratch. The tank was peeled in several places and stained with rust. Different parts of the bath itself and the shower invaded by mold.",3,2024,10,07

47,A guarantee,"This hotel is always a guarantee considering the location (20/30 minutes from the airport), metro in front of the entrance, the quality of the rooms and services, the open air swimming pool with large relaxation area on the 8th floor with spectacular views of Plaza de Espanya and Montjiuc
Very cool restaurant and bar but eye on prices
The same applies to rooms that are not always cheap, especially at events

47,Absolutely Recommendation,"I chose this hotel because of the location and the presence of the pool. 
In fact, one of the Espanya metro accesses is right in front of the main entrance. 
But, if you love walking, you can walk to many points of interest.
The very nice room, equipped with everything you need, although given the type of hotel I would have expected courtesy slippers.
Large and comfortable bed.
Large bathroom, with large shower. And bidet, which an Italian never minds.
Spectacular pool on the eighth floor, where you can take a towel if you are staying in the hotel. The bar is also pleasant, ideal for a drink even at night, given the view of Plaça d'Espanya.
Friendly staff, both at reception and in the bars and pool, and also the cleaning ladies are very nice.
Possibility to leave luggage attesting to check-in or after Check-out.
Inside the hotel there are three restaurants, but we did not use them.",5,2024,08,26
47,Incompetence,"They are totally incompetent when it comes to managing parking.

From the two levels you see Barcelona and you don't seem to be in Barcelona because you don't hear anything. The service is excellent are always on top of you in case you need anything (e.g. order food or drinks) recommend the burgers are spectacular. They give you towels as soon as you enter the terrace.

47,Mala,"It is a shame to do this because I had high expectations of this hotel but I have been quite disappointed. Starting because a housekeeping came into the room without knocking on the door or warning when he was sent to fix the bed. When booking I specified that I wanted a double bed and when I arrived we were given a room with two beds, situation that they resolved very well but with the incident mentioned above. It touched us on the first floor, overlooking nothing, the trees and the street. The door to the room was broken, in the room there were only two plugs and behind the TV. Cleanliness was poor. The table was full of dust, the shower walls were moldy and the shower was rusty. The cards didn't work, both to open the room and for the elevator it was a roll. We spent 5 minutes trying to open the room and the door being broken we had to put a lot of pressure to close it completely. On one occasion the door opened for this very thing. For the hotel it is and the price it has does not seem normal this type of thing",3,2024,06,30
47,Very nice days spent,"Very nice hotel with fantastic views from the roof terrace. The traffic was quite noisy, so we looked at the suite on the 8th floor. Floor granted, this had a large terrace. Breakfast from 07:00 possible, that was great 🤩 and there was a lot of choice, there is something for everyone.  
We always got a little surprise in the room, thank you very Attentive😀👍
Unfortunately, on the terrace all wiring could be seen, these should not be visible to the guest!! Where you didn't see the wiring, there was waste in it, you can't do it at all!! 
Just as with rain showers was the case on June 20, the outside beds (mattress) belong changed and not just left on the terrace.  Otherwise it was very nice.",4,2024,06,27

I was expecting courtesy slippers but they weren't there. Chapter aside from the bathroom: no type of ventilation despite having no window, if you put in the bidet you also have to put in the wipes... I certainly don't use the facial ones. The sink was leaking, the shower head was swinging over my head, the water mixer didn't allow you to take a lukewarm shower... it was either hot or freezing, the shower door barely slid. Very nice breakfast.",3,2024,04,23

47,Happy and classy birthday,"The entire hotel and the room have turned out spectacular. It is not the first time at the Hotel and also in the Clock Suite it was the second time, also for a birthday. The only drawback is the TV in the living room of the Suite, it cannot be used and create a suitable atmosphere with music or some entertaining TV channel, it is something that nowadays with film and TV platforms in a hotel of this category and a such a special room, it is not normal that that TV does not work in August or in March.

The room we had had the nightstands full of dust, you could make drawings with your finger. The bed moved at the slightest movement and the sheets hung over one side. Please check the expiration date of the things in the room because the milk was expired since January. We like to have buffet breakfast but we thought the price was exaggerated. The good thing was the location, 24-hour reception and the person who helped me by phone when I asked for information to reserve. The waiter who charged me at the bar was very friendly.",3,2024,03,10

They allow dogs for 25 euros/night although the website says 20. Ridiculously, they require a deposit of 200 euros in case the dog causes damage, which they return without checking anything.

Premium room with views of Plaza de España. Fair size. Good bed, pillows that could be improved. Minibar, coffee maker and kettle. Safe. Iron. Correct bathroom, but the bathrobes and slippers that the website promised for this room were not there, which is an ugly detail. Shower with fine rain half clogged.

Correct cleaning.

Good wifi.

I didn't try the breakfast or use the parking.

Quality/price ratio that can be improved.",4,2023,11,04
47,Exceptional,Elixir the Catalonia Plaza España hotel is like being at home. For this reason I am at your hotel every time I can. The service is spectacular and when you are far from home it is very important to feel good and see the smiles of the staff. A round of applause everyone.,5,2023,11,02
47,Beautiful city hotel in a great location and with outstanding views over the city,"Combined with a Barca La Liga game, we found the perfect hotel. Centrally located on the Placa d’espanya, with a fantastic view over Barcelona and Montjuïc, where Barca is currently playing in the Olympic Stadium. From the square, it’s about a 20-minute walk to the stadium, past the National Museum with a wonderful view over the city! We and our dog were given a very friendly welcome, and the room was nice and clean. Ours was on the 12th floor. We didn’t book breakfast, but there are also great cafes downstairs in the same building. We loved the roof terrace with pool and the great view! When booking, make sure to choose a room with a city/mountain view! We would definitely come again!",4,2023,10,30

47,EXCELLENT ALTERNATIVE IN BARCELONA,"
I really liked the hotel and its common spaces. Its location for me is excellent. When we arrived they gave us a room with a bad smell, and with a view of the back of the hotel. We asked for a room change, and they did it immediately, so everything was fine during our stay.",5,2023,09,19
47,"The lobby is beautiful, not worth the price of the hotel","A little old hotel, beautiful hall, kind bar men and equally kind receptionists. The room is not worth the asking price, old bathroom with visible and very ugly details and grouting, various hairs here and there in the room, many in the bathroom, including very long ones and others less so. The beds, despite the request for a double bed, were separated and with trundles underneath, not up to the standard of a 4 star hotel. Very good cocktails on the ground floor, terrible on the top floor despite the beautiful view the bar is not valued and €15 per drink.",3,2023,09,19

47,Defraudadas,"Ofertan más de lo que tienen. Dicen que tienen restauración y no es verdad. Tienen una cafetería abierta al público de calle y no atienden a los alojados. No hemos podido comer en hotel, y cenar tampoco. Quieren conciliar la oferta al público con las personas alojadas y al final nada de nada",2,2023,04,30
47,Aufenthalt Barcelona,Ich war bereits mehrfach beruflich im Catalonia an Barcelona und komme immer wieder gerne .das Zimmer das ich gebucht hatte war perfekt und die Freundlichkeit und Sauberkeit ließ keine Wünsche offen.

Die eigene große Terrasse lädt zum verweilen bei schönem Wetter ein.Da in direkter nähe des Hotels 2 Bäckereien/ Cafés sind haben wir auf das Frühstück im Hotel verzichtet,5,2023,04,29

Hay buena comunicación en transporte público y mucho ambiente durante todo el dia",5,2023,04,09
47,Ottima posizione per visitare Barcellona (metropolitana all’ingresso) e rispetto all’aeroporto (pullman o metro),"Buon albergo ottima posizione un po’ datato ma sopratutto la cosa più fastidiosa che si trova spesso a Barcellona l’odore di fogna. La camera era comunque confortevole e molto silenziosa , ma troppo calda anche in giornate freschine perché batte il sole tutto il giorno sulle vetrate . Ottimo il fatto che non c’è la moquette, e quindi molto pulito. Dotato anche della nespresso con capsule omaggio ogni giorno.",3,2023,04,08
47,Consigliatissimo!!!,"Posizione con splendida vista su Plaza de Espana, camera spaziosa e pulitissima. Vetri insonorizzati che rendono il riposo piacevole, nonostante si sia in una zona centralissima e molto trafficata. Nel bagno vi è un'ampia doccia, lavabo con kit per l'igiene personale, wc e soprattutto bidet (non così scontato quando si viaggia fuori dall'Italia)  Ottime colazioni in una grande sala con la possibilità di servirsi anche più volte di bevande e cibi dolci e salati. Unica pecca, il ristorante per i pranzi, non proprio organizzato. Ci hanno detto che la gestione era cambiata da poco, speriamo riescano a migliorare il servizio. Grande comodità: il bus per l'aeroporto proprio davanti all'hotel. Consigliatissimo!!!",4,2023,04,07
47,Normalito,"En el check-in no nos informaron de nada, solo nos dieron las llaves de la habitación, solo te explicaban cosas si tu les preguntabas. En el desayuno buffet había vsriedad la justa y tardaban micho en reponer las tortitas, gofres o en hacer tortillas. En el restaurante japonés adjunto, 60€ por unas gyozas, un yakisoba, 20 piezas al gusto del chef (pedimos q no llevaran picante y nos pusieron wasabi...) y 2 bebidas 60€, sin postre ni café. En el bar del hotel por la noche hacía frío, entraba todo el aire de fuera. El personal dependiendo de quién te tocara era amable, en especial una chica del desayuno, fue muy agradable, otros simplemente correctos. La limpieza era buena, todo estaba muy pulido y las camas bien hechas. Ha sido una experiencia normalita, pero por el mismo precio hay mejores opciones seguro. No creo que repitamos.",3,2023,04,05
47,Estancia por trabajo varios días ,"Fantástico hotel en pleno centro de Barcelona. Cuenta con instalaciones modernas, atención por parte del personal de 10 y un desayuno estupendo.

Personal amable familiar y atento. Servicio de desayuno increíble. Equipo de recepción siendo Cristina la responsable con la mejor sonrisa y trato inmejorable,5,2023,03,07
47,horrible estancia a precio de paraíso,"hotel en obras: recepción en el sótano y entrada por una puerta sin control, cualquiera puede acceder desde la calle.
habitación 715 horrible: interior, wc no funcionaba (lo arreglaron muy rápido para no cambiarnos de habitación), sofá cama es un pequeñísimo colchón tirado en el suelo, muy calurosa y leve mal olor. Si esto es una habitación a 200 euros y pico la noche....
como compensación nos regalaron el desayuno, bueno estuvo bien pero no suficiente, tendríamos que haber tenido una estancia acorde a lo pagado (que se nos cobró antes de ver la habitación por si salíamos corriendo)
me hubiera ido si no fuera tarde y llevara dos niños
cuando expliqué todas estas deficiencias en recepción lo primero que me preguntó el señor es por que vía hiciera la reserva, entiendo que si no la hubiera hecho directamente con ellos echaría balones fuera.
",1,2023,03,01
47,Personal de tarde poco profesional,"Llegamos el día de 19 de febrero y hasta las 19 de la tarde no nos dieron la habitación, tenían problemas con el wifi. Las chicas del mediodía fueron muy amables y nos explicaron el problema que había. Nos marchamos a pasar la tarde pero cuando llegamos a las 19 fueron muy bordes y nos trataron fatal cuando no les dijimos nada más que eran las 19 de la tarde y que habían tenido tiempo de buscar una solución para buscar una habitación. Esta misma tarde día 20 el mismo personal de ayer por la tarde, cuando hemos ido a por nuestras maletas nos han atendido fatal y nos han mandado a nosotros a por las maletas cuando ellos estaban de tertulia sin hacer nada y finalmente no hemos encontrado dicha habitación y nos la ha traído el recepcionista de muy malas formas.
Conclusión poca profesionalidad del personal de la tarde.",2,2023,02,21

Siamo stati coccolati, ogni nostro desiderio è stato esaudito nel migliore dei modi, albergo eccellente da tutti i punti di vista prima colazione ottima ,personale incredibilmente gentile e tra tutti spicca sempre il responsabile del desk Cristina che si è spesa in tutti modi per rendere quest’occasione un ricordo fantastico in tutti i minimi particolari:perfino nella torta davvero eccellente fatta preparare da un’ottima pasticceria, nella eccellente cena al Filigrana ottimo ristorante dentro l’albergo  e poi nella preparazione a sorpresa della nostra suite e del regalo delle bottiglie di ottimo spumante…insomma un soggiorno davvero super e indimenticabile che meglio non poteva essere.
Grazie Cristina,grazie Catalonia Barcelona Plaza:un grandissimo hotel e sempre in miglioramento.",5,2022,11,13

47,Eccezionale esperienza,"Per un disguido avevo perso la prenotazione della camera al Sagrada Famiglia di Barcellona (3stelle), notte 29/30 ottobre 2022. Ringrazio molto la ragazza bionda capelli lunghi della reception che mi ha trovato una camera presso il Plaza Espanya di Barcellona, categoria superiore allo stesso prezzo della camera persa. Inoltre durante l'attesa ci è stato offerto un bicchiere di vino di cava. Il taxi per il trasferimento è stato a spese dell'albergo. Infine, quando mi sono accorto di aver perso il carnet di biglietti della metropolitana, la ragazza bruna, capelli lunghi della reception che era a lavoro il 29 ottobre mattina al Plaza mi ha regalato un carnet quasi intatto di un altro cliente che lo aveva lasciato lì. Grazie mille siete stati gentilissimi ed eccezionali.",5,2022,10,31

La ubicacion excelente y cerca de todos los sitios importantes. Recomiendo las habitaciones con vistas a la plaza.

47,Excelente hotel en Barcelona,"Excelente hotel en Barcelona por muchas razones:
- Viajero de negocios: Situación inmejorable, pues está frente a la Fira Montjuic y muy cerca de la Fira Europa.
- Viajero de ocio: Muy buena situación. Delante de la puerta tiene una boca de metro que te permite ir a cualquier punto de la ciudad, y también paradas de autobús. En una de ellas para el que va al aeropuerto. Delante del hotel se encuentra la fuente mágica de Montjuic.
- El hotel. Es un hotel recientemente reformado, las instalaciones son excelentes. 
- Habitaciones. Las habitaciones son muy amplias y cómodas. Disponen de todo el equipamiento necesario para una buena estancia. En muchas, las vistas son excepcionales, pues desde la ventana se puede contemplar la plaza de España y la fuente mágica de Montjuic.
- Personal excelente. Muy profesional y amable. Otro punto fuerte del hotel.
- Limpieza. Inmejorable.
- Servicios. El desayuno es un buffet muy variado y abundante. Tiene un restaurante (Filigrana), de comida catalana muy recomendable, y también un restaurante japonés (Kurai) y una cafetería. También dispone de salones amplios para eventos. Cuenta con un centro de estética con masajes y tratamientos, y tiene gimnasio.
- La terraza. En la octava planta hay una terraza (The Clock), que tiene unas vistas increíbles de la ciudad y por supuesto, de la fuente mágica.  En la terraza hay una barra de bar, una buena piscina, y alrededor de ella, camas balinesas, tumbonas y mesas.
- Precio. Buena relación calidad/precio.
Este hotel es mi recomendación como alojamiento en Barcelona. Mi familia y yo nos alojamos en él cada año y, por supuesto, repetiremos.",5,2022,09,09
47,Finde de desconexión,Hemos pasado un fin de semana maravilloso. Las instalaciones son modernas y limpias. Nos hicieron un cambio a una habitación superior y nos pusieron un detalle en la habitación. Desayuno muy completo. La piscina un poco colapsadla de gente pero con unas vistas y un ambiente muy acogedor. Todo el personal del hotel fue muy amable y atento pero quiero agradecer especialmente a Cristina por su amabilidad y ayuda en todo momento. Tuvimos una pequeña incidencia en la habitación y lo solventaron muy rápido. Volveremos de nuevo cuando podamos volver a tener una oportunidad de descanso y desconexión.,5,2022,09,06
47,Lebendig vielleicht bald tot,"Eine seht interessante Großstadt, relativ sauber, guter ÖV, Super Restaurants, freundliche Leute, teilweise schlechte Bedienung in Bars und Restaurants. Das Schlimmste aber ist der weitverbreitete Cannabiskonsum. An jeder Ecke wird gekifft. In 10 Jahren gibt es hier nur noch Potheads und Zombies und und Lewa wird den Rekord im Eigentor schiessen aufgestellt haben!",3,2022,09,05
47,Una calida bienvenida con una copa de regalo en la preciosa terraza . Las habitaciones increibles. La atencion 100 punto,"Muy buena recepcion, calidez y atención. Ganas de quedarse mas !

Las habitaciones amplias y espaciosas , todo para estar increíblemente en familia .
Agradable y familiar",5,2022,09,03
47,Oltre l’apparenza…,"Abbiamo alloggiato qui 4 notti: la posizione dell’hotel è ottima, purtroppo però i servizi non altrettanto.
Entrati in camera c’era un odore fortissimo di scarichi: avvisato il personale c’hanno detto che avrebbero mandato qualcuno a controllare. È arrivata una signora delle pulizie che parlava solo spagnolo e c’ha fatto capire che avrebbe spruzzato del profumo ed arieggiato la stanza per vedere come andava (magari poteva essere utile farla accompagnare da qualcuno che parlasse anche inglese): rientrati dopo cena l’odore era ancora pesante ma essendo tardi abbiamo aspettato la mattina per avvisare la reception: risultato stanza nuova ma più piccola, con comunque problemi di odori dagli scarichi anche se molto più lievi.
Ascensori: ce ne sono  almeno 6 ma spesso bloccati. In uno addirittura la figlia di una mia amica è rimasta chiusa dentro.
Pulizie: abbiamo dovuto più volte chiedere alla reception gli asciugamani perché essendo in 3 in camera ce ne lasciavano due, ricarica sapone è stata sollecitata, idem per la carta igienica 
I pro: personale molto gentile. Alla fine ci hanno offerto il parcheggio
Tutti questi inconvenienti non sono gravi ma li segnalo perché comunque è un 4 stelle: l’hotel è bello ma questo non basta a sopperire ad un’attenzione al cliente doverosa",3,2022,09,02
47,Estancia maravillosa,"Un hotel genial!

47,¡¡¡Maravilloso!!!,Genial el fin de que he pasado con mis amigos en este hotel de Barcelona. Cercano a todos los sitios emblematicos de la ciudad y muy bien comunicado. Habitacion triple amplia y muy limpia. Gimnasio muy completo para ser de un hotel. Terraza muy Grandes y muy bonita,5,2022,08,11
47,Finde genial!,He pasado el finde con mis amigas y la verdad desde que llegamos el trato de todo el personal ha sido excelente. Muy amables y siempre dispuestos a ayudar. Las habitaciones con vistas a la plaza España son muy bonitas. La piscina un poco pequeña para lo grande que es el hotel.,5,2022,08,11
47,Estancia Perfecta,"Desde la llegada al hotel, todo fue genial, me atendió Carla, una chica muy joven y la verdad que súper simpática!

Definitivamente recomendaría este hotel.",5,2022,08,07
47,Il top a Barcellona,"Hotel veramente eccellente sia per la posizione che per la comodità e confort delle camere.pulizia sempre eccellente,colazione ottima e ricca di tutte le specialità spagnole ,molto bella e confortevole la zona piscina dotata di grandi letti per il sole e di un bar attrezzatissimo.Ma quello che rende sempre indimenticabile la nostra vacanza in questo hotel è la cordialità e disponibilità di tutto il personale e soprattutto la professionalità di Cristina sempre eccezionale nell’individuare le nostre esigenze e nel risolverle al meglio:persona veramente unica tra tutte quelle incontrate nei nostri soggiorni negli hotel di tutto il mondo.",5,2022,08,02
47,vamos a hablar del parking,"hedor a orines por todas partes no hay una pared y/o columna que no muestre rastro de haber sido orinada,el  suelo no se ha limpiado nunca y ahora en temporada alta basura botellas y cualquier cosa imaginable por los suelos . muy mala imagen para el hotel",1,2022,08,01
47,Bueno  pero no el servicio en la terraza,"Terraza magnifica, servicio de recepción excelente, gracias  Linda por su bienvenida, simpatía y profesionalidad, haciéndonos sentir como en casa.  Desafortunadamente   opino que la dirección del hotel debería invertir en la formación de sus camareras de piscina, bastante desganadas, no muy amables con los clientes y lo peor no saben ( o quizás no quieren ) hacer un Mojito en condiciones, lástima porque eso le ha bajado nota a mi review del hotel",3,2022,08,01
47,Atención al cliente excepcional,"Fue una experiencia placentera, teníamos en la planta 6° unas vistas espectaculares y la comida de cortesía en vez de estar en la habitación lo ponían en cestas grandes comunes a todas las habitaciones del mismo pasillo y eran: 1 cesta de manzanas rojas, 1 cesta de manzanas verdes, y una cesta de crackets. La terraza O’clock espectacular con unas vistas inmejorables, el desayuno abundante y variado.
Lo negativo es que no tiene spa interior con jacuzzi o piscina interna (se espera de un hotel que pone que tiene “spa”); y el baño de la habitación no tiene escobilla del inodoro, algo insólito en un baño y bastante antihigiénico.
La atención al cliente excepcional.",5,2022,08,01
47,Mesiversario. Up the Iron!!,"El hotel es una pasada. Al llegar, a pesar de tener doble sup nos cedieron una suite. La habitación era inmejorable. El servicio genial. La limpieza muy correcta. El desayuno muy variado y abundante, con una media hora de cortesía para entrar. Unas vistas ideales desde la habitación. El espacio de piscina se llena demasiado, pero es muy agradable.Todo de 10.",5,2022,07,31
47,Gran experiencia,"Desde que entramos al hotel el recibimiento fue impecable. Personal muy amable en recepción, con ganas de que disfrutes de tu estancia en Barcelona. La habitación era espaciosa, con vistas, limpia y súper confortable. Nosotros teníamos desayuno incluido, excelente y muy variado. Como punto a destacar, la piscina en la azotea con vistas a Plaza España es inmejorable. Sin duda volveremos!!",5,2022,07,26
47,Urlaub in Barcelona,"Sehr schön gelegenes Hotel am Placa Espanya. Ca. 15 Autominuten vom Strand entfernt. Sehr gut war das nebenan gelegene Einkaufszentrum mit vielen Geschäften und Restaurants. Bars und Cafés in der Nähe. Top Dachterrasse mit Pool. Leider meistens sehr voll. Die Bar auf der Dachterrasse ist verbesserungswürdig, da man sich keine Bar nennen sollte wenn man nicht mal RedBull hat. Cocktails waren überteuert für das was man bekommt. Qualität und Preis-Leistung der Bar ist zu optimieren.
 Insgesamt ein schöner Urlaub. Ich war dort für eine Woche mit Freunden. Alles in allem sehr zu empfehlen. Ich komme wieder!!",4,2022,07,26
47,Experiencia única,"Desde que llegamos al hotel fue fantástico!!!! El personal de recepción fue excelente, muy profesionales y amables.

47,Wonderful experience,"Un hotel maravilloso con una ubicación perfecta! Gracias al personal del hotel por ayudarnos a conocer Barcelona con sus consejos, fueron muy atentos y amables con nosotros.
El restaurante The Clock tiene unas vistas maravillosas de la ciudad",5,2022,07,25
47,Abglanz vergangener Tage,"Lage: perfekt für Business und Urlaub
Ausstattung: sehr schöner Dachpool und schöne Roofbar
Zimmer: teilweise renoviert, teilweise jedoch nicht, d.h. viel Glück, denn ansonsten wackelige Badinstallationen und spritzende Wasserhähne
Schimmel in Bad und Zimmer
nahezu nicht verwendbarer Zimmersafe
nicht unbedingt sauber
Personal: teilweise sehr engagiert und freundlich, teilweise extremst unverschämt 
Frühstück: im Keller (!), großes Angebot, das aber kaum aufgefüllt wird, kalte Spiegeleier und kein heißes Wasser für den Tee
Preis/Leistung: zu teuer, da nicht mehr zeitgemäß, unser Unternehmen wird dort nicht mehr buchen.",2,2022,07,24
47,Ad un passo da La Rambla,"Abbiamo soggiornato in una stanza al 5° piano della struttura, con terrazzo e vista sulla piscina, stanza dalla superficie un poco risicata rispetto alla categoria, ma appena ristrutturata compreso il bagno con una spaziosa doccia. L'Hotel è stato creato dalla fusione di 2 edifici (uno risalente alla Belle Epoque e l'altro di inizio '900) con caratteristiche architettoniche e logistiche diverse. Noi abbiamo alloggiato in quello più recente. Servizio in camera puntuale e professionale. Reception attenta alle esigenze dei clienti.",4,2022,07,23
47,La terraza es maravillosa para cenar y tomar algo,"Estuvimos cenando en la terraza del hotel. Cenamos de lujo ya que tienen uno de los mejores japoneses de Barcelona. Destacó además de las vistas el ambiente que se crea y el servicio que es de calidad, casi imposible de encontrar en Barcelona. Te hacen sentir muy muy bien.",5,2022,07,15
47,"Una estafa, para no volver más!","Hicimos reserva en este hotel porque ya habíamos estado anteriormente varias veces y nos gustó las habitaciones, trato del personal, etc. En esta ocasión nos sucedió lo siguiente, paguemos por una habitación superior ya que era nuestro aniversario, y cuando lleguemos al hotel nos dijeron no tenían habitación hasta las 15 horas. Con lo del Covid y siendo verano, no pusimos queja porqué entendemos el tema personal y limpieza. Cuál és la sorpresa que al darnos la habitación nos dan una doble. Fuimos a reclamar a recepción y la recepcionista nos dijo que eso és lo que había. Además sólo le indiquemos que queríamos la habitación limpia de polvo porque soy alérgica, y la verdad la limpieza dejaba mucho que desear. También no teníamos albornoz, ni jabón de ducha, y la habitación estaba bastante deteriorada. La verdad una completa decepción! Con el check-out le hicimos comentario de lo sucedido y no nos dierons respuesta ninguna. En fin, con ese servicio al cliente, y viendo que no éramos las únicas que en recepción se estaban quejando, no volveremos más... ",1,2022,07,14
47,Demora en entregar la habitación,"El check-in es a las 3 pm sin embargo a esa hora me dijeron que la habitación no estaba lista y que regrese después de las 4 y a esa hora quizás esté lista pero no estaban seguros. No buscaron como solucionarlo ni preguntar información adicional, recibí simplemente un ""no lo sé""",2,2022,06,22
47,Hotel moderno muy bien ubicado,"Habitación amplia, moderna y con baños amplísimos. La piscina y pool bar con amplias infraestructuras de mesas y hamacas. Gimnasio bien dotado. La atención del personal excelente. Un único lunar: la organización del desayuno fue un poco caótica.

",5,2022,06,15
47,Agradabilísimo,Habitación muy confortable con vistas excelentes. Personal muy amable. Muy recomendable y muy céntrico. En nuestros viajes a Barcelona solemos alojarnos en este hotel por sus prestaciones. Cuando en alguna ocasión las cosas se han desvirtuado siempre reparan satisfactoriamente.,5,2022,06,07
47,Mala estancia.,"Mala conexión y ruidos desde temprano (antes de las 7 am) limpiando cristales del edificio. Excusas como que hay que conectarse vía IP o que hay un repetidor cerca de la habitación y no debería haber problemas. Nadie vino a la habitación, 3 días sin poder trabajar, cero soluciones.",1,2022,06,05
47,Sorprendente,"Ubicación fantástica, personal muy agradable y servicial, terraza increíble, camas enormes. Aislamiento muy bueno al exterior.
Desayuno bueno y detalle de zumo natural fresco y frio.

Como mejora quizá una cafetería en planta hall se agradecería.",5,2022,05,18
47,Muy buen Hotel,"Hemos estado 3 días alojados 5 matrimonios y el resultado ha sido excelente. Empezando por la amabilidad de todos sus empleados ( gracias Cristina por todo ) , las habitaciones limpias y  espaciosas y con unas vistas inmejorables, la ubicación ( a 10 minutos de la estación de Sants y el metro a la puerta ), el desayuno buffet estupendo y una terraza espectacular con unas vistas inmejorables.
resumiendo, ya tenemos nuestro hotel para siempre en Barcelona.",5,2022,05,18

47,"Muy buena situación, suciedad en rincones y ducha sin funcionar.","No volveré al hotel dado que el precio por lo que me ofrecieron no se corresponde.

47,Despertar viendo amanecer,"Henos estado alojadas en este hotel..y tanto su ubicación, trato y comodidad son de lo mejor. Sus vistas al amanecer mirando a la ciudad y a Montjuic son sin duda el mejor recuerdo de este Hotel..todo es amabilidad desde la primera persona que te recibe a la entrada hasta la última persona que te despide.Todo muy a mano metro, bus túristico..o ir dando un paseo...Volveré a ver el amanecer desde Catalonia",5,2022,04,12
47,Vistas de Barcelona,Pasamos un fin de semana en marzo y la estancia en el hotel fue más que excelente con unas preciosas vistas de Barcelona desde la habitación y desde la piscina. El persona agradable y atento en todo momento. Los desayunos completos aunque el sitio es frío. Localización cercana a todos los lugares de interés.,5,2022,04,11
47,Simplemente perfecto,"Dediqué mucho tiempo a buscar alojamiento para pasar un fin de semana en Barcelona. Somos una familia de 5 y es complicado encontrar algo donde podamos estar todos juntos. En la mayoría de hoteles, teniamos que coger dos habitaciones y eso encarecía muchísimo. En Catalonia Barcelona Plaza tienen suites familiares para hasta 6 personas donde hemos estado de maravilla. La habitación super espaciosa y todas las instalaciones del hotel son increíbles. La azotea donde se encuentra la piscina y las vistas desde allí son una pasada. Además la localización es ideal, según se sale del hotel tienes una boca de metro para poder moverte por toda Barcelona. Tambien destacar el centro comercial que hay enfrente, genial! Y el aparcamiento con acceso directo al hotel, tambien otro punto a favor. Vamos!! Es que ha sido todo perfecto!
Destacar tambien los dos restaurantes que se encuentran en el hotel: uno de estilo mediterráneo, y otro japonés. Se come de maravilla en ellos y no nos parecieron para nada caros ninguno de ellos. 
Sobre el resto de instalaciones del hotel, hay una sala con juguetes en la planta 7 que está muy bien, y la conexión WIFI tambien destaca por lo bien que funciona.",5,2022,03,28
47,Catalonia Plaza,"Emplazamiento muy bueno, excelentes vistas a la fuente mágica, muy buenas comunicaciones con parada de taxi, metro, aerobus, bus.. etc) personal muy agradable y habitaciones muy bien insonorizadas.
Solo un pero y supongo que sera por la polucion, las ventanas sucias así como el exterior del hotel muy sucio (no hago responsable al hotel dado que hay una boca de metro justo a la entrada y es un continuo fluir de personas).",4,2022,03,25
47,Top Hotel in toller Lage,"Immer wieder gerne!
Das Hotel punktet mit seiner tollen Lage am Plaza Espana, direkt am Fuße des Montjiuc-Berges mit dem Palau und dem Olympia-Gelände sowie dem Magic Fountain.

47,Fotoausrüstung sowie Bargeld Geklaut aus dem Zimmer und heftigst belogen,"Ich und ein Kollege sind gegen 20:00 Uhr angereist und wollten dann noch etwas in der City Essen gehen. Zimmer 649 eingecheckt und Gepäck abgelegt und gleich los.
um 20:25 sassen wir im Taxi in Richtung City. Als wir um 22:43 wieder zurück gekommen sind haben wir festgestellt, dass aus meinem Backpack meine Sony Kamera sowie Zubehör, Apple Earpads 2nd Edition sowie 100 Euro und eine angebrauchte Parfum Flasche entwendet worden ist. Als ich direkt in die Lobby gelaufen bin und den Diebstahl gemeldet hatte, wurden die Logs ausgelesen für mein Zimmer. Die Zuständige weibliche Person hat den Anschein gemacht etwas zu verheimlichen und hatte ein Gespräch mit der Receptionschefin diskutiert. Danach verschwanden beide kurz und kamen dann mit der Info, dass sie keinen Zutritt zu den Zimmer finden konnten und zeigte mir einen Ausdruck der angeblichen Logs.. nur komisch, dass der Zeitpunkt auf dem Ausdruck wann wir das Zimmer betreten haben um 20:25 war.. da waren wir jedoch bereits im Taxi .. Das hatte sie dann aber natürlich nicht richtig verstanden und meinte es wäre gut wenn ich einen Diebstahl bei der Polizei melden sollte. Nachdem ich Ihr laut ins Gesicht gelacht hatte mit dem Hinweis, dass die Spanische Polizei nicht dafür bekannt ist, dass sie helfen würde.. bzw. sie einen ""feuchten"" drauf gibt ob etwas gestohlen wurde oder nicht . Ich gehe hier stark davon aus , dass die Damen hier ganz genau wussten was hier passiert ist und versuchten sich ganz klassisch aus der Affäre zu ziehen. Sollte jemand einen ähnlichen Fall erlebt haben im selben Hotel, bitte kontaktieren. Wir versuchen gerade eine Sammelklage einzureichen.",1,2022,03,09
47,Inmejorable,He pasado el fin de semana con mi hermana y mi hija y todo ha ido mejor de lo esperado. El registro de entrada rapido y sin esperas. Nos atendio Cristina y nos dio toda la informacion de la ciudad y del hotel. La habitacion para las tres muy limpia. Nos dio una habitacion superior a la que habiamos reservado. Las vistas desde la terraza excepcionales. Lastima que ha llovido y el tiempo no ha sido el esperado. Javier nos atendio muy atento y profesional dandonos  reseñas e informacion de todas nuestras preguntas. La limpieza excelente y en general todo el personal atento y siempre haciendote sentir bienvenido. Cristina nos dio una salida mas tarde de lo habitual y nos fue muy bien puesto que el avion nos salia tarde y pudimos descansar antes de viajar. Gracias Javier y Cristina y a todos. Muy amables.

Su servicio es muy atento y amable, siempre dispuesto a ayudar con cualquier necesidad. Las habitaciones son espaciosas y con unas vistas a Plaza España privilegiadas. 
En cuanto a sus instalaciones, son de alta calidad y se encuentran en perfecto estado. Además, el hotel se encuentra en una muy buena localización.

47,Un hotel ideal,"La estancia en este hotel ha sido maravillosa, estuve solo una noche y acabe enamorada del hotel. Solo por la ubicación ya es un hotel excelente. Las instalaciones son un gusto, las habitaciones tienen una luz natural fantástica, y por no hablar de las impresionantes vistas. Gracias al servicio porque su trato ha hecho que la estancia haya acabado de ser ideal, toda la estancia estuvieron a nuestra disposición y siempre muy amables. Sobretodo en el desayuno pudimos disfrutar de la simpatía del servicio y la verdad es que se agradece encontrar a gente tan buena.

47,Habitación y trato excelentes,"Acudí un fin de semana, tras haber estado un mes antes en previamente en hoteles de la cadena Catalonia y acceder a su programa de puntos. Habiendo disponibilidad, me ofrecieron sin gasto adicional un aumento de categoría superior de habitación, sumamente confortable (silenciosa, amplia, elegante y cómoda) en comparación con otras experiencias hoteleras previas en Barcelona. El trato del personal de recepción (Cristina en el check in, Linda en check out) encantador, todo facilidades ante mis varias dudas, el tipo de cosas que marca la diferencia. Primera vez que voy, pero no será la última.",5,2021,12,24
47,Buena ubicación,"Un buen Hotel, situado en una zona muy bien comunicada, con parada de metro justo delante y parada de taxis, la habitación amplia y con unas vistas espectaculares de la plaça Espanya i la montaña de Montjuic. El desayuno tipo bufete bastante completo, la sala del restaurante un poco austera. La única crítica es que la calefacción en la habitación estaba demasiado alta lo que nos impedió descansar correctamente",4,2021,12,08
47,Gracias,"Viajé por trabajo y me alojé aquí por recomendación de una buena amiga. Las instalaciones son una pasada, la ubicación es inmejorable y mi habitación me encantó.

Con gente así da gusto.",5,2021,12,02
47,World Expo Barcelona,"Insgesamt zufrieden. Die Schlafqualität war mangelhaft, da die Temperatur im Zimmer zu hoch eingestellt war und trotz mehrfache Nachfrage an der Rezeption nicht verändert wurde. So musste ich bei offenen Fenster schlafen und der Verkehrslärm war die ganze Nacht sehr hoch. Beim Doppelbett wären zwei Bettwäschen/Einzeldecken bequemer. ",3,2021,11,22
47,Hotel muy comodo con buena ubicacion,"La ubicacion del hotel es excelente, con amplias habitaciones, muy limpio e increiblemente silencioso para ser un hotel. 

El personal es muy atento y amable. Ademas, el desayuno es impresionante, merece la pena. Ademas, su amplio comedor hace que que sea muy agradable.",5,2021,10,21
47,Más que correcto,"Desde luego encontrar un hotel en Barcelona a este precio y con las prestaciones que tiene, es difícil. No tenemos peros que objetar, quizás el tamaño de las habitaciones, aunque paramos poco en él, por lo que nos importaba era todo lo demás.
Muy bien",5,2021,10,14
47,correcto,"El baño de la habitación es muy pequeño para ser una suite.
Pocos restaurantes o cafeterias. En la terraza debería haber algún tipo de servicio incluso en otoño . El japonés tendría que estar abierto aunque fuera lunes ya que el martes era fiesta nacional. ",4,2021,10,13
47,Repetiremos seguro!!,"Hemos repetido hotel y una vez más ha sido una estancia excelente! El trato de todo el personal es muy bueno, la habitacion impresionante y las vistas preciosas!!!

Repetiremos seguro!",5,2021,09,19
47,Hotel 4 stelle con gestione approssimativa,"Ottimo hotel, splendida piscina sul tetto, disponibilità di parcheggio ma... Alcune cose sono da migliorare. La manutenzione in primis. Ho segnalato appena entrata in camera che il tappo del bidet era rotto....l'ho segnalato per più volte ma sono rimasta tre giorni con l'acqua stagnante nel bidet. Ho avuto anche un problema al momento del check out anche se la camera era pre pagata. La colazione era sufficiente. La pulizia della camera e aree comuni era poco più che sufficiente. ",3,2021,09,18

El desayuno en una área cubierta, muy iluminada, super espaciosa y con una variedad increíble. Diferente clases de panes, pancakes que podías hacerlos tu mismo, mermeladas, tortillas que una señora te hacía con los ingredientes que tu escogias, diferentes tipos de yougures, leches, frutas, fiambres y cereales. Cafes, tes, y zumos. Incluso había limón y  jingebre",5,2021,09,03
47,Excelente escapada romántica. ,"Hemos ido con mi esposa a celebrar nuestro aniversario de boda y hemos quedado encantados con el servicio y la calidad del hotel.

Nos hemos alojado en una habitación executive (546). Las vistas son impresionantes y la insonorización excelente. Se respira una calma absoluta (estando el hotel en temporada alta y con muchos huéspedes).

Calidad, confort, elegancia...sobran las palabras.

Este hotel es el establecimiento perfecto para una noche romántica. ",5,2021,08,08

47,Hotel da incubo!!!,"Metto una stella perché non si può mettere meno..hotel scadente,vecchio e sporco..l'unica cosa positiva è la posizione..durante il nostro soggiorno di circa 2 settimane siamo rimasti molto delusi,iniziamo dalla pulizia delle camere,pessima!!le cameriere non pulivano,abbiamo dovuto chiamare il ricevimento per far sì che la camera venisse ripulita..dall impianto di condizionamento usciva tantissima polvere,e si dormiva malissimo.
In più una notte ho dimenticato sul mio comodino la mia collana d'oro(era un regalo di matrimonio)e la sera dopo era sparita..quando sono andata a lamentarmi sono stata presa per bugiarda dall'addetta al ricevimento..ho dovuto fare una denuncia alla polizia per questo e la mia collana è sparita nel nulla..è troppo caro per quello che offre..pessimo!ci sono tantissimi hotel nei dintorni superiori a questo!!!",1,2021,07,24

47,Excelente,Primera vez en esta ciudad y el primer acierto ya fue el hotel. Excelente hotel y excelente trato del personal. Tan solo un pequeño mal entendido con el horario de la cena que finalmente lo solventaron quedando a la altura. Gracias por la amabilidad de todo el personal. Lo recomiendo 100%. Volveremos.,5,2021,04,18
47,Escelente ubicación e instalaciones y un gran problema la calefacción,"Todo excelente ubicación e instalaciones en general ,  pero la verdad me parece increíble que en un hotel de esta categoría no puedas hacer uso de la calefacción de manera individual . Tal día como hoy tengo frío dentro de la habitación ,  he querido ponerla para ambientarla y no funciona y  me han dicho que me suben si quiero un manta pero que la calefacción no está conectada . Francamente no puedo entenderlo , es un servicio básico hoy día es la primera vez que me ocurre . No doy crédito .",3,2021,04,16
47,Muy cómodo y silencioso,"Hemos estado este fin de semana en el hotel, y a pesar de estar en Plaza España es de lo más silencioso.

47,Fin de semana de desconexión total !,"Gran fin de semana. Estancia insuperable en este fantástico hotel.
Ubicación ideal. Preciosas vistas desde la espectacular terraza ""The clock"".

Todo ello sin olvidar al personal del hotel, encantador.
Muchísimas gracias por hacer nuestra estancia inolvidable.",5,2021,03,15

47,Fin de semana genial,"Ha sido un gran fin de semana en un hotel fantástico con unas vistas preciosas de mi ciudad. El trato del personal del hotel ha sido muy bueno, destacar la amabilidad de la recepcionista de la tarde-noche. También mencionar la comodidad de las camas y la variedad en el desayuno. 
Además siguen muy bien los protocolos covid aumentando la tranquilidad de cliente en los momentos en los que nos encontramos. Repetiremos seguro! :))",5,2021,02,22

Por otra parte, recomiendo cenar en el Kurai ( un restaurante muy bueno en el mismo edificio de sushi)",5,2020,12,14
47,Todo fué genial,"Todo super correcto , muy bien cuidados y con mucho cariño por parte de todo el mundo, tanto las habitaciones que son muy bonitas con unas vistas estupendas a la Plaza España como el restaurante,donde cenamos, con una calidad exquisita y que además celebrábamos un aniversario. Una noche genial. (para volver a repetir)",5,2020,11,23

",5,2020,11,16
47,comodo e funzionale,"4 stelle di livello, comodo alla metro con la fermata subito davanti. Stanze ampie così come gli ambienti comuni. Stupenda la terrazza con vista sulla piazza. I ristoranti erano chiusi causa covid ma questo a Barcellona non è sicuramente un problema.

Personale alla reception e sala  colazione molto gentile e disponibile. A ottobre  devo tornare  a Barcellona e mi sa che ci tornerò.  Esperienza positiva",4,2020,09,12
47,Sin Minibar,"Un hotel de esta categoría no puede no ofrecer un servicio de minibar. Sin ningun tipo refresco en la habitación, y de agua fresca.
Me enfadó muchísimo la situación: tener que reclamarlo tres veces; y que al final solo llevasen agua caliente.
Un olvido o fallo cualquiera, pero no solucionarlo o intentarlo por todos los medios, es otra cosa.",2,2020,09,07
47,Decepcionante ,"Opte por este hotel conociendo la cadena y leyendo opiniones... Decepción. Primeramente se siguen vendiendo habitaciones con beneficios (que escudados con el Covid) que no ofrecen pero te cobran el valor superior de la habitación alojándote en habitación normal.
Dudosa limpieza en la habitación. Buenas vistas pero a través de unos cristales en condiciones que no te hacen disfrutar de las mismas.
Bien por la piscina y bar aunque por supuesto que el protocolo contra el covid cojea.
Si te decides por este hotel no pagues por habitaciones con servicios superiores porque no los ofrecen. ",3,2020,09,03
47,Terraza Bar cero protocolo de seguridad ,"Buenas noches, fui con mi pareja a disfrutar de buenas vistas y un rato de relax, pero no pudimos. Al llegar encontramos un sitio en la barra con vistas al Montjuic y nunca vinieron a desinfectar ( había otros clientes antes sentados) en fin, nos sentamos esperando a que ""alguien nos atendiera para avisarles que debían limpiar la zona... Nos cansamos de llamar a la camarera que continuamente nos miraba y nos ignoraba. Finalmente 15' después vino un camarero, se disculpó y nos sirvió las bebidas, sin saber asesorarnos debidamente respecto a nada. Continuando con los métodos de protección y protocolo continuamente estaba no solo la camarera con mascarilla en la perilla (totalmente bajada) sino que de la cocina salía personal ""sin mascarillas"" directamente... también como en la foto, había personal dentro de la barra sin mascarilla  Luego unos clientes estaban en la piscina haciendo uso de los camastros ... Los cuales al marcharse ellos... no fueron desinfectados. Sólo los movieron ... No llegamos a terminar nuestras bebidas ... Preferimos marcharnos por nuestra seguridad. En estos tiempos habría más que nunca seguir las pautas de seguridad covid. ",1,2020,08,14
47,No servizi ,"Prenotiamo sempre i 4 stelle per i servizi che offrono ma questa volta devo dire che era meglio andare nel 2 stelle e non spendere 600 euro. La colazione e stata risicata considerando che la mattina mangio latte di soya (non prevenuta)  fette biscottate (non pervenute ) e marmellata ( solo fragole e albicocche) . I ristoranti sono tutti chiusi quindi se vuoi pranzare o prendere un aperitivo in piscina non si puo. Tutto questo a causa dell'emergenza Covid . Queste restrizioni le posso capire e le accetto ,ma nn puoi fare pagare prezzo intero se non offri i servizi adeguati!!!",2,2020,07,19
47,Simplemente excelente,"Recibimos un trato exquisito en un hotel que cumple con creces. Des del servicio, limpieza, seguridad, y atención, hasta el trato de todo el personal.

Me ha perjudicado porque el hotel tenia que haberlo pagado la empresa que me invito y por error de comunicación entre esta empresa y el hotel cuando de aclaro ya lo había pagado yo por este motivo.",3,2020,03,17
47,qualche giorno di relax,"bella struttura,moderna e allo stesso tempo accogliente.
camera spaziosa e molto carina come anche il bagno,con pulizia perfetta,niente che non fosse al proprio posto.
ottima anche la colazione,forse al ristorante farei meno ""mensa"".
ottima la posizione per chi si vuole spostare .",5,2020,03,13
47,Sin poder dormir en absoluto por ruido de otros clientes,"No se pudo dormir nada debido al escándalo de otros clientes irresponsables que eran jovenes británicos que estaban chillando, con la musica alta y dando portazos en la puerta que teniamos pegada a nuestra habitación. A ciertos perfiles de clientes deben de darle un consentimiento informado que si hacen escándalo pueden llamar a la polícia y echarlos del hotel. ",2,2020,03,10

47,Perfectas instalaciones!! Pero cuidado con quien tratas...,"Estuvimos varios días alojados en el hotel, sus instalaciones son inmejorables y muy modernas, en continuo mantenimiento. La cama de la habitación perfecta.

El trato del personal puede variar, desde comentarios y miradas fuera de lugar (Como los de Olga) supuesta “maitre“ en los desayunos. O como el trato poco delicado de Rafa en el Gourmet Corner Bar.

Al igual que menciono el trato desagradable, tengo que mencionar el trato por parte de Jaime y Alfredo que fueron intachables y muy cuidadosos en el Gourmet Corner Bar.

Por ello desgraciadamente me voy con una sensación agridulce.",3,2020,03,03
47,Hotel muy recomendable.,"Ayudaron a que el viaje en familia fuera extraordinario. El personal muy amable y atento, las instalaciones de lujo. Instalaciones muy cuidadas. Desayuno impresionante, como pocos he visto en hoteles.",5,2020,03,02

47,Cómodo,"Me gustó todo, menos el check-in, porque se puede entrar a partir de las 3 de la tarde. Muy buen desayuno con gran variedad. Las habitaciones cálidas. Las camas muy cómodas. El último día tuve que salir pronto y no pude ir a desayunar y me prepararon un picnic para llevar. Fue una decepción total. Con lo que cuesta el desayuno ya podrían preparar algo más elaborado y de mejor calidad, y no lo más barato y económico.",4,2020,02,11
47,"Lo mejor, el desayuno","Un hotel de buen nivel, bien ubicado, en el que destaca el desayuno.

Trato muy correcto, pero faltando mayor simpatía en recepción.

La habitación es una pasada pero hay que mejorar algunas cosas el rociador de ducha que no salía casi agua,la luz del minibar no se apaga y por la noche molesta, durante toda la estancia se escuchó un ruido en la habitación bastante molesto.La limpieza también se puede mejorar. En conclusión hay que cuidar más los detalles por el precio del hotel. Las chicas de recepción  muy majas. Cenamos en el restaurante filigrana y todo muy bien tanto la comida como el servicio.",3,2020,02,06
47,Fantástico Hotel en Plaza España!!😊,Hola!! Me encanta el Hotel Catalonia Barcelona Plaza!! Es un Hotel muy grande y fantástico para estar unos días en Barcelona solo!! La comida del Restaurante Japonés es buenísima y también del Restaurante Filigrana!! El personal ha sido conmigo muy simpáticos y muy agradables durante mi estancia en el Hotel!! El desayuno es gigantesco!! Y tienen una gran variedad de productos mediterráneos!! Es un Hotel grande en la Plaza España que se puede ir fácilmente en cualquier parte de Barcelona!! Ya sea en transporte público y en taxi!! Los precios son normales en el Hotel ni caro ni barato!! Lo que se puede mejorar en el Hotel es si es posible que los Hoteles Catalonia cambie los Uniformes del personal!! Los encuentro súper serios el gris y el rojo!! Tendrían que ser más felices los colores de los uniformes para trabajar!! En la próxima estancia en Barcelona volveré al mismo Hotel!! Saludos a todos!!😊,5,2020,02,01

(PLANTA1, hab 155). Mando de TV no funcionaba, tras cambiarlo la antena no estaba sintonizada, el teléfono tampoco funciona (para resolver las incidencias tienes que pasearte a recepción)...

47,Pésimo servicio en aseo de habitaciones y mala atención de Cristina la supuesta encargada o subgerente. ,"Salimos a las 7 de la Mañana a nuestro tour por la ciudad, fuimos a comer y regresamos a las 17:30 para descansar, y cual fue nuestra sorpresa, que de las dos habitaciones que tenemos no las habían aseado porque según Cristina la subgerente,  si es que así s ele puede llamar, el personal sale los domingos a las 18:00 y muy déspota y prepotente nos comento que si queríamos sino que ella no podía hacer más y que entendiéramos sus políticas del hotel. 

La ubicación está muy bien pero tengan cuidado con las supuestas políticas de aseo en fines de semana, que la vdd se me hace un Mal comentario ya que en ninguna parte del mundo los hoteles tiene restricción de aseo en fines de semana.

47,Barcelonas Hermosa en Navidad,Muy Buena experiencia en Barcelona.  Gracias los jovenes del front desk siempre fueron muy amables y dispuestos a ayudarnos. El invierno de este año no fue tan fuerte estuvo de 65* a 45* y eso no es muy frio pero el hotel no tenia disponible el aire acondicionado.  Compre un ventilador para poder dormir bien pero no fue suficiente y abrir la Ventana no es lo mejor. El desayuno estaba muy Bueno y muy completo. La limpieza y la localidad muy buenas tambien. Me encanto esta temporada porque ya todos estaba decorado de Navidad y sus calles y mercados son bien lindos.,4,2019,12,16

47,Buon hotel in ottima posizione,"Al contrario di quanto ci si potrebbe aspetttare dalla vecchia facciata dell'abergo, la struttura dispone di camere moderne dotate di tutti i comfort e all'altezza delle sue 4 stelle. Alcuni difetti sono: la scarsa insonorizzazione delle camere verso i corridoi (ottima quella verso la strada), la poca cordialità e professionalità di qualche membro del personale e il comfort del terzo letto aggiunto (materasso troppo duro). Punto di forza sono la posizione (vicinissimo alla metro e alle principali attrazzioni) e l'ottima vista dalla terrazza e di alcune stanze su piazza di Spagna.",4,2019,12,14
47,Basura de atencion y servicio,"Me dejaron sin mi reserva de este hotel al llegar al mismo, no me dejaron poner/sellar una reclamación. 
Me dieron como solución otro hotel y un taxi, lo cual por supuesto no acepté. Pedi ser atendido por el director/ responsable, el cual se limito a dar directrices desde su cómodo despacho sin dar la cara. 
Soy cliente habitual de la cadena, y no volveré jamas. 
Por supuesto no recomendaría esta cadena. ",1,2019,12,11

47,Sehr schönes Hotel an prima Lage,"Das Hotel liegt direkt am Placa Espanya, zur Rambla geht es in wenigen Minuten mit der U-Bahn, direkt vor dem Hotel, oder zu Fuss über die schöne Grande Via in etwa 25 Minuten. Die Zimmer sind sehr modern und sauber, das gesamte Hotel ist modern ausgestattet, auf dem Dach im 8. Stock hat es eine schöne Bar mit fantastischem Ausblick. Der Grossteil des Personals ist sehr freundlich (siehe auch negative Punkte). Das Frühstücksbuffet hat zwar viel Abwechslung, doch wird nicht überall gleich frisch aufgefüllt.
Wie gesagt, der Grossteil des Personals ist sehr freundlich, ausser beim Frühstück. Am Eingang wird man noch sehr freundlich begrüsst - und auch wieder verabschiedet - aber im Raum selber ist das Personal eher mürrisch und wenig hilfreich unterwegs. Wenn Besteck auf dem Tisch fehlt, muss man es sich selber zusammen suchen auf anderen Tischen. Früchte oder auch Orangensaft wird zum Beispiel nur sehr langsam und nicht immer wirklich frisch nachgefüllt. Ansonsten ist das Hotel wirklich top!",5,2019,10,15

47,Ottima Esperienza ,"Ho alloggiato in questo hotel per tre notti in occasione di un congresso.
L’hotel si trova direttamente su Plaça de España. All’uscita dell’hotel ci sono a due passi le scale che portano alla metropolitana. Le mie camere (ho dovuto cambiare dopo la prima notte perché mi era stata data una camera di categoria superiore) erano entrambe ristrutturate da pochissimo, spaziose e molto pulite. Enorme la cabina doccia. All’ottavo piano c’è la terrazza con piscina e bar con una vista spettacolare. Molto bella e funzionale anche la palestra. Ottima la colazione.

Es un edificio emblemático con una terraza con una vista quizá la mejor de BCN.
Personal muy muy amable.
Instalaciones clásicas bien mantenidas. Es enorme, muchísimas habitaciones.
Las habitaciones, muy amplias, muy limpias. Entre los peros: mal insonorizadas, un olor como a tabaco, no hay puerta en el WC que separe del baño.
Buffet desayuno de gran calidad, pastelería muy buena, cava y vino blanco, café de varios tipos, incluyendo tipo Nespresso.

47,Tolles Rooftop Pool,"Das Hotel ist sehr zentral gelegen und ist gut den öffentlich Verkehrsmitteln erreichbar vom Flughafen. Das Taxi hat 48 Euro gekostet vom Flughafen hier hin. Vor der Fahrt den Preis frage oder zu verhandeln kann sich lohnen. Mit einer 2 Tages U-Bahn Karte für 15 Euro ist man mobile mehrere Linien sind in der Nähe. Das Camp Nou Stadion des FC Barcelona kann direkt ohne umsteigen erreicht werden in ca. 30 Minuten.
Das Zimmer war sehr gut, angenehme Betten, tolle walk in Dusche. USB Anschlüsse können benutzt werden, um ohne Adapter Geräte zu laden. Der Roof top Pool und die Terrasse dazu mit den Liegeplätzen top! Die Bargetränke zu fairen Preisen. (Bier 6 Euro, Drink um die 10 Euro)
Das Frühsück war aus meiner Optik eher durchschnittlich und der Aufbau und der sehr grosse Esssaal wirkte für mich eher wie eine Kantine. Ein sehr gutes Hotel das seinen Preis hat, aber dafür auchbwas bietet.",4,2019,09,15

Zimmer-TV konnte nicht angesehen werden trotz Hinweis auf der Programmliste am TV- Gerät. Wurde dann gemeldet an der Reception und uns mitgeteilt, dass dieser Sache umgehendst bearbeitet wird. Leider fand dies während unseres Aufenthaltes nicht mehr statt.
Bad -Artikel (z. B.Handtücher) wurden jeden Tag  erneuert o. ergänzt.",5,2019,09,01
47,Hier werden Sie bestohlen,"Ja, schütteln Sie nur den Kopf ob der Überschrift. Und lesen Sie anschließend mal noch ein paar andere negative Bewertungen - das Thema kommt da auch nochmals vor.

Doch der Reihe nach...
Man fragt sich, wie dieses Haus ein ""Zertifikat für Exzellenz"" bekommen kann und was die Leute einnehmen, die hier eine Bewertung mit mehr als 3 Sternen vornehmen. Die einzige Erklärung: Es gibt Zimmer, die renoviert sind und solche, denen man das Jahr der Erbauung des Hauses anmerkt. Falls dem so ist, wäre meines dann eins aus der letzteren Kategorie gewesen.

Ich weiß gar nicht so recht, wo ich anfangen soll. Vielleicht bei der Lautstärke:

Placa Espanya sagt im Grunde schon alles, sprich: Verkehrsgünstig - man sollte deshalb ein Zimmer zum Innenhof nehmen. Aber auch dort ist es nicht gerade leise, denn z.B. die Klimaanlage tut ihr möglichstes, mit dem Straßenlärm mitzuhalten. Auch die Abflussgeräusche aus den Zimmern drüber tragen zu einem akustischen Erlebnis der besonderen Art bei.
In diesem Zusammenhang gut: Die Zwischentür im Zimmerflur, denn die schirmt die Geräusche aus dem Hotelflur, die infolge des schlecht verlegten billigen Laminatbodens entstehen, immerhin einigermaßen ab.
Alles in allem ist das Haus und das Zimmer aber extrem hellhörig.

Der Eindruck vom Zimmer beim Betreten: Abgeranzt. Lange nicht mehr so ein abgewohntes Haus gesehen.
Die Emaille-Wanne durch und durch beschädigt, die Fugen verschimmelt. Abplatzungen an Möbeln und Flecken überall. Die Abluft im Bad war defekt (was den Schimmel erklärt), die Klobürste versifft, Silberfischchen kamen zu Besuch in der Wanne. Tolle Sache...

Aber hey, wenn die Reinigungskräfte lieber nur ""zu Besuch"" kommen und eine Visitenkarte hinterlassen, statt tatsächlich auch zu reinigen, dann kommen die Sachen eben herunter und die Zimmer bleiben dreckig (wie in meinem Fall Bad/WC und Zimmerboden).

Meistens möchte man im Hotel ja auch schlafen. Dazu besorgt man sich zuerst gern frische Luft (das geht hier - was sehr positiv ist - durch Öffnen der Fenster (s. Innenhof)). Auch die Verdunklung funktioniert sehr gut.
Dann wäre da noch das Bett: Die Matratze war okay, das Kissen hingegen eine Zumutung.

Um auch mal was positives zu sagen: Das Frühstück ist sehr gut. Auch, wenn man sich im weitläufigen Speisezelt im Atrium des Gebäudeensembles erst ein wenig zurechtfinden muss: Die Auswahl ist sehr gut, die Speisen auch.

Ich weiß, Sie wollen, daß ich zum Punkt komme und die Überschrift rechtfertige.
Ich habe den großen Fehler begangen und mich nicht an das im Zimmer groß aufgestellte Schild gehalten, wonach Wertsachen unbedingt im Safe zu deponieren sind. Okay, ich hatte keine dabei - bis auf meine teuren Kopfhörer. Und die...lagen halt einfach so im Zimmer bzw. im offenen Koffer. Bis ich bei der Abreise merkte, daß sie da eben nicht mehr lagen.

Der Polizist war nur genervt, denn ich war wohl nicht der einzige, der die Wache gegenüber mit solcherlei Anzeigen belästigt.

Und das Hotel? Dem war's egal. Das hat am Ende behauptet, ich hätte den Kopfhörer (den ich nur zur Reise brauche, nicht zum Arbeiten) verloren. Die Auswertung der Daten des elektronischen Schlosses hätte ergeben, dass nur ich und der Reinigungsdienst im Zimmer waren. 
Eben, und da ich mir nicht selber meinen Kopfhörer klaue und der Reinigungsdienst die Angewohnheit hat, die Zimmer alle offen stehen zu lassen, gibt es doch einige Optionen, die eben sehr wohl im Einflussbereich des Hotels liegen. Dort sieht man sich jedoch nicht in der Pflicht.

Ich mich auch nicht, jedenfalls was einen weiteren Besuch dort angeht. 
Von mir aus kann das Haus Pleite gehen.",1,2019,09,01
47,Hervorragendes Hotel!,"Tolles Hotel in zentraler Lage! Direkt vor dem Hotel ist der Zugang zur Metro. Das Frühstück war hervorragend und das Personal äußerst zuvorkommend.

El personal muy amable y servicial.
En la planta 8 tienen una piscina con terraza con vistas espectaculares.

Aspectos negativos: por poner alguna pega.. cenamos una noche en la terraza y la comida tanto en cantidad como en elaboración esta un poco escasa. 
En general es un hotel muy sobresaliente a tener en cuenta a la hora de  alojarse en Barcelona.

La estación de Sants a 10 min caminando, lo que te permite moverte también por los alrededores de Barcelona en tren. Las habitaciones muy bien. El desayuno muy variado.

47,TODO DE MATRICULA MENOS UNA COSA,"Como ya he escrito anteriormente, y después de nuestra larga estancia. sólo existe una cosa que me chirría mucho en este Hotel. La falta de carros para transportar los platos y vasos de los clientes en la sala de desayunos. La implantación de dichos carros nos evitaria a los clientes tener que soportar escenas que nos llevan a  tiempos de exclavitud y que aportan una imagen nefasta y muy negativa a la cadena Catalonia. Estamos en la Barcelona del Siglo XXI",5,2019,08,02
47,buona posizione e bella piscina,"Peccato mi abbiano addebitato un giorno in più di parcheggio; qualche problema al ristorante; con la doccia bisogna fare in fretta perchè si rischia di allagare tutta la stanza mentre di accappatoio ne era previsto solo 1 per 2 persone e hanno fatto storie per darmi il secondo.
Per il resto tutto ok, ottimo hotel in ottima posizione. Comunque lo consiglio, prezzo nella media.",4,2019,08,01
47,"Todo fue excelente, salvo por un error","Quiero expresar una queja relacionada con su personal. Fuimos con las mejores expectativas. Cometimos un error y compramos un monopatín eléctrico, el cual uno de sus empleados llamado Franco Martinez Kopecky, quien es botones del hotel, quiso ayudarnos a embalar el monopatín y nos dijo que si no aceptaban que entre al avión por la batería de litio, que lo llamemos, que él lo retiraba y nos lo compraba. A lo cual confiamos en él y este señor cuando se dio cuenta que llegamos a nuestro destino, nos bloqueo por WhatsApp y para llamadas. Esto deja al hotel muy mal parado, y con gente así no nos dan ganas ni de volver ni de recomendarlo! Queremos que el señor nos pague o entregue el monopatín a una persona conocida de nosotros.",4,2019,07,30
47,Calidad y confort,"Recomiendo 100% este hotel bien de precio con preciosas instalaciones y muy bien ubicado de todo,

47,"Excelente ubicación, desayuno delicioso y variado.","El hotel esta en la Plaza Espanya justo al lado del centro comercial Las Arenas de Barcelona, y frente a la fuentes de Montjuic. Y a unos pocos pasos de la estación del metro, fácil acceso. El servicio en recepcion fue excelente, nos dieron un mapa y muy amablemente nos dieron las indicaciones para llegar a la Catedral de Santa Maria del Mar. La habitación muy amplia, limpia y cama muy cómoda, nos encantó la limpieza de las camas y el baño, además en la habitación hay un celular de cortesía para usarlo durante la estancia con internet y para llamadas locales. El desayuno estuvo muy variado y de buena calidad, 100% recomendado.",5,2019,07,26
47,"Live there, amazing experience","Barcelona Mola.

Una ciudad con mucho dinamismo, museos, parques, gastronomía, cultura.

Encontrarás montańa, playa, frío, calor, dependiendo de la estación en que vayas.

47,Gran noche para recordar,"Agradecimiento a todo el equipo de la Terraza ""The Clock""  q hicieron de nuevo,  q fuera un éxito nuestra celebración!!! Sin olvidarnos del dpto de Cocina q fue de 10!! Todo exquisito!!!!  Memorable noche!!!! Gracias !!!",5,2019,07,23
47,Excente terraza frente a Montjuïc,"En la 8a. Planta del Hotel Plaza de Barcelona, en la misma plaza España y frente a las fuentes de Montjuïc tienes la posibilidad de tomarte un combinado tranquilamente en un chillout maravilloso y relajarte antes o despues de cenar en alguno de los restaurantes del hotel. No te lo pierdas, hay que disfrutar de los paraisos de Barcelona y este es uno de ellos.",5,2019,07,23
47,Lugar paradisíaco,Fuimos a celebrar el cumpleaños de un familiar y estuvieron más que a la altura! El lugar de por si ya es increíble y el servicio y la comida imposible superar. Los camareros muy amables y no se les escapaba ningún detalle! Y felicitaciones a los cocineros ya q estaba todo buenísimo,5,2019,07,23
47,Increible!!!,Me ha encantado alojarme en este hotel por segunda vez! Todo el personal es amable y atento. Las habitaciones con vistas a la Plaza españa son espectaculares. La piscina impresionante y de noche mas aun. Espectacular el restaurante Japones. Volvere otra vez por seguro!,5,2019,07,20
47,Hotel molto confortevole ,"Bella struttura in posizione ottima, strategica per le visite in città. Alcuni piccoli dettagli sul servizio migliorabili (phon malfunzionante, due ciabattine per cinque ospiti) nel complesso consigliato. Barcellona stupenda ",4,2019,07,16
47,Simplemente perfecto,"La atencion del personal, lo servicial de sus empleados, el personal de recepcion espectacular, la terraza. La ubicacion perfecta para mis negocios, la habitacion espectacular. En definitiva todo me ha encantado y volvere!",5,2019,07,15
47,Increíble ,"Me quede por una semana y el trato fue excelente, las personas que trabajan en la terraza son tanto como Jaqueline que tuvo un muy buen trato conmigo y a los que atendía , los de las recepción hacen un muy buen trabajo , Alfredo me trato muy bien y siempre estuvo presente cuando tenia dudas y se hizo cargo de mis maletas. La ubicación es muy buena  con una vista increíble y es súper recomendable ",5,2019,07,15
47,Comodidad y practicidad,"Comodo y práctico cubriendo todas nuestras necesidades. Habitaciones con buena insonorización al exterior, quizás no tanto al interior, aún que dispone de dos puertas desde la habitación al pasillo. Repetiremos",5,2019,07,15
47,Recomendable por su ubicación,"Estube hospedado del 5 al 7 de este mes.
Mi viaje a Barcelona fue por trabajo y en principio tendría que haber sido alojado en el Sagrada Familia de la misma cadena.
En todo caso soy reward, cliente habitual de la cadena a nivel particular, por lo que no soy un cliente ""de paso"" por decirlo de alguna manera.
La llegada ya fue problemática pues el sagrada familia cobró por defecto una cantidad que en este hotel aún no les constaba (y a día de hoy todavía no ha sido devuelta pero de eso se encargará la empresa según la vía quecesrimen conveniente). A mi modo de ver se me trató con cierto despotismo por algún empleado de recepción los cuales a excepción  de una chica de cabello moreno y aparato que es un amor, dejaban según quién bastante que desear.
Las instalaciones pueden mejorarse, sobre todo las habitaciones.  La mía no cerraba la puerta de entrada salvo a empujones y la puerta del baño mostraba síntomas de deterioro.
La ubicación es inmejorable 
La piscina muy bien aunque los precios de su bar bastante elevados.
Recomendable por su ubicación y por el exquisito trato que dispensa la citada señorita de recepción.",3,2019,07,09
47,4 estrellas son demasiadas,"Las habitaciones necesitan una reforma integral, pero urgente en los sanitarios que aún tienen cortinas en la bañera y duchas de plástico por las que es evidente el paso del tiempo. La comodidad de las camas es más que deficiente y la amabilidad de gran parte del personal brilla por su ausencia. En mi opinión le sobran casi 2 estrellas.",2,2019,07,08
47,Excelencia de Mar (Recepcion),"Viajamos cada mes a Bcn. Y nos paramos siempre en el mismo hotel hasta que la tarifa cambio de repente y no nos pudieron respetar la nuestra a pesar de ir 10 veces en un año al mismo hotel, lo que nos obligó a cambiar de hotel en nuestra penúltima estancia. Anoche nos presentamos de nuevo al hotel habitual y gracias a la intervención muy profesional de Mar(Recepcion), el hotel volvió a ganar un cliente habitual. Una pena que este tipo de profesionales escasean! Gracias Mar por tu intervención, nos volvemos a ver el día 21. Un saludo.

47,Barcelona,"Increible lugar, una ciudad para disfrutarla todo el tiempo,  la plaza de Cataluña, Montjuic con su Castillo y la fuente de aguas dansantes,  el Arco del Triunfo, su gastronomia,  las playas,  la Sagrada Familia, etc.",5,2019,07,03
47,Decepción,"Muy decepcionada con el checkin del hotel, una chica muy amable nos coge los datos, al finalizar nos dice q las habitaciones no están listas aún y que esperemos un poco, sin problema nos vamos a comer, a la vuelta surgen los inconvenientes. Para empezar nos hacen pagar en el checkin ( es otra chica bastante menos amable que la primera) cosa que nunca me había pasado, intento hacerle ver a la chica de recepción que no es una manera a la q estoy acostumbrada. No me lo explica bien, y me cuesta entenderla porque me habla en catalán. Cuando acepto a pagar y le pido la factura me dice ( de un modo bastante poco amable) que la factura me la da en el check out, y yo le digo q sin factura no hay pago. Por supuesto sale el supervisor y arregla la situación. Todavía no he entrado en la habitación y ya me quiero ir.",1,2019,07,02
47,Excelente servicio,"Servicio 5 estrellas ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Lo visité en un viaje de negocios y me gusto mucho el hotel en su ubicación y las instalaciones son excepcionales además sus restaurantes son muy buenos y el desayuno de la terraza fue muy completo ",5,2019,07,01
47,Ein paar fehler ... aber super Lage,"Check-In und Check-out waren fürchterlich !!! Es hat viel zu lang gedaurt. 
Zum Glück haben wir beim check-out genug Zeit eingeplant und durch die dreiviertel Stunde verzögerung trotzdem unseren Flieger bekommen. 
Der Pool könnte etwas früher auf machen damit man ein paar runden drehen kann. Dafür hat er bis um 2 offen was es wieder ausgleicht. 
Das Hotel ist schön und ruhig. Tolle Zimmer, toller Pool und Liegeflächen. Das Frühstück war auch sehr lecker nur war der Saal in dem es statt fand sehr unpassen. Man fühlte sich wie in einer Kantine und es war sehr, sehr laut. Ein paar Raumtrenner oder aufteilung des Saals würden Wunder bewirken. ",3,2019,07,01
47,"Excelente ubicación, mejorable servicio y atención ","Me he hospedado en 2 oportunidades en este hotel (ambas veces por Congresos ya que está emplazado frente a la Fira de Barcelona), realmente tiene una excelente ubicación y un muy buen desayuno.
El bar y la piscina de la terraza están muy bien también, con vistas del Montjuic y el Museo Naciona de Catalunya.
Todo lo demás del hotel es pésimo, la atención es malísima, el personal del front desk parece que no quisiera atender al huésped, pedí que me destaparan la tina y el lavabo que se encontraban tapados (me hospedé 6 días en un executive floor) y nunca lo hicieron y para colmo la noche anterior bajé a realizar el check out, pague los cargos y le solicite al personal de ese turno que me emitiesen la factura a nombre de mi empresa en lugar de realizarla a nombre de mi persona. Por algún motivo, esa persona me dijo que la factura me la entregaban al día siguiente (???)
...y al día siguiente cuando fui a retirarme y a entregar la llave magnética me quisieron volver a cobrar los cargos sino no me entregaban la factura.
Unos estafadores.
En fin, no vuelvo más a ese hotel.

47,"Buen hotel, habitaciones y vistas.","Estuve en Barcelona por trabajo durante 1 día, me dieron una habitación en la planta 5 con vistas a Montjuic y las fuentes. La habitación muy buena así como el baño. Destacables y recomendables.
El desayuno buffet mejorable, tanto por lo que se ofrecía como por la dispersión en toda la sala.",4,2019,06,25
47,Grundsätzlich gutes Hotel an einer sehr günstigen Lage,"Das Hotel ist grundsätzlich gut gelegen, mit Anbindung an alles Nötige in Barcelona. Die Infrastruktur ist sehr gut. Leider mussten wir erhebliche Mängel bei der Nutzung der Infrastruktur sowie bei der Sauberkeit feststellen. Im ganzen Zimmer wurde seit Wochen der Staub nicht entfernt. Zudem mussten wir täglich unsere Zimmerbadges an der Rezeption neu laden, da sich das Zimmer nicht mehr öffnen lies. Das Natel, welches einem eigentlich im Zimmer zur freien Verfügung steht, funktionierte nicht. Im Frühstücksraum ist es eiskalt, ich sah Frauen mit Winterjacken (!). Leider durften wir am Pool die Sonnenschirme, welche direkt am Liegestuhl befestigt sind, nicht wegnehmen und mussten so anstatt an der Sonne, im Schatten liegen...:-(",3,2019,06,23
47,Habitaciones y baños  en mal estado,No lo recomiendo porque a pesar de su ubicación la relación calidad precio no es buena. Los baños tienen moho. Huele muchísimo a lejía. Deberían plantearse una renovación total. Por favor háganlo asap.,3,2019,06,22
47,Estadia en Barcelona,Lo pasamos muy bien el desayuno extraordinario mucha variedad ubicación excelente lo recomiendo lo único problema es un poco de olor a cloaca espero lo demás excelente Lo recomiendo muy bueno la verdad que lo pasamos re lindo el restaurante el sushi y probamos,4,2019,06,20
47,DEecepcionante,"Muy decepcionado con este hotel que esta en esta ubicacion tan buena y promete tanto por fotos. Hotel en general antiguo, mal servicio de habitaciones, muy ruidosos sin respetar a los clientes el silencio o sueño. Bar de la terraza muy bonito pero mal atendido.
Lo siento pero no volvere",3,2019,06,18
47,Viaje de negocios,"Excelente ubicación, habitaciones confortables, muy bien desayuno y personal amable. 
Como negativo, baño de la habitación del siglo pasado. Bañera roñosa, grifos de ducha que mejor no tocar y para colmo cortinilla de ducha. ",3,2019,06,11
47,Una estancia magnífica,"Es un hotel estupendo. Los servicios que presta son de primer nivel. No os perdáis la piscina en la 8ª planta con una vista magnífica. La ubicación, al menos, para nuestro caso, era perfecta. Además, el autobús que lleva o trae desde el aeropuerto para en la misma plaza donde está el hotel. El trato de todo el personal es profesional y amable. ",4,2019,06,11
47,Poca comodidad,Apenas limpiaron la habitación. Nunca recambiaron jabones en 5 días de estancia. Debajo de la cama había suciedad de meses sin limpiar. Habitación sin enchufes apenas. Mala accesibilidad. Fallo de tarjeta llave constante ,2,2019,06,11
47,Estancia en sexta planta espléndida,"La estancia fue muy buena, los diversos detalles la acabaron de hacer magnifica. Las vistas a Montjuic y plaza España dieron un plus a nuestra estancia al regresar cada vez a la habitación. La ubicación es excelente, los dos restaurantes ubicados en el mismo también tienen una oferta muy interesante.",5,2019,06,09
47,La limpieza y el olor dejan que desear,"A pesar de que nos aseguraron que todas ls habitaciones eran de no fumadores nuestra habitación apestaba a tabaco rancio. El baño de la habitación no estaba limpio, había pelos cuando llegamos. En recepción no nos dieron una solución. Solicitamos cambio de habitación y nos dijeron que las habitaciones era de no fumadores y allí se quedó el tema. Como solo era una noche nos quedamos pero si hubiéramos tenido que quedarnos más noches habríamos insistido en el
cambio ya que era desagradable.",2,2019,06,08
47,Excelente,"Limpio

Excelentes instalaciones a pesar de que se escucha ruido de los pasillos de los mismos clientes que se encuentran hospedados y que me tocó la habitación que pega con el ascensor y se oía la apertura y cierre de este ",5,2019,06,05
47,ALTAMENTE RECOMENDABLE,"estuve   solo una noche por un viaje de negocios y es un hotel muy recomendable por su calidad, amplias y cómodas habitaciones, personal, y en general todo perfecto. moderno y funcional. para repetir. desayuno muy completo y el sky bar muy amplio ",5,2019,06,04

47,Sehr zu empfehlen,"Top Lage, gutes Hotel. Freundliches Personal. Zimmer und Service sehr ansprechend. Direkte Anbindung an Metro und Shuttlebus zum Flughafen. Frühstück haben wir nicht genutzt, daher keine Angaben dazu. Perfekter Spot, um Barcelona zu erkunden",5,2019,05,27
47,Bello ma troppo caro,Ci sono stato 2 giorni per lavoro. L'hotel è in una posizione strategica e centralissima. Le camere sono abbastanza moderne e ampie. Pulite. Eccellente la colazione sia per qualità che per quantità. Non ho messo un voto più alto per l'esagerato costo che ho pagato. Probabilmente colpa della settimana del gran premio e della fiera dell'automobile che si stava svolgendo lì di fronte.,3,2019,05,22
47,Über meinen Geburtstag,"Dieses Hotel liegt verkehrsmäßig gut gelegen. Vom Flughafen El Prat gelangt man innerhalb einer halben Stunde mit dem A1 oder A2 direkt zum Plaza Espanya. Am Hoteleingang befindet sich direkt der Zugang zur Metro.

Das Erscheinungsbild der Lobby wirkt gehoben und zeitlos. Wir sind gegen Mitternacht angereist und der Empfang war noch gut besetzt.

Auf unserer Etage gab es morgens einen Kaffeevollautomaten, an dem man sich kostenlos bedienen konnte, ebenso an Obst und Wasser.
Nachmittags wurde hier kaltes Wasser, Säfte und kleine Süßigkeiten bereit gestellt.
Auf dieser Etage sitzt auch zeitweise ein Guest Service Mitarbeiter. 
Bei uns war es Almudena Fernandez bei der ich mich bedanken möchte, für die liebe Aufmerksamkeit zu meinem Geburtstag.

Was ich besonders mochte, war der Holzboden auf den Fluren und in den Zimmern. Ich lief mit weißen Socken durch das Zimmer und sie blieben auch nach einer Weile weiß. 

Das Zimmer hatte eine ansprechende Größe und vor allem konnte man neben der Klimaanlage auch die Fenster öffnen. Es sollte einem nur bewusst sein, dass die Fenster alle zur Straße raus zeigen. 
Die Betten waren super komfortabel und das Badezimmer gut ausgestattet. Es gab einen großen Kleiderschrank und genug Staumöglichkeiten für unsere Koffer.

Das Highlight des Hotels sind zwei Dinge. Zum einen die Dachterrasse, von der man einen wunderschönen Blick über Barcelona hat. An der Poolbar gibt es genügend Auswahl an Cocktails und sonstigem. Hier sind ausreichend Liege und Sitzmöglichkeiten vorhanden. 

Das zweite Highlight sind die beiden Restaurants, die am Hotel angeschlossen sind. Ich kann sie wirklich nur weiter empfehlen. So wie ich dieses Hotel nur jedem einwandfrei empfehlen kann, wenn man Barcelona besucht. Ich komme bestimmt wieder.",5,2019,05,18
47,Excelente !,"Sin duda  regreso,  todo  y todos  de lo mejor,  atendidos  y apoyados en todo momento, muy serviciales...

volveremos !!!",5,2019,05,13
47,Una experiencia inolvidable,"Es un Hotel que está bien situado, nos hemos alojado en la Suite del Reloj; una de las mejores habitaciones del Hotel.
El trato que hemos recibido es incomparable con otros hoteles en los que nos hemos alojado en Barcelona.
Tienen una estupenda terraza y unas vistas espectaculares.
Han tenido detalles durante toda nuestra estancia; sin duda repetiremos!!",5,2019,05,09
47,Un Hotel impresionante,"Es la primera vez que nos alejamos en este hotel y lo recomendamos al 100%. Reservamos con mucha antelación ya que fuimos al concierto de Metallica celebrado en el Estadio Olímpico. Tiene una ubicación perfecta, muy cerca del centro, al lado de la fuente de Montjuic. La atención en recepción fue impecable, máxima amabilidad. Nos informaron de un cambio en nuestra habitación a una superior, y nos dieron una Suite increíble. Sofá, sillones, mesa y sillas para 6 personas, una cama de 6 metros cuadrados, un baño enorme con 2 duchas de mano y 2 en el techo tipo spa. unas vistas espectaculares a Montjuic. No le faltaba detalle. Disp
one de muchos ascensores, con lo que en ningún momento hicimos cola y eso que el Hotel estaba lleno.
El desayuno muy completo, te hacen las tortillas a tu gusto en el momento, reponen de todo en cuanto se acaba. La calidad de los productos muy buena. Nos alojamos dos noches, como nos volvíamos en el tren de las 7 de la mañana y no llegábamos a tiempo del segundo desayuno, nos prepararon un picnic para llevar, con todo tipo de alimentos, un detallazo!! 
Imprescindible subir a la 8a planta al sky bar, tiene piscina ahí mismo, y las vistas vuelven a ser espectaculares. 
Tiene parada de metro en la misma puerta, siempre había taxis en la puerta también.
Muy contentos de habernos alojado en este Hotel, lo recomendamos y seguro que repetiremos muy pronto!!",5,2019,05,08
47,Un lujo de hotel,"Es la segunda vez que me hospedo en este hotel y nunca defrauda. La atención del personal magnífica y la habitación muy cómoda y limpia.
Imprescindible subir al bar de la octava planta donde se puede disfrutar de un cocktail viendo el colorido espectáculo de la fuente de Montjuic.",5,2019,05,07
47,Hotel bien situado cerca de Montjuic,"Es un hotel muy grande, con cantidad de habitaciones. El personal es amable y correcto.
Las habitaciones son amplias. Y se esta bastante bien aislado del exterior.
En cuanto al buffet, correcto.
Dispone de 5 ascensores para poderse desplazar con rapidez.",4,2019,04,30
47,Pésimo...,"Habitación más bien casposa...con vistas a una obra.....sin desayuno, cortinillas en los baños con algo de moho... el personal de recepción sobre todo al chelkin up... de lo peor!!! Y todo por pedir explicaciones por el impuesto de tasa de Barcelona... te cobran la tasa y aplican el iva...algo ilegal... pues una de las empleadas q está embarazada me contesto de muy malas formas y después despotrico sobre mi con sus compañeros... nefasto...",1,2019,04,29

47,ottima posizione,"hotel che merita totalmente le sue stelle. Camera comoda (bellissima doccia!) 
c'era tantissima gente (ragazzini in gita), ma comunque il personale riusciva a gestire bene la situazione. Unico neo: poca informazione sui servizi inclusi",4,2019,04,29
47,Una ubicación excelente,"Las habitaciones son excelentes y la vista a Plaza España, las torres venecianas y las fuentes de Montjuic son únicas. Excelente lugar para comenzar a conocer Barcelona. Un centro comercial al lado, una parada de metro y cercanías y muy cerca de la estación de Sants.",4,2019,04,28
47,Recepcionista maleducado,"Esta noche hemos utilizado el parking del hotel. Al pagar, la máquina no funcionaba por lo que tuvimos que ir a recepción. Allí nos atendió un recepcionista que al darse cuenta de que no éramos clientes del hotel nos trató con desprecio, poniéndonos malas caras e incluso riéndose de nosotros. Servicio pésimo por parte de esta persona (chico joven de gran tamaño con ojos claros).",1,2019,04,27
47,Muy buen hotel,"El hotel me parecio excelente,  muy buena ubicacion,  el personal super amable y servicial, super  limpia la habitacion, el restaurante muy bueno, la pizza y el cafe  en especial.. fuimos en familia, lo recomiendo mucho ...",5,2019,04,17

47,"Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, un hotel con clase","El Plaza de Catalonia Hotels & Resorts de 1992 de los arquitectos Enric Sòria y Jordi Garcés, a las puertas de la Fira Barcelona es un lugar estupendo y muy recomendable donde alojarse por lo céntrico y bien dotado en cuanto a servicio y habitaciones.

47,Muy Bueno,"Trato excelente por parte de los empleados, situado en el centro de la Plaza de España. Hotel muy limpio y habitaciones silenciosas, cama confortable. Desayuno buffet con gran variedad para elegir muy bueno",4,2019,04,11
47,excelente,"excelente ubicación, limpieza, amabilidad de los empleados, me encanto la disponibilidad de agua, fruta, café saliendo de los ascensores. Extraordinaria idea la del móvil con wifi que te prestan durante tu estancia. Lo único es el buffet el sabado para el desayuno era muyyyy lento por que había muchísima gente, en dias que habra mucha gente poner dos personas que preparen huevos,. 
Me gusto que tenia comida para todo tipo de dietas; desde los crudiveganos, gluten free, diferentes tipos de leches vegetales, eso no lo había visto en ningún lado. Todos los tipos de dietas tiene algo que pueden consumir . Me impresionaron,  muchos detalles únicos ",5,2019,04,08
47,Repetiremos,Hotel muy bien ubicado en que nos trataron fenomenal. El personal de recepción fue súper cercano y amable tanto en la entrada como en la salida y también fueron muy agradables en el desayuno. La piscina es sencillamente espectacular ,5,2019,04,07

47,Buen hotel en un lugar inmejorable,"El hotel situado en la Plaza de España no puede estar mejor situado (siempre que no te moleste el ruido de los coches)  para nuestro viaje exprés de dos días pudimos ver casi todo en Barcelona gracias a las conexiones de transporte público cerca del hotel.  El buffet de desayuno estaba completo,  zumo natural lo cual se agradece y muchos productos para elegir.  El restaurante japonés ofrece un servicio excelente y de calidad.  El check-in fue rápido y nos dieron la información necesaria para nuestra estancia.  Pedimos bañera y no tuvieron problema en darnos una habitación con esa característica aunque están un poco viejas y habria que hacerles un lavado de cara.  Pero en general disfrutamos la estancia,  una lastima no haber podido disfruta más días.  Esperamos volver en el futuro si volvemos a visitar Barcelona.  ",4,2019,04,01
47,Hotel ideal para B travel,"Está muy bien situado en la plaza frente a la feria. Muy cómodo para los expositores y reservando con tiempo muy buena relación calidad/precio. Buen bufet de desayuno, pero muchos grupos de adolescentes extranjeros. ",4,2019,04,01
47,Excelente hotel,"El Hotel está muy bien situado, las instalaciones son muy buenas (lo unico a comentar es que la temperatura de la Habitación era demasiado cálida y no se podía refrescar ya que el AA no se puede poner  hasta que el sistema de calefacion no se modifica de forma general.

A pesar de que es un Hotel muy transitado, el silencio nocturno muy bueno.",5,2019,04,01
47,Magnífico hotel,"Espectacular suite, muy limpia y ordenada. Recientemente reformada. Magnifica atención del personal en general. La señorita Linda de recepción nos atendió con mucha simpatía y profesionalidad. El gintonic de por la tarde en la terraza de la  piscina de la séptima planta imprescindible.",5,2019,03,28
47,Buono con un però ,"Meravigliosa posizione, proprio accanto all’entrata c’è la metro.Stanze spaziose e molto belle, ma come ho aperto la porta mi ha investito un forte odore di fumo molto fastidioso, evidentemente era una stanza per fumatori. Il però è nella pulizia, per 2 giorni di fila nella vasca ho trovato peli e capelli non miei, anche dopo che ho fatto la doccia e che hanno pulito il bagno ho riavuto la stessa sorpresa, inoltre mi è caduto un cerotto che ho dimenticato di buttare e il giorno seguente, dopo le pulizie, l’ho trovato ancora sul pavimento del bagno. 
Il pranzo e la cena sono stati a buffet, buoni, ma niente di speciale, mentre la colazione era fantastica.
Il personale è stato cortese, ma abbiamo avuto qualche problema, infatti in quanto docenti di un gruppo di studenti minorenni in viaggio d’istruzione abbiamo chiesto al personale di levarlo dalle camere dei ragazzi, ci hanno detto che dovevamo levarle noi mettendole nelle nostre stanze, così abbiamo fatto, peccato che il giorno dopo ce le hanno tutte addebitate dicendo che nessuno ci aveva autorizzati a levarle.Per fortuna siamo riusciti a risolvere e a farci levare l’addebito.
Nelle camere del primo e secondo piano si sente la metro quando passa, ma forse nelle camere ai piani superiori non c’è questo inconveniente.
Tutto sommato è un buon hotel

47,EXCELENTE HOTEL,"Todo perfecto, personal atento y encantador, desayuno variado y de calidad, habitacion muy bonita e impecable. El rincon piscina es precioso. Detalles como albornoz, secador de pelo bueno, cafetera y agua en la habitación son de agradecer. Enhorabuena ",5,2019,03,26
47,Espectacular suite,"Me alojé con mi pareja en una de las suites y la verdad es que nos fascinó. Están totalmente reformadas con un estilo moderno y precioso. Presentan todas las comodidades: un salón-comedor con televisión, sofá y mesa; un lavabo totalmente equipado con una zona de aseo, una ducha enorme y una bañera y un dormitorio con una cama muy grande y cómoda, una chimenea eléctrica y unos sillones de descanso.Nosotros escogimos la suite porque sabíamos que la habían restaurado recientemente y por las magníficas vistas a Montjuic. También cogimos el desayuno incluido y vale mucho la pena, es enorme y hay de todo tanto de comida (dulce y salado) como de bebidas (leche, zumos e infusiones). Tienen habilitada una zona para hacer tortillas y huevos al gusto y al momento y otra para hacer crepes y gofres. Un lujo, realmente recomendable. Además, el trato que recibimos por parte de todos los trabajadores del hotel fue de 10, siempre muy atentos e interesados en nosotros.",5,2019,03,25
47,Schönes Hotel in prima Lage,"Das Hotel liegt direkt am Plaza Espania. Metro ist unmittelbar vor der Lobby. Personal ist freundlich und hilfsbereit. Das Frühstück lässt keine Wünsche offen.

47,Muy buena ubicacion,"Hotel centro Barcelona, con metro y taxi en la puerta del hotel. Habitación grande ,baño con bañera y cortina.

47,Recomendable,"Buen desayuno, buena ubicación,  bien insonorizado, personal amable y eficaz.

47,Mal.,"Decepcionada con este hotel de 4 estrellas.Al entrar ya da sensacion de anticuado,la puerta pesa un demonio.Ya cuando he llegado a la habitacion,era poco menos que como una pension, dos camas separadas,muebles viejos,baño anticuado,con cortina en la bañera y grifo oxidado.Menos mal que al menos la ventana daba a la calle,porque me parecio ver alguna q da a patio!La limpieza bien pero poco cuidada,no reponian gel ni papel higienico y me dejaban la basura del dia anterior en la habitacion,no habia papelera.Se libra el personal del bufet (muy bueno por cierto)que era super amable y estan muy pendientes de todo. 
Se me hizo muy dificil la estancia ya que voy a trabajar y mi empresa se molesta en buscarnos hoteles de 4 estrellas para que estemos en condiciones y no lo merece. ",1,2019,03,10
47,Esperienza da ripetere!,"Sono stata in questo hotel per una notte e non vedo l'ora di tornare! Camera doppia grande, pulita, con tutti i comfort (TV, aria condizionata, servizio bar e macchina per il caffè, phon), bagno grande e pulitissimo. Mi ha stupito molto il self service - un mini bar - a disposizione dei clienti tutto il giorno nel proprio piano di alloggio.
Personale gentilissimo e disponibilissimo. Colazione a buffet con ampia scelta da dolce a salato.
Posizione strategica, tutto è molto vicino con pochi minuti di taxi ma c'è la metro vicino. Inoltre dall'altra parte della strada c'è un centro commerciale.
Che dire, spero di tornare presto!",5,2019,03,04
47,Excelente,"He pasado una noche en este hotel y todo ha sido perfecto. Empezando por la atencion recibida en la recepcion, dadonos solución a nuestras necesidades con una gran amabilidad. La habitación amplia, la cama enorme y muy comoda.

47,"El servicio de la cafeteria, un desastre","Sabado 16 de febrero a las 17h. Un grupo de amigos nos escontramos en la cafeteria del hall. Pedimos unas aguas y unos cafes. La camarera nos trae las aguas abiertas (para mi impensable en un hotel de 4 estrellas). Al quejarnos, la camarera improvisa una escusa sin fundamento. Poco despues vemos como en una mesa cercana vuelve a servir aguas abiertas. Esta claro que nuestra observacion le importa un bledo. A la hora de pagar, hemos de llamarla diversas veces. Cuando acude, nos dice que no somos los unicos clientes. No se si la insolencia de esta señorita es comun en el resto de empleados del hotel, pero en cualquier caso, esta señorita, da una imagen nefasta del establecimiento. ",1,2019,02,18
47,Penoso,"¿Hotel de cuatro estrellas? 

Habitación vieja, rota, descuidada, ruidosa, malos olores en los pasillos y encima el personal fue muy desagradable.

No volveré a este hotel.

47,Genial,"Este hotel está situado en plena Plaza España, al lado de Las Arenas, una situación estratégica de cara a la movilidad en Barcelona. Es un hotel de 4 estrellas y sus instalaciones están muy bien. Es elegante y práctico, la atención al cliente muy amable y servicial. Yo estuve en una habitación en la sexta planta, la 645, creo, con unas vistas impresionantes. La habitación era amplia, cómoda y super tranquila, muy silenciosa, sobretodo estando de cara a plaza España. La cama, de las mejores en las que he dormido nunca y el servicio amplio, con una ducha enorme. El buffet de desayuno es abundante y variado con productos frescos y que se preparan al momento.

47,Deteriorado,"Era un hotel que valía la pena y se ha deteriorado en los últimos tiempos, las habitaciones necesitan un repaso y los baños también. La relación calidad/precio no es muy buena. En cuanto al desayuno que es bueno, es enormemente disperso, cuando lo lógico es que el desayuno ocupara el espacio central, resulta que ocupa la periferia y se debe recorrer de parte a parte para ir a por el zumo o coger un croissant.",3,2019,01,22
47,Buena experiencia,"Por la localización y por los servicios que ofrece este hotel, es muy recomendable. Puedes ir andando desde la estación de AVE hasta el hotel, la zona está muy bien para pasear con muchas opciones para comer/cenar. Seguro que repito",4,2019,01,21
47,Esperienza positiva ,"Camera doppia non grandissima ma comunque carina, l’unica pecca sono le poche prese di corrente; inoltre penserei magari a rimodernare un po’ il bagno: la tenda non è un granché calcolando che è un 4 stelle. 
Colazione ottima, c’è di tutto e di più, compreso uova, pancake e churros preparati al momento. 
Staff molto gentile e disponibile. 
La posizione è comoda anche per i mezzi, c’è una fermata della metro proprio sotto l’hotel e nelle vicinanze ci sono diversi ristorantini carini. 
Nel complesso è stata un’esperienza positiva. ",4,2019,01,06

47,No vayas con mascota tienes que pagar 200 euros de depósito,Pagas por la mascota pero no te dan ni un cuenco para que pueda beber. El suelo de la habitación estaba sucio así que se ensució la manta de mi perro y tuve que pagar 200 euros de depósito por llevar perro y perdí 10 libras en la transacción no hay derecho ,3,2018,12,29
47,Pfff.. un hotel increíble,"El hotel es impresionante, la ubicación perfecta. En plena Plaza Espanya, la boca de metro queda a 10 metros de la entrada del hotel. La recepción y las instalaciones son geniales, con mucha luz y espacio, dignas de las estrellas del hotel.

El comedor es enorme, con un buffet libre para el desayuno de bastante calidad: panes, bollería, café, leche e infusiones, embutido y quesos, y hay 1 persona encargada de preparar tortitas al gusto del cliente y otra encargada de preparar tortillas francesas de igual modo, con varios toppings (cebolla, queso, j. york, etc). Eso habla mucho de la categoría del hotel.

Respecto a las habitaciones, como cabe esperar están impolutas, con un escritorio para trabajar, enchufes, etc. El baño es muy amplio, con un espejo enorme para que puedan arreglarse 2 o 3 personas a la vez, y los típicos artículos de higiene cortesía del hotel.

En general, es un hotel de mucha calidad, al que espero volver a tener la oportunidad de ir.",5,2018,12,25
47,No muy bueno,"Se me infundió el baño, tardaron 15 minutos en arreglarlo, no funcionaba la tele tardaron 15 minutos hasta decir que ya era tarde. No había sauna por reformas y jamas me ofrecieron otra cosa. NO VOLVERÍA ",3,2018,12,24

Despues de llamar varias veces a recepción (que no deja de comunicar) bajo y le explico a la persona la situación. Me indica que el aire acondicionado está desconectado en todo el Hotel. ¿Que solución tengo? , Le pregunto. Ninguna, me responde. ¿Que tengo que hacer, abrir la ventana de la habitación para que se enfrie?. Y me responde que esa es una de las posibilidades. Le pregunto si estoy alojado en un hotel de 4 estrellas, en Barcelona, Plaza de España, a más de 100 euros la noche. A lo que me responde que si, que lo siente. Desde mi punto de vista es absolutamente impresentable la situación. No puedo recomendar un hotel asi.Mi habitación es la 556. Saludos",2,2018,12,10

47,Mal 4 estrellas y con Estelada en info turistica,"Hotel bien ubicado en plaza españa. Habitación bien, pero el termostato no funciona y se oyen ruidos de cañerías continuamente. La TV, con un mando universal, no permite quitar los subtítulos y la caja fuerte no tiene llave. Para colmo, en la info turística que proporcionan con el ""móvil"" que hay en la habitación, lo primero que te sale es una estelada. Vergonzoso.

47,Buon hotel migliorabile,"Sono stato in questo hotel per alcuni giorni durante un viaggio di lavoro. La posizione dell'hotel è perfetta per raggiungere più o meno tutte le mete di Barcellona, uscendo si entra praticamente direttamente nella metro di Placa d'Espanya. L'hotel è molto grande con moltissime camere, questo purtroppo porta ad avere fila al check-in e al check-out. La camera doppia è sufficientemente spaziosa, peccato per la pulizia non eccezionale e per il bagno con vasca e tenda di plastica decisamente ""old style"" e scomoda. Per il resto colazione discreta con buona scelta di dolce e salato (evitate i waffle fatti al momento, non ne vale la pena!). Prezzo alto per il servizio offerto.",3,2018,11,26
47,Ottima colazione,"Bell'hotel con ottima colazione, non proprio strategico a causa dell'elevato traffico.

47,Preis nicht gerechtfertigt!,"Die Lage direkt am Plaza ist natürlich top, aber das war’s auch schon. Das Frühstück ist okay, gibt ein paar „besondere“ Sachen, aber alles in allem nicht ausreichend für ein 4 Sterne Hotel. Wirklich entsetzt waren wir aber vom Zimmer.. eng, altbacken und dunkel, der Schrank war kaum aufzukriegen und die Preise für die Minibar überdimensional. Ein Bad mit Wanne ist ja eigentlich schön, aber beim Baden lief das Wasser ständig ab und die Vorrichtung für den Duschkopf war kaputt - duschen also nur „per Hand“ möglich.Für 1/3 des Preises würden wir wohl wiederkommen, aber da ist einiges zu überholen.",2,2018,11,12
47,Schönes Hotel in guter Lage,"Viele Zimmer sind sehr schön und modern renoviert. Ein tolles Bad mit einer großen Dusche in der man stundenlang duschen könnte. Bei den Zimmern muss man einen Kompromiss bei der Lage eingehen, denn die Zimmer mit Aussicht auf den Plaza Espana sind tendenziell laut durch den Verkehr. Die Zimmer nach hinten sind ruhiger, haben aber keinen schönen Ausblick.",4,2018,11,11

47,Adecuado,"Es un hotel adecuado para negocios o incluso para familia. Cerca tiene varias zonas de restaurantes. El hotel es agradable. No en el mismo centro, pero a una distancia razonable de la mayor parte de los puntos turísticos y de visita.

47,Aprobado y  gracias,"De otra época, viejo y mal mantenido. Requiere de una reforma integral, las puertas de las habitaciones son de otra época.

Senza possibilità di capire cosa sia successo visto che avevamo prenotato con un mese di anticipo, ci informano che avrebbero chiamato un taxi a loro spese e ci avrebbero spedito in un altro hotel della stessa catena. Tutto questo ci è stato comunicato con arragonza e senza troppe scuse. Il taxi da loro chiamato non è mai arrivato. 
DA EVITARE",1,2018,10,10
47,Imposible tratar peor a un cliente,"Me alojé en este hotel los dias 3 y  4 de Octubre de 2018 .
Me dejé olvidada una bolsa con ropa sucia , encima de una especie de mostrador que hay en la habitación. Me di cuenta al llegar a mi casa el 4 por la noche y vaciar la maleta.
El día 5 a primera hora llamé al hotel. En recepción me indicaron que debía enviar un email confirmando la pérdida y así lo hice inmediatamente . Como el 5 a media tarde no había recibido respuesta , llamé otra vez al hotel y me respondieron que confirmarían con la lavandería si había aparecido allí.  Me respondieron al cabo de un rato con un email de tres líneas  explicando que no había aparecido nada y que lamentaban las molestias causadas.
Me resulta asombroso que un hotel no sepa reconocer un error. La bolsa quedó en la habitación , les indiqué exactamente donde , pero parece que el Servicio de Limpieza o lo tiró a la basura o no lo devolvió a Objetos Perdidos. Pero entiendo que este error lo debe asumir el hotel. Detallé exactamente lo que había en la bolsa y les pedí una solución pero no he vuelto a recibir ningún tipo de respuesta.
Nada más llegar , en mi caso con una habitación ya abonada, lo primero que hacen es solicitar la tarjeta de crédito con la que cubrir los posibles deterioros que causen los clientes o los productos del minibar que consideren que has consumido y no abonado . Pero esta responsabilidad no es recíproca. Los bienes de los clientes , evidentemente, no tienen ningún valor para la cadena ni están dispuestos a interesarse lo más mínimo una vez sales por la puerta del hotel. En mi caso, las prendas que no me han devuelto ascienden a poco más de 50 euros (tres prendas) . Gracias a su actitud elimino la cadena de mis alojamientos habituales. En cualquier caso, la habitación que ocupé (327) no estaba a la altura de un hotel de 4 estrellas. Coincido con otros comentarios en que el hotel está masificado y el desayuno se sirve en un salón enorme e incomodísimo . No recomiendo este hotel a nadie .",1,2018,10,09

47,MUY BUENA UBICACION,"Muy buen hotel ,moderno ubicado frente a la Plaza de España con una vista  preciosa. Buena recepción muy amable y con muchos restaurantes en las cercanías. Muy buena habitación con buenísima cama y baño. Aseo correcto. Buen desayuno pero  se hacía pequeño el lugar y además todos los mesones quedaban muy lejos ya que se encontraban dispersos por la periferia de lugar
El Wi Fi no funcionó, según me dijeron era problema de los I Phone  y sus sistema de seguridad ya que los Android se conectaban, pero  no me convence porque en todos los demás hoteles no tuve problema. De manera que tuve que comprar un chip de Vodafone por 15 Euros con 800 minutos a todo destino y 5 GB de navegación y así comunicarme con mi familia. Creo que deben preocuparse del WI FI. ",4,2018,09,29
47,Molto buono,Albergone che affaccia su Plaza de Espana piuttosto semplice da raggiungere in auto..anche se non ha nemmeno una zona sosta per il carico & scarico bagagli. Parcheggio in zona ad €25/giorno comunque non comodissimo..Buona accoglienza alla reception anche se nessuno mi ha aiutato col bagaglio..nonostante il personale ci fosse! Mi sono piaciute molto le camere..ampie ed estremamente confortevoli e dotate di tutto. Non ho provato la prima colazione ma dopo averci trascorso la prima notte del mio tour della Spagna..ho deciso di confermare anche per l’ultima prima del rientro in nave verso l’Italia. Bella la terrazza con bar & piscina all’ultimo piano.,4,2018,09,16
47,Todo bien!!,Ya me alojé antes en este hotel y volvería a hacerlo. Todo impecable. El trato y la disposición del personal son excelentes. La ubicación y la magnífica vista a plaza España y Montjuic con las fuentes un verdadero espectáculo.,5,2018,09,15
47,Habitación 455,"Estuvimos una sola noche y la atención en la recepción el día que llegamos fueron dos chicas y genial, muy amables, pero al día siguiente cuando llamamos a la recepción porque tuvimos que salir más tarde por motivos de retraso del vuelo el chico de la recepción no tuvo tacto ninguno y nos hizo sentir bastantes incómodos con sus exigencias. Una pena. 
En cuanto el hotel está bien situado con metro en la puerta y el parking también cómodo solo que un poco caro. La habitación estaba limpia y bien situada pero la cama parecía que había pasado un ejercito entero por encima, hacia mucho ruido. Las vistas muy chulas sobre todo desde la piscina.",3,2018,09,14

47,Una notte per rilassarsi,"Sono stato una notte in questo albergo e non cercavo niente di meglio.
La camera pardon l’appartamento è dotato di ogni confort per lo standard, frigo bar incluso.
Struttura veramente centrale ma quello che mi ha colpito è stata la piscina all’ottavo piano con terrazza panoramica veramente fantastica con bar incluso e un mojito da paura.
Che dire !!!! Eccellente",5,2018,08,30
47,Estancia cumpleaños,"Aunque esta vez las vistas fueron buenas pero no excelentes, la habitación de la 6a planta resultó cómoda y confortable. A los extras ya habituales el hotel añadió en esta ocasión otros con motivo de la celebración del cumpleaños, que resultaron excelentes. También, como siempre, destacar la amabilidad del personal.",5,2018,08,30
47,Sehr gute Lage für eine Städtetour,"Das Hotel liegt wirklich gut für eine Städtereise. 15 Minuten vom Flughafen entfernt mit einem super Blick auf den Plaza Espana. Von hier auch sind Camp Nou, Park Güell und die Sagrada gut zu erreichen. Das Hotel ist in die Jahre gekommen und rechtfertigt die Sterne und den Preis so gerade eben noch. Die Rooftopbar mit Pool ist allerdings ein echtes Bonbon. Der Blick von da oben ist großartig. Dafür sind die Getränke ein wenig überteuert. Muss man akzeptieren.",3,2018,08,25
47,Hotel masificado pésimo desayuno habitaciones obsoletas,"Esperaba mucho de este hotel! Masificado con turismo de mala calidad, poco estilo y elegancia, desayuno muy baja calidad, churros incomibles pero todo malo en general, decoración pésima tipo comedero de colegio, habitacion obsoleta y pequeña, piscina minúscula, desorden en terraza , mala impresión en general",1,2018,08,25
47,No lo recomiendo ,"Nos hospedamos una noche en las instalaciones del hotel en base a un paquete turístico que adquirimos desde Peru y nos llevamos una fea sorpresa en el baño. 
Llenamos la bañera y el agua salió de color amarillo. Pusimos la queja en recepción y nos cambiaron de cuarto. Sin embargo, el cuarto no tenía las mismas características del cuarto anterior (la primera una cama matrimonial y la segunda, camas separadas). Hice el reclamo en recepción y solo me contestaron “lo siento” y no hay mas cuartos. 

Considero que la cadena Catalonia es de primer nivel, sin embargo, quedó insatisfecha con la atención recibida y las instalaciones.",1,2018,08,21
47,Deludente,"Questo albergo, potenzialmente, potrebbe essere uno dei più belli di Barcellona. La verità è che stato costruito all’età del mio bisnonno e, dato che la posizione è estremamente strategica, pensano di poter lavorare così male! 
1) non ci sono le prese della corrente accanto al letto per caricare i cellulari
2) le donne delle pulizie sono molto poco minuziose: ci è capitato di trovare capelli, peli e di non trovare shampoo e bagnoschiuma. Insomma, sotto questo aspetto un disastro! Ci sono ancora le manate sul vetro di gente che avrà fatto sesso alla finestra e loro non si degnano di passare una pezza!
3) evitate il ristorante “Filigrana” (che si trova nell albergo) oppure prendete i tranci di pesce
4) il personale è abbastanza gentile e disponibile, ma se potete, cambiate albergo e andare nel quartiere ‘El born’",3,2018,08,21
47,PURO CAVIAR BELUGA,"Solamente tengo que dar una unica queja, para hacer la entrada tuvimos que esperar casi media hora, eso es lo unico malo, lo demas pura fantasia.
La habitacion planta 5, impresionante con vistas a las Fuentes de Montjuic, ibamos tres personas, me dijero que no habian podido meter una tercera cama en la habitacion, asi que por el mismo precio nos endosaron dos habitaciones unidas por una salita, impresionantes.
El Desayuno es pura calidad, todo de primera categoria, sin esperas.
Lo caro o barato esta en funcion de lo que recibes, en este caso baratisimo.
Enhorabuena",5,2018,08,20
47,Bello!,"L'hotel è situato di fronte placa d'Espanya, grande, accogliente. Avevamo la stanza al 6°piano, peccato non aver avuto la stanza con vista verso la piazza, che io consiglio di prendere se si ha la possibilità. La stanza era grande e confortevole con aria condizionata regolabile ed un letto molto comodo, il bagno con una doccia veramente ampia era molto spazioso. Punto forte di quest'hotel il rooftop all'8 piano con piscina, bar ed una vista fantastica. La fermata della metro è praticamente di fronte, e, ad una ventina di metri vi è la fermata del pullman che porta dritto in aeroporto.
Ci torneremo sicuramente.",5,2018,08,16
47,molto buono,"bell'hotel  ben posizionato,diciamo all'ingresso del centro della citta nella bella plaza de espana.molto comodo da raggiungere dall'aereoporto.molto bella la vista dalle camere e dalla piscina al piano nr 8.posso solo lamentare (almeno nella mia camera) i bagni un po vecchi e l'impossibilita' di avere la chiave per chiudere la cassetta di sicurezza che ho chiesto per 3 giorni di seguito.altra pecca non trascurabile,il wifi va lentissimo! normalmente in spagna è velocissimo ovunque. ho anche cenato presso il ristorante filigrana che ho trovato ottimo. ci tornerei per la posizione la qualita' del sonno la comodita' della camera,la bella vista .",4,2018,08,12

La piscina con las vistas espectacular y hay q decir q la bebida está súper bien, en especial si te atienden como Ingrid lo ha hecho, impecable!!!!Para recomendar y para volver pronto! 
",5,2018,08,08
47,Ubicación excelente¡¡¡,"Un hotel muy bien mantenido con una ubicación excelente, junto a la antigua plaza de toros convertida en un mega centro comercial con tiendas espectaculares. Junto a estaciones del metro. Vistas impresionantes desde la última planta. Habitaciones muy completas. 
Me alojé hace varios años en época navideña. La ciudad estaba preciosa.",4,2018,08,07
47,A mejorar en algunos puntos,"He estado alojada con mi pareja una semana en el hotel y hay muchas cosas buenas a destacar, especialmente la ubicación que es inmejorable, perfectamente comunicado con todo, en pleno centro y con la posibilidad de caminar y disfrutar de muchas cosas alrededor como montjuic y la fuente mágica. 
Sin embargo, hemos sufrido no sólo el ruido normal de coches sino también la obra del edifícil contiguo desde las 8 de la mañana.
Por otra parte, el servicio de limpieza es mejorable. Muchos días se quedó sin barrer y varios días no nos dejaron el gel, champú o papel higiénico.
Además la piscina se comparte con toda la gente de fuera que pague para entrar por lo que es difícil tener sitio. Un día ya no teníamos ni toallas y cuando pedimos en recepción después de esperar más de 15 minutos nos dijeron que lo subirían a recepción, pero nunca pasó.
En definitiva, aunque hemos estado bien, esperaba mejor atención al ser un hotel no precisamente barato.",3,2018,08,02
47,"Buen hotel, buen ubicado, desayuno aceptable","Un buen hotel. Buena opción para ir en familia (habitación familiar), parejas y negocios. Buen desayuno, algo lenta la atención y vajilla y vasos un poco sucios. Podrían mejorar la velocidad de atención de las estaciones de huevos y pancakes. Habitación familiar muy bien exceptuando que el ascensor no llega hasta el piso 12. Si va con bebés con coche evítelo ya que son bastantes escalones",4,2018,08,01
47,Muy buen hotel,"Muy recomendable. Moderno, limpio y excelente situación. Fui por negocios y el trato fue muy bueno. El restaurante japonés dentro del hotel es de muy buena calidad.
El desayuno es muy completo. Lástima porque no pude disfrutar de la piscina pero sé que las vistas son excepcionales.",4,2018,07,30
47,Gutes Hotel an perfekter Lage,"Gutes Hotel an perfekter Lage um die Stadt zu erkunden. Tolle Terrasse mit wunderbarem Blick über die Stadt, insbesondere in den Abendstunden.
Zimmereinrichtungen wirken etwas veraltet, doch meist ist man eh unterwegs...",4,2018,07,24
47,Ideal en familia,"Estuve alojada con mi marido y mis dos hijos porque acudimos a un concierto, el hotel está muy bien comunicado con la zona de conciertos. Varios autobuses pueden llevarte allí. El trato en la recepción fue magnífico, especialmente la atención de linda, fue muy profesional con sus consejos y muy cariñosa con los niños. Habitación espectacular con literas abatibles muy cómodas para nuestros hijos. La cena en Kurai, restaurante japonés del hotel, fue excelente. El desayuno con gran variedad y calidad. Sin duda repetiremos.",5,2018,07,14
47,Perfektes Hotel an toller Lage,"Dieses Hotel ist absolut perfekt für einen Städtetrip nach Barcelona. Die Lage könnte besser nicht sein. Bushaltestelle, Einkaufszentrum,Sightseeing,Park mit faszinierenden Vögel und sogar einem Hundegarten. Bei der Buchung unbedingt ein Zimmer mit  Blick auf den Square buchen. Diese Zimmer bieten eine fantastische Aussicht.",5,2018,07,14
47,No todo es el dinero,"Teníamos 2 habitaciones dobles reservadas desde Diciembre. Cuatro amigos para ir a un concierto en Montjuic. Elegimos este hotel por la piscina y sus vistas, y por la ubicación ( justo al lado del concierto). 
La tarde antes llamamos para confirmar hora de llegada, etc..., ya que hacia 7 meses desde la reserva. El hotel nos confirmó que la reserva estaba correcta, y comprobaron en su sistema que era de una noche.
Cuando llegamos, e intentamos hacer el check in, nos indicaron que no constaba nuestra reserva. Se había esfumado por ""un error del sistema"".
Además, como estaban completos, nos trasladaban a otro de sus hoteles, según la responsable ""mucho mejor"". Ellos se harían cargo de los costes de traslado, taxis básicamente.
Cuando llegamos al hotel al que nos trasladaban, las habitaciones no estaban listas. Y tardarían 90 minutos. Decidimos esperar allí tomándonos un refresco, que nos cobraron religiosamente.
Además, tuvimos que pagar por anticipado la habitación ( aunque aún no estaban listas).Sorprendentemente los datáfonos no aceptaban la Tarjeta Meliá de American Express ( por lo que tampoco sumamos puntos). 
Sobre el hotel diré que este tenía una pequeña piscina interior sin bar y sin vistas, las habitaciones eran mucho más pequeñas y por supuesto, estaba muy alejado del concierto. Nada que ver con el hotel que habíamos reservado. 
Para rematar nos cobraron una botella de agua del Minibar a la salida ( 3,75 €).

En nuestra opinión, siendo día 1 de Julio, con un concierto multitudinario esa noche al lado del hotel, y con todo completo, dieron nuestras habitaciones a un precio mucho mayor sabiendo que podrían trasladarnos a otro hotel de su cadena.
Entiendo que los negocios estén para ganar dinero, pero nunca a costa del bienestar de sus clientes.

Resumiendo, arruinaron nuestro viaje para asistir al concierto.",1,2018,07,07
47,Molto bello,Un bel l’hotel in un ottima posizione in Plaza Espanya. Camere belle e spaziose con vista molto bella sulla piazza e su Montjuic. Buona spa e bellissimo roof con piscina e vista spettacolare. È ottimamente collegato con la metro subito fuori dall’hotel. ,4,2018,07,04
47,Un 10 personal recepción,"Fin de semana con dos amigas en Barcelona, teníamos reservada una habitación triple y por el mismo precio nos dieron la suite familiar. Simplemente: IMPRESIONANTE. Un 10 para las chicas de recepción que nos atendieron, lastima no acordarme de sus nombres.
El hotel está muy bien ubicado, y la piscina proporciona un gran alivio para el calor de Barcelona.
Un hotel que te hace sentirte comoda en todo momento.
Sólo un único ""pero"" debido a la ubicación del hotel tiene bastante ruido de tráfico por lo que supongo que si te alojan en habitaciones en pisos bajos, nosotras estábamos en la planta 12, molestará bastante para dormir.",5,2018,07,03
47,Excelente,"Nos alojamos en este hotel porque fuimos a un concierto y por proximidad al estadio olímpico nos fué genial. 
El hotel excelente, muy limpio y con todos los detalles. 
La atención excelente. Si tenemos que pasar alguna noche más en Barcelona sin dudarlo escogeremos este hotel.",4,2018,06,24

47,Ha empeorado mucho,"Como ya he escrito en el primer apartado:
La habitación no estaba correctamente limpia.
Hice excesiva cola para el check-in y el check-out
La puesta de la habitación estaba medio rota. no se abría bien, se encallaba y tenias que introducir la llave de tres a cuatro vesces para que se abriera, tras desencallar la maneta
Se me desmagnetizó la llave dos veces en dos dias

",2,2018,06,18
47,"Buen hotel, buena ubicacion","El hotel está perfectamente ubicado en la plaza de españa...mítica plaza en la ciudad frente a la feria de barcelona, junto a un bonito centro comercial y a un paseo de la estación de sants.

Es todo correcto, el servicio, la limpieza, la amplitud de las habitaciones...

En mi opinión, hay 2 cosas que necesitarían mejorar...la cortina en la ducha...hacia una eternidad que no lo veía en un hotel, y menos de esta categoría...y que sólo hay 1 enchufe en toda la habitación hábil para cargar el móvil, y no está junto a la cama...

El resto muy bien.",4,2018,06,11
47,Fantástico hotel,"Hotel muy elegante y con un trato muy cordial y amable. Muy bien situado, cerca de la parada del aerobus y estación de Sants. 
Quizás la única pega es que la bañera está muy alta y tendría que tener una barandilla para poder entrar y salir de la misma con más seguridad",4,2018,06,11
47,CATALONIA PLAZA  = CERCA DE TODO,"EL CATALONIA PLAZA, es un hotel 4 estrellas de los lindos, cerca de todo, muy fácil de ubicar, frente  al Plaza España, con una vista muy bonita de la ciudad.
a mi me dieron una habitaron al frente con vista a la plaza y al Palacio de Montjiuc y la plaza de las cascadas, que desde la piscina es un espectáculo digno de ver.
la habitaciones son buenas, las limpieza es correcta, y el servicio es bueno.
El desayuno no es malo, pero podría ser mejor.
la atención es muy cordial en todos sus empleados, ya sea de piscina, restaurante, botones, lobby y en le mostrador de recepción.
recomiendo sin dudar.",4,2018,06,10
47,Faltan mejoras!,"Fuimos un grupo de amigos en el bar de la terraza que tienen en la octava planta.
El hotel es céntrico, limpio y bien comunicado. El personal muy amable y muy atento a todo.
El bar esta muy bien decorado y tiene unas vistas increíbles.
Pedimos una botella de vino o de cava y nos dijeron que no ofrecían botellas sólo se podía pedir en copa (primer hotel que me encuentro este caso). 
A lo cual decidimos pedir una copa de vino blanco. Cual fue nuestra sorpresa? Ver que no tenían copas y te servían el vino en una especie de vaso bajo de plástico fuerte de no más de tres dedos de altura a un precio de 5€.
Señores si van a cobrar este precio que no está mal por el sitio y las vistas, por favor currárselo (copa de cristal) un poco más no estaría nada mal.",2,2018,06,09
47,Muy buen sitio para estar,"Muy comodo, muy bien ubicado, cerca estación del metro, centro comercial, fuente magica Montjuic con una excelente vista de ella y de la plaza de España, para los turistas buen sitio casi todo esta cerca para ir caminando, el Bufet muy variado, la terraza esta genial en el dia como en la noche.

47,Molto bello e centrale.,"Hotel in piazza di Spagna molto grande.
Come spesso accade, le dimensioni non sono sinonimo di trascuratezza ma di sevizio.
Personale efficiente e gentile, cane pulite e ben organizzate.
Belllissima la vista all’ottavo piano con piscina rooftop molto moderna.
Pulizia delle camere nella media spagnola.
Ho molto apprezzato l’acqu a di cortesia che denota attenzione al cliente business (che non si taglieggia con i tre euro di acqua del minibar).

Consigliato",4,2018,05,27
47,Spettacolo!,"Piacevole sorpresa al nostro arrivo, upgrade l sesto piano con libero accesso alla zona colazione e break pomeridiano, talmente siamo stati bene, che abbiamo deciso di allungare di una notte, cambiando anche il volo di ritorno. Camere comode, personale alla reception cordialissimo e disponibilissimo. Vista dl roof top mozzafiato, direttamente sulla Fontana Magica e sulla suggestiva Plaza d'Espanya. Consigliato, non per tutte le tasche, ma se si trova una buona offerta, un pazzia si può fare. Bar della terrazza e ristorante giapponese, veramente splendidi.",5,2018,05,24
47,Genial pero habitaciones hacia el patio ruidosas,"Un hotel genial, la limpieza, los detalles, el armario con plancha, el baño y sus amenities ... Pero sin tapones imposible dormir. Un ruido tremendo del sistema de climatización del patio o jardín donde se sirven los desayunos. Estábamos en la planta quinta y aún así y con las ventanas cerradas se oía muchísimo. Si fuera un hotel más barato no pasaría nada, pero por el precio que se paga deberían solucionar urgentemente este problema, ya que tuve que adquirir unos tapones para poder dormir",5,2018,05,23
47,Ottima esperienza ,"Hotel posizionato in zona centrale sul splendida piazza di Catalunya. Camere belle, letto comodo pulizia buona.   Colazione fantastica , rooftop da voto 10 con piscina , ristorante bar , palestra e S.p.A. (S.p.A.  a pagamento ).  Ci tornerò ",5,2018,05,22
47,Buena elección,"Estuvo do bien si hay que poner algún pero el temas de no poder subir a la habitación hasta las 14 horas. Muy aconsajeble el desayuno y la piscina.
Las habitaciones son de bastante confort y la localización perfecta",5,2018,05,22
47,Cena de celebracion con 60 comensales en sala reservada,"Cena con menú pactado previo de 35€ con entrantes de croquetas, jamon con coca de pan y una ostra por persona con dos primeros a elegir entre los que habia una ensalada escasa y de segundos un pescado corvina y entrecot con escasa y poco cuidada guarnición y de postre frutas o pastel de chololate todo en general correcto pero no a la altura de la categoria del restaurante Filigrana del mismo hotel que habia degustado en varias ocasiones con excelentes platos y servicio.
La sala muy mal insonorizada imposible mantener una conversacion en la misma mesa sin chillar y con pésimo aire acondicionado ya que pasamos muchisima calor y la respuesta fue que iba a tope pero lo cierto es que no funcionaba correctamente.
Despues de esta experiencia negativa nos planteamos seriamente no repetir la cena de empresa en el Hotel Catalonia Plaza de la plaza España de Barcelona.",2,2018,05,21
47,Maravilloso ya antes de alojarnos.,"Cristina, Jefa de Recepción de Tarde nos arregló un problema que teníamos con la reserva de Internet de forma espectacular. Como no pudo recibirnos al llegar, se apoyó en Alex para ello. Personal muy resolutivo y atento. Hotel estupendo con muchos detalles y con buenos restaurantes. La terraza de la piscina no tiene precio. Volveremos sin dudarlo.",5,2018,05,20
47,Ha mejorado ultimamente,"Hotel bien comunicado aunque no está en el centro estricto de la ciudad. La habitación era espaciosa, bien iluminada, con armarios más que suficientes para una estancia media, con plancha, y máquina Nespreso. El baño era amplísimo con amenities de calidad (la maquinilla de afeitar superior a la media, el aroma del gel de baño sobrio).
En relación a mi visita anterior he apreciado una mejora notable en el desayuno-bufet: variedad de platos calientes (por ejemplo, 3 tipos de salchichas, huevos recién hechos frente al cliente); la fruta cortada de calidad, en su justo punto de madurez, chocolate caliente, cafè muy correcto; variedad de pan, de quesos, etc. El único producto que tuve que dejar por incomestible fueron unos churros gomosos.
La amabilidad del personal excelente: en el restaurante solicité si tenían periódicos, y me trajeron uno a la mesa, que fueron a buscar en recepción; el check-in y -out fueron rapidísimos.
En resumen: no es un hotel barato, pero ha vuelto a mi short-list de hoteles para mis pernoctaciones en Barcelona.",5,2018,05,18
47,Satisfacción,"El Servicio recibido en el Hotel fue de excelente calidad, limpieza de habitación, desayuno variado y de muy buena calidad, áreas comunes limpias, atención general excelente, amabilidad del personal. Agilidad en la entrega de la habitación.",5,2018,05,15
47,Una noche,"Hotel muy 🔝 con una ubicación inmejorable. En el centro de plaza españa, con varias paradas de bus y metro a menos de 50 metros. A 40 metros el ""pequeño"" centro comercial.. la cama de nuestra habitación la mas cómoda que he probado en cualquier otro hotel. Repetiré",4,2018,05,15

47,esperienza da non ripetere,"Hotel vecchio e pulizia veramente pessima, o meglio,  assenza di pulizia. Non adeguate stelle e prezzo. Non mi è piaciuto niente a parte la colazione che era nella media . Personale per niente professionale a parte 2 o 3 persone. Non ci tornerei nonostante la bellissima posizione, ma la pulizia vale molto di più del dover prendere un taxi per raggiungere il centro.",1,2018,05,03
47,Consigliato!!,Molto bello sia fuori che dentro. Ho atteso un po’ per il check-in. Personale molto gentile e a disposizione per qualsiasi esigenza. Struttura nel complesso ben fornita e stanze ben pulite. Sicuramente ci ritornerò!,4,2018,05,03

47,Funcional en gran ubicación.,"Lugar perfecto. El hotel es cómodo y agradable. Pero la habitación en un primero dando a patio interior era muy oscura. Increíble que solo hubieran 2 enchufes en la habitación. Uno en el baño y otro en el escritorio. 
Bufé rico y completo ",3,2018,04,30
47,Buen hotel y buena situación,"Elegimos este hotel por su proximidad a la salida/llegada del Maratón de Barcelona. El hotel en general bastante correcto. La habitación amplia, moderna y bien equipada. Desayuno bueno en cantidad y variedad. Su ubicación muy buena, junto a un centro comercial y una boca de metro. El personal amable y servicial.

Buena opción para visitar Barcelona.",4,2018,04,29

Recomendables bien por cien en relación calidad precio",5,2018,04,19
47,Fabuloso Hotel,"Siempre lo recuerdo, pero había olvidado el nombre de éste Hotel. Es una gran alegría reencontrarlo y así rememorar mi visita a Barcelona, que en realidad fue allá por el año 95 del siglo pasado.- Me encantó vivir en él, la comodidad y amplitud de sus habitaciones. Recuerdo haber cenado solo por que era el único que tenía pagada la media pensión en el tour y culpa de esa lujosa cena, me perdí el espectaculo de las fuentes de agua danzantes justo frente al hotel.- Al día siguiente, caminé por aquel hermoso paseo y por otras calles hasta llegar a la Rambla y el monumento a Colón. También recorrimos en un tour las obras de Gaudí, donde sobresale la Sagrada Familia. (Anécdota: La contemplé y saqué muchas fotos y después descubrí que la entrada estaba justo del otro lado). También recorrimos la zona Olímpica hecha no recuerdo si para un mundial de fútbol o de Olimpiadas.  Junto a Venecia, Barcelona fue lo que más me gustó de aquel primer viaje a Europa y ansío volver por lo que me quedo de ver en Barcelona.-",4,2018,04,17

47,Hotel bueno,"Después de ver alguna opinión, entendí más cosas el hotel tiene un Hall muy bonito y amplio. La zona de desayuno muy bonita. El pero viene en que me dieron una de las habitaciones antiguas y aunque estaba correcta, la bañera con claras manchas de óxido no se puede permitir en un hotel de 4 estrellas.

Alojado en el hotel en donde el primer dia me asignaron una habitacion pegada una.maquina exterior que hacia mucho ruido por lo que dormir era imposible.Tuve que llamar a recepcion a la 1,30 am y me dijeron que me tenian que cambiar porque ese ruido iba a seguir en el tiempo..¿Porque me la.dan entonces?
Al.dia siguiente me cambian de habitacion y cual es mi sorpresa cuando llamo a recepcion para preguntar por el aire acondicionado(en barcelona habia 25 grados)y me indican que NO TIENEN hasta verano y que si tengo calor que ABRA LA VENTANA
Pero que tipo de hotel de.cuatro estrellas es ?
Como se puede permitir?
Sin duda no repetire y en dias de calor hasta el.verano hay mil opciones mejor ya que disponen de aire acondicionado .

Era la segunda vez que iba a este hotel y han mejorado mucho. Si vuelvo a Barcelona, seguramente volveré ahí.",5,2018,03,12
47,Muy bueno. Recomendable,"El hotel bien esta bien situado en una zona donde hay de todo. El personal es amable y eficiente. Nuestras habitaciones amplias y con una buena vista sobre la plaza de España, con camas comodas  y un gran baño. El desayuno correcto.",5,2018,03,09
47,Un día perfecto,"Ya es la segunda vez que me hospedo en este hotel y solo puedo darles muy buenas opiniones. En esta ocasión me quede una sola noche. Cogí una habitación doble superior con terraza y me hicieron upgrade a una suite con terraza sin saberlo; cuando subí por el ascensor y abrí la habitación me quedé muy sorprendida y agradecida. 

Al entrar a la suite, a mano derecha hay una sala de reuniones con sofás, una mesa grande y un televisor, con máquina para hacerte café o tés, un minibar muy bien surtido y puedes pedir comida por el room service. Por esta sala puedes salir a la espectacular terraza con unas fantásticas vistas a Plaza España. Solo al entrar a la suite verás un lavabo para los invitados a la reunión. A mano izquierda de la entrada, hay el pasillo con tres armarios muy grandes dónde guardar tu ropa, uno de ellos tiene una caja fuerte. Al lado del pasillo, hay el baño principal y al fondo, la habitación para dormir. El baño principal tiene un gran espejo, el wc y bidé juntos, una ducha y la fantástica bañera redonda dónde te podrás relajar de todo. La habitación para dormir, tiene una cama muy grande y cómoda, un televisor,  una mesa dónde te dejan el agua de cortesía y dos sillas. Además se puede regular la temperatura. Me encantó el fantástico detalle con el que te obsequian con esta suite. Hacen que tu estancia sea una gran experiencia! En resumen, una suite fantástica y acogedora!

El desayuno consiste en un buffet grande. Hay bollería, lácteos, cereales, panes, tostadora de pan, zumos, cafés, frutas, embutidos y quesos, churros, un apartado dónde te hacen tortilla o huevos al gusto, otro que te hacen crepes o gofres o tortitas, una zona para los celíacos y mucho más!

El hotel es excelente y con muy buen ambiente. El personal del hotel es muy amable. Los recepcionistas siempre te reciben con una gran sonrisa. 
Des de aquí os agradezco el upgrade: gracias por una estancia maravillosa; porque viendo por aquí en Tripadvisor, siempre que pueden, te alegran el día con un upgrade; y esto es de agradecer mucho, porque ves como se preocupan por el cliente y te tratan muy bien. 

Recomiendo mucho este hotel y estoy segura de que repetiré muchas más veces con ustedes cuando tenga que quedarme en Barcelona. Muchas gracias por su fantástico servicio! Muchas gracias por todo!!",5,2018,03,06
47,Viaje de Negocios a BCN,"Considero que las instalaciones están anticuadas para tratarse de un hotel de 4 estrellas situado justo enfrente del recinto ferial de la ciudad. Cuando te alojas en un hotel de estas características y en una urbe como Barcelona esperas que el ambiente general, tanto en zonas comunes como en las habitaciones, sea más moderno y marque la diferencia.",3,2018,03,06

47,Estancia de lujo,"Fin de semana excepcional en este hotel.
Situado en la plaza de España, con unas vistas magníficas (no te puedes perder las vistas desde la piscina en el piso 8) con  la entrada del metro en la misma puerta y delante del centro comercial las Arenas. 
El personal muy amable y profesional nos obsequiron con una habitación ejecutivo De tres plazas (no habíamos pagado por ello) donde además  de lo habitual había cafetera, infusiones,cafés y agua de cortesía en la habitación.
La habitación  muy limpia,amplia y acogedora.
Debo destacar y recomendar encarecidamente el restaurante Filigrana donde disfrutamos de una cena de lujo (comimos el menu de 38 euros)y nos rebajaron un 10 por ciento  por ser clientes del hotel.
Hotel altamente recomendable.
Esta cadena de hoteles nunca nos defrauda.",5,2018,02,12
47,"Hotel de categoria, Spa pésimo","No entiendo como un hotel de categoria permite que una empresa tan pésima y estafadora gestione su Spa. Hotel maravilloso y muy bien ubicado, personal excelente! Lástima que por culpa del Spa pierda calidad",3,2018,02,08
47,Fantastico,"Posizione ideale. Curato e pulito. Camere molto spaziose. Staff cortese e disponibile. Tornerò sicuramente quando farà più caldo. Terrazza con piscina panoramica da sfruttare assolutamente. Ristorante sushi ottimo, anche lì uno staff attento e gentilissimo. Bravi!!! ",5,2018,02,06

47,4 stelle meritate,"L'albergo è in una posizione comoda da cui muoversi in città ed letteralmente a due passi da una stazione nevralgica della rete metropolitana di Barcellona.

La camera in cui sono stato era ampia, elegantemente arredata e con un ampio bagno.
Pulita e silenziosa, con un accesso wi-fi ad Internet piuttosto veloce, mi ha garantito una permanenza confortevole e lo sarebbe stata ancor di più se fosse stato possibile regolare la temperatura che di notte, per i miei gusti, era alta.
Insomma era gennaio ma Barcellona non è Oslo...

La colazione, piuttosto variegata offre cibi caldi, freddi, dolci e salati di buona qualità; da menzionare la spremuta d'arancia sempre fresca e deliziosa così come la frutta (ananas e meloni) tagliata a fette e le brioche.

Il personale è molto cortese e disponibile.

In conclusione, è un bel albergo che si presta bene a far da base sia per viaggi di lavoro che di piacere.

I prezzi sono proporzionali al livello offerto dall'albergo, che si merita interamente le 4 stelle.",4,2018,02,03
47,gran hotel,"excelente ubicación en el centro de barcelona. muy buenas habitaciones recien reformadas y con un baño a la altura de un hotel de esta categoria. La servicios al cliente en la zona de ascensores de la planta son una gozada, frutas, cafes, pastas, golosinas...

47,Capodanno,"Un bellissimo capodanno in piazza a Barcellona!  E per far questo abbiamo prenotato la notte del 31 in questo hotel che si trova proprio in plaza Espana. Posizione ottima. Servizio eccellente. Camere grandi con vetrata proprio sulla piazza. Noi avevamo una camera laterale con vista arena. Sebbene l'hotel era molto pieno, considerata la data, non ci sono stati disservizi, anzi ci hanno dato la camera al nostro arrivo alle 10. Perfetto per chi vuole un buon hotel in ottima posizione per visitare questa stupenda città.",5,2018,01,24
47,Estancia genial! ,Estuvimos una noche de fin de semana en una suite. La estancia estaba genial y las vistas eran espectaculares. El personal del hotel fue muy agradable y amable. Nos trajeron agua de cortesía y unos bombones. El café de la habitación era bastante bueno. Nada que objetar en esta experiencia.,5,2018,01,22
47,Un spa no recomendable,"El personal del hotel impecable. EL spa desastroso. Huele mal sobre todo sobre las 12 del  mediodía y nunca están. Además te dan gato por liebre. Disminuye la calidad del establecimiento.

I don´t recommend the spa. It smells bad and they are never available. Bad experience. It reduces the quality of the place.",2,2018,01,22
47,Excelente hotel,"Ubicación excelente, muy bien comunicado y con un buen servicio. La habitación estaba limbia y tenía pequeños detalles como toallero eléctrico, espejo de aumento... muy útiles

47,Personal muy amable y eficaz,"La atención del personal, en todos los departamentos fue excelente. En recepción muy amables y siempre atentos. En los desayunos siempre con una sonrisa y serviciales, fueron de gran ayuda ya que íbamos con dos niños pequeños. Las camareras de pisos simplemente espectaculares. Habitación muy limpia y nunca faltó de nada, excelente trabajo y personal muy amable siempre que coincidimos.",5,2018,01,15

47,Buen hotel.,"El hotel está bastante bien, personal amable, tranquilo, el mobiliario necesita una renovación pero está todo muy bien cuidado y mantenido.  Las habitaciones no son ruidosas a pesar de la zona donde está situado. Muy cerca de la estación, enfrente de un centro comercial, rodeado de comercios.",4,2018,01,13
47,Excelente para año nuevo,"con una ubicación inmejorable, la terraza con vista a la fuente de Monjuic, un año para recordar

47,Excelente en todo,"Totalmente recomendable por relación precio-calidad, ubicación está muy bien comunicado, es un hotel que tiene buenas instalaciones como spa, gimnasio, una terraza espectacular con unas vistas impresionantes, una piscina .....El trato del personal muy amable y atento,  el restaurante tiene mucha variedad y calidad ,la  decoración y mobiliario de la habitación muy nuevos, tambié nmuy limpia, en general toto excelente.

Muchas gracias!!

Volveré, sin dudas!!",5,2018,01,10
47,Bien ubicado pero descuidado,"El hotel está bien ubicado pero la habitación que me tocó estaba absolutamente sucia, creo que en un año no habían barrido debajo de la cama. El 31 de diciembre compre un vino en el bar y estaba horrible. Es imperdonable que en España uno pueda tomarse un vino de mala calida. El personal muy amable y sobre todo súper ágil. La ubicación y el personal salvan el hotel",3,2018,01,10
47,Ha sido GENIAL!,"Nos ha encantado! Las vistas a Montjuic son espectaculares y el servicio del personal increible!!
La terraza es muy bonita. Habitación muy limpia y amplia. La única pega el ascensor, para subir a la terraza, nosotros estábamos alojados en la 5a planta, y teníamos que bajar a recepción para coger otro ascensor que subiese directamente. Por lo demás todo estupendo.
Sin duda, volveremos!!",5,2018,01,10
47,"Un buen hotel, muy confortable","La estancia ha sido muy satisfactoria. El baño y la habitación son muy confortables, los detalles de almuerzo y merienda en el hall de la planta 6ª se agradecen. El desayuno era muy completo. El ticket del parking no funcionaba, pero nos abrían con relativa rapidez desde recepción. La azotea con piscina es fabulosa. ¡Una pena que hacía frío para disfrutarla mejor! La botella de agua mineral y los bombones gratuitos en la habitación son un detalle a valorar.",5,2018,01,09
47,CELEBRACIÓN BODA,"Celebramos el banquete de nuestra boda en este hotel. Decir que el trato por parte de la directora de convenciones que había en ese momento (Y.G), fue pésimo;
En el primer contacto que tuvimos con ella, cuando todavía no habíamos decidido donde realizar el convite, ofreció hacernos un descuento sobre el precio, también nos comentó que tendríamos el parking del hotel disponible para todos los invitados sin ningún coste adicional. 
Después de haber dado la paga y señal para la reserva, en la prefectura, nos aplicó un cargo por hacer el ""pica pica"" en la terraza del hotel, que anteriormente no nos había mencionado. Obviamente nos quejamos y finalmente nos lo descontó.
A 48 horas del enlace, cuando tuvimos que realizar el pago por adelantado del evento, nos dimos cuenta que el descuento aplicado tampoco era el pactado en un inicio (era inferior), lógicamente también nos quejamos, y nos contestó de muy malas formas, diciendo que el descuento estaba bien aplicado. 
Puesto que estábamos a dos días del enlace, tuvimos que pagar el importe de más que nos estaban aplicando. Dicho importe se nos devolvió unos meses después, ya que pusimos una queja al hotel exponiendo todo lo sucedido con esta persona y mostrando los mails que habíamos intercambiado, donde quedaba claro el trato recibido por parte de esta persona (insisto, la que era directora del hotel Plaza)
El día del evento (una vez allí con los invitados), nos hicieron saber que se iba a cobrar 5€ a cada invitado que había dejado su coche en el parking del hotel, una vez más nos volvimos a quejar y tuvieron que rectificar.
Ya por último, comentar que al final del evento, en la ""barra libre"" (también pactada con el menú), sirvieron las copas y refrescos de cualquier manera, los gin tonics y las tónicas sin su pieza de fruta, decían no tener zumos de fruta para las personas que querían tomar algún combinado con zumos, etc...

Fue una muy mala experiencia que no se la recomiendo a nadie. Me consta que ya no está la misma persona como responsable del departamento de convenciones, pero he de decir, que un hotel con este prestigio no se puede permitir tener directores tan poco profesionales.",1,2018,01,09
47,Bien pero la limpieza de las habitaciones mal,"El hotel está muy bien situado, con el metro en la puerta.
En general es un buen hotel, aunque le hace falta un repaso y renovación de algunas cosas (bañera, suelos, etc)
El personal es amable.
Sin embargo las habitaciones están sucias, en el suelo del baño encontrarás pelos sin mucho esfuerzo y en la habitación pelusas de polvo en cuanto mires un poco.
Tuve que mover un poco la mesilla de noche para coger un bolígrafo del suelo y......madre mía!!! Lo que había detrás!!! Una auténtica despensa de migas, polvo, papeles, etc. 
En la no daria un cero pero desde luego una nota por debajo la media y de lo esperado para un hotel como este.",2,2018,01,09
47,Tolle Stadt ,"Barcelona ist eine wirklich tolle und junge Stadt 
Durch Gaudi ist die Stadt wahnsinnig interessant 
Die Tapas Bars sind vorzüglich ! 
Das die Stadt direkt am Meer liegt ist auch ein großer plus Punkt

47,Maestoso,"Siamo stati in questo prestigioso hotel per il capodanno 2018 a Barcellona, e non potevamo scegliere di meglio. L'hotel si trova nella piazza principale di Barcellona, a pochi metri dalla fermata della metropolitana Espanya, e fermata taxi proprio sotto l'hotel, in più autobus per aeroporto di Barcellona e diversi collegamenti con tutta la città.
Posizione perfetta per girare a piedi o con i mezzi pubblici la città. 
L'hotel è imponente, vanta 8 piani di camere (tra cui vista plaza, superior, superior terraza, executive, executive vista plaza, junior suite, suite, suite terraza,suite familiar, suite reloj) compresa Spa, piscina, palestra, sala conferenza/meeting. e una terrazza.
L'hotel oltre ad essere un hotel di lusso, viene apprezzato per la cordialità e gentilezza di tutto lo staff, a partire dagli addetti alla reception (parlano tutte le lingue) passando per i camerieri, fino ad arrivare alle signore delle pulizie, un gruppo esemplare che fa di questo hotel il punto di riferimento della città. I nostri più sentiti ringraziamenti.

47,PRECIOSA HABITACIÓN Y RIQUÍSIMO DESAYUNO,"El hotel está muy bien ubicado, justo al lado del autobús A1, A2, que lleva al Aeropuerto.

Cama 2x2 muy comoda. Vistas a la plaza y muy bien situado. El personal muy amable, sobretodo el recepcionista que nos atendió a la llegada.",5,2017,12,11
47,Menos agradar oídos y más actuar.,"La categoría no se mantiene sólo por exhibir estrellas. La gente que vamos a este tipo de alojamientos esperamos que se esté a la altura de las circunstancias, que para eso se paga el servicio. Si no, podríamos ir a otro alojamiento más limitado.

El personal del hotel, por su política de acutuación, fue lamentable.
Un hotel de esa supuesta categoría y precio no debería limitarse a ofrecer un check in y regalar de serie dos copas de cava.
Nos encontramos con la habitación fría y nos fuimos igual.
Se hizo saber a recepción. Tuvimos que llamar dos veces porque la primera parece que no fue suficiente. El personal que enviaron no estaba preparado para solucionarlo, por tanto no se solucionó. Nadie se puso en contacto con nosotros para saber si se había resuelto.
En estos casos, no entiendo cómo en ese proceso tan posiblemente común haya tantos errores en el proceso y en la actuación.
Lo que puede servir para lucirse y mostrar la categoría del hotel de una forma sencilla y eficaz, se convierte en un fuerte contratiempo para las aspiraciones a mantener tal categoría.
Decepcionante.",2,2017,12,06
47,Una escapada fantástica,"Estuvimos alojados en la 12ª planta, con unas vistas maravillosas. La habitación era muy amplia y cómoda y la limpieza excelente. Además, la amabilidad de todo el personal era constante y digna de mención.

Die Möbel waren bei Ankuft sehr staubig, im Badezimmer waren Haare am Boden, Armaturen in der Dusche waren abgebrochen und der Duschschlauch ist angerissen. Dies sollte in einem 4 Sterne Haus definitiv nicht sein !
Beim duschen wurde das Wasser abwechselnd Feuer heiss oder Eis kalt - so dass die morgentliche Dusche eher eine 'Strafe' war. 
Für ein Executive Room war das Zimmer recht klein. ",3,2017,12,04
47,Magnífico,"Perfecto en todos los sentidos. Un lugar agradable, céntrico, sin el menor problema. Muy recomendable  para todo el mundo. Hemos estado tan bien que nos ha dado pena tener que marcharnos. No tengo sugerencias que hacer",5,2017,12,04
47,Un lujo de habitación.,"Todo perfecto, la tele, la cama, las vistas, con el solo fallo de la ducha, que no funcionaba bien, y no era una cosa del momento, pues salia agua por todos los sitios y te mojabas el pelo, aun que no quisieses. Era una averí que tenia que estar reparada al entrar alguien en la habitación.
",5,2017,12,02
47,Experiencia para olvidar,"Después de hacer la reserva con tres meses de antelación, llegamos al hotel y no teníamos habitación . Gran esperar 30 min nos dan una habitación que más que de un hotel de cuatro estrellas es una mala pensión. 1 piso ruido infernal , el baño del año de la tarara. Bajo amablemente a recepción para que me cambien pagando la diferencia por una habitación acorde a las estrellas y me dicen que imposible. Me sorprende ver que para las mismas fechas en la web de booking si que me dan habiatacion . En fin Barcelona y su oferta hotelera para olvidar. Experiencia nefasta

47,Una velada inolvidable,"Me trasladan por trabajo a otra ciudad, me apetecia ser ""Turista"" en la ciudad que me vió nacer, ademas aproveché que una revista de arte estaba interesada en entrevistarme y hacerme una sesion de fotos, que mejor que el Plaza ( conocia las vistas de The Clock, la terraza de verano del hotel) y siempre que he subido he pensado en alojarme en la suite de la Terraza. Pues junté todos esos deseos y añadí una cena con amigos en el Japones del hotel.Todo Fantástico, ahora que ya no seré ""Barcelonés"" por empadronamiento mi ""casa"" será el Plaza.",5,2017,11,27

47,Excelente experiencia,"Fui por motivo laboral. 
No puedo opinar sobre el precio porque no corría a mi cargo.
Ubicación excelente en la misma Plaza de España que tiene parada del autobús del aeropuerto y de metro. Muy cerca de la Fira y Montjuic.
Frente al centro comercial Arena.
El buffet del desayuno completísmo.
El personal de recepción muy amable y colaborador.
No pude disfrutarlo la 100% porque mi estancia fue sólo 1 noche.",4,2017,11,20
47,NOS DEJARON SIN SUITE TERRAZA RESERVADA,"El pasado día 16 de noviembre fue mi aniversario, y mi pareja me regaló una noche en la suite terraza (80m2 + 30m2 terraza). Nos pedimos fiesta del trabajo, lo dejamos todo bien organizado y nos fuimos a pasar el día a bcn. La sorpresa nos la llevamos cuando fuimos a hacer el check in a las tres del mediodía del día 17 y la recepcionista nos dice que la habitación está ocupada, que la reserva está bien hecha pero que la habitación ya estaba reservada des de antes de que mi pareja la hiciese. Pero que además no tiene el número de teléfono de mi pareja (cuando él sí que lo dio) con lo cual no nos han podido llamar para avisarnos. 

La solución que nos ofrecen al momento es darnos una suite estándar (sin terraza y mucho más pequeña) con el desayuno incluido. No nos parece lógico que nos ofrezcan una habitación de categoría INFERIOR y decimos que no. La respuesta de la recepcionista: lo siento mucho, pero no puedo ofreceros más.  

Al rato llamamos y pedimos hablar con el supervisor, que según nos dicen no está. Hablamos con el jefe de recepción que nos dice que el motivo del problema es que el huésped que estaba en la suite y debería haberla dejado a las 12, está ilocalizable y hay algunas de sus pertinencias dentro de la habitación. Motivo que no se parece mucho con el que nos dieron al principio. 

Al final, a las 21h nos mandan un correo y nos dicen que lo sienten mucho y que CUANDO HAYA DISPONIBILIDAD nos ofrecen la suite con terraza, u otras suites, a precio de habitación estándar. Una buena recompensación pero el mal rato, el día de fiesta pedido en el trabajo, y el día perdido no nos lo quita nadie. 

PD: Estoy escribiendo esta opinión a día 19 y seguimos sin haber encontrado una fecha para ir… puesto que no es tan fácil encontrar un día que tanto el hotel como nosotros coincidamos en disponibilidad. En fin, muy decepcionados",1,2017,11,19

47,Grata sorpresa.,"Hotel perfecto para correr la carrera de la mujer. Al lado de un centro comercial, 2 restaurantes y 2 cafeterías en el mismo edifico. Frente a plaza España.

A 10 minutos en metro para ir al centro y a 30 minutos andando de plaza Cataluña. Unas vistas increibles. Volveremos seguro.",5,2017,11,13
47,"Il migliore, punto.","Sono stato qui qualche giorno fa ed è diventato il mio hotel preferito a Barcellona.
Da che parte comincio?
La posizione: la mia camera affacciava sul cortile interno...peccato per la vista sul ristorante, ma il silenzio è assicurato. Stanza ampia, pulita, ben rifinita ed arredata, con un efficace condizionatore ed un bagno spazioso e vivibile. Le camere (e la terrazza) che affacciano su plaça d'Espanya hanno una vista incantevole. E Monjuïc è a due passi.

Appena entrati si respira subito un'aria di classe: arredi, rivestimenti, luci...un piacere per i sensi.

E poi, la colazione: il cortile interno, con una superficie di 1000mq attrezzato a ""sala"" mediante tensiostruttura, dove puoi gustare un'ampia varietà di piatti appena cucinati.

Prezzo adeguato, ma non teme confronti.",5,2017,11,08

47,Positiva,"Fue una estancia corta. El lobby un poco frio y oscuro. Servicio de bar bastante caro. En general bastante agradable.

47,Buen hotel bien hubicado,"Hotel de categoría que siendo muy grande, y estando prácticamente al 95% de ocupación durante mi estancia no daba esa sensación de bullicioso, está perfectamente ubicado enfrente de la feria de Barcelona en la Plaza de España. Con buenas conexiones al aeropuerto y a la estación de tren. Tiene El Centro comercial al lado lo cual le da una ventaja. Las habitaciones son espaciosas, diseñadas con gusto y muy funcionales. Las camas de primera categoría. El desayuno muy variado, en un restaurante amplísimo en el patio interior del edificio. Tiene una piscina en la última planta aunque como estaba lloviendo no la pude usar. Buen hotel para una estancia en Barcelona tanto por trabajo como por turismo.",4,2017,10,26

47,Gotisches Viertel ,Ein schöner Tag im gotischen Viertel in Barcelona. Wir sind den ganzen Tag durch das gotische Viertel spaziert. Schöne und interessante Gebäude und Atmosphäre in diesem Viertel. Nicht soviel Trubel wir auf der Ramblas. Sehr zu empfehlen ,4,2017,10,25
47,Desorganización y falta de profesionalidad,"Fuimos con la família a ver el espectáculo de las fuentes de Montjuïc desde la terraza del Hotel el Jueves 12 de Octubre.
Primero decir que en la terraza ya no servían cenas ni nada de comida, ya que la cierran a finales de Septiembre. (pero hombre...!!! si tienen la mejor terraza para ver las Fuentes de Montjuïc!!! y el hotel está en Bcn, no en la Costa Brava donde puede que sí que haya terminado la temporada de verano, però en Barcelona? y con el calor que hace aún? que pocas ganas y visión de negocio y popularidad.
Pero además de eso, a parte de no tener claro los horarios del bar de la terraza, pq en recepciòn nos dijeron hasta las 22:00h y la chica del bar decía que cerraba a las 21:00h... vaya poca profesionalidad de este servicio, tratando ""de tu"" al los clientes y de cualquier manera.
Total... que nos fuimos a ver el espectáculo en las mismas fuentes, y nos fuimos a cenar a casa, pq tampoco nos motivó nada el restaurante japonés del hotel.
Vaya... para no ir más ni recomendarlo.",2,2017,10,20
47,Detalles que hacen le hacen diferente,"Habitaciones completas,al detalle,limpias y comodas...acabados del baño de primera.. ducha impresionante..albornoces y zapatillas de casa... muy impresionado... centrico y comodo.. cc plaza al lado...como en casa",5,2017,10,16
47,Ottimo hotel nel cetro di Barcelona,"Ci sono stato agli inizi di ottobre per lavoro, ottima posizione, stanza spaziosa, letto confortevole e grande. Lo consiglio a chiunque, sia per lavoro che per turismo. La colazione a buffet ottima, esperienza da ripetere al più presto. ",5,2017,10,16
47,Terraza perfecta en verano,"Vistas espectaculares y además con piscina. Se puede también comer aunque sea de forma ligera. 
Por la tarde se puede tomar algo y disfrutar de vistas espectaculares de la ciudad. 
Tiene hamacas y barra. Creo que se puede venir durante todo el día aunque no seas huésped. 
",4,2017,10,15
47,Hoteles de la Olimpiadas,"Este es uno de los emblemáticos ,que yo recuerde de las añoradas Olimpiadas Barcelona 92. Su situación es muy buena, Plaza España al lado de la Fira de Barcelona y Montjuïc, y en su momento el diseño fue rompedor.

Había estado ya una vez, no recuerdo si en 1993 ó 1994 y me llevé una gran impresión, por lo que me hizo ilusión volver después de tanto tiempo.

Está a apenas 15 minutos andando desde Sants, si vienes en tren aunque lleves maleta puedes ir perfectamente caminando dado que es una suave cuesta abajo.

Trámites de entrada muy sencillos, numerosos ascensores que funcionan bien incluso en hora punta, largos pasillos hasta llegar a la habitación, el hotel es grande.

Cuarto amplio, con facilidad para deshacer el equipaje, baño separado y de tamaño correcto. Armarios grandes, las puertas correderas merecerían un lijado para que fueran mejor, perchas suficientes. Decoración agradable y luces sencillas de usar. Café y té de cortesía.

Cama espaciosa y cómoda, 2 tipos de almohada. Tv de pantalla plana, bastantes canales no están disponibles.

Adminículos de aseo de calidad y abundante oferta, si te falta alguna cosa en recepción te la facilitan. Látima hay bañera y no ducha, al menos el chorro de agua caliente es poderoso y no te juegas la vida entrando y saliendo de la misma.

Un pequeño fallo es la caja de seguridad, colocada de manera muy incómoda a ras de suelo, precisa una llave especial que has de solicitar en recepeción. 

El desayuno tipo bufé se sirve en una gran sala de la planta baja instalada en una gran carpa en lo que debía ser un patio interior. útil en cuanto a dimensiones y posibildad de presentar todo en condiciones, pero un tanto desangelado, me resultó poco acogedor. Y es pena porque la oferta gastronómica es de sobresaliente en todos los sentidos, con detalles en cuanto a calidad y surtido de gran hotel, disfruté un montón. Además el personal muy amable y competente.
En resumen, un buen 4* en todos los aspectos con un desayuno excepcional.",4,2017,10,13
47,"Muy antiguo, poco cuidado","El hotel está viejo, poco cuidado, con puertas roídas, bañeras con los suelos ennegrecidos, ausencia de enchufes en la habitación para cargar los teléfonos... Para ser un hotel que se vende como de congresos, el estado es bastante malo.
El desayuno es correcto, con buen pan y jamón, se hace en una especie de carpa dentro del patio.
La piscina, aunque de tamaño muy pequeño comparando con lo que uno se espera, tiene unas vistas muy bonitas. Los precios del bar, excesivos.
No lo recomiendo, salvo que tengas la suerte de que te toque una de las pocas habitaciones renovadas.",1,2017,10,11
47,Bueno en general,"Desayuno muy bueno, terraza muy bonita para tomar algo, aunque cuando cierran no se lo piensan, apagan las luces y fuera.lentos en el check in. Situación general muy buena. Cortinas en la bañera, no mola ",4,2017,10,10
47,Keine 4 Sterne wert,"Unfreundliche Massenabfertigung beim check-in. abschreckende Verpflichtung sofort zu zahlen.
Zimmerausstattung: Defektes Fenster, defekte Badewanne, defekte Badewannenarmatur, defekter und fleckiger Türrahmen, keine Bademäntel
Spa-Bereich ist ein Witz: Eine uralte schmutzige Sauna ohne Aufgussofen, es wird nur ein Badetuch zur Verfügung gestellt, keine Bademäntel, keine Latschen im Angebot. Es gibt keinen Ruheraum.",2,2017,10,10
47,Vistas espectaculares ,"Llegamos al hotel y nos asignaron una muy buena habitación. Las vistas eran espectaculares. sin embargo al estar situados al lado del bar piscina se oía el bullicio de la gente al lado de nuestra puerta mientras esperaban al ascensor.
La ubicación en plaza espanya es excelente. Personalmente a mi pareja y a mi nos encanta esa zona y es el motivo por el que contratamos este hotel.
La única pega que puedo poner es el lío que se formó la recepcionista con la factura, ya que a la hora de hacer la reserva online contraté 2 pack que aparecen en el correo de confirmación. Unos meses atrás me había puesto en contacto con ellos por email para eliminar estos dos packs y supuestamente estaba solucionado. Sin embargo, cuando llegamos al hotel todavía estaban los cargos en la factura. Por lo que tuve que mostrar el bono del hotel que casualmente lo tenía impreso. Aunque a simple vista esto no tiene mayor importancia, lo que le puso la guinda al pastel fue la mala cara con la que nos miró la recepcionista al no haber cogido los packs.
Por último y para terminar con el lío de la factura, al hacer el check out nos querían cobrar un cargo del minibar que no habíamos hecho.
En definitiva,  el hotel y sus instalaciones son perfectas pero le falta mejorar en la atención al cliente.",4,2017,10,10
47,il MIO hotel a barcellona,"il mio hotel a bcn, ottima posizione, fermata metro e taxi davanti all'hotel, nonchè fermata del airbus da e per l'aeroporto (comodissimo ed economico), si arriva in pieno centro anche a piedi, e poi è  vicinissimo a quello che io chiamo il triangolo delle bermuda dove ci sono i ristoranti più trendy della città, ,camere  belle e spaziose, ottima la prima colazione, servizio impeccabile. ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo.",5,2017,10,09
47,"Una reforma,  por favor. ","Sí bien cuando fue inaugurado era un muy buen hotel, actualmente es el clásico hotel para turistas,  muy desgastado y que necesita a gritos una rehabilitación, especialmente de las habitaciones. 
De entrada, a partir de las 8h de la mañana,  las habitaciones resultan insoportables por los numerosos ruidos interiores y exteriores. Además, requieren una reforma urgente,  pues ,  por ejemplo,  las puertas de los armarios tienen los cantos rotos,  dejando el aglomerado a la vista. Peor  están los baños. Resulta extraño que un hotel de 4 estrellas tenga una vulgar cortina de baño en vez de una mampara. Súmese que la grifería está muy deteriorada por el uso y que el agua,  no muy abundante ,sale al mismo tiempo por el grifo de la ducha y de la bañera.Además, la bañera esta sobreelevada,por lo que resulta un peligro para el desplazamiento de las personas mayores. En cuanto al buffet es claramente mejorable. Por favor, no se les ocurra probar los churros. 
Lo mejor del hotel, el buen trato de su personal,  con la excepción del restaurante  del hotel  FILIGRANA, y su buena ubicación.  Están avisados.",3,2017,10,07

47,Mejor que en Casa,"Es la segunda vez que elijo el Hotel Catalonia Barcelona, y aseguro que no será la ultima.
Lo cogi por practico, ya que estaba al lado de la feria que exponía, pero la amabilidad y la atención recibidas , hace que sea una opción preferente en otras visitas a Barcelona también. Las habitaciones están bien, tiene todo tipo de servicios, el personal es amable, esta bien comunicado en Metro y taxi.. Realmente bien",5,2017,10,03
47,"Ojo si te olvidas algo en la habitación, no aparece! Que verguenza","Tras olvidarme 3 prendas de ropa en el armario y llamar en menos de 24 horas, me contestan que no aparecieron, por lo que saco en claro que el personal se ha quedado con ellas o no ha limpiado bien y no la aha encontrado. Conclusion no son mucho de fiar... resto bien.",2,2017,10,02
47,Excelente,"Inmejorable todo, empezando por la ubicación, lo bello que es el hotel , la habitación muy amplia con dos toillete,limpieza increíble, el personal muy atento y servicial, la verdad todo lindo!

47,Coole Poolbar,Wir waren nur auf einen Drink auf der Dach terasse. Tolle Aussicht bei Traumwetter. Die Getränke freundlich serviert und preislich in Ordnung.  Saubere Toiletten. Zu dem Hotel selber kann ich nichts sagen.,5,2017,09,23
47,Ungenügendes Hotel ,"Auffällig schlechter Service - Personal teilweise unfreundlich. Angefragte Serviceleistungen (z.B. Bügeleisen und -brett) wurden erst nach Stunden und unvollständig erbracht. Mal ehrlich - was soll ich denn nachts um halb eins noch mit nem Bügeleisen? Und dann noch ohne Bügelbrett?
Wach war ich aber noch: sind nämlich extrem laute Zimmer - sowohl in Richtung Strasse als auch Innenhof (Brummen der Klimaanlage).
Altes Badezimmer mit deutlichen Abnutzungserscheinungen. 
Frühstück in hallenartigem Innenhof.  Nicht unbedingt gemütlich. 
Um es kurz zu machen: das Geld nicht wert. 
Lediglich die Dachterasse mit Pool ist spektakulär. ",1,2017,09,22

47,La mejor habiatación del hotel y la mejor terraza de Barcelona,"me alojé con mi pareja en la Suite del Reloj. La mejor habitación del hotel presidida por ventana reloj que ocupa casi toda una pared. Una estancia de lujo en un lugar inmejorable. Una cama enorme y muy cómoda donde descansar después de un día de turismo. Una zona de sofás y televisión junto con otra que hace la función de comedor con una mesa muy grande y unas preciosas sillas donde poder contemplar las vistas que hay detrás de la ventana. Todo cuidado al detalle y muy limpio. El lavabo es grande pero lo más espectacular es la ducha que cuenta con cuatro alcachofas (dos en cada lado). Es una ducha enorme. A parte de la habitación, que es perfecta y lujosa, el hotel dispone de gimnasio, sauna y una espectacular terraza superior con piscina abierta durante el día y que por la noche se transofma en un lugar ideal para tomar una copa y para contemplar la Barcelona nocturna y el espectáculo de las fuentes mágicas de Montjuic. Una estancia única y muy recomendable. Además al estar alojados en la Suite del Reloj, nos dieron unas copas de bienvenida que tomamos arriba en la terraza.",5,2017,09,04

47,BODAS DE ORO INOLVIDABLES,"Celebramos las bodas de oro de mis suegros en este fabuloso hotel y se convirtió en un día inolvidable para todos, gracias al buen trabajo, la amabilidad y el cariño de cada uno de sus empleados. La sala donde  celebramos, espectacular, gracias a sus modernos equipos de audiovisuales,la amplitud, la decoración acorde al acontecimiento,  todos los pequeños  detalles que la hicieron especial.
En cuanto a la habitación, la SUITE DEL RELOJ, preciosa, magnífica,amplia,luminosa y con una decoración cuidada al milímetro y unas vistas espectaculares de la Plaza España, Montjuic y sus fuentes que cambian de color,en definitiva, indescriptible.

47,Muy buena estancia,Me ha gustado mucho el hotel porque las habitaciones son fantasticas.. el desayuno y el personal del hotel muy amable.

Accanto all hotel il centro commerciale Arena con negozi e ristoranti.

47,EXCELENTES VISTA Y SERVICIOS,"Estuvimos con mi esposa en Julio, tuvimos una estadía muy confortable, excelente servicio, hermosa la vista a plaza Espanya y las fuentes, la ubicación es muy buena, la piscina en el 8°piso tiene unas vistas excelentes con las instalaciones de buen nivel y cómodas, el servicio de room service muy bueno en calidad y precio. Ya habíamos estado en otra ocasión y ambas veces quedamos totalmente conformes, solo quedamos, en esta ocasión, un tanto desconformes con la atención de una de las conserjes que realmente estaba lejos del nivel de eficiencia del resto del personal que es muy amable y atento.",5,2017,08,09
47,Una vista magica,"Hotel comodissimo per girare la città di Barcellona, esattamente di fronte alla stazione della metro e davanti alla fermata per il bus navetta che porta direttamente all'aeroporto El Prat. Ho soggiornato due volte al Plaza e mi sono sempre trovata splendidamente. Appena aperta la porta della camera sono rimasta incantata dalla vista imponente sulla piazza, che è davvero strepitosa; solo quella varrebbe la scelta dell'hotel! il letto king size comodissimo e la pulizia ottima. La colazione offre un'alta qualità dei prodotti e viene servita da personale sempre attento. Purtroppo non ho potuto usufruire della piscina perché il meteo non me lo ha permesso ma ho potuto sorseggiare un aperitivo offerto dall'Hotel sulla splendida terrazza. Tutto davvero super! Barcellona è sempre una città spendita, da visitare a fondo e in ogni suo angolo. Spero di tornarci presto!",5,2017,08,09

47,Relax e turismo,"Hotel molto attento al cliente nei servizi, caffè , bibite e snaks al piano, piscina e terrazza con vista super panoramica e spettacolo tutte le sere sulla fontana magica. Comodissimo alla metro, uscita dell'hotel praticamente sull'entrata delle linea rossa. Personale non sempre cortese e preparato, dipendeva molto da chi c'era . Unico lato negativo: la nostra porta della camera al 6° piano era di fronte alla porta di transito nelle scale che permettevano l'accesso alla terrazza e alla piscina: sbatteva in continuazione! Comunque da consigliare!",4,2017,08,08
47,HOTEL MUY BIEN SITUADO,"Destacar la sitauación del Hotel. Desde su piscina situada en la planta 8º se ve todo Barcelona las vistas son impresionantes. Encontramos tres accesos al metro cerca del hotel,  Centro comercial El Arenal, con varios restaurantes en su última planta estupendos.

Les he pedido por escrito y en persona varias veces que me hagan una propuesta de acuerdo a las condiciones de mis recurrentes visitas.
De la misma manera que el personal de recepción es muy amable, me indican que ellos no pueden hacer nada al respecto y que hay que solicitarlo por escrito a Reservas.
Es muy frustrante ver como tus correos los envían directamente a la papelera de reciclaje sin molestarse a contestar no tan solo un acuse de recibo.
Nunca mas trabajaré con esta cadena.",1,2017,07,26

47,Correcto: en la media de un hotel de 4*,"Las instalaciones son amplias y bien conservadas; el personal atiende rápida y discretamente, y su ubicación es buena sin estar en el centro saturado. Sólo el desayuno debería mejorar un poco la calidad de la fruta.",4,2017,07,19
47,Negocios y ocio,"Un buen hotel, ligeramente caro pero compensa sus excelentes servicios, su confort y su ubicación.

47,"Lo mejor, la ubicación","Hice un viaje de negocios a Barcelona y el encuentro era cerca de la plaza España, pero aproveche para hacer un poco de turismo por las fuentes y la montaña de Montjuic. Justo al lado hay el centro comercial Arenas donde tienen de todo. Lo malo de la zona es que el tráfico es horrible, hasta que no llegas a las fuentes. Al hotel le faltaría actualizarse un poco y ajustar más los precios, pero por el resto todo perfecto.",4,2017,07,12
47,El hotel perfecto....,"Nos hemos alojado una semana en Catalonia Barcelona Plaza...ha sido la estancia perfecta.De todos los hoteles de 4 estrellas que hemos elegido hasta ahora en nuestros viajes es el mejor con diferencia...habitacion grande, moderna ,confortable , baño amplio con una ducha enorme....la tele de 49"" colgada en la pared una pasada...las fotos de internet no le hacen justicia...es mucho mejor en realidad.Los pasillos  son muy limpios y amplios y las zonas comunes elegantes y muy bien organizados.A destacar el Restaurante Kurai y el Filigrama que ofrecen cocina de calidad dentro del recinto del hotel.Y lo mejor de todo la Terazza The Clock en la octava planta con vistas espectaculares a la ciudad sobre todo de noche...para no hablar de su enorme piscina ubicada en frente del bar que es un espectáculo por la noche....buen ambiente,cócteles ,cenas al lado de la piscina...la terazza es una pasada...tanto de dia para darte un chapuzon y descansar en sus comodas tumbonas como por la noche para disfrutar de un buen trago y de las vistas a la Plaza de España y de la Font Magic de Montjuc....en mi opinion se merece 5 estrellas...por todo lo que ofrece en instalaciones,servicios,facilidades y atencion al cliente me parece insuperable en calidad precio.Volveremos sin duda para disfrutar de su encanto unico....",5,2017,07,12

47,LA MEJOR TERRAZA DE BARCELONA,"Una de las mejores terrazas de Barcelona, no solo por las vistas ,sino porque te puedes tomar una copa, como si estuvieras de vacaciones,en la zona chillout. Precios acordes con las magníficas vistas. No os lo podéis perder, con pareja, familia, negocios,ocio.",5,2017,06,28
47,"Muy bien ubicado, estupenda habitación y piscina","Me alojé por un viaje de trabajo y por ello valoré especialmente la ubicación, a 15 minutos caminando de la estación del AVE.

Las habitaciones son muy cómodas y bien decoradas, y me gustó la amplitud de la ducha, la comodidad de la cama y la insonorización. Fantásticas vistas sobre la Fira.

No utilicé la pisicina por falta de tiempo, pero es un espacio muy bonito. Seguro que al caer la tarde es un lugar impresionante para tomar una copa. Igualmente, la ambientación musical con un pianista en el lobby es agradable cuando llegas por la tarde.

Por poner un pero, el desayunador me pareció muy ruidoso. La calidad del buffet es correcta, así como la variedad de productos y la atención del servicio. Pero probablemente por los materiales de acabados duros da la impresión de mayor ruido del que corresponde al público presente. 

En definitiva, una dirección muy recomendable si viajas a Barcelona. Imagino que en periodos de ferias será prohibitivo, por su excelente ubicación frente a la Fira y su rápida conexión con la estación.",5,2017,06,28
47,Bien ubicado,La suite espaciosa con vista a la plaza España. Con el metro en la puerta del hotel. El desayuno impecable. Fuimos a uno de los restaurantes a cenar y estuvo magnífico.

47,Altamente recomendable ,"Un hotel que recomiendo sinceramente, muy bien ubicado en plena Plaza España al lado de un Mall (el Arena Plaza, que ha sido antes una plaza de toros), un hotel con una excelente atención, habitaciones amplias, bien equipas, muy limpias y con excelente WiFi gratuito así como un excelente desayuno. Las habitaciones que dan a la Plaza tienen una inmejorable vista pero tienen de malo que son ruidosas por el tráfico vehicular, asimismo no tienen suficientes llaves para las cajas de seguridad por lo que no pude usar ese servicio.

47,Simplemente impresionante ,"Hemos estado alojados en el hotel dos dias, no hay ninguna pega que se le pueda poner.
Desde el momento en el que entramos por la puerta el personal fue atento y muy amables.
La habitacion era expectacular, cuidando cada uno de los detalles, bonita, moderna..
No nos llevamos bañadores puesto que era una estancia corta pero al invitarnos a una copa de bienvenida y ver la piscina nos compramos ropa de baño puesto que era maravilloso estar en esa piscina con esas vistas tan privilegiadas.

Y el desayuno realmente excepcional, de calidad, con gran variedad a elegir y todo buenísimo. 

Recomendamos el hotel al 100%.
Felicitar a los empleados porque hoy en dia tanta amabilidad se agradece y es algo que no todos los alojamientos tienen.

47,Che vista dalla piscina sul tetto!,"La catena è ottima e questo hotel non è da meno. Non è propriamente in centro, bensì in Plaza de España, ma la fermata della Metro che porta a Plaza de Catalunya è a 10m ! È comunque comodo e raccomandabile per chi visita il Montjuic, distante 15' a piedi. A fianco dell'hotel il nuovo e grande centro commerciale de Las Arenas. 
Camere ampie, pulite, ben fornite di articoli varie da toilette, e con Wi-Fi gratis. Ma la cosa più bella è la piscina dell'ottavo piano, con una vista straordinaria sulla piazza sottostante, la Font Magica e la collina del Montjuic. Merita di andare, anche solo per un drink",5,2017,06,14
47,Gran Hotel,"Excelente servicio, la habitación muy cómoda y la ubicación del hotel es la mejor. El personal es muy amable. La piscina es espectacular la vista a la plaza España es la mejor. Lo recomiendo como una gran opción en Barcelona. ",4,2017,06,13

47,Que pena que no pudiera disfrutarlo más ,"He estado sólo una noche por temas de trabajo y me ha dado pena no haber podido estar más tiempo en este hotel pero con mi marido en plan ocio. La ubicación es inmejorable el servicio espectacular, no había ni un emplead@ del hotel que no fuera espectacularmente amable en su justa medida sin agobiar.  La habitación genial también con una cama enorme en la que dormí de un tirón como un bebé chiquitín. La terraza de la planta 8 es una pasada y tiene unas vistas impresionantes, sólo que hacía bastante aire y no pude disfrutarla mucho, pero invita a ello. 
Si tengo que poner una pequeña pega es que las señoras de la limpieza hacen bastante ruido desde las 7:30 de la mañana y si te apetece dormir más no puedes porque se oyen bastantes portazos y conversaciones entre ellas por los pasillos. 
También, si me permiten una sugerencia, un hervidor de agua o una cafetera en la habitación sería un puntazo. 
Recomiendo el desayuno al 100% ",4,2017,06,09
47,"Perfecto, como siempre",Es mi primera opción para alojarme en Barcelona y nunca defrauda. Solamente una sugerencia: el horario de cierre del gimnasio a las 21:00 horas no está pensado para los que salimos tarde de trabajar y queremos utilizarlo. ,5,2017,06,07

47,Gran hotel,"Nos alojamos en este hotel con motivo de una reunión, sin duda ya la localización es excepcional, cerca de la estación de Sans y además en un lugar precioso, al lado de la plaza de toros. 
El hotel cuenta con todas las comodidades posibles, piscina, spa, gimnasio... espacios amplios y habitaciones luminosas y con decoración agradable. Servicio de habitaciones muy atento y personal muy agradable, sin duda un acierto, no tengo ningún aspecto a mejorar que pudiese destacar.
El desayuno buffet es una maravilla te hacen en algunos puestos crepes y tortillas etc al gusto, todo cuidado al detalle.
Volveremos.",5,2017,06,03

Mi habitación estaba en la planta 6 que se ve muy renovada y cuidada.
Sin duda para recomendar.",5,2017,05,30
47,Feria,"Plaza España es buena ubicacion para la feria y desplazarse por la ciudad, la piscina de la cubierta ofrece buenos atardeceres. La habitacion es correcta y estaba limpia. El desayuno muy completo en un comedor bonito",4,2017,05,30
47,Mucho ruido,El pasillo necesita una alfombra u otro elemento que evite el ruido pues se escucha los pasos de las personas y prinicpalmente el ruido de las maletas. Algunas puertas están muy apretadas obligando a dar portazos aumentando así el ruido.,3,2017,05,30
47,"Limpieza en las habitaciones, mejorar servicio comedor en desayuno,","Quitar las baneras, son peligrosas, la limpieza en la habitaciony el bano, deben entrenar el personal de limpieza, para que despolven bien y laven bien el piso del bano , el servicio en el comedor del desayuno debe mejorar, el desayuno es bueno, ",3,2017,05,24

47,Muy recomendable,"Trato muy bueno, calidad precio muy aceptable, personal amable. Ubicación excepcional, desayuno muy variado y de alta calidad. Quizás deberían mejorar la conexión wifi, por lo demás una estancia muy buena, distendida y sintiendo un servicio acorde a su categoría, yo repito siempre que vengo a Barcelona.",4,2017,05,16
47,Maravilloso," Magnífico hotel situado en una zona muy céntrica enfrente de la feria de Barcelona, ideal para negocios, escapada urbana. Cenamos en el restaurante japonés francamente bien y muy bien atendidos.  Pero uno de los detalles que le diferencia de los demás es su terraza con piscina, con magníficas vistas sobre Barcelona es un espacio ideal para poder tomar algo después del trabajo  mientras te relajas a la piscina, con una fantástica atención del personal de la barra ",5,2017,05,16
47,may 12,hotel dalle pareti di carta velina da evitare si sente lo sciacquone della camera accanto  camere sono come delle celle specialmente quella assegnatami traffico tumultuoso nella piazza antistante mai successo a Barcellona di stare in un albergo di tale basso valore,1,2017,05,15
47,Excelente lugar para organizar eventos,"El pasado 24 de abril organizamos una conferencia (con cátering incluido) en este hotel y el resultado fue excelente. Las infraestructuras (logísticas y tecnológicas) están perfectamente adaptadas a las necesidades de un evento de estas características, y el servicio del equipo del hotel fue impecable, en todo momento nos facilitaron el trabajo. En definitiva, un lugar muy recomedable para organizar cualquier tipo de encuentro de negocios.",5,2017,05,15
47,Buena experiencia,"Buen hotel con camas grandes y cómodas, habitaciones amplías. Desayuno muy completo en una zona muy agradable. Tiene muy buenas vistas.
Perfecta ubicación, para aparcar es horrible hay que pagar parking.",4,2017,05,14
47,Normal tirando a mal,"Hotel anticuado, el baño mal conservado con descolchones en la bañera y azulejos medio caídos, el desayuno bien pero el almuerzo poca variedad y mala calidad. Por suerte tiene bonitas vistas desde la terraza",2,2017,05,08
47,Zusammenfassung,"Preis konnte nicht bewertet werden, da dieser von der 3M getragen wird.
Die Teils Lauten Nebengeräusche(Nachbar-WC-Spülung + Hackenschuhe des Nachbarzimmers) sind zwar aufgefallen, lassen sich vermutlich aber auch kaum vermeiden.",4,2017,05,08
47,schönes Hotel zentral gelegen,"sauberes Hotel, zentrale Lage, U-Bahn und City Tour Busse direkt vor der Tür,

47,Un evento perfecto,"Contratamos la sala para conferencias para la realización de un evento para 400 personas y toda la organización fue perfecta. El equipo del hotel se volcó para que todo saliese a la perfección.
El equipamiento de las salas es ideal y espectacular. Muchas gracias por todo.",5,2017,05,08
47,Meeting a Barcellona ,"Tre giorni a Barcellona in questo hotel che è veramente scarso,4 stelle regalate,pulizia pessima,personale lento e non molto attento,camera buia e con tenda nella doccia che non si vede dal dopoguerra 
",2,2017,05,05
47,Servicio,"Escelente hotel, amplio, limpio, y 
Con personal  siempre a tu disposicion y solucionando los problemas.Excelente ubicacion.
Tendria que mejorar el wifi.
Hay linea del metro cerca y Arenas, local comercial con un mirador y restaurantes en el mismo.",4,2017,05,03
47,Non lo consiglierei,"Posizione comoda grazie alla fermata della metro proprio di fronte all'hotel che permette spostamenti veloci. 
Siamo arrivati alle 11.00 in hotel (comunicato all'atto della prenotazione) e pur non pretendendo di trovare la camera pronta, aspettare fino alle 16:00 circa per fare il check-in mi è sembrato chiaramente un segno di disorganizzazione e indelicatezza.
La camera di modeste dimensioni e datata nell'arredo e nella mobilia; ancor più il bagno, completamente da rifare.
Ottima la colazione, ricchissima e di qualità.",3,2017,04,30
47,Buena ubicación ,"Repito después de 24 años. Vine en el 1993 recién estrenado y regreso ahora.
Debo decir que al menos las habitaciones de la planta 4 están igual que cuando se inauguró. Unos compañeros el la planta 6 tenían mejores habitaciones, seguramente de categoría superior a la mía.

Pros: Buena ubicación a un paso del AVE, y resto de servicios de transporte en la puerta, tranquilo, desayuno correcto, camas cómodas y ajuar de calidad. Buenas vistas si tu habitación da a la plaza.

Contras: La habitación no tenia el minibar, estaba quitado. La griferia ha tenido mejores épocas. No funcionaba la calefacción, solo soplaba aire frio, veías camareros subiendo mantas a la gente.
Los cierres de las ventana muy cascaditos.

Hace falta una reforma...

Pero si tengo que volver repetiría, pero a las habitaciones como las de la planta 6.

 ",4,2017,04,28
47,Veramente al di sotto delle aspettative,"Una posizione eccellente, sprecata da una gestione veramente approssimativa. Prezzi ingoustificati visti il pessimo servizio. Camera decadente con probabilmente decine di anni senza restauro. Bagno sporco e malandato. Neanche un cuscino supplementare e una volta chiesto alla reception è arrivato ( dopo sollecito) con 24h di ritardo. Veramente scarso per un 4 stelle.",1,2017,04,27
47,TRES NOCHES QUE REPETIRÍA,"La ubicación y la calidad del hotel merecen la pena. 
La habitación y el servicio ha sido fantástica (poder dormir sin ningún problema de ruidos es una ventaja). Boca de metro a escasos metros, centro comercial en frente. 
Buena experiencia. ",5,2017,04,27
47,Super Lage,"Preis-Leistung für Zimmer ok, wenn auch obere Preisklasse. Frühstück den Preis nicht Wert und unverständlich, dass Kinder bis 12 Jahren genauso viel dafür bezahlen müssen. In den meisten Hotels sind Kinder beim Frühstück mit den Eltern inkl.",4,2017,04,26
47,FC Barcelona Tournaig,Zu diesem Preis sehr schlechtes Zimmer. Leute die weniger bezahlt haben hatten das viel bessere Zimmer (6.Stock) Ich hatte 50% mehr bezahlt und ein Zimmer bekommen das so viel Geld nicht wert war. Verstehe nicht das man dies bei der Buchung nicht berücksichtigt.,3,2017,04,26
47,Ubicación buena. Habitación muy mejorable,"La ubicación del hotel muy correcta. La habitación, en comparación con hoteles de la misma categoría en Barcelona en los que he estado, con diferencia es el peor que he estado. El personal muy atento. El desayuno mucha variedad en un comedor muy amplio.",2,2017,04,25
47,Eine Woche Barcelona,"Wir waren insgesamt sehr zufrieden. Frühstück ist zu teuer in dem Hotel mit 20,00 Euro pro Person. Die Lage ist aber optimal und wir konnten in den Cafe's rund um das Hotel sehr gut frühstücken. Die Metro-Station befindet sich direkt vor der Eingangstür des Hotels.",4,2017,04,25
47,La mejor vista de Barcelona,"Excelente hotel en todos los sentidos, su mayor atributo es la increíble vista desde la terraza de la piscina hacia el Palau Nacional y plaza España. Se acomoda para todo tipo de planes y las habitaciones son muy espaciosas. ",5,2017,04,25

47,Klasse spanisches Hotel,"Vier Tage in dem Hotel und ich wollte nicht mehr weg. Sehr freundliches und zuvorkommendes Personal, sehr saubere und moderne Zimmer, ein sehr gutes Frühstücksbuffet, was keine Wünsche offen lässt und last but not least die coole Roof Top Bar mit Swimming Pool über den Dächern von Barcelona - hier muss man den Sonnenuntergang mit einem Drink genießen.",5,2017,04,24
47,Albergo bello in ottima posizione,"Siamo stati 3 giorni a Barcellona ed abbiamo soggiornato in quest'albergo che abbiamo trovato bello, ben tenuto ed in posizione ottima per visitare la città. 
Da sottolineare lo spuntino nel pomeriggio con caffè, dolcetti, acqua ed aranciata, cosa molto gradita dopo una giornata passata in giro per la città. 
Il costo è alto ma il servizio è molto buono, la colazione ha invece un costo troppo alto soprattutto se si richiede un semplice cappuccino con briosce. ",4,2017,04,23

47,Abgewirtschaftet,"Das Hotel befindet sich in Top-Lage, hätte aber schon vor 15 Jahren renoviert werden müssen. Bemühtes Personal kann Sauberkeits- und Qualitätsprobleme nicht ausgleichen. Leichter Schmuddel, schreckliches Restaurant, leiernde Technik.",3,2017,04,18
47,Muy bueno,Hotel y personal muy bueno. Recomendaría cambiar los sofás que desmerecen el hall del Hotel. Hubo cierta masificación un par de días con grupos de jóvenes. El espacio del buffet del desayuno resulta muy ruidoso y algo desangelado.,4,2017,04,11
47,acerca del hotel,"Hotel muy bien ubicado , buen servicio ,servicio wifi potente,Desayuno mejorable.Esta necesitando rehabilitacion pero de momento muy bien. Estuve alojado durante cuatro dias, se descanas bien a pesar de la ubicacion en centro de la ciudad",5,2017,04,11
47,Inmejorable estancia,"Como cada vez que me alojo en este hotel, todo perfecto, un trato súper amable por parte de todo el equipo humano que conforma esa plantilla, hace que uno se sienta como en casa. Desde la llegada, hasta el ultimo día, todo genial.",5,2017,04,11
47,Sitio perfecto para trabajar o visitar Barcelona,"Hotel moderno, con todos los servicios y muy cerca de todo tanto por negocios, esta enfrente de la Fira, como por turismo ya que Plaza de España esta en el mismo centro de Barcelona. Muy bien comunicado por transporte público y con para de taxis en la puerta del hotel. El personal es impecable y te hace sentir como en casa.
Volveré al hotel por trabajo el mes de mayo.

47,BUEN HOTEL EN GENERAL,"me mejoraron la habitación que tenia en mi reserva, lo que siempre es muy de agradecer.

el único punto negativo se lo pongo a la limpieza, había detalles en la habitación que en mi opinión deben de tener mas control y eficacia.",5,2017,04,11
47,Caro,"En muchos de sus servicios es caro pero Barcelona es bastante cara 
La habitación básica es cara con respecto a cualquier hotel similar. Cama cómoda pero ruido de la calle y del pasillo! Desayuno correcto pero caro",4,2017,04,10

47,Catalonia Plaza España ,"El hotel, que está situado en el centro de la ciudad, está lleno de pequeños detalles que marcan la diferencia. Es un lugar ideal para pasar una escapada de trabajo e incluso romántica. El precio más o menos acequible lo ajustan por las vistas a las que accedas desde la habitación... desde muchas se puede apreciar en plena plaza de España y Montjuic de fondo.",4,2017,04,08
47,Repetiria,"Cogi el hotel para asistir a una feria, me resulto muy comodo, me permitio visitar la ciudad los dias previos y descansar nada mas acabar la feria los dias de trabajo. En la proxima feria me alojare alli seguro.",4,2017,04,05
47,Me toco la habitación vieja,"Este hotel tiene habitaciones viejas mal restauradas y otras nuevas muy bonitas y confortables. Al mismo precio. Aconsejo que examinen la habitación asignada antes de aceptarla. A mi me toco una de las viejas y el baño era inaceptable: con oxido en la bañera, manchas de moho en el techo, una ducha rota...",2,2017,04,04
47,Magnifico hotel con buenas vistas,"Muy bien comunicado, y con unas instalaciones renovadas. Desayuno muy completo y bueno. La atención del personal excelente. Nos hizo el upgrade de habitación gratis y un descuento para el desayuno.

47,Fantastico,"Vistas espectaculares desde la habitación de la planta 12. La ubicación del hotel excelente. Es un hotel grande con muchos servicios de restauración, aparcamiento propio y salas de ocio. La atención del personal del hotel es exquisita",5,2017,03,31
47,100% RECOMENDABLE,"Estuve el fin de semana con mi pareja y fue una experiencia excelente. 
Tanto el trato del personal como las instalaciones y servicios que ofrece el hotel son espectaculares, por suerte justo habían abierto el bar de la terraza donde las vistas de Barcelona son privilegiadas.
Esta muy bien ubicado ya que tiene la parada de metro justo enfrente y la zona comercial al lado.
Sin duda lo recomiendo a todas esas parejas, amigos y familias que deseen pasar una agradable estancia.",5,2017,03,30
47,Necesita un lavado de cara,"En otra epoca debió ser muy bueno, ahora está obsoleto. Las zonas comunes, el servicio y la ubicación estan bien. La habitación es penosa, especialmente si da al patio interior: sin luz, anticuada, cama incomoda...",3,2017,03,28
47,Gran hotel con piscina,"Muy buen hotel. Las vistas de las habitaciones son increíbles y el hotel esta en pleno centro de Barcelona. La decoración y calidad de todo es muy buena, así como el servicio y limpieza. Muy recomendable.",4,2017,03,28
47,Esperaba más de un 4 estrellas ,"Sinceramente pasable. La habitación parecía decorada en 1970. Y algunas cosas  (cuadros, suelo, elementos del baño) confirmaban que no se habían tocado desde hacía muchos años. El aire acondicionado ruidoso como un avión. Tuve que quitarlo para poder dormir aún a costa de pasar frío. Ruido de la calle (comprensible, está donde está). Decepcionante desde luego. ",2,2017,03,27
47,Muy buen Hotel,"Estratégicamente ubicado y con una atención excelente, faltaría algunos detalles en lo que se refiere al cuidado de los baños (cielorrasos) y algunas dificultades en cómo está orientada la ducha respecto de la bañadera, esto hace que se moje demasiado el baño.",4,2017,03,27
47,Una esperienza che segna,"Posizione ottima vicina alla metro, al centro commerciale Arena, ai trasporti urbani e ai collegamenti con l'aeroporto; ottima la vista panoramica. Atrio di ingresso con due ampie sale per rilassarsi, personale cordiale. Le stanze sono grandi non molto curata la insonorizzazione specialmente degli scarichi dei w.c. capiente armadio, arredamento moderno abbastanza funzionale e frigo bar. Nella camera non era presenta una cassaforte. Il bagno è comodo con vasca e annesso doccino con saliscendi, completo di asciugacapelli. Ambiente pulito un po' vecchio. La colazione è servita a self servire in una ampia sala ricavata da una tensostruttura coperta nella corte interna dell'edificio. La colazione è ricca e completa.",4,2017,03,26
47,Buen hotel y buen servicio ,"He estado por un tema de congresos. Es de n hotel bien comunicado con las ""firas"" céntrico y con una parada para ir al aeropuerto q es algo a valorar. 
La habitación es muy correcta con vistas a la plaza España una cama amplia y con todos los servicios q deseas tener en una estancia rápida de trabajo. En recepción me han atendido muy bien y el
Bufett del desayuno es adecuado y variado en dulce salado y fruta con lo  necesitas para un buen desayuno. Consta con dos restaurantes temáticos uno Japones q tiene una carta extensa y con platos no habituales en un Japonés habitual pero guardando su esencia y de calidad aunq un poco caro pero esta bien. Los servicios adicionales para la habitación como la suscripción a revistas gratuito ha sido un toque q me ha gustado en estos tiempos q cualquier detalle cuenta. Buen hotel de negocios y creo q para visitar esta bonita ciudad también ",4,2017,03,23
47,dasa,"Bien en general, aunqúe sólo estuve una noche y no tengo mucha experiencia para valorar todo. Quizás lo peor la insonorización de las habitaciones que se oia hablar al de al lado y no es que estuviera chillando",4,2017,03,21
47,Gran experiencia ,"El personal del hotel es muy atento! Las habitaciones con vistas a Plaza España impresionantes, las fuentes se veían dsd la habitación. El hotel tiene una terraza maravillosa en la 8a planta y las vistas son auténticas, lastima que aun hace frio. Si os gusta comer bien, Filigrana tiene parada obligatoria igual que el japones. 
Muy bien comunicado y creo que tienen salas de reuniones porque había mucho movimiento de gente. ",5,2017,03,20
47,5 estrellas!!!,"El mejor hotel en todo mi recorrido por Europa. No se por donde empezar si por la comodidad y buen nivel de sus habitación o por la amabilidad y servicio de su personal. Cuidaron cada detalle. Esta super ubicado y te da oportunidad de conocer Barcelona y regresar con seguridad al hotel. El desayuno es de primer nivel me recordó a los Buffets de los hoteles Mexicanos, con comida basta y de calidad. Si regreso a Barcelona me hospedo nuevamente en este hotel. ",5,2017,03,20
47,Muy bien. Perfecto para abogados ,"Excelente hotel. Cuatro estrellas superior. La mejor opción para abogados que buscan alojamiento cerca del Palacio de Justicia de Barcelona. Suite amplia y perfectamente acomodada, cuenta con salón dotado de mesa de reuniones. Excelentes vistas. La Dirección del hotel facilita la estancia y da un trato amable y cercano.

47,Doble superior con terraza = Noche romántica perfecta,"Mi pareja me regaló una noche en el hotel para nuestro aniversario y la verdad que todo fue perfecto.

Para empezar, recomendamos usar siempre ""Booking"", ya que mi pareja llamó primero para reservar al hotel y luego consultó la web de ofertas, y justamente ese día era la ""mega-oferta"" y te ahorrabas la mitad por la misma habitación. 

Pasamos una noche fantástica en la habitación Doble superior con terraza. Tienes vistas a toda Plaza España y al castillo de Montjuïc, y como cierran la zona de terraza y piscina común a las 19h y esta es la única habitación que te da acceso, te quedas con la pedazo terraza para ti sólo. 

La habitación cuenta con ducha, una bañera muy grande y redondeada (pero no de hidromasaje), y con una cama enorme.

El servicio del hotel muy atento, nos regalaron cava y unos bombones. Además que pedimos un jarrón con agua para unas flores y no tardaron nada en traerlo.

El buffet del desayuno fue una pasada: zumos detox recién exprimidos, churros con chocolate, miles de embutidos, amplia variedad de bollería de calidad, huevos fritos y gofres hechas al momento delante tuyo... Vamos, para empezar la mañana con energía.

En resumen, una experiencia inolvidable con terraza privada en el centro de Barcelona.",5,2017,03,16
47,Excelencia,"Habitaciones impolutas. A pesar de la cantidad de clientes que hay en el hotel, el trato por parte del personal es muy personalizado e inmejorable. Preciosas vistas e increibles restaurantes. Volveremos sin duda! ",5,2017,03,15
47,Un 2 stelle ma con prezzi da 5,"Peccato, sarebbe anche anche in una bella posizione, comodo a centro e aeroporto, ma devo proprio sconsigliarlo.
Premetto che non abbiamo prenotato noi le camere in questo hotel, considerato 4 stelle, ma che forse non si avvicina neanche a 2....
Abbiamo dormito in camere standard in qualche punto di questo immenso albergo.
Ci sono solo ascensori da un lato e poi un dedalo infinito di corridoi ai piani, dove perdi facilmente l'orientamento.
La struttura e gli interni sono tipicamente di epoca fascista e da lì non si sono mossi.
Ma non credo che basterebbe sistemare gli arredi per migliorarlo. Se si muove una formica in un'altra ala dell'hotel, sicuramente riuscirete a sentirla anche dalla vostra camera. Noi abbiamo dormito malissimo e abbiamo un sonno davvero pesante....
La colazione buona per un quattro stelle, con specialità di cucine internazionali ma non normale il prezzo. Alla stessa cifra pagata per la colazione si può tranquillamente pranzare in un buon ristorante. 
Il personale gentile, ma la camera era poco pulita in modo particolare il bagno.
Cercheremo sicuramente di evitare questo hotel per futuri viaggi a Barcellona",2,2017,03,14
47,MEDIO,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel , ma che dire la posizione è fantastica ,la camera nella media il bagno appena sufficiente come la pulizia dello stesso. La colazione buona e con varietà. Sinceramente non all'altezza di un 4 stelle a mio avviso.
Se vi è piaciuta la mia recensione un è stata utile è sempre molto gradito ",3,2017,03,13
47,SOBREVALORADO,"Es un hotel perfectamente situado, aunque muy sobre elevado su precio, el desayuno, el sitio es excelente y su desayuno normal, las habitaciones no están mal pero los baños, son enanos y las almohadas de una pésima calidad, el personal educado y eficiente, y la limpieza esta muy bien",3,2017,03,13
47,Pros y contras,"Puntos fuertes segun mi experiencia: servicio amable, room service rapido y sin errores, privilegiada situacion, nos actualizaron a suite en planta 12 con vistas excepcionales, camas bastante buenas.

Pero... la habitacion, para ser la suite no era muy amplia, no tenia bañera ni bide, el baño olia fatal (reflujos de cañerias o ventilacion?) el dia que llegamos por la noche, aunque al dia siguiente bajo mucho, y sobre todo, a pesar de ser la planta 12, muchisimo ruido del trafico, no es buen sitio si tienes sueño ligero. 

",3,2017,03,13
47,Fin de semana en Barcelona.,"Llegamos a este hotel por segunda vez , ya que en una feria de alimentaria ya estuve. La ubicación de este hotel es esencial por nuestra visita tan corta, estuvimos en la azotea  del hotel tiene unas vistas prifeligiadas,  se ve toda la plaza España y la plaza antigua de toros , que ahora es un centro comercial,  Que ahí de todo , bueno que es ideal para un fin de semana .",4,2017,03,11

47,Hotel gigante con mucho bullicio aunque bien situado ,"Hotel muy grande situado en la plaza de España mirando a Montjuic!!! Tiene siempre mucho bullicio y ruido, hasta el punto que las habitaciones superiores (las que miran a la plaza de España) son peores porque tienes muchísimo ruido y las habitaciones no están bien aisladas!! El baño no es acorde a su nivel (dejo foto) y las sabanas y almohadas tampoco!!!! El desayuno normal y se acaban las cosas y a veces no reponen!!! En fin muy mejorable!!!",3,2017,03,05

47,Una buena semana!,"Ha sido un placer alojarme con ustedes. Empezando por el personal, siguiendo por la habitación, continuando por las instalaciones y finalmente el restaurante, esos desayunos dan energía para todo el día (muy bueno)!!
Un lástima no haber podido disfrutar más de la terraza pues las vistas y la piscina tienen pinta de que en verano se pueden disfrutar mucho.

Muchas gracias por todo.
Un saludo,

CG",5,2017,02,28
47,Gran hotel,"Muy grande el hotel y no solo por el número de habitaciones. La atención de todo el personal es exquisita y la atención de Mariana fuera de lo normal en cualquier otro hotel. El desayuno es toda una experiencia sobre todo en el rincón del Gourmet. Si además es verano la terraza con su piscina y zona chill-aut es espectacular con unas vistas a plaza España y Montjuic incomparables
Muy recomendable",5,2017,02,21
47,Excelente ubicación,"Trato del personal y ubicación excelentes. Comodidad y comidas buenas. Pero si la habitación da a la Plaza España o la calle Creu Coberta, a primera hora de la mañana se oye mucho ruido de los coches, autobuses, taxis...",4,2017,02,21

47,fantastica,"El hotel esta en un sitio fantastica. Estamos en un suite super bien con vista plaza España. Por la noche podemos mirar de nosotro habitacion las fuentes. La Fira cerca y palau sant jordi 10 minutos de pied.
Teniamos un bon contacto con las chicas de mostrador, muy muy amable y ayudamos con todo. Me han dado disquentas para parking y restaurant Japones, que fue super bien. Desayuna, pedir al mostrador, cuesto menos y sobre todo tambien especial.
Secura vamos otra vez al este hotel.",5,2017,02,19
47,Una experiencia bellísima!,"Fui con mi pareja a pasar dos días a este maravilloso hotel, pudimos disfrutar del una gran comida en el restaurante Filigrana y una cena espectacular en el restaurante japonés (Kurai). Al día siguiente fuimos a desayunar al buffet y cuando lo vimos nos quedamos con la boca abierta de lo grande que era y de todo lo que había.. Incluso había una estación de donde había cava y vino! Fue espectacular y nos lo pasamos genial! Enserio volveré  ",5,2017,02,17

47,Hotel catalonia Barcelona plaza,"Buen hotel y bien hubicado. El personal muy amable y atento. El desayuno  buffet  muy bueno y con gran variedad. Habitaciones grandes y cómodas. Me encontré algún pelo largo en el baño después de la limpieza de los mismos. Puede pasar en cualquier hotel pero me veo obligado a decirlo. Escatimaron con el gel de de baño, un hotel de 4 estrellas y con el precio que tiene no puede hacer eso. 
En general, un hotel recimendable si puedes permitirte pagarlo. ",3,2017,02,16
47,Muy buena situacion,"Muy buena situación para visitar la ciudad o alrededores, en vehículo propio o transporte publico.

47,Buena opción si vas a Montjuic,"Un hotel con mucho movimiento de turistas, nuestra habitación tenía unas vistas más que espectaculares a la plaza de España. Está justo al lado de la parada de bus que va al aeropuerto y a un paseo de Montjuic, ideal si vas a un concierto al Palau Sant Jordi.
Los puntos negativos que nos encontramos fueron que la calefacción no podía  apagarse y que a las no eran casi ni las 12 de la noche y ya era imposible tomar un sandwich en la cafetería del hotel, para ser un hotel tan grande y un sábado en una ciudad como barcelona  esto resultaba sorprendente.",3,2017,02,13
47,Hotel comodissimo ,"Imperdibile il servizio pulman diretto da e per L'aeroporto ogni 10 minuti.

Camere ampie ,luminose e ben arredate .
Ero li per lavoro e debbo dire che colazione e pasti erano il linea con la qualità dell'Hotel ",4,2017,02,12
47,Un servicio de altura ,"Encantada con este hotel, el trato excelente, empezando por recepción. La comida muy buena, sobre todo el japonés Kurai (creo que se llama así) y muy amable todo el personal. Cristina creo que se llama la chica que nos atendió muy bien, estaba en recepción y nos ofreció planos de la ciudad y lugares imprescindibles que no pudimos visitar todos, pero volveremos. La ubicación excelente. La próxima vez será una escapada en familia. ",5,2017,02,12
47,Week end catalano,"Hotel fuori dal centro ma comodissimo sia per andare in aeroporto sia per visitare la città: proprio accanto all'hotel vi sono 2 fermate di metro e diversi bus.
Personale gentile e disponibile e struttura davvero di classe..CONSIGLIATISSIMO",5,2017,02,10
47,Buen hotel,Buen hotel por su excelente ubicación y relación calidad-precio frente a la oferta de nivel similar que existe en Barcelona. Repetiría sin lugar a dudas en próximas ocasiones en las que regrese a Barcelona. ,3,2017,02,07

47,Decepcionante!,"Trato del personal del turno de las 5h30 de la mañana malo y ineficiente! Poco profesional. Manchas de sangre en el baño y respuesta de la Direccion a nuestra queja muy limitada. En fin, experiència muy mala por el Trato personal",1,2017,02,06
47,Solo 4 stelle,Davvero curato in tutto. Il personale è gentilissimo. La colazione davvero ottima non manca niente. A un passo dalla metro e dalla fermata del bus 46 dall'aeroporto. X qualche giorno a Barcellona è perfetto,5,2017,02,06
47,Excelente,"Las Suits son impresionantes, con unas vistas de lujo.  No puede estar más céntrico. Todo muy limpio, tranquilo y con una decoración muy elegante. Sin duda estoy deseando repetir. Aconsejable al cien por cien.",5,2017,02,06
47,ESTANCIA DE UNA NOCHE.,"La habitación impresionante y unas vistas excelentes.
La decoración muy moderna y la cama muy cómoda y amplia, y el servicio de literas para ir con niños muy moderno y muy cómodo también.
El servicio de desayuno muy completo y muy bueno.
Totalmente recomendable.",5,2017,02,02
47,un ruido espantoso con las obras! ,"El hotel en principio parece que está bien, claro que todo encanto desaparece cuando te colocan en la quinta planta mientras hacen una reforma integral de la planta sexta ...vine por trabajo y no hubo quién pudiera trabajar en la habitación, ni hablar por teléfono, ni descansar, ni nada de nada ...un horror. Me parece increíble que tengan la desfachatez de colocar a gente en está planta mientras tiran la de arriba !!!",1,2017,01,31
47,Week end lavorativo,"Hotel accogliente anche se momentaneamente con alcuni piani in ristrutturazione, camere spaziose e pulite , colazione abbastanza varia e personale cortese e professionale , personale alla reception il fiore all'occhiello.",4,2017,01,31
47,Un error mio hizo que fuese una noche maravillosa,"Hice una reserva a través de booking pero no me di cuenta que la reserva después de la medianoche es para entrar a las dos del mediodía así que al hacer la entrada el sr. de recepción, nos explicó de la incidencia, y muy amablemente lo solucionó a nuestro favor ya que la reserva que hicimos fue la mas barata que era de pago sin devolución, y nosotros queríamos pasar esa noche allí no la siguiente, nos pasó la reserva a esa misma noche y nos regalo por el precio de una habitación normal una suite preciosa, con vistas y muy bien decorada parecía nueva, nos encantó y lo que podría haber sido un problemón (porque no todos los hoteles hacen eso) fue al final una noche romantica mas de lo que habíamos imaginado.",5,2017,01,30
47,HOTEL NORMAL CON PRECIO AJUSTADO,"Estaba acostumbrado a los precios de Barcelona y me sorprendio el precio de este hotel . Precio  ajustado para un hotel bien situado pero eso es todo . Personalmente que me cobren la estancia por adelantado no me gusta , me parece una falta de respeto hacia el cliente y dice poco del establecimiento.Al llegar a la habitacion el olor de tabaco fue insoportable ademas de comprobar que la ventana estaba abierta y la temperatura de la habitacion tampoco era correcta . Al intentar ajustarla mediante la puesta en marcha del aire acondicionado comprobamos que no funcionaba correctamente o al menos no lo supimos poner en funcionamiento , mas tarde comprobamos que lo que ocurria es que tardaba en funcionar .
La cena en el restaurante del hotel denaminado ""rapido "" o de snaks fue mala ya que la carne que pedimos estaba dura y fria .
El desayuno es pobre pero se tendra que achacar al precio ajustado , pero aun asi creo que deberia de ser mejor.
La siguiente noche quisimos cenar en el restaurante estilo mediterraneo y la recepcionista de este restaurante de nacionalidad extranjera por su acento nons indico que estaban completos , al indicarle que quedaban mesas vacias nos indico nuevamente que estaban completos esta vez con voz mal sonante, por ultimo le dijimos que cenariamos en la terraza donde todas las mesas estaban libres y esta vez con cierto tono elevado nos dijo que seguien estando completos . Seguro que tenia un mal dia pero este tipo de situaciones no deberian de ocurrir en un hotel de 4 estrellas. Por ultimo el tema de los olores no esta bien resuelto en general en el hotel ya que la intensidad de los ambientadores es muy elevada .
Excepto la persona mencionada del restaurante la atencion del resto del personal fue muy correcta.
Necesita mejorar mucho.",3,2017,01,29
47,Correcto,"He estado allí para una reunión de ventas. En recepción son algo lentos, pero amables.
Añgunos compañeros se quejaron de que sus habitaciones eran ruidosas. Parece ser que hay un generador en alguna parte porque hacen obras y molesta por las noches. 
Yo pedí una habitación tranquila, y me dieron una suit que era muy nueva y bonita.
En sus restaurantes se come muy bien y la atención es muy correcta.",4,2017,01,28
47,Ottima posizione,"Ottimo hotel posizionato in una delle piazze più belle di Barcellona, servita da tutti i mezzi (bus, metro, bus turistici, taxi, bus per l'aeroporto) con un panorama stupendo su piazza di Spagna, con lo spettacolo delle fontane.
Piscina panoramica sul tetto.
Servizio di reception veloce e cordiale.
Prima colazione completa, sia dolce che salata, con ottimi panini col Serrano, con bevande di ogni tipo. Caffè e cappuccino eccellenti.
Struttura moderna ed elegante, con camere ampie, con ampie vetrate. Silenziose.
La sala ristorante è molto ampia e con un design moderno ed elegante con personale discreto ed efficiente.
L'unica nota negativa sono certi clienti che si presentano alla colazione con pigiama corto e infradito in gennaio.
Consigliabile per tutti.",5,2017,01,27
47,Excelente,"Situación inmejorable y trato exquisito. Restauración magnifica en los dos Restaurantes. Habitación excelente. Va a ser el Hotel de referencia para los invitados de la boda de mi hijo en Barcelona....

47,Confortable y amigable.,Céntrico. Bien comunicado. A pesar de encontrarse en zona bulliciosa el aislamiento del ruido es fantástico. Personal muy atento. Habitación amplia y acogedora. Desde luego que no será la última vez que me decida por este establecimiento. ,5,2017,01,23
47,Pérdida de exquisitez de la atención,"Visito frecuentemente el hotel por cuestiones laborables. La última vez me acompañó mi familia y nos sucedió algo que no espero de un hotel de esta categoría:

A lo largo de la tarde estábamos descansando con nuestra hija de pocos meses y se oía constantemente ruido de obras. Comprendemos que las obras son necesarias, pero la gestión del problema fue poco satisfactorio, puesto que nos dijeron textualmente que ""nadie más del hotel las oye"".

Hay alternativas: mostrar comprensión y predisposición a buscar una solución (aunque no exista), ofrecer un cambio de habitación, obsequiar con un detalle por las molestias causadas, etc.

La calidad del desayuno ha empeorado en los últimos meses; menor variedad y la distribución de los diferentes productos es un poco confusa.",3,2017,01,18
47,Muy buena experiencia,"La ubicación era perfecta, nos alojamos allí porque fuimos a ver un concierto al Palau Sant Jordi Está cerca de la estación del tren de Sants, al lado del centro comercial Las Arenas, y con el metro, a cinco minutos de Las Ramblas.
Nos pusieron en una habitación con vistas a la Plaza. Las vistas de dia y de noche espectaculares. 
En recepción fueron muy amables, ubicandonos y explicandonos el tema del metro y los autobuses.
Lástima que no fuera verano para poder difrutar la piscina y la terraza.
Volveriamos sin lugar a dudas.",5,2017,01,17
47,Expectacular en todo,"Genial ubicacion, atención, servicio de habitaciones... todo sobresaliente.
Las vistas a plaza de españa y las que se ven desde la terraza quedan deniales para fotos y sesiones, en verano, estar en la piscina debe ser estupendo.",5,2017,01,16
47,"prensa escrita y parking, ascensores","Poco variada , solo la vanguardia y en pequeña cantidad respecto a la dimensión del hotel, parking sin acceso directo y cajero que solo acepta efectivo.
se observa falta de mantenimiento , uno de los ascensores con un remiendo de madera pegado con cinta adhesiva ",4,2017,01,16
47,Un 10,"Tener reservada una triple y que el hotel te de por cortesia la Suite no tiene precio!!!!Todo expectacular.Muy centrico con boca de metroa 10m. AMABLES, VOLVEREMOS.

47,3 giorni al Catalonia hotel Barcellona,"Siamo arrivati in hotel la notte del 25 dicembre alle 23.30, il personale ci ha accolto con gentilezza e cordialità. Nei giorni seguenti ci ha fornito la cartina della città di Barcellona che ci ha permesso di spostarci con semplicità. La camera è molto spaziosa e pulita con tutti i confort necessari ( pettine, calza scarpe, sacchetti igienici, bagno doccia, saponette, cuffia per la doccia).
Abbiamo lasciato la camera la mattina alle 11 ma ci hanno tenuto le valigie fino al momento in cui ci saremmo dovuti recare all'aeroporto.  ",4,2017,01,09
47,Almohadas de hospital en suite de lujo,"Ayer estuvimos alojados en el hotel Catalonia Plaza en la habitación suite con terraza de la planta 801, una habitación correcta grande amplia para mi gusto un tanto clásica y sencilla, cabe a destacar la gran terraza con excelentes vistas preciosas de gran parte de barcelona, y un bufete desayuno incluido con la habitación excelente tenían gran variedad y calidad. 

Puntos negativos fueron :

1 Pago     Cobraron la estancia el dia de antes de llegar.

2 Recepción      Al llegar tuvimos una hora de espera en recepción una cola enorme, lo cual me pareció fatal la habitación te la dan a las 14h (bastante tarde) y entremos a las 15h por la tremenda cola que tenían montada (culpa de ellos) ... 
 
3 Agua     En una suite de esas condiciones no es normal que solo te pongan un agua pequeña de cortesía para dos personas no me parece lógico bastante escasos en esos detalles cuando otro hoteles te dan hasta una botella de cava en la habitación. 

4 Menú de Almohadas,    Eso decían programa de almohadas la que tu quisieras escoger lo cual elegimos las nuestras llamemos al teléfono que ponía y nadie nos cogio el teléfono, bajemos a recepción solicitando nuestras almohadas (incluidas de regalo con la suite )   Y al principio no sabían ni de que hablábamos luego nos dijeron sin darnos mucha importancia que si queda algo ya nos lo subirían... y  luego de aquella manera el botones la dejarian en la suite, nadie subió... 
Me parece fatal presumir de un programa de almohadas con varias a elegir y no tenéis ninguna disponible, ya que dormimos fatal con las almohadas pésimas que tenéis en dicha suite de lujo parecían de hospital ya al menos intentar mejorar las de serie para los próximos...   ",2,2017,01,08
47,Estupenda eleccion,"Cogimos este hotel para pasar solo una noche ya que hacíamos escala en Barcelona. La verdad es que ha sido muy agradable la estancia. El personal muy simpático y atento, el check-in rápido y el Check-out también. Los precios del room service no son muy altos. No pude disfrutar del desayuno, pero la comida que pedimos en la habitación estaba buenísima. 
Otra cosa muy buena del hotel es que está muy bien ubicado, con bocas de metro al lado, la parada del aerobús justo en la puerta, y justo enfrente del centro comercial y de ocio Las Arenas. 
Sin duda, repetiré si se me presenta otra ocasión.

Nuestra visita ha sido para despedir el año 2016 y recibir el año nuevo. Desde la propia azotea disfrutamos de las campanadas de fin de año organizadas por el ayuntamiento en Motjuic.
Para finalizar recomiendo el desayuno. Puesto de tortillas y tortitas cocinadas al instante, gran variedad de frutas, bollería y zumos con los que deleitarte durante 4 días sin caer en el clásico ""aburrimiento por repetición"".
El personal del hotel es cálido, atento y muy profesional. Sin duda una experiencia que merece ser vivida más de una vez! Repetiremos!",5,2017,01,04

47,Mala relación calidad precio,"Lo primero que me llamó la atención y es la primera vez que me pasa es que cobraron la habitación por adelantado para evitar colas ala hora de irse del hotel ,cuestión imposible pues si tomas algo del mini bar y dejas las maletas en consigna se tarda igual.lLa habitación pequeña y las camas muy pequeñas y mal aisladas por lo cual se oía el ruido de la calle.El último día no cambiaron las toallas y pusieron los artículos de aseo para una sola persona

47,Pesimo,"El hotel en general no esta mal, las habitaciones un poco viejas , lo peor es la dirección del hotel, me cobran el doble por el Barça Madrid y resulta que yo vengo a trabajar en la feria de Montjuic , que sentido tiene estafar a un pobre trabajador que no pudo ver ni el partido. Por favor un poco de seriedad.
Estoy indignado",1,2016,12,06

La ubicación es perfecta, en la misma Plaza España.
El trato del personal de recepción fue sencillamente impecable, muy profesionales, súper amables, siempre con una sonrisa en la cara y dispuestos a ayudarte con todo y más. Un servicio de 10.
Nos ofrecieron una habitación con terraza, abonando un pequeño suplemento, y sin duda valió la pena. Una habitación amplia, luminosa, con vistas a la piscina. A destacar la limpieza y el cuidado de todos los detalles.
Además repetimos dos veces en el restaurante japonés, Kurai, una de ellas eligiendo el menú degustación. Gracias a todo el equipo por el buen trato, las excelentes recomendaciones de platos y el buen ambiente que se respira. Fantástico el trabajo de los cocineros.
Volveremos a repetir, sin duda. Gracias a todo el hotel por hacernos sentir como en casa. Sois geniales, chicos.",5,2016,12,03

La ubicación perfecta con una parada de metro justo en la puerta. Desde ahi puedes moverte perfectamente por toda la ciudad. Hay autobuses que paran también en las inmediaciones para poder moverte sin dificultad. Muy cerca de Montjuic, palau sant Jordi y toda la zona olimpica.  La limpieza de la habitación perfecta. Un buen sitio para descubrir todo el encanto de esta bella ciudad",4,2016,11,28
47,Celebración de club muy satisfactoria.,"Con motivo de visitar Auto Retro en Montjuïc, nuestro Club de automóbiles clásicos celebró una comida de socios en una sala del Hotel Barcelona Plaza.
Aparte de la evidente óptima ubicación, nos satisfizo plenamente la calidad y presentación de los platos servidos, el trato tanto de los directivos como del personal de servicio, la sala en si y las facilidades para su ambientación (disponen de medios audiovisuales adecuados donde pasamos imágenes del club).
Como responsable de algunas actividades del Club suelo albergar cierta desconfianza hacia las grandes cadenas de hoteles.  En este caso mis temores quedaron totalmente infundados.   Muy bien, muy bien, muy bien!   Volveremos en cuanto haya ocasión.",4,2016,11,28
47,Correcto,"Fuimos a comer con amigos el servicio muy bueno aunque los primeros nos parecieron sosos, probamos el menú ejecutivo - sopa de caldo sin sabor y ensalada de para buena presentación pero de sabor muy poco , el arroz del señoret estaba muy rico.
Los postres muy ricos también.",3,2016,11,28

Una sala espectacular, unas pantallas gigantes y luz ambiente azulada, mesas redondas con una bonita decoración. El personal en todo momento muy atento y profesional.
Tanto el aperitivo como la cena fue espectacular. Mucha calidad y presentación de los platos maravillosa
a destacar los postres, que nos sorprendieron con un temático de postres en el centro de la mesa.
Sin duda la mejor convención que se ha hecho !",5,2016,11,27

47,Buena ubicación,"Estuve alojado, hace tres semanas en el hotel.
La ubicación es perfecta, el edificio es bonito y las habitaciones son correctas.
No me gusto nada el baño, con cortinas de hace 20 años,que dan sensación de suciedad.
No me gusto nada el comedor de desayuno.Una terraza reconvertida en comedor, que olía a plancha, el suelo resbalaba. Me sentia super incomodo y no me quede a desayunar.
Al llegar y hacer el check in, me dieron una habitación ocupada por otras personas, me parecio un poco caotico todo,pues despueés de recorrer los largos pasillos , tuve que volver a recepción para que me dieran una habitación sin inquilinos.
Es una pena estos detalles, porque el hotel en si,esta bien,pero deben cuidar los detalles",3,2016,11,17

47,SOLO una noche,"Solo estuve una noche, pero me pareció una magnifica solución en Barcelona. En el centro de Barcelona muy cerquita de la estación de Sans. Un buen lugar para celebrar eventos. El servicio es magnifico y te tratan con mucha profesionalidad.",4,2016,11,08
47,Justito,"Estuve alojado en este hotel por negocios. Lo mejor que tiene es su ubicación cerca de Sants y del centro. Pero por contra es un hotel que requiere una remodelación, sobe todo en lo referente al baño, que parece del siglo pasado. El resto de la habitación no estaba mal, pero eche de menos unos cuantos enchufes. La decoración y muebles de la habitación son algo cutres. Un hotel funcional sin más, que me parece caro para lo que ofrece. ",3,2016,11,07
47,nº1 en Barcelona!!!,"El sitio espectacular fácil de llegar desde el aeropuerto, el sitio estratégico para quien quiere conocer Barcelona. Estuve una sola noche por trabajo y trataré de volver cada vez que viaje a Barcelona. La piscina es genial y tiene una visual espectacular. Las habitaciones son espaciosas y tranquilas. Muy rico el Restaurante Filigrana donde cené divinamente. Lo mejor, junto al Staff, es el buffet del restaurante",5,2016,11,07

47,Muy Buen Hotel!!!!!,"Hola, el Hotel esta de maravilla de ubicación no les falta de nada. Las Habitaciones son modernas y muy lujosas: Me gustan mucho sus decoraciones ya sea en el Interior o sea fuera con vistas a la Plaza España. Mi habitación fue fuera con vistas a Plaza España y estuvo muy bien. Sobre el trato al personal a los clientes tengo que decir que me ha gustado mucho como me han tratado. Lo que seria mejor es que seria mejor hacer un cambio de uniformes porque de color negro o gris es muy serio para el personal y tienen que dar buena imagen al publico. Para no esperar mucho mejor poner lineas de espera en recepción y que la gente se espere el turno cada uno. Los restaurantes buenísimos el Japones y el Filigrana y magnifica vistas desde la piscina desde arriba de todo. No hoy muchos ruidos en las Habitaciones ni las personas que pasan por las habitaciones. Me gustaron los bolígrafos del hotel y los nuevos salones de reuniones del Hotel. No tengo ni una mínima queja de este hotel magnifico. Volvería otra vez a alojarme cuando venga por Barcelona. Saludos",5,2016,11,02
47,¿Dónde están los enchufes?,"Un hotel de 4 estrellas con un personal más que atento, un buffet de desayuno espléndido (gran café de máquina expresso automática), unos servicios para reuniones y eventos de empresa reseñables. Pero un gran fallo: no tienen enchufes junto a las mesillas de noche. Sólo uno junto a la televisión (dos si se desenchufa ésta) y el del baño. Por cierto: ¿cuándo se van a ir sustituyendo las bañeras por cómodas cabinas de ducha?",3,2016,11,01
47,Spa deludente ,Una sola piccola sauna e non ci sono ciabatte a disposizione...ho dovuto entrare in calze. Per alloggiare in un quattro stelle non pensavo di dovermi portare le pantofole da casa! Sul terrazzo una splendida piscina ma l'acqua è piuttosto fredda.,3,2016,11,01
47,Experiencia magnífica,Ha sido una experiencia magnífica. En cuanto a los servicios del hotel todo fue maravilloso y la ubicación de éste es inmejorable para conocer la ciudad. Seguro que si en futuro se presenta la ocasión volveré a él.,5,2016,11,01
47,Buen hotel!!!,"Hotel muy correcto, aunque que creo que las habitaciones son un poco justas por la categoría del hotel. Me aloje en una triple y la cama supletoria, era muy justa.Pero quiero destacar gran trato del personal. Al personal les pondría a todos excelente",4,2016,10,25
47,Buenas expectativas,El hotel ha cumplido con todas nuestras expectativas de situación privilegiada a 3 minutos a pie de la Feria de Barcelona. Con todo tipo de conexiones a cualquier lugar y rodeado de todos los servicios que puedas necesitar.,4,2016,10,25
47,Bien pero...,"La habitación fantástica, la cama hiper megagrande, las vistas impresionantes, pero....el desayuno, después de pagar 16 euros, creo que es algo a mejorar, falta bolleria, falta mejores productos, cafe servido en la mesa.",4,2016,10,24
47,"Excelente, como siempre.","Perfecta estancia de 18 días en el hotel, hacen que se sienta uno como en casa. Como siempre todo estuvo perfecto. Desde la llegada a la salida, todo estuvo perfecto. Gracias a todo el equipo por hacer la estancia tan agradable.",5,2016,10,24
47,Optima elección,"Nos hemos alojado en este hotel por su proximidad a la Fira, pero nos ha sorprendido por su servicio y hospitalidad.

La próxima vez que tengamos que pernoctar en Barcelona, seguro que volvemos a este hotel. 

Gracias por vuestra hospitalidad!",5,2016,10,13
47,Magnifico hotel para la Fira Montjuic,"El hotel fue magnífico para asistir al Barcelona Games World con un precio muy especial conseguido desde la página del evento, con el que parece que el hotel colaboraba. Con esa oferta especial, mucho más barata que el precio normal en buscadores, la relación calidad-precio ha sido excelente. El precio que se encontraba en los buscadores quizás excesivo pues a ese precio se espera un Gran Lujo. 
Respecto al hotel y sus instalaciones excelentes. Mucho huésped internacional, la recepción algo saturada por la gran cantidad de clientes que ingresaban, pero el personal de recepción muy amable y efectivo. La habitación grande y muy cómoda con muy buena conexión wifi. Buena insonorización a pesar del tráfico de la zona; sólo se escuchaba el sonido de las sirenas de las ambulancias o policía. El desayuno excelente en un local amplio y cómodo, bien ordenado. A destacar las tortillas y los crepes hechos en el momento. El hotel parece que tiene dos zonas diferenciadas de habitaciones según su calidad. Hasta la planta 6 las habitaciones estándars, amplias y cómodas, con buenas vistas. Desde la planta 7 las habitaciones de mayor nivel y suites. En esas plantas se encuentran el Gym y el Spa en la 7, en la planta 8 la terraza y la piscina frente a la fuente de Montjuic, ESPECTACULAR! Esas plantas tienen acceso independiente de ascensores. 
Una única pega sobre las instalaciones es el tema de accesibilidad: del parking subterráneo (22€/día) al hotel hay que pasar unos cuantos escalones, el acceso a la zona de desayuno también tenía algunos escalones no apropiados para personas con movilidad reducida, y señalar también la excesiva altura de acceso a la bañera, inadecuada incluso para personas con mayor movilidad, y más teniendo en cuenta el perfil de clientes del hotel. Creo que en estos hoteles debería ser equipamiento básico una ducha plato para facilitar el acceso a la ducha, y en su caso la bañera como equipamiento añadido.
El hotel cuenta con dos buenos restaurantes, con room service de su carta. Yo hice uso del servicio solicitando un plato del restaurante japonés Kurai. Tuve que esperar más de media hora pero mereció la pena por la calidad del plato, un arroz frito con huevo, calamares y gambas a un precio muy asequible.
En resumen, un gran hotel con muy buenas instalaciones, en una muy buena ubicación, al lado del centro comercial Las Arenas, en frente de Montjuic, con el metro en la puerta. Si se consigue un buen precio es absolutamente recomendable. El precio ""normal"" de los buscadores excesivo, y buscaría opciones más asequibles.",4,2016,10,13
47,Muy contentos!,"Sobre todo con la amabilidad del personal, en especial Linda de la recepción. La terraza es preciosa con vistas impresionantes sobre todo por la noche, las habitaciones muy bonitas y limpias, en general muy satisfechos, muchas gracias!",4,2016,10,11
47,Buena,"Muy bien situado, muy bonito y muy buen servicio.... Las habitaciones son una pasada y tienes muchas cosas alrededor del hotel para ver y comprar! Solo a la hora de salir fueron un poco pesados llamando",4,2016,10,11
47,Vistas de lujo,"Me encanto la estancia, todo formidable . La habitación es una pasada, cómoda y fácil descanso. Mucho turismo masivo pero es lo que tiene la ubicación maravillosa. El personal bien aunque mejorable en cocina y recepción perfecto. ",5,2016,10,10
47,Resolución de problemas,"Tardaron muchos días en encontrar un paquete que llegó a mi nombre un día entes.nadie se preocupó de buscarlo bien,se limitaron a buscar en una lista y decirme que no estaba,incluso cuando tenía el recibo de la agencia como que lo habían entregado,pero un chico muy amable lo soluciono al tercer día

",4,2016,10,10
47,Cómodo y cerca del AVE,Buena ubicación y un buen hotel para asistir a conferencias. Estuve poco tiempo y no pude disfrutar de la piscina y del bar de la azotea. La comida y el desayuno muy buenos. Cerca de la estación de AVE y con el metro a la puerta.                                                                    ,4,2016,10,09
47,Hotel en gran lugar,"El hotel está situado en la Plaza de España, con la plaza de toros antigua, ahora reconvertida en centro comercial, parada de metro al cruzar la calle, con zonas de restauración en los alrededores y para la noche poder ver la fuente de Montjuic(fantástico).
El hotel en sí grande y bastante moderno, habitaciones amplias, sin lujos pero no dejado, está muy bien, no es el más barato por su situación privilegiada claro, pero algo caro para lo pagado.",4,2016,10,05
47,Excelente hotel tanto para negocios como para turismo privado.,Excelentemente conectado mediante transporte publico al centro y también con el aeropuerto. Las habitaciones son muy amplias y cómodas y el personal extremadamente amable. La zona de la piscine es fantástica.,5,2016,10,04
47,Hotel alucinante,"El hotel se encuentra en una ubicación estupenda, está bien comunicado con la cuidad en el caso de que desee usar el transporte público hay una boca de metro a escasos metros de la puerta y si se quiere mover en taxi no se preocupe, justo en frente de la puerta encontrará millones de taxis. 
Las instalaciones del hotel son magníficas así como la terraza del rooftop con vistas directas a la Plaza España. 
El personal de recepción es muy amable y atento.",5,2016,09,30
47,"Donde hospedarse para estar en la city, sin los agobios del centro!!","Estuvimos Lola, mi hija, y yo un fin de semana largo, vaya, tres dias, lo pasamos muy bien y visitamos la ciudad a lo grande, pero nos dejamos cosas por ver por culpa de la espectacular terraza con su piscina, visita obligada de la peque y su baño, y el pool bar que tiene, donde se está de locos, relax, buena vista y musiquita que ameniza la situación (el papi)!!!
Buen hotel, buenísima acogida, buena ubicación, desayuno más que correcto, un restaurante (Fili... algo, no recuerdo el nombre) de cocina mediterránea de mercado con muy buena relación calidad-precio, un ""japonés-fusión"" más que aceptable (y yo soy súper comida japo y la conozco bien debido a mis estadas en Japón).
En definitiva, hotel ideal para llegar del aeropuerto, del ave, de crucero, no céntrico (en relación a plaza Cataluña) pero a cinco minutos del mismo.",5,2016,09,28
47,Zwei Tage Barcelona,"Sehr gut gelegenes Hotel mit freundlichem Personal und GUTEM Preis/Leistungs verhältniss.

La terraza es muy amplia, con piscina y barra de bar. 
El trato fue excelente.",4,2016,09,25
47,Barcelona Weekend,"Die Begrüssung bei der Ankunft donnerstags nachts um 23 Uhr war nicht gerade berauschend, der Rezeptionist war schlecht gelaunt, kurz angebunden und schnippisch. Die Gerüche im Eingangsbereich waren manchmal auch etwas fragwürdig und wir mussten sicher 1-2x pro Tag (3 Tage lang) immer wieder die Karte zur Zimmertüre neu aufschalten lassen. Am ersten Tag hiess es noch, wir sollten die Karte nicht beim Handy lagern (was wir nicht getan haben). Am 2. Tag hat sich dann einer verplappert, er wisse auch nicht, wieso die Kollegin die Karte nur für 1 Tag freigeschalten habe. Tja. Was soll man als Gast davon halten? 
Die Lage ist ok und man hat eine schöne Aussicht von der Suite aus. Die Suite war ok, nicht billig, aber sauber und komfortabel. An das konstante brummen der Ventilatoren im Schacht habe ich mich ab dem 2. Tag dann auch gewöhnt.",3,2016,09,22
47,Buen hotel ,"La ubicación es estratégica, es fácil moverte en metro por la ciudad. Las instalaciones están muy bien, las habitaciones están insonorizadas a pesar de haber mucho ruido en la calle en el hotel hay absoluta tranquilidad. El desayuno lo mejor, mucha variedad.",5,2016,09,22
47,Recomendado,"fabuloso, me encanto!! lo volvere a repetir sin duda alguna!!
La habitacion muy comoda, no nos tocaron buenas vistas, pero ningun problema por ello. La piscina era un sueno, con la vista de Montjuic! 
El desayuno delicioso y copioso, muy satisfecha. 
Un lugar al que volvere sin lugar a dudas! ",5,2016,09,19

Una gran oportunidad para ver a los amigos en un lugar unico",5,2016,09,18
47,Vistas!!,"el hotel es muy bonito, tiene buenas vistas desde el bar del hotel a la plaza españa, cruzando la calle se encuentra el centro comercial arenas, y a la puerta del hotel esta la estación del metro españa de la linea 3, tiene muy fácil acceso; lo único que no me agrado fue que en la habitación en vez de tener una cama grande tenia dos pequeñas ""juntas"" que en realidad se separaban y no era nada cómodo para dos personas al parecer esto se debia a la gran ocupación del hotel.",4,2016,09,14
47,Escapada,"Perfecto para pasar unos días en Barcelona. En horas puntas la piscina y la terraza se llena, pero siempre se puede tomar una copa. Durante nuestra estancia habían convenciones con bastante gente en el hotel y tuvieron el detalle de darnos una habitación en una zona más tranquila. Sin duda volveremos.  ",4,2016,09,12
47,Esperienza Fantastica!!,"Posizione favolosa, ho adorato il quartiere nei dintorni dell´Hotel; strategica per ogni movimento, vista spettacolare sulla piazza e sulle fontane danzanti.

47,Experiencia Increible,"La estancia fue perfecta. Personal atento y amable. Habitaciones perfectas y con unas vistas maravillosas. Zona de la piscina increible!

Sin duda volveremos a hospedarnos. ",5,2016,08,31
47,Una terraza espectacular,"Me he alojado con mi pareja hace dos fin de semana, era úna escapada romántica,  con reserva en los dos restaurantes que poseen, ya habíamos estado en el rte. Umo y nos sorprendió que era el mismo restaurante japonés con un nombre  poco sugerente como Kurai (oscuro, sin espíritu) pero me sorprendió a mejor, han actualizado la carta con unos excelentes cocktails japoneses, originales y sorprendentes,  de la comida todo magnífico (yo es que en un japonés me pierdo y éste es para repetir mil veces)¡¡¡ufff riquísimo el tiramisú verde!!!, y si además subes depues a la terraza con para mi las mejores vistas de la ciudad,  con ls camas balinesas, esa barra que permite tomarte una copa o algo de comer que si llego a saber que podemos cenar arriba la misma cocina que en el Kurai, pues pienso repetir. La estancia ha sido buena, dos noches excelentes en una habitacion superior, camas cómodas, buenas vistas, profesionales en la recepción y en la Terraza, como en los restaurantes ya que la siguiente noche como quedamos contentos y los chicos de Recepción nos recomendaron el restaurante catalán,  Filigrana, una carta bien combinada con brasas y recetas tradicionales,  el tàrtar de atún para mi increíble.",5,2016,08,31
47,Gran elección,"Las habitaciones muy amplias y con todo lujo de detalles. La cama muy confortable y grande. El baño amplio con bañera.

El buffet libre en el desayuno con mucha variedad. Con cocinero para hacer diferentes platos en el momento. 

La ubicación es perfecta, ya que está en Plaza España donde los Aerobus tienen una parada. También puedes utilizar el metro para desplazarte a cualquier lugar.",4,2016,08,30
47,Esperienza Plaza Barcellona,"L'hotel è situato in un piazza di Spagna in un punto strategico della città; a 25 minuti dall'aeroporto, a ridosso della metropolitana che offre il collegamento con tutta la città e le stazioni principali dei treni. L'ampia terrazza con piscina offre una meravigliosa vista sulla piazza e sul mont juic da cui sgodersi i magnifici  giochi d'acqua e di luci colorate della fontana. Il vicino centro commerciale arena è dotato di molti ristoranti. Le camere sono ben climatizzate e spaziose ed il bagno è dotato di bidet (elemento assai raro). Unica nota dolente e migliorabile è il buffet della colazione, scarno e di qualità non consono alle 4 stelle dell'hotel. ",3,2016,08,30
47,Recomendable,"A la llegada tuvimos algunos problemas, como que la llave no funcionaba o que tuvimos que dejar el equipaje en otro lugar hasta que cogiésemos la nueva llave, nada grave. Además el personal fue siempre súper amable y atento.
La habitación amplia y limpia sin embargo el baño es poco intimo por el diseño de la puerta. La cama era algo incomoda pero dormí en una supletoria.",4,2016,08,28
47,Mejorable en relación calidad-precio,"Estuvimos durante 3 noches hospedados en este hotel, y tras haber  reservado a través de la página oficial del hotel, empezaron no dándonos lo que prometieron (cóctel de bienvenida...) Pedimos explícitamente cama de matrimonio y nos comunicaron que las únicas habitaciones que tenían ese tipo de cama no tenían vistas, aunque no esperábamos que fuese un patio interior en el que sólo se veía una carpa. Bajamos a recepción y nos cambiaron de habitación a otra en la que las vistas mejoraron notablemente aunque el armario del minibar y la estantería del armario estaban rotos. (nos lo arreglaron rápidamente sin poner pegas). Otro detalle a destacar es que,  el hotel no cuenta con una llave de la caja fuerte para cada habitación por lo tanto nos pusieron en lista de espera y al terminar nuestra estancia allí, no tuvimos llave. Nuestra experiencia no fue del todo satisfactoria ya que nos pareció que pagamos demasiado para lo que es el hotel. Cabe a destacar que el desayuno y el personal del hotel eran buenos a pesar de que estaban desbordados de ocupación y la habitación la segunda vez, una vez arreglado todo estaba bastante bien. En conclusión,  hotel normal, aunque en relación calidad precio demasiado caro para los servicios que incluye.",3,2016,08,28
47,Stupefatto ,"Piazza centrale dalla quale parte la famosa Rambla, è stata una scoperta piacevole che non conoscevo e non avevo visto nei precedenti viaggi a Barcellona. 
Palazzi gotici, fontane, e giardini fioriti accolgono letteralmente il turista che si immerge nella cultura catalana.

47,Cupón Spa Grupalia. Peladito peladito...,"OPINIÓN EXCLUSIVAMENTE SOBRE LA ZONA DE SPA/PISCINA

Compré un cupón por Groupalia de ""piscina, chill-out y masaje balinés para dos personas"".
Llegamos a la planta del spa y estuvimos como 15 minutos esperando a que viniera alguien (tenían una hoja din A4 puesta en el escritorio rollo ""estamos ocupados, volvemos enseguida""... Genial)
Como veníamos con tiempo, la chica nos invitó a subir un rato arriba. Tuvimos la genial idea de pedir una coca-cola zero y una cerveza de barril. Todo al módico precio de casi 7€. (Las camareras super majas, ojo)
Ese masaje que te dicen de 25' en realidad es de 15, y dando las gracias. Piernas y espalda (ni brazos, ni pies, ni manos, ni ná).
Entramos en la sala a en punto, nos desvestimos, las chicas entran, nos dan el masaje, se marchan, nos quedamos dos minutos en plan tranquilo y nos bajamos de la camilla... Y cuál es mi sorpresa al ver que eran y 20. Hola?
Cuando nos damos cuenta de que el bono no tiene acceso al spa, preguntamos si podríamos acceder igualmente, aunque pagáramos lo que costase, nos dicen que no tienen (la frase literal fue ""somos un spa, pero sin spa, jejejeje""). Ni sauna, ni chorros, ni circuito termal... Nada.
Seguimos con el bono:
El concepto de piscina ok, es una piscina en el piso superior (a la cual CUALQUIER PERSONA puede tener acceso: Basta con entrar al hotel y subir en ascensor), limpia y bastante pequeña.
Lo que no me quedó muy claro era dónde estaba el chill-out, porque intentaron hacernos creer que era allí donde la piscina pero sólo nos encontramos en una terraza de un ático con 5/6 sitios buenos cerca de la piscina y otros 4/5 en la otra punta subiendo la escalera, el resto eran hamacas y sillas de mimbre en el mejor de los casos, sino de plástico o directamente al suelo. Básicamente hay buenos sitios para 15 personas con un aforo medio de 50. Con niños salpicando y chillando constantemente es sorprendentemente fácil relajarse, sí sí...
Y por cierto, no hay ni duchas, así que tú y esos 3 litros de aceite que te han puesto os vais juntitos a casa, espero que vivas cerca ;)",2,2016,08,24
47,Muy recomendable.,Hotel muy recomendable por su ubicación y servicios. Precios razonables por su categoria y localización. Servicios adecuados y habitaciones comodas y amplias. Muy buenas vistas de la plaza de España. Un hotel perfecto para el turismo internacional.,4,2016,08,23

Consigliato come appoggio per l'ottima posizione centralissima che permette di raggiungere i principali monumenti e ramblas in pochissimo tempo a piedi o con la metropolitana.",4,2016,08,07

Lo mejor zona de la piscina para buenas vistas y tomar un buen y refrescante cocktail",4,2016,08,02
47,Ubicación,"Tiene una ubicación excepcional. El restaurante es muy bueno. La habitación triple deja mucho que desear, ya que está metida la tercer cama con calzador. El desayuno merece la pena, ya que cuando fuimos había una oferta por 10€.",4,2016,08,01
47,Bueno,"El hotel está bien situado , con conexión con todos los servicios. Las habitaciones requiere una reforma de mejoras, el personal muy atento y resolutivo. En la fecha que estuvimos había unos conciertos y este hotel es ideal para este tipo de evento por su situación. Relación precio-calidad es un poco elevado.",4,2016,08,01
47,Magnífica ,"Es una terraza muy ancha con vistas  espectaculares, buenos sofás  y con precios correctos. La carta de comidas y cenas es un poco escasa pero es muy correcta. Comimos un ceviche de Curbina después unas almejas a la brasa Josper y por acabar un chuletón a la brasa con Josper, hay que decir que por estar hecho en Josper no tenía mucho sabor. Pero en general todo estaba correcto . El trato de los camareros en mi caso fue fantástico. Recomendable 100%.",5,2016,07,28
47,Bueno servicio aunque detalles mejorables en un cinco estrellas.,"Me alojé hace tres años durante los mundiales de natación del 2013, con mi marido y mi hija, en la suite del reloj. Para ser la suite principal del hotel, había detalles a mejorar, por ejemplo, visagras de ferretería colocadas bajo la cama supletoria de la habitación de abajo, algún fallo de pintura y se echaba de menos un sofá familiar en la salita.
Por lo demás muy bien, el servicio muy amable, tanto en pisos como en recepción como en el restaurante. Los desayunos y las cenas espectaculares. 
Para volver, aunque pienso que deberían ajustar un poco el precio.",4,2016,07,26
47,Wir hatten 7 angenehme Tage im Hotel,"Das Hotel ist sehr gut, sehr sauber und hat eine sehr gute Lage. Die Mitarbeiter sind ausgesprochen freundlich und hilfsbereit. Der Pool auf der Terrasse im 8 Stock ist herrlich und man hat einen wunderschönen Rund-um-Blick über Barcelona.",5,2016,07,26
47,Espectacular. ,"El hotel y sus empleados cumplieron muy bien nuestras espectativas. La terraza espectacular. Por el día para uso de la piscina y zona ""chill out"" y por la tarde/noches muy bien para tomar algo mientras ves cómo baila el agua en la fuente de colores  de Montjuïc con el MNAC al fondo. Súper bien comunicado para hacer turismo y para ir de compras, al lado del Carrer de Sants y del centro comercial Las Arenas.",5,2016,07,24
47,Una noche perfecta,"Celebramos una fiesta con amigos en la terraza y todo estuvo muy bien. Aperitivo muy bueno, vistas fantásticas y la música con el DJ estuvo genial. Un buen recuerdo para todos. Nos quedamos a dormir y la habitación es amplia y cómoda y está muy bien insonorizada a la calle. Desayuno habitual de un hotel. El trato del personal muy amable. Hotel céntrico y muy recomendable. Buen parking con acceso directo al hotel. Lástima de no disponer de más tiempo para disfrutar de la piscina y el spa.",5,2016,07,19
47,Negativo ,"Hotel pubblicizzato al di sopra di quanto lo sia effettivamente in realtà. Personale della reception in ore notturne scortese e maleducato e non parla l'italiano. La prima sera che sono arrivato, musica altissima per un matrimonio e in camera non si poteva dormire. In tutto l'hotel, la zona di interesse servita da un solo ascensore  (l'altro era in avaria). Inoltre l'unico ascensore funzionante era usato anche dal personale di servizio che trasportava pietanze e panni sporchi, con conseguenti olezzi in cabina. Colazione sufficiente ma i tavoli, in orari previsti, non erano adeguatamente apparecchiati (mancavano le posate). Esperienza negativa.

nos falto un celular,otras personas se quejaban de que les robaron la cámara de fotos,del hall.
Nos dieron tambien por error,en el check in,la llave de una habitación que estaba ocupada y tuvimos acceso a todas las pertenencias de esa persona. Eventualmente,otra persona,pudiera haber tenido acceso a las nuestras.",2,2016,07,15
47,Fantástico ,"Estuvimos para una comida y fue todo muy muy agradable,  las vistas inmejorables de las calles de Barcelona, Montjuïc, las fuentes, la piscina...

47,Vieles ist zu verändern,"Platten auf Tischen und im Badezimmer machten wegen vorhandener Flecken einen ungepflegten Eindruck.

47,Ubicación y hotel excelente,"La ubicación en plena plaza España, enfrente de la Fira y el palacio de Monjuïc es excelente, además en la puerta del hotel hay una parada de metro. Estuvimos un fin de semana en una minisuite, 2 adultos y 2 niños.Las camas son amplias,la decoración minimalista, el baño con instalaciones modernas y muy limpia tanto la habitación como todas las instalaciones.
 El hotel tiene 12 plantas y en todo momento te vas encontrando personal del hotel que te pregunta si pueden ayudarte, amabilísimos.
En la planta 8 se encuentra la piscina, con unas vistas espectaculares de la ciudad.
Volveré seguro",5,2016,07,05
47,Super Hotel in toller Lage,"Wir sind zu Viert für ein Wochenende in das Hotel gekommen. Das Personal ausgesprochen freundlich und zuvorkommend. Die Zimmer waren noch nicht fertig, aber wir hatten die Möglichkeit das Gepäck in der Zwischenzeit in einem Gepäckraum aufzubewahren. Wir hatten ein gutes Gefühl dabei, da die Koffer beschriftet und von einem Mitarbeiter verstaut wurden. So konnte niemand anderes zu den Koffern gelangen und eventuell etwas entwenden.Auch am Abreisetag konnten wir die Koffer wieder gut unterbringen
Die Zimmer waren sehr schön und ausgesprochen sauber.  Die Betten, Boxspringbetten, sehr bequem und die Pölster luftig und bequem.
Das Frühstücksbuffet war ein Traum und bot alles was das Herz begehrt. Frisches Obst und frische Smoothies, Lachs, Wurst, Käse,..... 
Auch die Lage ist super. Direkt bei der Einkaufsstraße und dem Platz an dem die Hop on hop off Busse ihre Haltestelle haben, ebenso die Flughafenzubringerbusse.
Ich kann dem Hotel nur die Bestnote geben. Wir haben selten bei einer Städtereise in einem so guten 4Stern Hotel gewohnt, .",5,2016,07,04
47,Cóctel en la terraza con la familia. Espectacular!!,"Hemos visitado la terraza del hotel Catalonia Barcelona Plaza por recomendación de amigos y no nos ha defraudado! Lo primero y principal ha sido la atención recibida por Carlos López que nos ha tratado como familia, mimándonos a nosotros y a nuestra pequeña a la que se ha ganado enseguida. Hemos podido disfrutar de unos cócteles buenísimos a buen precio en un entorno brutal con vistas a toda Barcelona. La terraza es sencillamente un oasis en medio de Barcelona y desde la cual se puede tener una vista panorámica de toda Barcelona y especialmente Montjuic. Quedamos pendientes de volver de noche ya que debe ser mágico!

Gracias Carlos!!

47,Buena opción en Barcelona,"Viajé por negocios, y elegí este hotel por su cercanía con el centro de convenciones de Barcelona. Más allá de eso, el acceso al centro, la rambla es muy simple, y se llega rápido con transporte publico. Desde el hotel se puede caminar hasta Montjuic, con una vista espectacular.",4,2016,06,30
47,"Buen hotel, detalles poco cuidado","Fuimos con mi pareja a pasar una noche en este hotel, situado en una zona central de Barcelona. El hotel en si tiene las comodidades de un hotel superior, pero la falta de cuidados en pequeños detalles, como falta de shampoo, no preguntar tipo de habitación o unos cojines poco cómodos, le baja la puntuación.",4,2016,06,30
47,Ubicación perfecta y hotel razonablemente bueno,"Estuve alojado en este hotel 1 noche por trabajo con buenas sensaciones sin embargo tiene puntos por mejorar con luces y sombras.
Lo mejor: ubicación perfecta tanto para ir a la estación de tren de Sants, como para ir al Aeropuerto, o visitar Barcelona, con multiples conexiones por autobus y metro. Desayuno razonablemente bueno, con buffet muy variado, incluso tortillas variadas elaboradas en el instante con los ingredientes a gusto. Además el desayuno se hace bajo una carpa en un patio interior donde se tiene la sensación de estar casi al aire libre pero a la sombra, así que es muy agradable. La habitación muy espaciosa y la cama muy cómoda con muy buen colchón. Eso es muy positivo ya que permite muy buen descanso.
Lo peor: Lo único malo del desaryuno es que los zumos no son naturales. Y en la habitación se nota que el mobiliario, y el acondicionamiento del baño lleva muchos años sin renovarse. Una relación calidad-precio media y las habitaciones que no dan al exterior dan a un patio interior bastante feo.
Conclusión: es un muy buen hotel para estancias cortas ya que aprovechas perfectamente su ubicación, el descanso que te ofrece la habitación y la piscina en pleno centro de Barcelona, con un desayuno razonable. El servicio fue muy bueno tanto a la llegada como a la salida. Para largas estancias quizás sea mejor buscar un hotel más económico. Incluye wifi gratuito.",4,2016,06,28
47,"Bellissimo, ma...","L'hotel è in posizione strategica, a un passo dalla metropolitana, le camere sono ben insonorizzate, i letti comodi, è la piscina con vista sulla città è un plus davvero importante. Solo quattro pallini perché la colazione l'ho trovata davvero scarna e di bassa qualità, quindi si può fare di meglio!",4,2016,06,27
47,Unfähiges Personal,"Wir kamen als eine Gruppe von 80 Leuten... mal abgesehen davon, dass einige Zimmer noch nicht fertig waren, war das völlig überforderte Personal nicht in der Lage, die verfügbaren Zimmerkarten vorzubereiten. Das endete in einem riesen Stau in der Lobby... wir mussten das Hotel verlassen und warten, bis sie endlich die Karten in Kuverts gepackt hatten. 
Wenn ein Hotel über die Ankunft einer derart großen Gruppe informiert ist, muss es eine Selbstverständlichkeit sein, dass die Zimmer vorbereitet sind und die Übergabe reibungslos funktioniert! Bin sehr enttäuscht...",1,2016,06,27
47,Tolle Lage,"Schöner Blick aus dem Zimmer - Bad ist renovationsbedürftig - die Bar auf dem Dach ist ein toller Treffpunkt. Es ist eine gute Idee ein kleinerer Frühstücksraum anzubieten, die Atmosphäre im grossen Raum ist gar wie in einer lauten Turnhalle.",3,2016,06,27
47,Mal servicio.,"La ubicación esta muy bien.  Cerca a autobuses, metro, etc.
Servicio en general malo. Desayunos con muy poco variedad.  Confort de las camas excelente.
Creo que el precio es demasiado alto por lo que el hotel ofrece",1,2016,06,24
47,"Cuidado, te asignan habitacion sin preguntar si deseas fumador o no. Y no todas las habitaciones tienen caja de segurida","El hotel es espacioso y cómodo. Buenas camas y sábanas. Pero tanto cuando haces la reserva como cuando te asignan habitación no preguntan si deseas habitación fumador o no fumador. Nos asignaron una habitación y en los pasillos solía haber olor a cigarrillo. Una noche fue muy fuerte el olor que penetraba en la habitación. Llamé  a recepción y me dijeron que era un piso de fumadores. Indignada aclaré que no me lo advirtieron al designarme habitación, ni al hacer la reserva. Era muy tarde para cambiar de habitación. Aguanté una noche más total ya me iba. Pero es muy feo sentir olor a cigarrillo que penetre en tu habitación. Y no es correcto que al reservar o al asignarte habitación no puedas elegir libre e humo. Otro inconveniente es que publicitan caja de seguridad en todas las habitaciones y cuando lo solicitamos no tenían llave, tuvimos que reclamar varias veces para que nos den una.",3,2016,06,23

Tutto incantevole,soprattutto per la vista. 
L'unica cosa negativa:il frigobar era rotto,ce l'hanno cambiato dopo varie lamentele e dopo un giorno si è rotto anche l'altro.",5,2016,06,21

47,hotel bonito y buen situado,"Se encuentra justo en la plaza de España. No es que esté en el puro centro pero está bien situado con buenas vistas a la plaza. 
Me gustaría criticar el servicio de barra de la piscina de la azotea. Para pedir tienes que echar en algunas ocasiones más de 10 minutos estando solo dos personas delante. Hay poca gente en la barra. Si saben que la mayoría de bebidas son cócktels, batidos etc que lleva una preparación tienen que meter más gente porque por momentos es insufrible la espera. En cuanto a los precios, pues normal que gente suba con bolsas del supermercado porque cuando por un refresco te cobran 4,40... Se pueden imaginar los del resto de bebidas.",4,2016,06,20
47,Bene ma non benissimo,"Ho soggiornato in camera superior per un viaggio di lavoro. 
Pulizia buona, letto molto comodo. La doccia però lasciava a desiderare. Il soffione a soffitto era talmente pieno di calcare da essere inutilizzabile.
Potrebbero sicuramente curare di più le camere, soprattutto se superior o suite.
Posizione impagabile di fronte alle fontane magiche e alla metro.",4,2016,06,18

47,"Muy buen hotel, en muy buena ubicación","Nos gustó mucho la estancia en este hotel. El personal muy amable, llegamos sobre las 12 y nuestra habitación aún no estaba lista y nos guardaron las maletas sin problema. Sobre la habitación, muy moderna y limpia, la única pega que la encontré pequeña, estuvimos en una Habitación Superior. 
No tuvimos tiempo de probar ningún servicio del hotel, pero visitamos la piscina exterior con el bar al lado y de noche es una maravilla. Por el tiempo que hacía de viento no pudimos disfrutarlo. 
La ubicación es genial, en plena Plaza España al lado de el Centro Comercial Las Arenas. Muy cerca del Palau Sant Jordi que era lo que nos interesaba, se podía ir andando perfectamente.
Tuvieron el detalle de traernos a la habitación fruta fresca, chocolates y agua.
También lo único que nos tocó si no recuerdo mal en el piso 6 o 7 y nuestra ventana que tenía una vista parcial a la Plaza España estaba toda cerrada con barrotes, parecía una cárcel... Pero las de mas abajo no lo tenían, solo algunos pisos creo recordar.
Seguro que volveremos.",4,2016,06,14

Sono stata avvisata alle16.30 (il mio arrivo era previsto per la sera tardi) da una signorina che l'hotel sempre di questa catena a tre stelle che avevo prenotato non era disponibile,non si sa per quale oscura ragione perché non ci è stato specificato. Siamo stati mandati qua.. ottima posizione dell'hotel,ci hanno detto che potevamo usare la Spa e la palestra, ma la Camera che ci hanno dato lasciare molto a desiderare.
Il lavandino del bagno non scaricava, l'acqua rimaneva li per parecchio tempo. 
La Camera dopo la prima notte non ci è stata rifatta,il gg successivo abbiamo dovuto fare richiesta specifica,nel frigobar la metà della roba era scaduta (coca, succhi) da almeno 2mesi. Le cameriere dovrebbero controllare queste cose anche se è una stanza poco utilizzata (abbiamo dedotto).
Non so se la stanza è riservata alle ""emergenze"" come la nostra ma di certo non abbiamo scelto noi di soggiornare qui e pagare come un tre stelle. ",2,2016,06,08

47,Gute Lage allein macht nicht froh,"Wir kamen als Gruppe von 20 Personen an einem langen Wochenende - deshalb hoher Preis, was wir an sich noch akzeptiert hätten. Ärgerlich allerdings war, dass wir alle im 3. Stockwerk in nicht renovierte, total enge Zimmer mit Schimmel am Waschbecken gesteckt wurden. Eigentlich war es ein Ein-Bettzimmer, in das ein 2. Bett geschoben wurde. Frühstück findet im durch ein großes Zelt überdachten Innenhof statt. Bei voller Belegung wird es extrem laut und gemütlich ist anders. Aber das Frühstücksbuffet ist so weit in Ordnung, frisches Obst, Jamon Serrano und Queso Manchego. 
Sehr gut ist die Lage an der Plaza Espana, und am Dach das offenbar ziemlich neue Schwimmbad mit herrlichem Ausblick auf die Stadt. Ein Tipp: die Zimmer in den oberen Stockwerken sind angeblich renoviert und sollen entsprechend luxuriös sein - möglicherweise verdient das Hotel deshalb 4 Sterne....",3,2016,05,31

47,Buono ma mi aspettavo meglio ,"Sono stato in questo hotel per viaggio in coppia unendo uno splendido concerto a 4 giorni di relax...non era la prima volta a Bcn...prenoto quest'hotel per buona posizione e per recensioni promettenti..effettivamente non rimango delusissimo solo mi aspettavo qualcosa in più...nello specifico...Camera Superior 7 piano (ottenuta con sovrapprezzo) ma:
- all arrivo camera consegnata in ritardo
- ci tengono le valigie mentre approfittiamo dell attesa per vedere un po la città ed al ritorno consegnano il bigliettino per il riconoscimento valigie, ci vengono date altri bagagli (totalmente diversi dai nostri)
- camera pulita ed in ordine ma il bagno (senza finestra) non ha la ventola 
- caloriferi scalda salviette arrugginiti 
- cameriera che per consegnare gentilmente i cioccolatini di benvenuto ha bussato e senza attendere risposta è entrata in stanza

Nel complesso una bella esperienza nonostante queste mancanze..certo si può sempre migliorare!

47,Hotel de calidad pero poco descanso,"El hotel no tiene prácticamente pegas.

Tal vez, cambiaría algo el aseo. Creo que es un atraso disponer de bañera aún y no de un cómodo pie de ducha.

Por otro lado, solicitamos dormir en una planta alta, lo que resultó imposible y provocó que apenas pudiéramos descansar, debido a que estábamos con vistas a la Plaza de Espanya y las habitaciones tienen una insonorización que deja bastante que desear.",4,2016,05,24
47,Para Repetir,"Excelente hotel ubicado frente de la plaza España en Barcelona, frente a estación del metro, estuve en una muy buena habitación con vista a la plaza España, desayuno amplio y muy surtido el Wifi es gratuito y rápido.",5,2016,05,23
47,Excelente atención,El hotel esta muy bien ubicado. El trato del personal fue perfecto. Las habitaciones muy amplias y equipadas. Tiene parada de subte en la puerta lo que permite una rápida circulación por la ciudad. Recomendable,5,2016,05,22
47,Muy recomendable,"Me hospedé en una habitación amplia y nueva, elegante, con vistas a la montaña de Montjuic, la ducha enorme y moderna, miles de detalles como toda clase de amenities, nevera con muchas bebidas heladas, climatización que no se oye de noche! Y muchas almohadas y cojines. Estuve en la misma planta que la piscina exterior donde hay un bar muy bonito y tiene vistas a toda Barcelona. Cené en la cafetería, una hamburguesa deliciosa y muy bien presentada a un precio muy económico. La amabilidad de todo el personal es increíble. Es un hotel muy grande pero muy recomendable. Me sentí muy a gusto. Hay parking en el mismo hotel, gimnasio pequeño pero con máquinas de última generación y un spa. El café del desayuno delicioso, expresso, corto, como a mí me gusta.",5,2016,05,18
47,Excelente Ubicación y trato,El trato del personal es excelente y la Ubicación perfecta. Las habitaciones e instalaciones muy bien. El metro está casi en la puerta y el recinto ferial con las fuentes de montjuic enfrente del hotel. Al lado justo de la antígua plaza de toros ahora reconvertida a centro comercial con unas vistas impresionantes de esa zona de la ciudad,5,2016,05,18
47,"Super Zentral gelegen, mit Wohlfühlfaktor",Wir waren 4 Tage in Barcelona und hatten in diesem Hoel einen idealen Ausgangspunkt für alle Unternehmungen. Die U-Bahnstation befindet sich direkt vor dem Hotel. Einzigartig auch der Rundumblick über Barcelona von der Dachterasse aus und herrlich auch die Abkühlung im dortigen Pool nach einer anstrengenden Tour. Durch die zentrale Lage darf man allerdings nachts nicht all zu empflindlich gegen Straßenlärm sein.  Das Frühstücksbuffet war ausreichend - für meine Begriffe jedoch etwas dürftig in der Auswahl und vorallem im Nachschub.,5,2016,05,17
47,Habitaciones con baldosas rotas. Bañera buena,"En el check in me tire 20 minutos. La habitación no es para un hotel de 4 estrellas con ese precio. Fue mi primera vez en este hotel y no volveré por el tiempo de espera en la entrada y el estado de las habitaciones.

47,Gutes Hotel mit super Bar/Schwimmbad,Gutes zentrales Hotel. Frühstück gut im Zelt überdachten Innenhof. Das Schwimmbad mit Bar in der 8. Etage. Superbe Aussicht. Die Zimmer sind groß aber in den Details lässt die Qualität der Ausstattung doch zu wünschen übrig. Nicht unverkraftbar aber merklich.,5,2016,05,17
47,buenisimo,"Un hotel con una exquisita decoración, personal amabilisimo y atentos de todo. La habitación muy buena con vistas a plaza cataluña y monguit aunque un poco ruidosa. Me encanto muy buen comunicado con boca de metro a la entrada y a 10 min de la estación de sants.",5,2016,05,16
47,Ineccepibile ,"L'hotel si trova nella meravigliosa Plaza de Espana e se si è fortunati o con un semplice upgrade si riesce ad aver la
Vista sulla piazza. L'hotel è ben organizzato, ampia la hall e sorridente il personale alla reception. Di particolare significato la presenza di una tabella al desk della reception con la differenza di prezzo per ogni possibilità di upgrade. Unica nota da migliorare è là forse eccessiva giovinezza (intesa come iniziale poca preparazione) che crea qualche piccolo problema.  Detto fatto... Chiedo una camera sulla Plaza e mi indicano come unica possibilità il passaggio nella junior suite. Ne prendo una ma... affaccia su un vicolo. Capisco che la ragazza non ha ben chiaro l'orientamento dell'edificio ma nessun problema. La camera viene cambiata immediatamente. Le junior suite sono ampie, letto king size e divano. Ampio bagno con doccia di dimensioni significative. Unica nota stonata è che il bagno è direttamente nella camera senza porte di separazione (cosa che invece c'è ma senza Chiavj per il wc e la doccia). Le camere sono pulite r ben curate. Silenziosi i piani. Previsti nella camera accappatoi, bollitore per acqua e macchina nespresso. Mi danno una camera al 7mo piano ristrutturato da poco ed a diretto contatto con la SpA e la piscina al piano superiore. Quest'ultima è semplicemente stupenda con una vista a 360 gradi su Barcellona. Bella la zona breakfast con la particolarità di un buffet suddiviso in differenti punti. Ottima la qualità delle materie prime e la gentilezza del personale. Nota finale... Non ho trovato in camera la macchina nespresso. Chiesta più volte ma mai avuta (a fronte di un ripetuto provvedo subito)... Alla fine si scusano e non mi fanno pagare l'upgrade. Da ritornare assolutamente ",5,2016,05,14
47,Molto vecchio," Camera vecchia riscaldamento non funzionante, il mobile del frigobar senza frigo, posizione hotel accettabile, vasca da bagno scolorita dall'usura, lo sconsiglio vivamente se tutte le camere standard sono come la camera 303.",2,2016,05,12

47,El personal deja mucho que desear,"Quisieron cobrar l'habitacion dos veces al igual que el desayuno cuando ya estaba pagado previamente por telefono. Despues de comprovarlo, el personal muy desagradable, nos hicieron la devolución del dinero.",1,2016,05,09

47,Angenehmes Hotel mit sehr guter Verkehrsanbindung,"Wir waren hier für 3 Nächte. Eigentlich hatten wir im Catalonia Alberniz gebucht, wurden aber wegen Überbuchung in das Catalonia Barcelona Plaza (ein Stern mehr, selber Preis!) transferiert. Wir fanden das Hotel insgesamt sehr schön und durch seine sehr gute Verkehrsanbindung sehr praktisch. Außerdem sind die Entfernungen zu den Ramblas oder zum Hafen auch mal gut zu Fuß zu laufen. Die Rezeption haben wir als sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit empfunden. Beim Einchecken wurde uns gleich gesagt, dass unser Zimmer nicht das Beste sei, dass aber wegen der Fashion-Week alles ausgebucht sei. Wir sollten uns aber einfach am nächsten Morgen melden und würden ein besseres Zimmer bekommen. Das Zimmer war aus unserer Sicht okay, aber die Betten etwas hart, daher haben wir von dem Angebot Gebrauch gemacht und das versprochene bessere Zimmer erhalten (größer, bessere Aussicht, neuer, ruhiger). Es stimmt, was manche anderen Gäste schreiben: die Rezeption wirkt manchmal überlastet, aber trotzdem sind die Mitarbeiter immer freundlich und hilfsbereit gewesen, z.B bei dem Ausdrucken von Online-Tickets für Besichtigungen. Frühstück fanden wir ebenfalls gut (Angebot, Qualität, Service - viel frisches Obst, frische Omelettes, nettes Personal mit Kaffeeservice), wenn auch die Atmosphäre im Frühstückssaal sicher etwas kalt ist - und Ende April auch war. Im Sommer ist dies sicher anders zu bewerten. Die Aussichtsterrasse mit dem Pool ist genial, haben wir aber wegen der noch recht kühlen Temeparaturen nicht weiter genutzt. Alles in allem würden wir hier jederzeit wieder Einchecken.

Noch ein letzter Hinweis wegen der angesprochenen Hellhörigkeit: ja, wegen der Laminatböden hört man sicher Schritte von anderen Gästen, aber dafür empfinden wir das hygienischer als die üblichen Teppichböden. Die Toilettenspülungen (Druckspüler) sind wirklich recht laut und auch vom Nachbarn zu hören, ist uns aber nur zweimal aufgefallen, also vernachlässigbar. Die Fenster sind gut isoliert, der Straßenlärm bleibt draußen (wir haben erst zum Hof und dann zur Straße geschlafen - jederzeit wieder Zimmer zur Straße). Dafür hört man Geräusche von der Metro - fährt direkt am Haus oder unter dem Haus durch. Ist in den unteren Stockwerken mehr zu hören, aber nicht so sehr, als das es ein Problem ist, außer es ist jemand extrem lärmempfindlich - aber der fährt dann besser aufs Land und nicht in die Großstadt. :-)",4,2016,04,30
47,"Bien ubicado, limpio, buen servicio.","El hotel se encuentra en la Plaza de España, justo al lado de Fira de Barcelona y en frente del Museo de Arte. Está bien ubicado, tienes la boca de Metro a unos metros. No está mal la calidad para su precio.",4,2016,04,27
47,week end a baecellona,"il soggiorno è stato fantastico, l hotel è collegato magnificamente e la posizione davanti a montjuic è meravigliosa..le camere confortevolissime e lo staff efficiente e gentile. la colazione ben organizzata e fornita di tutto",5,2016,04,27
47,Un Hotel con un enclave unico,"El Hotel Catalonia, tiene un enclave único con unas vistas panorámicas de la ciudad y del Montjuic. Su personal es muy amable y la calidad de su buffet muy buena. Dispone de una preciosa terraza con chillout. El único pero es que en las habitaciones el mobiliario esta un poco anticuado y el mantenimiento del mismo deja un poco que desear.",4,2016,04,27
47,Viaje de negocios,"Hotel que necesita una reforma en las habitaciones, están muy usadas. En cuanto a la limpieza, estuve dos noche y no cambiaron el gel y el champú usado. Pese a todo y por su ubicación y amabilidad del personal tengo pensado volver a este hotel",3,2016,04,26
47,Hotel confortable ,"Nueva visita a este hotel por negocios, esta vez el hotel estaba muy concurrido y me toco una habitación mas pequeña de lo habitual. Eso sí con una cama de 180cm de ancho muy confortable. A mejorar los baños que ésta ocasión tenía cortina en la bañera y no mampara y es una cosa que odio y creo debería de estar prohibida en hoteles de 4 estrellas.

47,Excelente,"Alojé a unos compañeros en viaje de negocios hace unos días y quedaron encantados con el hotel y con el trato que les dispensó el personal. Ya he repetido varias veces en este hotel y el resultado ha sido siempre el mismo. Un hotel muy recomendable, muy cerca del centro de Barcelona.",5,2016,04,23
47,"Buena calidad, podría mejorar.","Este es un hotel en el que ya he estado por trabajo y merece una opinión. Resaltar la amabilidad de Oscar en recepción y de Carla y otro chico rubio delgado del que no supe el nombre en el Restaurante Kura. Las habitaciones son correctas y espaciosas y las ame nítida de calidad. Las Habitaciones de la 1-28 interiores y más oscuras, de la 29 a la 58 exteriores y las mejores vistas de la 40 en adelante. Han cambiado los colchones desde la ultima vez que estuve y las camas son cómodas. Las almohadas son altas y duras así que si no te gustan así dilo en el check in. 
No dejar de visitar la piscina y la terraza, Chil out con camas balinesas y vistas de Montjuic impresionantes
El desayuno flojo para la categoría del hotel. Poca variedad; de pan, por ejemplo, no tenían integral de calidad. 
El restaurante Filigrana muy bueno aunque te tienen que traducir la carta. La cantidad razonable para este tipo de restaurante. El babá al ron merece probarlo de postre. Caro. 
El japonés Kura muy bueno, los edamame los ponen a la plancha! y en general mucha fusión en los platos. Si buscas un japonés puro no es este. El tiramisu de té verde era sorprendentemente bueno. Caro. 
Los dos restaurantes tienen servicio muy lento porque hacen la comida en el momento y eso lleva su tiempo. 
Aun así está muy bien ubicado en la Plaza de España al lado del centro comercial que han hecho en la antigua plaza de toros y que también merece una visita. El metro está en la puerta del hotel y comunica con rapidez toda Barcelona.
Listos? Pues a disfrutar de la visita!",4,2016,04,23
47,"""Como estar en casa""","Una vez más, no puedo decir otra cosa que ha sido una experiencia estupenda. Las habitaciones son muy cómodas, con una decoración moderna y renovada, llena de detalles que te hacen una estancia muy confortable. El personal muy agradable y atento. El desayuno muy variado, con productos de gran calidad. 
No puedo hacer otra cosa que recomendarlo al 100 %",5,2016,04,20
47,Total satisfacción ,"Una vez más mi estancia en este hotel hay sido muy satisfactoria. Una habitación recién decorada amplia, cómoda con distintas comodidades (albornoz, fruta fresca, cafetera...), el trato por parte del personal exquisito, desayuno en un entorno cómodo, tranquilo con una variedad de productos más que adecuada. Seguiré recomendando este hotel a todas aquellas personas que visiten la ciudad. ",5,2016,04,18
47,Como regresar a casa,"El hotel es bonito, cómodo, las habitaciones son muy agradables, los baños bien dotados, hay cafetera en el cuarto. Las camas son cómodas y las almohadas muy buenas (y yo tengo problemas con las almohadas). El personal el atento, la comida es muy buena.
El hotel está muy bien ubicado, a pocas cuadras hay estación del metro, pero si al final estás muy cansado la opción de taxi no es descabellada, tienen precios aceptables.
LO MALO: los ascensores son pequeños, caben dos personas con sus maletas, así que si van en grupos grandes, la fila va a ser larga. Y lo otro, estar pendientes de sus pertenencias, pues el día que dejábamos el hotel una señora descuidó su cartera y le robaron la billetera.",5,2016,03,30
47,Necesita remodelacion urgentemente,"Habitaciones amplias pero viejas. El baño necesita urgentemente una reforma. La música del pasillo está excesivamente alta de manera que se oye mucho en las habitaciones. 
El desayuno buffet muy bien.
La atención del personal excelente ",3,2016,03,24
47,Non sanno che il sole riscalda la terra che gli gira attorno,"Nel continuo gioco dell'oca che è diventato viaggiare dopo la cancellazione dl volo di ritorno e circa sei ore di fila all'aeroporto di Barcellona la Ryan Air ci ha ospitato in questo albergo che si presenta molto bene. Le due notti, contrariamente a quanto ci era stato detto sono state pagate direttamente da Ryan Air mentre ci era stato detto che avrebbero provveduto solo alla prima e la seconda avremmo dovuto pagarla e poi chiedere il rimborso. Arrivati in camera, bella, pulita, sufficientemente poco rumorosa ci è sembrato di entrare in una sauna, penso la temperatura fosse prossima ai trenta gradi. Aperta la finestra e staccata l'aria condizionata uscendo per cena abbiamo chiesto se si potesse accendere il condizionamento e ci hanno risposto che l'apertura della finestra avrebbe risolto il problema, Abbiamo inoltre chiesto due altri cuscini poiché quelli presenti erano  molto lunghi ma bassissimi e poco voluminosi. Al rientro ovviamente i cuscini supplementari non c'erano e abbiamo dovuto decidere se patire il caldo o sentire il rumore della strada. Il mattino successivo abbiamo richiesto dei cuscini (ma questi hanno mai provato a dormire in quelle condizioni?) e se avessero qualche notizia circa il condizionamento dell'aria. Una gentilissima signorina mi ha spiegato che è colpa del sole che riscalda le camere e siccome non possono accendere il condizionamento d'inverno non si poteva risolvere il problema. La colazione seppur non molto varia era sufficiente e buona la pulizia i soliti problemi con i miscelatori dell'acqua che non sono mai facilmente regolabili. Incredibile come una struttura di quelle dimensioni e tutto sommato di una alta qualità cada su queste bucce di banana. con poco potrebbe essere un ottimo Hotel degno di Barcellona Consiglierei ai titolari o ai manager di passare una notte da turisti semplici e modificherebbero le sciocchezze che possono distruggere un lavoro tutto sommato buono. Al caldo e con cuscini scomodi non si riesce a dormire, un vero peccato.",2,2016,03,24
47,Super Lage; tolle Aussicht; reichhaltiges Frühstücksbüffet;,"Die Lage direkt an der U-Bahn ist top. Die Zimmer sind geräumig und sauber (allerdings störte der Chlorgeruch auf der Toilette etwas)
Das Personal ist super nett; das Frühstück für 10 Euro absolut perfekt.
Hervorzugheben ist auch die tolle Aussicht auf der Dachterrasse mit Pool und Sonnenliegen.",4,2016,03,24
47,Bene benissimo ma forse si può fare ancora meglio,"Ho soggiornato in questo Hotel per partecipare alla Maratona di Barcellona.
Gli aspetti assolutamente positivi sono la posizione dell'albergo rispetto alla mia esigenza di correre la maratona (200metri dalla partenza/arrivo)
La pulizia delle camere e la loro grandezza, mi è piaciuto molto la divisione con porta del Water e della doccia. 
I cuscini sul letto erano tanti e personalmente comodissimi.
La cortesia del personale e la loro disponibilità è un altro bell'aspetto.
La terrazza panoramica con piscina è un altro bel plus dell'albergo, bella vista e bel posto dove rilassarsi al sole
Nel complesso stando da sabato a lunedì posso assolutamente consigliare l'albergo e sicuramente lo terrò tra i primi della lista la prossima volta che tornerò a Barcellona.
perchè dico che si poteva far meglio? perché sarebbe stato bello che si stimolassero maggiormente le emozioni, con delle piccole accortezze.
Un messaggio di benvenuto personalizzato sul letto, con un in bocca al lupo per la maratona era sicuramente un plus. Come sopperire all'esigenza di avere una presa a tre spinotti, non disponibile in albergo, e mi è stato consigliato di andare al centro commerciale li vicino... ho risolto, ma sarebbe stato più emozionale che avessero risolto loro... bada bene non sono aspetti negativi, e il mio giudizio generale è assolutamente positivo... ma non mi hanno ""rapito"" il cuore, che non è un male. :)",5,2016,03,19
47,Perfecto hotel para la Fira,"Hemos estado dos días, con ocasión del #ItWorldEdu8, y nos ha parecido perfecto por todo,... Excelente ubicación, servicio amable, desayuno cómodo, wifi gratuito de calidad, precio correcto,...

Lo recomendamos y volveremos pronto",5,2016,03,08
47,Gutes zentral gelegenes Hotel in Barcelona,"Das Hotel an der viel befahrenen Plaza Espana liegt am Rande der Innenstadt (ca. 2.5 km zu den ""Rambles"", 3 km zum Hafen oder zum Castell de Montjuic). Direkt vor dem Hotel befinden sich sowohl Bus- als auch Metro-Haltestellen, so dass man schnell überall hinkommt (sobald man den Plan hat ;).
Das Hotel der **** Klasse ist gut ausgestattet (Farbfernseher, WiFi, und Föhn), die Zimmer grosszügig und nach aussen gut schallisoliert (bei offenem Fenster zu schlafen ist allerdings auch fast unmöglich) - aber teilweise mit den normalen Gebrauchspuren versehen, die nicht renoviert wurden.
Matrazen und Kopfkissen waren hervoragend, die Bettdecke aber ebenfalls typische spanisch eine nur eingeschlagene Wolldecke.

Einziger Negativpunkt: Die Klima-Anlage war (noch) nicht aktiviert, so dass es relativ warm war im Zimmer - scheinbar erfolgt die Aktivierung erst bei Aussentemperaturen über 25 Grad.
Frühstück ist typisch spanisch orientiert, aber völlig ausreichend, das Personal sehr freundlich und auf English oder Französich ansprechbar.",4,2016,03,05
47,Perfetto ,"Siamo state solo per una notte, ma la posizione dell'hotel merita una recenzione di sicuro. La Metro, l'autobus dell'aeroporto, bus tutti a pochi metri. Piazza de Espanya la sera con le fontane illuminate, il Centro commerciale Arenas offrono anche un'intrattenimento serale. Lo staff dell'hotel gentile, le camere pulite e spazi comuni molto ampi.

47,Habitación floja ,"La situación es buena, en la plaza de España, con parada de metro, bus y taxis. El desayuno buffet está bien. La atención de todo el personal es exquisita. 
Mi habitación estaba en el primer piso. Mucho ruido, no sólo de la calle, también de las habitaciones cercanas. Y no porque tuviera vecinos ruidosos. Pero es que se oyen los ronquidos, ruido de baños, etc, de forma exagerada. 
La ducha tienes que tener suerte para que salga, porque el grifo flojea bastante. La cortina de la ducha como el agua la roce, es tan fina, que inundas el baño.
Si tienes suerte con la habitación, porque parece que hay alguna reformada, bueno. Pero mi experiencia es muy negativa. 
Una pena, porque el personal es muy profesional, pero ante la posibilidad de que me vuelva a tocar una habitación como esta, no vuelvo. ",2,2016,01,30
47,Muy bueno y perfectamente situado,"A 10 minutos caminando de la estacion de Sants y en la puerta una estacion de metro para moverte por Barcelona, tiene una ubicacion muy buena.

La 804 en concreto es estupenda, muy amplia, un baño enorme y terraza a la piscina desde donde hay unas vistas fantasticas a la plaza. Sobre el desayuno no puedo opinar, 10€pp me parece excesivo. Personal muy agradable y simpatico, el lugar perfecto desde donde visitar Barcelona. Para repetir.",5,2016,01,25

Di fronte all'hotel la strada porta dopo qualche centinaio di metri alle bellissime fontane magiche del Montjuic. Le stanze, leggermente datate, hanno tutti i confort di un buon 4 stelle.

risolto in modo eccellente graziea due ragazzi della reception; grazie per un'ottima vacanza a Dario e Alex.Ottima posizione dell'albergo per poter visitare la città.",5,2016,01,05
47,Ottima posizione ,"La posizione è ottima. Il servizio prima colazione lascia molto a desiderare, per il resto tutto ben curato.
La piscina sul tetto una chicca.
Se la camera ha la vista sul Montjiuc potrete vedere i giochi d'acqua e di luci da una posizione privilegiata.",4,2016,01,04
47,muy bien comunicado,hotel con habitación espaciosa por lo menos la mia y eso que era una estándar con cama supletoria (401) el desayuna era muy bueno y el personal era encantador.el hotel esta muy bien comunicado según sales tienes dos líneas del metro para ir a cualquier lado y un centro comercial al lado y muchos sitios para comer algo a cualquier hora.Lo único que tengo que reprochar es que en la televisión los canales de pago en vez de ser en castellano son ingles lo que me parece lamentable por que cuando tu sales al extranjero los canales siempre son en el idioma original del país en el que estas.dos cosas mas la almohada para mi gusto es demasiado blanda y el parking del hotel vale 22 euros al dia,4,2016,01,02
47,INMEJORABLE,"Fuimos a una cena de empresa en una pedazo de sala donde se hacen eventos en el Hotel y a parte de cenar muy bien, la música y el dj estuvieron muy bien.
Y la sorpresa fue, la suite que nos dieron!! Nos dijeron que era una de las 3 nuevas que tenían y la verdad, no faltaba detalle, preciosa!!
Quedamos maravillados por todo el conjunto, sin duda recordaremos la experiencia siempre!! Totalmente recomendable!",5,2015,12,30
47,Gran Hotel,"Acudimos a él con motivo de un concierto, y la verdad que todo estuvo perfecto. Habitación enorme, cama extremadamente confortable, atención a la altura. Lo recomiendo, sin duda, además de estar situado en un lugar estratégico.",4,2015,12,29
47,Buen Hotel,"Buen Hotel Merecidas las 4 estrellas

inmejorable ubicacion sobre plaza epaña
Vista incrible desde la terraza
15 minutos del aeropuerto todos los medios de transporte en la puerta
LImpio 
Un estaurant japones y otro de comida mediterranea
Desayuno Muy completo",4,2015,12,24
47,Bello e centrale!,"Sono stato al Catalonia Plaza per una Convention di lavoro e devo dire che il soggiorno é stato sicuramente confortevole. La camera dava sul centro commerciale a forma di Plaza de Toros, che la sera é illuminatissimo.
Poi con pochi metri di cammino si arriva alla Fontana Magica, sempre spettacolare.
L' hotel é funzionale, proprio in centro, a pochi passi dal polo fieristico. Lo staff lavora bene ed é cordiale.
Bella la sala stile giardino all'aperto dove servono la colazione.
Sicuramente uno dei migliori di Barcellona.
",4,2015,12,22
47,maravilloso,"Ha sido una estancia maravillosa. Me regalaron una suitt. El trato y la atención excelente. El buffet muy completo y muy bien. La ubicación del hotel excelente, cerca de Monjuit y pegado al centro de ocio y comercial de las Arenas. la comunicación con el centro perfecta.",5,2015,12,20
47,Estancia,"Hemos pasado un fin de semana genial, la habitación muy espaciosa y limpia, el buffet de desayunos muy completo. Super céntrico y bien comunicado. El personal todo muy atento, amable y servicial. Una pena no poder disfrutar de la piscina en esta época, pero volveremos en verano.",5,2015,12,20
47,Hotel muy recomendable,"Habitaciones muy amplias y confortables
Limpieza excelente
Con vistas impresionantes
El personal del hotel és muy amable
Con muy buena situación
El desayuno es muy completo y variada

También es muy aconsejable el Restaurante Filigrana que se encuentra en el mismo hotel",5,2015,12,20
47,Cuidado con las fiestas,"Definitivamente, escogí unas malas fechas para alojarme en este hotel. El fin de semana del 12-13 de diciembre se celebraron varias cenas de empresa en la carpa situada en el patio interior del hotel que, lógicamente, impiden el sueño. El viernes 11 llegué muy tarde por cuestiones de vuelos, con la fiesta en plena ebullición. Entre unas cosas y otras me acosté tarde, a la 1 de la madrugada. Sin embargo, a pesar de estar en el sexto piso, era imposible dormir, pues mi habitación se encontraba pegada al patio interior. Afortunadamente, la fiesta terminó media hora después.
Al día siguiente, al confirmar que la noche del sábado habría otra cena-fiestecilla, una magnífica profesional en recepción me ofreció cambiarme de habitación, lo que afortunadamente hice. Descansé perfectamente en la otra esquina del hotel, que es muy grande. 
Las habitaciones son muy amplias y cómodas. Yo pondría algún enchufe cerca de la cama. Imposible cargar el móvil cerca.
La cena en el restaurante me pareció mala y no me informaron de que la cerveza no iba incluida dentro del servicio que ya tenía pagado. Faltó profesionalidad.
Conozco en Barcelona mil hoteles mejores.",3,2015,12,18
47,Lamentable atención ,"Pésima la recepción,  nada amables, lentos, desinformados de las condiciones que ofrece el hotel en reserva
No se cobra late Check out al reservar en web hotel, todos pretenden cobrar
Me iban a dejar un paquete,  tardaron en atender a la persona y fatal atendida 
Mucho calor en habitación,  no hay firma de poner aire. Con la ventana abierta el ruido insoportable 
La reserva incluía una botella de agua, llegué a las 11 y me la entregaron a kas 19
Decadencia en pleno para 90 euros
Nunca mas",2,2015,12,16
47,Habitaciones normales y un desayuno malisimo para 16€,"Si vas a la FIRA y no quieres desplazarte más de 30 mtrs puede ser una opción, para todo lo demás no vale. El desayuno cuesta 16€ y no hay más que un poco de fiambre (no jamón) , bolleria escasa, poca variedad y no sé si fue casualidad pero para pedir un café tuve que hacerlo varias veces.
Las habitaciones están bien, con baño grande.
El gimnasio, tiene dos bicicletas y un espacio escaso para moverte.
La ubicación para conocer Bcn no es la mejor ya que queda lejos de todo, menos de Montjuich.
La comida en los restaurantes pésima, no sé si es porque eramos 10 y pusieron un menu cualquiera pero he comido mejor en polígonos indistintamente ",2,2015,12,11
47,Muy profesional,"Estuve el pasado puente de vacaciones del 4 al 8 de diciembre con mi familia en este hotel Catalonia de la plaza de España en Barcelona y fue una experiencia muy gratificante el recibir el trato profesional del personal del hotel.Ademas las instalaciones del hotel son muy modernas y la situación inmejorable.
Gracia a la Srta Lourdes por el recibimiento y por haber pasado una estancia muy agradable.
Mis felicitaciones a Ud y todo su equipo.

47,Muy buena relación calidad precio,Bonito hotel completamente renovado. Las habitaciones son amplias y confortables. Tiene una bonita terraza chill out con piscina en la azotea. Está al lado del centro comercial Las Arenas y bien comunicado por metro con el centro de la ciudad.,5,2015,12,10
47,"Buon hotel, buona posizione","Ho soggiornato tre notti in questo hotel per motivi lavorativi. L'hotel era convenzionato con l'evento a cui ho partecipato, quindi presumo che mi sia stata assegnata una delle camere meno belle della struttura. La camera nel complesso non era male, ampia e con un grande bagno ma ce ne sono di migliori allo stesso prezzo. Nota positiva il ristorante Giapponese all'interno dell'hotel che serve pasti anche senza glutine. Alla reception mi hanno informato che anche per la colazione, di cui però non ho mai usufruito, sarebbero state presenti delle opzioni senza glutine. La posizione dell'hotel è vincente: esattamente di fronte alla fermata della metropolitana, facilmente raggiungibile dall'aeroporto sia con autobus e taxi e poco lontano dalla fiera e dal centro città.",3,2015,12,08
47,Todo perfecto,"Cuando llegamos al hotel decidimos coger una habitación superior a la que habíamos reservado, la chica de recepción nos estuvo aconsejando en todo momento. Al subir a la habitación (con vistas impresionantes de la Plaza de España) teníamos como cortesía una botella de agua y seis galletas macarons que nos supieron a gloria después del cansancio del viaje. 
Fue una parada de nuestra luna de miel y al regresar de cenar nos encontramos en la habitación una botella de cava y unos chocolates riquísimos.
El hotel está muy bien situado y justo en la puerta hay una boca de metro, además de una parada del autobús que lleva al aeropuerto.
Todo perfecto. Era la segunda vez que nos alojábamos en este hotel, y seguiremos repitiendo en cada viaje a Barcelona.
",5,2015,12,05
47,Se le cae una estrella,"Para ser un cuatro estrella le falta una pequeña reforma en las habitaciones estándares,  están anticuadas y obsoletas. Si quieres algo más paga suplemento de 15, 25, 50 €, etc. Cuarto de baño sin ducha, con bañera y con cortinilla, habitación sin minibar, al menos la mía, ahh y la calefacción no funciona, un frío en la habitación de muerte. Pero lo peor es la poca insonorización que tienen las habitaciones, te enteras de todo lo que pasa en las contiguas y en el pasillo. Y si te toca una del primer piso, cada 10 minutos que pasa el metro lo notas. Así que si vas, pide una habitación en piso alto. Para negocio esta bien, buenas salas,  comida muy básica. ",3,2015,12,01
47,Hotel y Personal y todo en general,"Hola, la estancia que estuve fue bastante buena fue una experiencia muy positiva. Las habitaciones muy bien y las vistas a la plaza muy bien. Las localizaciones están muy bien porque puedes coger ambas cosas y puedes moverte muy bien. El Personal del Hotel tanto recepción como en otras partes me han tratado bien y el desayuno muy bueno. A veces pienso de que si el personal de recepción llevara otro tipo de ropa por ejemplo mas de color no todo gris o negro estaría mejor porque mucha seriedad no da buena imagen para unas personas si y otras no. El restaurante UMO muy bueno, la próxima vez volvería a este Hotel. Pero a hora que pienso para que la gente no se queje a veces que hay mucha cola es poner lineas amarillas como tipo aeropuertos para esperar pero lo mismo enfrente del mostrador. Cada vez que entraba en el Hotel hacia una frescor a un perfume de esos tipo fragancias. Pero hubo una cosa que no me gusto es que si alguien trabaja que no tire el humo del cigarrillo a la cara. Pero no lo hago con mala intención es para que quedéis mejor y que el Hotel continue para siempre y vaya mejor todo en general cada día. Os deseo lo mejor y continuar así. Volveré mas a este Hotel cuando pueda. Saludos.",5,2015,11,30
47,Fantasía,"Servicio perfecto, habitación premium con vistas increíble. Los detalles no podían faltar como copa de bienvenida, cava y bombones en la habitación, nuestros albornoces para un spa completo y una terraza con vistas a Barcelona inmejorable, la verdad noche perfecta con colofon cenando en el umo,restaurante japonés del hotel,y claro otro detalle 10% en la cuenta, cortesía del catalonia,una vez más gracias, repetimos seguro. Solo un pequeño fallo para gente calurosa como yo, mucho calor en la habitación.",5,2015,11,28
47,Uno dei migliori ,"Ottimo hotel. Vale tutte le quattro stelle. Personale gentilissimo, avevamo una camera superior e ci siamo trovati una bottiglia di Cava in camera dopo cena offerta dalla direzione. Hotel di lusso ma con ottimo rapporto qualità/prezzo. ",5,2015,11,27
47,Cuando notas que formas parte de Barcelona,"Desde el primer momento la atención recibida a nuestra llegada por el servicio de recepción fue magnífica pues en todo momento se mostraron atentos, cordiales, educados y prestos a ofrecernos una grata estancia. El desayuno ofrecido en el Gourmet Corner (en un entorno tranquilo y con una ambientación musical más que acertada) fue exquisito, muy bien presentado, con una amplia variedad de productos de calidad y un trato digno de ser recalcado. La disponibilidad y atención con la que fuimos tratados es algo a resaltar, por cuanto hizo que nos sintiésemos como si estuviésemos en nuestra propia casa. La ubicación del Hotel es excelente. Quizás el único inconveniente que le encontré a la habitación fuese su orientación pues daba a un solar en la parte de atrás que se encontraba en plena demolición. Pese a ello la habitación estaba muy bien insonorizada. La terraza con piscina y zona chill son como un un verdadero oasis. Si por mi fuese volvería ya mismo.",5,2015,11,27
47,Excelente ,"Hotel 10! Buena ubicación , las habitaciones muy amplias y con camas muy confortables y gran atención de su personal. Además dispone de la piscina fantástica donde poder relajarte y gimnasio bastante completo.
Indicar que dispone de un gran parking",5,2015,11,25
47,Desastroso,"Mi experiencia en este hotel no es muy buena, he pasado una noche ahi, para el precio que tiene la habitación de no fumadores olía muchísimo a tabaco, la limpieza es muy escasa, el agua de los grifos salia marrón, toda la noche la calefacción a toda pastilla que no se podia quitar, mi compañero de habitación del calor se desmayó, el teléfono de recepción no funcionaba, un desastre, lo único bueno que puedo decir el Buffet. Pero vamos, no volveré.",1,2015,11,25
47,Muy mala la cama,"En recepción eras todos becarios, niños recién licenciados, no uno, sino todos. Pedí una pizza a Telepizza (que ofrecen ese servicio teóricamente en 30min) y tardó 1h. La cama muy mala, el mobiliario antiguo, se atascó el lavabo, el grifo de la ducha no podía moverlo, tenías que hacer mucha fuerza. Lo único la ubicación.",1,2015,11,24
47,Sin detalles de un 4*,"Me alojé durante dos días y la verdad es que hay algunos detalles que no me terminaron de convencer. La ducha no tenía nada de presión, eso sumado a una cortinilla difícil de manejar hizo que la ducha cada día fuera una experiencia desagradable.  El servicio de habitaciones tampoco estuvo a la altura, la habitación estaba prácticamente igual salvo la cama hecha, y por último el desayuno me parece poco variado para un 4*, otros hoteles del mismo nivel presentar bastante mejor desayuno. Eso sí localización inmejorable con una boca de metro en la misma puerta del hotel. ",3,2015,11,22
47,Renovad las camas,"El colchón es horrible, se te clavan los muelles! Y las almohadas? Duermo mucho fuera de casa pero esta vez ha sido alucinante. Llame a recepción 3 veces para que por favor alguien me subiese una almohada y no me hicieron ni caso. Ruidoso: se escucha todo tanto dentro como fuera. La Ubicación es buena. ",2,2015,11,20
47,Muy cómodo si vas a la Fira,"Hotel moderno, limpio, cómodo y con una terraza estupenda. La comida del bar está deliciosa, el servicio es bueno y está a 5 minutos caminando de la Fira. La estación de tren del AVE está a 15 minutos caminando, tiene una boca de metro en la puerta (L1) y el aerobus para en un lateral. Comunicación de diez.",5,2015,11,14
47,Soggiorno unico..,"Io e la mia ragazza abbiamo soggiornato due notti in occasione del nostro compleanno in questa fantastica struttura, albergo imponente con i suoi 12 piani, avevamo la camera 709 una junior Suite situata al 7'piano.. Abbiamo notato subito le finiture di pregio della stanza , il letto king size un valore aggiunto, bagno molto raffinato, la doccia comoda e funzionale , unica pecca il soffione grande era difettoso , ma questo non risultava un problema ; la terrazza un sogno , io e la mia ragazza l'abbiamo sfruttata per scambiarci i regali del compleanno ,sicuramente resterà nei miei ricordi ! Prezzi un po' alti, ma commisurati al valore dei servizi offerti! Consigliato ",5,2015,11,12

Los aperitivos estaban deliciosos. 
La atencion del servicio a la altura de lo que se espera de un hotel de esta categoria.
Totalmente recomendable.",5,2015,11,09
47,Ruido!!!!,"He estado esta semana en la sexta planta del hotel. Llegue sobre las 20h para una reunión al dia siguiente. Con lo que quiero decir que simplemente. Me apetecía descansar.

Nada mas acostarme noto un ruido como si estuviera el aire acondicionado puesto. Una vez comprobado el aire, el minibar, y hasta el secador de pelo me dio por abrir la ventana. Puede comprobar que daba a un patio interior en el que se veían varios motores de aire acondicionado y extracciones... Era un ruido constante con el que me costo mucho tiempo conciliar el sueño.

Por lo demás, sinceramente bien, pero este pequeño detalle arruino mis expectativas! 

Siento poner una mala puntuación pero sé que is servirá para mejorar aun mas! ",2,2015,11,06
47,Muy bueno,"Muy bueno en todos los aspectos
Habitaciones muy limpias nuevas y cuidadas.el restaurante muy bueno.
Sitio buenísimo.de el precio no puedo opinar pues los gastos los pago un proveedor.en general muy bueno
Reconozco que soy algo delicado 
Y aquí todo perfecto",5,2015,11,05
47,Muy correcto ,"Excelentemente ubicado,en plena plaza España,habitaciones reformadas y modernizadas.
Personal amable y suficiente.
Por poner una pega,no se puede ir desde las 6 primeras plantas a las seis superiores sin bajar y volver a subir,pasando por recepción y cambiando de ascensor.

47,Ausgezeichnetes Hotel in sehr zentraler Lage,"Diese Hotel kann kaum zentraler liegen und sowohl Zimmer, Personal als auch das Essen sind hervorragend.
Der Pool auf der Dachterasse gibt einen herragenden Ueberblick auf den Montjuic und das Besuchen der Poolbar in der Nacht is ein Muss.
Sehr praktisch und preislich fair ist die Hotelgarage.
Genau vor dem Hotel stop der Flughafenbus so dass man eigentlich kein Taxi braucht.
Hier uebernachte ich immer gerne wieder (wenn es ein grosses Hotel sein soll). Vielen Dank",5,2015,10,24
47,Excelente,"Impecable Hotel. Excelente ubicación. Un placer. En Plaza España, con una vista increíble desde la habitación que incluye las Torres Romanas, la Fuente de la Plaza, las Fuentes Mágicas, la Arena de Barcelona (ex plaza de toros hoy Shopping y Restaurantes) etc. El Metro en la puerta. El Bus Turístico para cruzando la calle. El desayuno bien, tiene de todo. El trato y la atención excelentes. Volveremos",5,2015,10,23

Amplias habitaciones para ir en familia, las vistas son impresionantes.
Repetiremos seguro :)",5,2015,10,22
47,Ottima posizione,"Ho alloggiato in questo hotel per una settimana e mi sono trovato bene. Personale disponibile, ottima posizione. Metropolitana vicinissima, talmente vicina che si sente addirittura tremare un po' la parete quando passa il treno. All'inizio fa un po' rabbrividire ma poi ci si fa l'abitudine. Camera pulita, colazione abbondante anche se sembra sempre che abbiano fretta di liberare il tavolo. Appena funisci qualcosa ti tolgono subito il piatto.",4,2015,10,18
47,Dettagli da migliorare,"Le stanze sono moderne e spaziose ma andrebbe controllata meglio la cura del bagno, tra i sanitari e la pulizia. Posizione molto buona, con 
due linee metropolitane e tutta la zona turistica di Plaza España.
Colazione a buffet, buona.
Bella la terrazza con piscina e vista panoramica.

",3,2015,10,10
47,Hotel comodo en excelente ubicación . Muy recomendable,"Es un hotel grande , ubicado en plana Plaza españa , con excelentes conexiones de transporte. Metro y buses en la puerta , También el autobús de lleva al aeropuerto . Habitaciones normales. Las vistas desde la terraza magníficas. Solo de negativo que durante el desayuno funcionan solo tres maquinas de cafe para un solo pocillo , lo cual es insuficiente para la cantidad de huespedes.",4,2015,10,06
47,QUANDO POSSO TORNARCI ? ? ?,"Posizione : perfetta (metro davanti all'hotel, stazione treni a 10 muniti a piedi)
Vista : su Montjuic e sulle fontane illuminate di sera 
Servizi : eccellenti

Stanze : molto belle
Cibo : vario e internazionale

47,De lo bueno ... lo mejor,"Excelente hotel ... magníficas vistas ... inmejorable ubicación ... trato exquisito ... Gran buffet en desayuno y para el almuerzo el restaurante Filigrana ... insuperable
La piscina del ático es perfecta ... relax total .... habitaciones cómodas y modernas y lo mejor es la relación calidad - precio ... el mejor sitio para hospedarse en Barcelona",5,2015,09,26
47,Lässiges Stadthotel mit coolem Rooftop Pool,"Das Hotel ist sehr geräumig, lässig auch schon der Empfangsbereich. Die Zimmer selbst in der einfachen Kategorie sehr groß und funktional eingerichtet, und auch ok her vom Design. Natürlich gibt es cooler designte Juniorsuiten und Komfortzimmer. Die von uns gebuchten zwei Dreibettzimmer, wir sind nun mal zu sechst,  gibt es aber nur in der ""schlichteren"" Variante. Bestechend der Rooftop Pool mit der coolen Bar. Hier kann man chillig nach Shopping und Sightseeing abhängen, vor allem die Kids waren begeistert. Super! (Hat mir letztendlich wesentlich besser als der Rooftop Poolaus im SohoHouse Berlin gefallen. Das hauseigene Restaurant Filigrana war überraschender Weise der Hammer! Einziges Manko: Das Personal im Hotel war mit einigen Ausnahmen etwas ""lahm"" und nicht gerade überaus freundlich. Aber wir würden hier mit der ganzen Familie wieder wohnen wollen.",4,2015,09,23
47,Ottimo 4 stelle,"Centralissimo.  Camere grandi, molto comode.   Doccia enorme.  Letto comodissimo.  Le stanze hanno il parquet, e questo da alla stanza un' aria molto più pulita che non quelle con la solita moquette.  Personale gentilissimo ed efficiente.  Un po' scomodo l' armadio perché non esistono cassetti in cui riporre le cose.",5,2015,09,16
47,"Buen hotel, pero muy masificado","Las vistas desde la habitación son muy buenas. 
La ubicación es estupenda junto al Centro Comercial Arenas, y al lado de una parada del Aerobús. 
La habitación es confortable. 

El Check-in fue lentísimo, estuve media hora haciendo cola. Sólo se puede hacer check-in desde las 14:00, por lo tanto a esa hora se acumula mucha gente, y tienen poco personal en recepción.

La piscina es pequeña en relación al número de habitaciones del  hotel, pero tiene unas vistas fantásticas.",4,2015,09,13
47,Buen hotel,"Buen hotel y muy bien situado, frente a fira de Barcelona, con unas vistas impresionantes al Palacio Nacional y la fuente mágica de Montjuic.  Metro lineas 1 y 3 a la puerta del Hotel.  Bus (Aerobús) para ir al Aeropuerto (todas las terminales) para en frente del hotel. Estación de Sants (AVE), a 600 metros  (a 2 paradas de metro Linea 3 -verde).  Plaza de Cataluña/Ramblas, igualmente lineas 1 y 3 justo en frente del hotel.  Habitaciones correctas (aunque ya necesitarian una pequeña remodelación). Baño correcto y muy buen servicio en recepción.  Centro comercial ""Las Arenas"" justo en frente.  Hotel muy recomendable por situación, y buen servicio.",4,2015,09,10
47,Hotel ottimo in posizione meravigliosa!,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel per 4 notti dal 29/8 al 2/9 scorso.
Posizione unica con camera vista città (Piazza de Espana e Montijuc con le fontane magiche). Insonorizzazione ottima e bagno ampio e funzionale. Personale molto gentile e disponibile con la possibilità di lasciare in deposito il bagaglio anche per tutta la giornata della partenza (avevamo il volo alle 22). La sala colazione è forse un po' dispersiva e rumorosa, in particolare quando si ha a che fare con gruppi numerosi. Consigliatissimo relativamente alla comodità dei mezzi di trasporto: proprio davanti l'hotel  c'è la Metro, la fermata dei bus, compreso l'Aerobus per l'aeroporto e i taxi.....cosa chiedere di più? Abbiamo girato in lungo e in largo la splendida Barcellona. Ci torneremmo volentieri!",5,2015,09,07
47,Fantastico è dir poco,"Sono stato in gita in questo hotel la bellezza di 7 anni fa, ma lo ricordo come fosse ieri, un hotel bellissimo pieno di servizi con piscina all ultimo piano, in cui, anche se era marzo, ci siamo fatti il bagno. Le camere sono davvero grandissime, per non parlare del letto in cui ci si poteva dormire anche in 3/4, ma la cosa più affascinante è la vista che si ha dalla grande finestra presente nella stanza in cui si può vedere in tutta bellezza la fontana di Plaza d Espana. Bellissimo.",5,2015,08,27
47,Muy correcto,"De vacaciones en familia en Barcelona buscaba un hotel en el cual sintiéremos la ciudad en la que estamos, por lo que este hotel cumplía las expectativas con creces por sus instalaciones, ubicación y vistas exteriores, magnífico desayuno deluxe.

También destacar el ático con piscina para descansar y tomar algo se ve muy chulo por la noche con la iluminación.",5,2015,08,27
47,"Toller Blick, schöner Pool, gute Lage","Am lebhaften Plaza Espanya verkehrsgünstig (Flughafenbus hält direkt cor der Tür, ca 25 Min Fahrtzeit, 5,90€ einfache Fahrt) gelegen hat man einen tollen Blick auf dem Montjuic mit MNAC und Fons Magica. Der Pool ist der Hammer, auch abends mit beleuchteter Bar. Aber die 6 ""Himmelbetten"" auf dem Dach sind natürlich bei gutem Wetter schnell belegt, die Liegen voll. nix für Langschläfer.Das normale Zimmer liegt nach innen oder zur Stadt hin; es lohnt sich aber, 30,-€ pro Zimmer für ein Update für ein Superior Zimmer zum Platz hin pro Nacht auszugeben. diese Zimmer sind zwar nicht ganz schalldicht, aber doch ruhig genug. verhandeln ist übrigens zwecklos: die Preise für upgrades ( etwa auf ein Zimmer mit Balkon) sind festgelegt.
das Hotel liegt nicht am Strand; es fahren Busse und U-Bahn zwar in alle Richtungen. zum Strand sind es dennoch günstigstenfalls 20-30 Minuten. 
Zimmer (superior) war sehr ordentlich, die gesamte 7. Etage vor nicht allzu langer Zeit renoviert. personal freundlich, allerdings nicht deutschsprachig (Französisch, Englisch) und hilfsbereit ( aber wir hatten auch keine Probleme). frühstück gut und reichhaltig in einem sehr grossen, teils etwas kalten ""Saal"" in Zeltform, der bei starker Belegung sehr hallt und laut ist. Leider keine eigene Bar ( ausser auf dem Dach: die ist gut, aber teuer), und die Lobby lädt nicht zum Verweilen ein. in-Viertel ( wie z.B. san Antonii) fussläufig erreichbear, Einkaufszentrum (Arena) direkt nebenan.
fazit: Jederzeit wieder, super, um auf Entdeckungstour zu gehen. Für reinen Strandurlaub nicht geeignet. Messe direkt gegenüber.",4,2015,08,26
47,"Gran hotel, gran ubicación",Casi todas las ocasiones que hemos estado por Barcelona que en la mayoria de las veces ha sido en verano nos hemos alojado en este hotel. Su ubicación en plena Plaza de España ya lo hace muy interesante. Cercano a todo y bien comunicado. En la terraza que hay en el primer piso se halla la piscina descubierta con unas esplendidas vistas de Montjuic. Dispone de aparcamiento privado a un precio muy razonable. Las habitaciones son elegantes y tienen un buen tamaño. Las suites son enormes y tambien tienen unas vistas maravillosas.,5,2015,08,23
47,Excepcional,"El segundo de mi viaje a España visite este hotel, me gusto mucho, buen ambiente, muchas atenciones del personal completo. Buena comida, limpio. Lo que mas me gusto fue el ambiente que ofrecen por  las noche,  para que el cliente no se aburra. Ofrece un concierto  de un pianista, que le da un toque romántico. Las habitaciones excelentes.  En el centro de la ciudad, cerca de todo.  De una puntuación de 10 yo le daría un 12. Si vuelvo a Barcelona volvería a este hotel.   
",5,2015,08,18
47,fantastico,"Abbiamo soggiornato 4 giorni in questo bellissimo hotel, soprattutto la sera dalla ns. camera c'era una bellissima veduta. Camere grandi e confortevoli bellissimo il bagno. In terrazza c'è una piscina, non troppo grande ma è suggestivo fare il bagno...
Subito fuori dall'hotel c'è la fermata della metro.
Noi abbiamo solo fatto colazione, ma che colazione...fantastico sfornavano le briosche davanti ai nostri occhi!!!",5,2015,08,18
47,NUEVA TERRAZA,"Espectacular remodelación de la terraza piscina. Ideal para tomar un refresco disfrutando de las vistas espectaculares y la buena música. había estado otras veces y veía que era un espacio desaprovechado.
Todo un acierto.
La recepción del hotel si que necesita una reforma para actualizar la imagen.",5,2015,08,14
47,Mejor imposible!!!,"La estancia ha sido maravillosa.  La ubicación es excelente, así como las  vistas, el hotel precioso, las habitaciones con todos los detalles, la terraza y la piscina únicas,  un desayuno  con una gran variedad, pero lo mejor del hotel, el trato recibido por parte de todo el personal, desde la entrada hasta el último momento, y los pequeños detalles que encuentras, que hacen de la estancia un lujo. Sin duda, si vuelvo a Barcelona repetiré y lo recomendaré como uno de los mejores en los que me he alojado.",5,2015,08,11
47,Excelencia en Hoteles!!!!!!!!,"Desde la atención en el momento cero de ingreso hasta dejar la estadía en el hotel 100 puntos !!!!!!!Imposible no recordarlo ,bellísimo ,cómodo ,placentero,infinidad de calificativos ,la vista frente a la fuente de aguas danzantes ,maravilloso .",5,2015,08,08
47,Grande Catalonia,"Posizione meravigliosa, staff gentilissimo, panorama dalla piscina spettacolare.
Siamo stati accolti con un aperitivo, aiutati per il parking e per la colazione.
Molta simpatia ed attenzione.
Stanza purtroppo che da all'interno ma sufficientemente spaziosa, molto gradevole.
Da migliorare il bagno (doccia e vasca meriterebbero una sostituzione) e fastidioso rumore dell'impianto di aereazione.
Ottima la colazione.
Siamo stati benissimo

47,Magnifico,"Ottima posizione, su Piazza di Spagna con la vista della Fuente Magica, di sera e' uno spettacolo, e cosa stupenda sulla fermata del metro, che a Barcellona ti permette di girarla tutta senza difficoltà.
Ottima colazione ,pulito, moderno, e va bene anche per famiglie con bimbi.",4,2015,08,05
47,Excelente Terraza,"Debes subir al piso 8 si o si para ver la excelente vista desde la terraza, al lado de la piscina, excelente ubicación, atención y desayuno. Absolutamente recomendable y lo más importante todos los huespedes son iguales, los que van en tour y los que no.",5,2015,07,30
47,Tranquillo,"Un hotel perfetto per la visita alla citta
Posizione ideale con la stazione della metro all"" ingresso
Colazione varia e abbondante
Camere pulite e ben arredate , tv con canali italiani
Bellissima la piscina all ' 8 piano",5,2015,07,25
47,Perfekter Service,"Naben der hervorragenden Lage an der Plaza Espana hat uns besonders der Service beeindruckt: Sachkundig, hilfsbereit und liebenswürdig, sowohl an der Rezeption (Cristina!) als auch beim Housekeeping. Und dann das Zimmer mit eigener kleiner Terrasse und Blick über die Dächer und zum Nationalmuseum! Sensationell!",5,2015,07,20
47,Perfecta ubicación.,"La experiencia en el hotel fue absolutamente positiva, por su ubicación, servicio y lo mejor que vi fue la terraza, desde donde se puede disfrutar de unas vistas de Barcelona increíbles. 
El desayuno de los mejores que he visto, a nivel de hoteles de categoría superior. 
La sala de fitness es bastante completa.",5,2015,07,19
47,Inolvidable,"Hemos estado ya varias veces y en distintos tipos de habitación, el trato es increíble y las vistas alucinantes, podría quedarme embobada viendo las luces de montjuic y su maravillosa fuente. Además si da la casualidad que pillas luna llena, el éxito esta asegurado 😍",5,2015,07,18
47,Terraza espectacular,"Increíbles vistas, ambiente acogedor, atención personalizada y con suerte, podéis ver el espectáculo de luces de la fuente de Montjuic.
Se puede picar algo, y también japones de su restaurante y tienen una carta de cócteles fantástica.",5,2015,07,15
47,Ya he repetido y repetiré,"Al regresar de Calella, como mis hijos estudian en Barcelona, yo me alojé unos dias en este hotel para darme ese capricho pues ya era la tercera vez, y no me ha defrauado salvo que en la zona de piscina, spa...estaban de obras y no podía utilizarla lo que si me fastdió un poco pero bueno en algún momento deben realizar las mejoras ¿verdad?.
El desatuno es fantástico y es mejor elegir una salita pequeña que han habilitado que el gran espacio comedor que resulta muy frio e impersonal.
Donde yo acudía te tratan ""en persona"" y te traen todo lo que solicites aunque a simple vista no aparezca entre lo que se ofrece.

La habitación maravillosa y aunque esta vez no estaba en el frente, se hallaba justo en el corner con lo cual las vistas seguían siendo impresionantes, lástima que no pude alargar mi estancia para ver el espéctaculo de la fuentes iluminadas, ainsss",5,2015,07,12
47,Excelente piscina del hotel.,"La zona de la piscina es espectacular. Vistas 360 grados a Barcelona. El agua en perfecto estado, zona con hamacas, con sillones super-confortables y también camas tipo chill-out para poder estar estirado con tu pareja … todo perfecto. Además puedes disfrutar de comida hecha en barbacoa por el personal del restaurante Filigrana que también es una maravilla.
Totalmente recomendable!!",5,2015,07,07
47,"Gran hotel,localización inmejorable,piscina increíble con las mejores vistas.","Se va modernizando pero el único fallo para mí la cama y el spa. Subimos pensando en un spa y sólo había cuartos con camillas para masajes una ducha de sensaciones y una mini sauna. Desayuno con fruta, huevos fritos, panes diferentes... Lo típico. Otra pega que para entrar a la habitación es a las 14 pero te guardan la maleta sin ningún problema. Lo demás todo excelente y cerquísima de la estación.",4,2015,07,06
47,Muy bueno,"La verdad es que el hotel está muy bien, un poco alto el aire acondicionado en las zonas comunes, cosa que puede llegar a resultar desagradable. La habitación con grandes vistas a la plaza de España pero con una pega, no hay enchufes en las mesillas, lo comenté con la gente que iba conmigo y todos estaban de acuerdo en que eso era bastante incómodo. El desayuno genial, mucha variedad y se agradece mucho que tengan leche de soja.",4,2015,07,05
47,Decepcionante,"Reserve en este hotel convencido de que el alto precio fuera consecuente con una alta calidad, ERROR!. 
Las habitaciones son pequeñas y los baños necesitan reforma. contraté el desayuno y este fue una decepción aún mayor. la calidad baja, las dos cafeteras que funcionaban eran lentísimas, al igual que el tostador del pan. Me recogieron la mesa sin haber terminado, con el desayuno que tenía preparado.
El punto más positivo es la piscina de la azotea, tanto de día para un baño como por la noche para una copa.
No volveré.",2,2015,06,26
47,Posizione favolosa!,"In placa d'espanya, quindi in una zona meravigliosa con un sacco di vita anche alla sera; a due passi dal  hotel c'è la metro che ti ricollega a tutta la città è questo è un 5/5. La Camera pulitissima e confortevole 5/5. Colazione meravigliosa, perché oltre al solito buffet c'era la cuoca che ti preparava sul momento le omelette e i pancake ed erano da volta via 5/5 assolutamente!",5,2015,06,18
47,Perfetta struttura in una meravigliosa città!,"Ok, inizio subito avvisando che il mio è stato un soggiorno lampo, dove ho dovuto vedere il più possibile in poco più di 24 ore! Ma potersi rilassare in questa comoda e pulita camera, con vista direttamente sulla placa de espana, con staff cordialissimo è semplicemente fantastica piscina al 7imo piano con tanto di vista mozzafiato..ha sicuramente aiutato!
Nulla da dire di cattivo, camere pulite, staff cordiale e disponibile (batterie scarica del lettore della card x entrare in camera, in meno di 10 minuti è arrivato l'addetto a sistemare il problema), una visuale bellissima, acqua e dolcetti di benvenuto e disponibilità e chiarezza di informazione!
Barcellona mi è entrata nel cuore, tornerò sicuramente per un soggiorno più lungo...ed alloggerò sicuramente in questo bellissimo hotel!",5,2015,06,16
47,¡No regresaría!,"Se demoraron más de dos horas para alistar la habitación. Cuando al fin pudimos subir, faltaba la cama adicional. Al traer la cama un empleado grosero me dijo que podía traer dos, tres, cuatro, cinco o seis camas adicionales, las que yo quisiera. ¿Es esto lógico? No es falta de cortesía, es sencillamente una grosería. Y falta comentar que la cama adicional era una verdadera vergüenza, un catre de tercera categoría que no está a la altura de lo que pensábamos era este hotel. Había escuchado muchos comentarios buenos de los hoteles Catalonia en el Caribe, pero al parecer el estándar español está muy por debajo.",2,2015,06,12
47,Schönes Hotel,"Sehr schönes Hotel direkt an der Placa Espana gelegen 3 Metrostationen vom Zentrum entfernt. Arenas Einkaufszentrum ist direkt gegenüber. Gratis Wifi, schön saubere zimmer, sehr gutes Frühstücksbuffet, schöner Pool auf dem Dach und nettes Personal, alles in allem kann ich das Hotel weiterempfehlen. ",5,2015,06,11
47,"Gute Lage, schlechter Service, katastrophales Troubleshooting...","Mit unserer Aviation Crew sind wir sehr viel in Hotels unterwegs. Es gibt Bessere und Schlechtere...DIESES Hotel gehört definitiv zur zweiten Sorte...zumindest, was den Service betrifft. Bei Ankunft wurden wir mal als Erstes ohne Absprache in Raucherzimmer einquartiert. Zähneknirschend haben wir das noch hingenommen. Nachdem wir unsere Sachen im Zimmer versorgt haben, gingen wir dann in den obersten Stock zum Pool. Der ist ganz nett, wennauch die Bar recht lieblos eingerichtet ist. Danach gingen wir noch in die Stadt, um etwas zu essen. Bei der Rückkehr fing das Desaster dann an. Wir gingen auf unsere Zimmer da kamen uns im Stock schon gröhlende Leute entgegen. Laut dröhnende Musik und ziemlicher Lärm zeugten von einer Party, die wohl voll im Gang war. Ungefähr 10-15 Leute feierten genau ein Zimmer neben uns ungeniert ein gutes Fest. Da wir am morgen um 0600 wieder auf mussten und als Crew der Schlaf vor dem Flug sehr wichtig ist, ging ich um 00:00Uhr zur Rezeption, um auf diese Sache aufmerksam zu machen. Die erste Antwort der Dame dort war, das sei eine Privatparty und vielleicht würden sie ja in 15 Minuten aufhören. Obwohl diese Antwort meine Halsschlagader aprupt anschwellen ließ, und mir kurzfristig alle Gesichtszüge entgleisten, versuchte ich ruhig zu bleiben, und das als kleinen Scherz zur Auflockerung der heiteren Runde abzustempeln. Sie meinte dann aber weiter, sie könne jetzt nix machen. Auch andere Zimmer seien keine Option, da es keine mehr gäbe. Komischerweise schaffte sie es dann, nachdem ich doch einmal in einen höheren Gang geschaltet habe, uns 3 Zimmer im vierten Stock (Nichtraucher *juhu*) zu organisieren. Während die Party im Nebenzimmer fröhlich weiter ging, durften wir um 00:30Uhr unsere Koffer packen, und umziehen. Das Zimmer war nicht unbedingt sauber, aber akzeptabel. Beim Check Out am nächsten Morgen ließ ich meinem Unmut noch einmal freien Lauf. Der Rezeptionist meinte, er könne nix machen, sondern nur der Manager. Ich habe ihm meine Mail Adresse hinterlassen, damit dieser sich bei mir melden kann. Dies ist natürlich bis heute noch nicht passiert. Ich denke nicht, dass wir dieses Hotel nocheinmal buchen. Für mich definitiv NICHT zu empfehlen!",1,2015,06,08
47,"Solides, sauberes Hotel","Zimmer sind sehr sauber und ausreichend groß; super Lage; sehr freundliches Personal; Frühstück ist reichhaltig.
Allerdings könnten Manche den Straßenlärm als störend empfinden ( ich fande es nicht so schlimm)
Alles in allem auf jeden Fall zu empfehlen! ",5,2015,06,08
47,Encantador trato!!!!!!!,"Lo elegimos, dada su próxima localización al recinto de un concierto y ha sido un absoluto acierto. Amabilísimo personal -mención especial a Mateu, todo un crack en Recepción-, habitacion amplia y limpísima, cama comodisima y buen desayuno con materia prima de calidad. Para colmo, agradable piscina con una barra que cierra a las 2 h y un restaurante japonés, realmente fantástico. VOLVEREMOS.",5,2015,05,31

Añadir, que cuando entramos en la habitación teníamos los albornoces y zapatillas sobre la cama y en una mesa: copas, agua y unos bombones!!
Mis hijos todavía se acuerdan de ese detalle!!
La ciudad preciosa y la gente de Barcelona ........... encantadora!!!",5,2015,05,22

47,Altamente recomendable.,"Estuve en la realización de un evento tecnológico el la que tuve la suerte de poder asistir en este hotel como ponente y la atención fue realmente excelente, unas vistas desde la piscina del hotel increíbles y la comida muy bien cocinada. La sala dónde se realizó el evento disponía de todos los elementos necesarios, buena cobertura Wifi y excelente cobertura 4G en todas las zonas del Hotel. Agradecer a la subdirectora del mismo, su inestimable ayuda y expresarle mi agradecimiento. Un buen hotel para volver, tranquilo con una muy buena organización.",5,2015,05,19
47,Hotel excelente!,"He estado alojado en este hotel varias veces, a veces de paso y otras simplemente por disfrute. Servicio muy correcto y bueno. Personal de limpieza genial, las habitaciones cómodas y con buenas vistas. Dentro del mismo hotel podéis encontrar dos restaurantes uno creo recordar que es japonés y el otro de alta cocina. He probado el de alta cocina llamado FILGRANA tienen precios elevados pero los productos son de primera calidad su servicio excelente, para ir en pareja fenomenal. Tienen una carta de buenos vinos. Justo al lado del hotel hay el centro comercial las arenas podéis encontrar supermercados y en su cumbre restaurantes muy buenos a precios muy razonables. No olvidéis de pasaros por las fuentes de Monjuïc justo enfrente del hotel.",4,2015,05,16
47,Practico,El hotel esta bastante bien la ubicacion es excelente tienes todo a la mano las habitaciones estan bien asi q recomendable para viaje rapido como en nuestro caso q estamos  solo por una noche tienes la plaza españa en frente centro comercial a menos de 50 mts repito recomendable,4,2015,05,14
47,Ottimo,"Posizione vicina  alla rambla ma anche al mare, personale molto gentile, stanza bellissima con bagno molto grande ,pulizie giornaliere in tarda mattinata o primo pomeriggio,   palestra gratuita  e piccola piscina in una corte riparata dal vento per quando non puoi  andare al mare!",5,2015,05,10
47,El hotel perfecto,"Las instalaciones son maravillosas, esta perfectamente ubicado, en plena plaza de españa. Puedes llegar caminando a un sin número de sitios turísticos. Queda justo al frente de la estación del metro.
Hay restaurantes cercanos muy buenos, y queda justo al lado de centro de comercial
Las habitaciones tiene una vista realmente hermosa, son amplias, cómodas y muy limpias. El precio es muy bueno.
Definitivamente volveré.",5,2015,05,09
47,Gutes Hotel nahe der öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel,"Check-In sehr langwierig und kompliziert, Zimmer war auch auch um 16.00 Uhr noch nicht bereit. Hotel befindet sich unmittelbar am Plaza Espania, Metro und Busse sowie Station des Aerobus in unmittelbarer Nähe, Zimmer im 5. Stock relativ ringhörig aber sehr sauber. WLAN ist gratis und genügend schnell.",3,2015,05,07
47,Super Hotel direkt neben UBahn Station,Super Hotel mit toller zentraler Lage (direkt neben UBahn Station) im Zentrum von Barcelona. Zimmer ausrechend groß. Frühstücksbuffet sehr großzügig. WLan funktioniert im ganzen Hotel super. Dachterasse und Dachpool mit super Ausblick über den Plaza. Nebenan befindet sich ein Einkaufscenter in der alten Stierkampfarena.,4,2015,05,06
47,Ist runtergekommen und hält nicht was es verspricht,"Ich hatte eine Junior Suite für 5 Tage gebucht, die Grösseingabe der Zimmer stimmt nicht. Das Zimmer hat einen Ausblick auf den Hinterhof und gegenüber kampieren Hausbesetzer. Die Klimaanlage mir der man angeblich heißen könnte, konnte neuer kühlen. So war es abends sehr frisch im Zimmer. Am nächsten Tag sollte ich für einen Aufschlag von 30€ eine Suite bekommen. Deine Suite 801 ist ein großer fensterloser Flur, ein Badezimmer mit einem Milchglasfenster nach draußen zum Swimmingpooleck. Dieses Badezimmer stinkt fürchterlich nach Kanalisierung. Der ahndender gab an, man habe diese Suite durch späteres Umbau ausgebaut, man hat 2 Zimmer zusammengelegt. Der Kanalgeruch war auch im Schlafzimmer. Das Fenster aus dem Schlafzimmer ermöglichte den Blick auf eine gekachelte Hauswand- hätte man auf der Miniterasse geschlafen -  wäre ein Blick in die Stadtlandschaft möglich gewesen. Wenn man sich beschweren will an der Rezeption, dann gibt es keinen Abteilungsleiter. am 2. Tag sagte man uns zu, dass wir am 3. Tag eine Suite im 11. Stock haben könnten. Am 3. Tag wurde uns dann morgens mitgeteilt, es sei dann doch kein Suite frei, wir sind dann wieder in die junior Suite umgezogen mit Blickkontakt zu den Hausbesetzern. Das Haus ist schlecht geführt.",2,2015,05,05
47,Apuesta Segura,"Este es un hotel, que utilizo en mis desplazamientos a Barcelona, por estar ubicado en un lugar de facil comunicacion.
Me gusta la comodidad de sus habitaciones, amplias y con camas comodas y un gran baño. Los apartamentos de la torre som de unas dimensiones espectaculares y con unas inmejorables vistas.",4,2015,04,28
47,Ottimo,"Siamo stati molto bene . Grande hotel , gentili. Ottima colazione in sala riservata. Ottimo caffè espresso , il che non è poco. Abbiamo preso una camera con vista e ne valeva la pena . Unico piccolo neo il rumore, niente di che ma potrebbe migliorare,  della ventilazione dell'aria condizionata , comunque efficiente .
Posizione super strategica",5,2015,04,27
47,"Buena situación, requiere de algunos cambios.","Hotel funcional, con una situación estupenda, en la Plaza de España. Habitaciones grandes. La bañera necesita un cambio, todavía con cortinilla. Las zonas comunes muy amplias. Me llamó la atención el desayuno, 16 €. Un abuso. Muy vulgar para ese precio, no tenía nada de extraordinario. Si vuelvo no lo cogería.",3,2015,04,24
47,Funktionell aber keine Schönheit,"Die Lage ist perfekt an der Plaza Espana nahe der Metro und am Flughafenbus. Das Hotel selbst ist ordentlich aber altmodisch. Kein besonderer Stil, etwas abgewohnt, etwas laut durch hallende Böden. Es ist ordentlich gepflegt, das Personal sehr freundlich. Der Speisesaal hat den Charme eines Notunterkunftzeltes, die Qualität des Essens ist ok. 
Zusammenfassend: ein Ahaerlebnis ist es nicht.

",3,2015,04,17
47,VISTAS ESPECTACULARES,Hotel con unicación perfecta. Bien comunicado. En la reserva vale la pena solicitar habitación con vistas a Plaza España. Hay que destacar la amabilidad de recepción. Perfecto estado de limpieza y mantenimiento de las habitaciones. Armarios amplios en habitación. Dispone de parquing.,5,2015,04,14
47,Hotel recomendable para todo,"Me he hospedado en este hotel desde el día 11 al 13 de este mes de abril. Hotel Muy bien ubicado, a 6 minutos con metro del centro de la ciudad. El personal que me atendió en recepción Olga y Linda, muy profesionales y agradables. Desayuno muy aceptable con fruta fresca y jugos naturales. Habitación espaciosa con una bonita vista a las fuentes de Monjuith. Tranquilidad y sosiego estos dos días. El Restaurante  Filigrana donde cene, en el mismo hotel, como reza su nombre es una filigrana. Exquisita presentación, buena calidad y precio justo. Acompañado de una música ambiental perfecta y atendido maravillosamente por Emilia Y Amandine . Muchas gracias a todos. Nos volveremos a ver.

Disponibile il personale.

47,Gran experiencia!,He tenido una experiencia muy agradable en el Barcelona Plaza Hotel. Cuando llegamos había un pianista en el hall tocando en directo. Pasamos la noche en una cama comodísima y nos levantamos con una vista estupenda sobre la plaza España y Montjuich. Además pudimos tener a nuestra perrita en la habitación cosa que no dejan en todos los hoteles. Cenamos unos platos exquisitos en el restaurante Filigrana que tienen abajo y el bufet del desayuno muy completo. :),5,2015,03,25
47,"A mano de todo, personal atento","Viajamos a Barcelona para el concierto de Sabina y reservamos el hotel por comodidad, solo queríamos tener un sitio para dormir y encontramos una buena oferta. Nada mejor que ir sin expectativas para que te sorprendan... Personal amable y atento, ni una sola pregunta que hicimos quedó sin respuesta, con paciencia y con sonrisas. Además, las instalaciones geniales, habitación limpia y estancia confortable. Muy recomendable el restaurante japonés! todo delicioso y más sonrisas!",5,2015,03,24
47,Maravillosa Suite del Reloj,"Mi familia me regaló pasar la noche de mi 60 cumpleaños en la recién inaugurada y reformada Suite del Reloj. El trato fue excepcional y el personal estuvo muy atento, ya que sabían que estaba celebrando una fecha muy especial junto a mi marido. La habitación es espectacular y las vistas sobre Plaza España inmejorables. Realmente la experiencia fue increíble.",5,2015,03,22
47,"Falta de respeto a clientes alojados. Fiesta hasta 2 de la mañana 8 de marzo, sin descansar a pesar repetidas quejas","Fiesta en salas con música y ruido intenso que no permiten descanso en habitaciones. Además expresamente solicité habitación tranquila. Desde recepción indicando de manera engañosa que la fiesta estaba a punto de terminar, así durante 2 horas.",2,2015,03,21
47,Total,"Es la mejor opcion de hotel para una visita rapida a Barcelona. El sitio es perfecto, metro a la misma puerta, autobus turistico y Aerobus. La zona es muy bonita, lleno de tiendas y restaurantes. La habitacion grande, cama comodisima, baño con bañera. Las vistas a Monjuic impresionantes! Lo recomiendo a todos!",5,2015,03,17
47,Muy recomendable,"Es un gran hotel. Estuve por trabajo y me aloje en este hotel durante tres días. La ubicación es excelente, el servicio super amable y bien predispuesto. Muy rico el desayuno. Las habitaciones son grandes y cómodas. Todo a favor. Queda en frente de Plaza España, con rápido acceso a todos los medios de transporte. Muy recomendable.",5,2015,03,14
47,Increíble la suite del hotel,"Nos alojamos mi esposo y yo para pasar nuestra noche de bodas y reservamos una suite que era enorme. Al entrar en la habitación no nos esperábamos que hubiera cava y agua como regalo del hotel. Todo estaba muy limpio, ordenado. 
La cama de la habitacion era inmensa, teníamos una tv muy grande en la habitación y otra en la salita en la que había una gran mesa con muchas sillas. También sofás y sillones. Contaba con dos baños, uno con un vater y otro con vater, ducha y bañera también grande con bonitas vistas. 
Lo recomiendo totalmente y en cuanto pueda, volveré.",5,2015,03,12
47,Excelente servicio,"Estuve alojada el fin de semana pasado con mi pareja. Un hotel excelente, todo el personal muy profesional, correcto y amable. Mi habitación tenia unas estupendas vistas de plaza España y Montjuïc y la cama era comodísima.  Me encantaron las zonas comunes y el desayuno. La localización del hotel es comodísima y la parada del metro está en la puerta del hotel. Volveré seguro!",5,2015,03,09
47,Fantástico hotel,"Estuve alojado durante tres días en este hotel ya que mi empresa hizo una convención allí y realmente me ha encantado tanto sus instalaciones, restaurantes y personal atento en todo momento.
Esta muy bien situado tanto para ir al centro como al aeropuerto. Lo recomiendo a todos",5,2015,03,08
47,Very poor,"La habitación era ruidosa por que era exterior, las camas HORRIBLES y las almohadas ya se notaban muy usadas. Había algún que otro 'roto' en la habitación. Las toallas raspaban un poco, y los accesorios del cuarto mde baño eran escasos....que menos que unas zapatillas para el baño o un cepillo de dientes!!!!.",2,2015,03,03
47,Caro pero como toda Barcelona,"El hotel en conjunto estás genial  y excelentemente situado. No le falta detalle , el  gran problema es el precio, elegimos este por la situación.La cama muy comoda y los amenities del baño de calidad. La limpieza 10.",5,2015,02,28
47,"Dia de los enamorados, acaba en disgusto","La atención al cliente y el ruido por obras en la habitación contínua hizo que nuestra estancia fuera realmente decepcionante. Es un magnífico hotel bajo una gran dirección, que por su falta de atención al cliente y la mala asignación de las habitaciones ha reportado en una mala estancia.",2,2015,02,22
47,Pensavo meglio,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel per una riunione di lavoro e, al di là degli spazi e della posizione, non sono rimasto particolarmente colpito dall'hotel. L'accoglienza non è stata delle migliori (un po' troppa confusione), la camera era sufficientemente spaziosa ma l'arredamento un po' datato. Buona e ampia la colazione, il cibo a pranzo discreto ma nulla di eccezionale. Resta comunque ottima la posizione per girare a Barcellona.",3,2015,02,21
47,Le falta una buena reforma,"Hotel muy bien situado, bonito por fuera, pero que necesita una buena reforma: se nota en las habitaciones (del siglo pasado, caja de seguridad inutilizada, bañera antigua, etc.).
El desayuno en una sala inmensa, con buena atención de las camareras (¡felicidades!, menos mal), pues con unas pocas cafeteras con instrucciones complicadas para mucha gente, las colas para poder servirte un café ...).
Cenamos por un evento unas 20 personas: lamentable, muy lamentable: ni del primero ni del segundo ni del postre tenían suficientes para todos, así que varios no tuvieron posibilidad alguna de elegir.  Alucinante en un hotel de esta categoría para un grupo tan pequeño.",2,2015,02,20
47,Perfecto para ir al Palau Sant Jordi,"Su conexión directa con el Aeropuerto del Prat (el Aerobús para en la misma puerta del hotel cada 5-10 minutos) y su cercanía a Montjuic (está en la misma Plaza de España) lo hace perfecto para acudir a eventos en el Palau Sant Jordi por ejemplo. Además tiene parada de metro a escasos metros con conexión a varias de las lineas principales que recorren la ciudad. En 3 días no necesitamos hacer ni un transbordo en metro para nuestras visitas.
El hotel está estupendo con cafetería para tomar algo si llegas tarde, piscina en la azotea en temporada (vistas de lujo) y justo en la acera de enfrente de la antigua plaza de toros ahora reconvertida en centro comercial con amplia oferta de restauración en la última planta. 
Nosotros fuimos una pareja con una niña de 14 años y nos pusieron una cama supletoria muy cómoda para ella y, a pesar de esta cama adicional, la habitación seguía siendo espaciosa.",5,2015,02,19
47,Mejor ubicación de Barcelona,"Lujoso hotel en una de las mejores zonas de Barcelona. 100% recomendable para familias y viajes de negocios.

47,Noche redonda,"El hotel perfecto, bien ubicado en la plaza España de Barcelona, habitaciones impecables y un buen servicio. Si además tienes la oportunidad de cenar en su restaurante pasa a ser una noche redonda, una cena espectacular. Volveré.",5,2015,02,14
47,"IMPOSIBLE DORMIR, BAÑERA ROTA, ETC.","Tremendo lo de este hotel.... Habitaciones ""sonorizadas"" Se oye absolutamente todo, pisadas de la gente por el pasillo, se oye hasta el baño y la habitación de al lado!  El ruido que hacen las máquinas del patio interno es indescriptible. Imposible dormir ni con tapones para los oidos y una almohada encima!! El baño lamentable: Un azulejo roto que dejaba caer una jabonera que, si no lo han arreglado ya, a alguno le cae en el pie. La ducha no se enganchaba al soporte, por lo que te tenías que duchar con la alcachofa en la mano. La bañera con ""bultos"" que no era otra cosa que chapuzas para arreglar seguramente roturas, no hay mampara, solo una cortina vieja que daba una grima tremenda. El agua se salió de la ducha nada más encenderla porque no se enganchaba al soporte y se puso el baño de agua hasta arriba.  Llamamos en 2 ocasiones para que vinieran a recogerlo y no vinieron. Tuvimos que poner toallas para no matarnos al entrar en el baño.  En fín, un ascazo. Tuvimos que pedir hasta en 4 ocasiones que nos trajeran 2 almohadas y por fin las trajeron. El desayuno normal, lo que en todos los hoteles, nada que destacar:  embutidos, fruta, yogures, bollería, etc. Se echaba en falta otros tipos de pan. Hay solo una tostadora (que además no tostaba a la primera...) para más de 200 personas... colas para servirte un café, el zumo bueno (aunque dudábamos si era natural o no).  El buffete de la comida demasiado corto: Solo 2 platos de segundo (pollo y salmón) ensaladas, fideuá y verduras. Lo único bueno que le saco al hotel es la cama que era muy cómoda, pero una lástima ya que no podías dormir por el insoportable ruido...   por lo demás, necesita reformas urgentemente en todo. La habitación de la que hablo es la 305. Yo no vuelvo más a este hotel! Ni regalado!",2,2015,02,13
47,Genial!,"Me recomendaron este hotel por su ubicación y por el buen trato del personal, y no se equivocaron. Justo delante está la estación de metro que te lleva al centro de la ciudad. El trato del personal de recepción fue magnifico, dispuestos en todo momento a ayudar. La habitación que nos dieron era fantástica, con vistas al centro comercial que justo hay delante del hotel.El desayuno era abundante y muy bueno. Sin duda volvería a alojarme y a recomendar este hotel.",5,2015,02,11
47,PERFECTO,"Hotel perfecto de principio a fin. Personal de recepción muy atento. La habitación espectacular, tanto en limpieza, como en amplitud y por supuesto sus fantásticas vistas. Es un hotel perfecto para el descanso. El desayuno muy completo, y una vez más con un trato espectacular por parte del personal que te atiente. UN DIEZ.GRACIAS",5,2015,02,06
47,Servicio deficiente,"Es un hotel de 4 * donde mi empresa ha celebrado una reunión de unas 150 personas durante 3 días. Tardaron más de 2 horas en darnos habitación y no nos ofrecieron dejar las maletas en su consigna. El personal de recepción fue algo desagradable y nos dijeron que para una reunión de empresa deberíamos haber llegado el día anterior al comienzo de la reunión. Cuando nos dieron la habitación, no estaba hecha. El agua caliente salía amarilla. A pesar de que todo corría a cargo de la empresa, nos pidieron nuestra tarjeta de crédito personal. En las salas de reuniones faltaban sillas y agua para todos. Los pasillos son de tarima y desde la habitación se oían los pasos de la gente. Sinceramente, es una decepción y no merece 4 *. Es una pena porque el hotel está muy bien situado.",2,2015,02,06
47,Fin de semana increible. Muy recomendable,"Es la primera vez que me alojo en este Hotel, y puedo asegurar que no será la última. El hotel fantástico, confortable, ubicación inmejorable, tienes entrada de metro en la puerta, también hay parada de autobús y tienes la posibilidad si quieres de hacer desplazamiento a pie. Su personal tanto recepción como servicio habitaciones y restaurante se merecen un excelente.Su trato es tan cortes que te transmiten  felicidad, alegría, etc.  El Hotel dispone de parking, muy cómodo llegas aparcas y te olvidas del coche hasta el momento de marcharte.
Las habitaciones la decoración, las vistas, la limpieza todo muy correcto. El desayuno, muy variado y de gran calidad .",5,2015,02,02
47,Muy recomendable,"Nos habíamos alojado hace 2 años y por eso quisimos repetir. Como siempre, todo ha sido perfecto. 
Nos encanta su situación (en Plaza España, con vistas a la montaña de Montjuic y muy cerca del centro de la ciudad), también la ambientación del espacio. Las habitaciones son elegantes y acogedoras. Y por último el trato recibido por todo el personal ha sido inmejorable, están pendientes de que no te falte de nada en ningún momento. Si visitáis este hotel no dejéis de probar su restaurante Filigrana, un descubrimiento muy grato. En definitiva, se ha convertido en un hotel referencia de la ciudad.",5,2015,01,30
47,Lo tiene todo!,"Solemos ir a este hotel en nuestras visitas a Barcelona porque cumple con creces todas nuestras necesidades: esta muy bien situado, la habitaciones están muy bien, el personal muy amable y además tienen dos restaurantes en los que se come genial, Filigrana gastronómico con cocina local y Umo japonés de fusión. Destacar también que tienen una terraza con piscina y vistas 360 a Barcelona, que aunque ahora esta en obras, en el buen tiempo la tendrán lista y espectacular. Lo recomiendo al 100%.",5,2015,01,30
47,Ist o.k. aber auch nicht mehr,"Die Lage ist wie schön öfters beschrieben wirklich gut und sehr zentral. Die Zimmer sind o.k., aber extrem hellhörig. Man hört jeden der am Gang am Zimmer vorbei geht, die Türen der anderen Zimmer und die Toiletttenspülung der anderen. Das nervt nachts schon ein wenig. Das Personal an der Rezeption macht seinen Job, Freundlichkeit gehört da jedoch nicht dazu. Also alles in allem o.k. aber auch nicht mehr.",3,2015,01,21
47,Buen Hotel,"Bonito hotel con una gran ubicacion.Habitacion jr suite con muchos detalles! No tenia una bonita vista pero solo fui a dormir! El desayuno no estaba incluido y pague 10 €uros por persona.La parada del barcelona airport airbus enfrente al hotel y centro comercial muy cerca,lo recomiendo!",4,2015,01,07
47,"Buen Hotel, pero....","El Hotel Palza es un hotel con una situacion excelente, Las instalaciones son buenas  como corresponde a su categoria. La recepcion a nuestra llegada pues normal muy amables y correctos, a la salida muy bien y rapidos. Las habitaciones estan muy bien acondicionadas con una cama comodisima y un baño bien equipado. El porblema que para mi es grave, es que el suelo de la habitacion y el baño estaban sucios con cabellos de señora por todos lados, incluso algun confeti, es inaceptable que un hotel de la caregoria que sea no limpien el suelo de las habitaciones ni del baño. Muy buen hotel pero el suelo muy sucio, una verguenza. Lastima la primera vez que pruevo Catalonia hotels.",3,2015,01,07
47,Viaje en pareja,"Increíble. Un hotel maravilloso y un personal inmejorable, especialmente el del turno de noche. Habitaciones espléndidas con espectaculares vistas a la plaza de España y Mont Juic y un desayuno maravilloso aunque bastante caro. Un lugar perfecto para quedarse en barcelona.  ",5,2015,01,05
47,Soggiorno comodo.,"Prenotato tramite booking (anche se al check - in non risultava la nostra prenotazione,in un attimo hanno risolto dandoci la camera).Anche se non centralissimo é servito molto bene dai mezzi (appena fuori vi é metropolitana che in pochi minuti porta alla ramblas),zona comunque bella e turistica.Camera comoda pulita e ampia,personale alla reception molto cortese, tra cui ragazzi italiani.Presenti due ristoranti all'interno,provato il giapponese e vale la pena.Consigliato.",4,2015,01,04
47,Perfetto,"Bellissimo hotel, con tutti i confort. Sito in posizione strategica, perfettamente collegato. 
Difficile trovarvi qualche pecca, la pulizia perfetta, le camere grandi accoglienti e ben disposte, una meravigliosa vista sulla Plaza, confort acustico eccellente. Davvero molto confortevole, se io e i miei familiari torneremo a Barcellona alloggeremo sicuramente in questa struttura. Tutto ci ha soddisfatto prezzo compreso. Non abbiamo consumato pasti nell'hotel, per come siamo abituati noi la colazione a buffet sarebbe stata eccessiva, ma se qualcuno gradisce può tranquillamente decidere in loco se farla o meno. Di certo non ci son problemi volendo farla fuori, perchè oltre ad un ottimo localino alla destra dell'albergo, sulla sinistra si trova l'Arena provvista di tantissimi e differenti locali.",5,2015,01,02

Muchas gracias por todo.",5,2014,12,31
47,"Hotel con ubicación fantástica, pero tiene que mejorar, pues es de cuatro estrellas.","El trato es bastante bueno, las habitaciones bien, pero hay desperfectos que no dan buena imagen. El desayuno está bastante bien. Unas zapatillas de cortesía no estarían mal. Lo mejor es que puedes trasladarte a todos los puntos importantes de Barcelona, pues su situación es fenomenal y la puerta del metro está al lado del Hotel.",3,2014,12,24
47,Bien y punto,"La entrada fue terrible: tuvimos q pedir q nos atendieran a pesar de no haber nadie haciendo cola y nos tocó una chica muy desagradable. La habitación: correcta. La cama pequeña e incomoda. La zona de aseo no tiene puerta, lo q resulta incómodo en ciertas ocasiones. La ducha de techo atascada. Por lo demás bien: las siguientes atenciones en recepción, el desayuno y la ubicación, por supuesto.",3,2014,12,06
47,Molto buone la struttura e la posizione,"L'hotel si trova in una posizione strategica per raggiungere l'aeroporto e il centro di Barcellona. Le camere sono confortevoli pur non avendo un design ""modernissimo"". Comodo il letto. Da rilevare la presenza di pavimento con parquet, decisamente molto meglio della moquette! Da notare la vicinanza ad un fornito centro commerciale dove si possono fare acquisti ""last minute"".",4,2014,12,02
47,justito justito,"elegimos el hotel por la hubicacion. Por la noche desde la habitacion se oyen los autobuses, el metro y los coches.

Vista meravigliosa sulla piazza e sulla fontana.
Ottima posizione con tutti i collegamenti davanti l'hotel.
Ottima la colazione. le camere molto pulite.
Molto confortevole per davvero.
Ci ritornerei molto volentieri, anche e soprattutto per gustarmi le prelibatezze del 7 Porte.
ciao Barcellona e a presto",5,2014,11,24
47,"Confortevole, ottima posizione","L'hotel è su uno degli snodi centrali dei mezzi pubblici sotterranei e di superficie, quindi comodissimo per tutte le esigenze turistiche e d'affari. Non è freschissimo come allestimenti e come manutenzione, ma nell'insieme ha tutto quello che serve. le camere sono ampie e ben insonorizzate, pavimento in parquet che io preferisco alla moquette, bagno ampio - ma con il miscelatore della doccia un po' restio a funzionare. Per usare la cassaforte della camera occorre chiedere la chiave in reception, ed è una piccola seccatura. Ascensori numerosi e veloci, la colazione a buffet ha tutto quel che serve, ma nessun guizzo. Ecco, se questo hotel ha un difetto, è che manca di personalità: se cercate un buon hotel centrale per andarci a dormire e tornarci per un po' di relax è perfetto, ma non è un hotel ""da vivere"".",3,2014,11,23
47,"Lindo hotel, inmejorable ubicación, excelente atención","Las habitaciones confortables, el desayuno espectacular, y el lugar... fabuloso. Todo lo mejor de Barcelona a un paso, caminando o en metro, que está en la puerta del hotel. Y la atención, realmente pocas veces en Barcelona hemos sido tan bien tratados como aquí. Súper recomendable...",4,2014,11,23
47,Hotel Increible,"La situación es perfecta, las habitaciones son muy bonitas y confortables; desde ellas hay unas vistas geniales. El trato del personal es exquisito y la comida aún mejor. Dentro del mismo hotel hay tres restaurantes que vale la pena probarlos. El desayuno buffet es completo muy bueno y el sitio donde se come es extremadamente grande, lo que hace que acústicamente sea perfecto. Aunque haya gente no se escucha nada de ruido y puedes estar tranquilamente hablando. En definitiva un hotel muy recomendable.",5,2014,11,21
47,RECOMENDABLE,"Hotel de 4 estrellas, bien de precio si reservas con antelación. La ubicacion inmejorable, parada de metro en la puerta, así como parada del bus que va al aeropuerto. Está en plena Plaza de España, a pie de Montjuic. Muy buen servicio de habitaciones, que son amplias y confortables, con bombones y agua mineral de cortesía.En la recepción hay ordenadores gratis con impresora.Me pareció caro el desayuno buffet, 16 euros,aunque es muy bueno. Al lado del hotel hay un centro comercial.",5,2014,11,19
47,Hotel dotato di ogni comfort e con un ottima posizione!,"Hotel eccellente con una vista fantastica su Plaza Espana. A lato una Arena de toros diventata un centro commerciale interessante da visitare. Ben servito dai bus turistici e dai taxi. Le suite sono dotate di ogni comfort, doppio bagno, due tv, WiFi, due frigo bar, camera da letto finemente arredata e una sala spaziosa con divani in pelle e un lungo tavolo in mogano. Colazione self-service ricchissima, con ogni prelibatezza. Cucina internazionale. Personale cortese.",5,2014,11,16
47,"Ottima posizione, ci sono cose da migliorare","Ottima la posizione proprio su Plaza di Espana, sono stato lì proprio nel momento in cui vi è stata la manifestazione per l'indipendenza catalana, uno spettacolo unico.

Vicinissimo il centro commerciale Arena, pieno di posti dove mangiare e fare shopping, oltre che a poca distanza dalle Ramblas.

L'hotel è molto bello e curato, ma pecca di disorganizzazione; appena arrivato, pur avendo segnalato il mio orario di arrivo in base al volo, ho dovuto attendere per ben due ore su i divani della hall. 

Una volta confermata la stanza, una Junior Suite ed aver richiesto l'integrazione della colazione per 2 giorni (ripartivo alle 5 a.m. del quarto giorno) ho dovuto litigare con il sistema di pagamento dell'hotel, inspiegabilmente non accettava carte Mastercard prepagate, ma ha correttamente effettuato l'addebito quando il numero della stessa è stato inserito manualmente. Stesso discorso per i due ristoranti interni.

Al termine del soggiorno ho richiesto il saldo per eventuali consumazioni del minibar e invece mi è stata addebitata un'ulteriore colazione con la scusa del ""non posso fare altrimenti"" perchè le hanno applicato la tariffa sconto che vale per tre giorni (problema tuo, non mio, ma comunque ho pagato).

Sconsiglio il ristorante giapponese interno, troppo caro, molto meglio cenare all'interno del centro commerciale di fronte.",4,2014,11,14
47,Perfekte Lage für einen Barcelona-Aufenthalt,"Das Hotel ist für Besichtigungstouren wunderbar gelegen. Sogar der Flughafenbus (Aerobus) hält direkt vor der Tür und weitere Verkehrsmittel liegen in unmittelbarer Nähe. Natürlich bringt der vor dem Hotel gelegene Kreisverkehr in den Nachtstunden Unruhe mit sich, aber wer will schon schlafen, wenn er in Barcelona ist? Außerdem ist der Blick aus dem Fenster so eindrucksvoll, dass man für den Straßenlärm voll entschädigt wird. Die Zimmer sind sauber und großräumig und lassen nichts zu wünschen übrig. Der 4**** Standard ist auf jeden Fall gegeben. Das Frühstücksbuffet hat für jeden Geschmack etwas vorzuzeigen, der Orangensaft ist frisch gepresst. Die Abendessen habe ich nicht im Hotel eingenommen sondern nebenan auf dem Dach der ehemaligen Stierkampfarena, die als Einkaufszentrum umfunktioniert ist. Dort sind einige Restaurants, z.B. das Mussol mit typisch katalanischer Küche. - Ich werde bei meinem nächsten Barcelona-Besuch gern in dieses Hotel zurück kommen.",4,2014,10,29
47,COMPLETAMENTE RECOMENDABLE !!,"Hace unas semanas estuve con mi familia  en el hotel  y después de conocer un poco Barcelona , me alegre de esta alojada allí
Las Habitaciones súper bien decoradas , amplias ,  y con muy buen servicio. 
El Desayuno muy variado y excelente  !!  Las vistas desde la azotea .. impresionantes  !!

47,¡¡¡Único e irrepetible! !!,"Hace muchos años que vamos al ahora llamado Restaurante Filigrana en el Hotel Plaza y siempre hemos salido más que satisfechos de su cocina vanguardista y del excelente trato del servicio. 
Hoy hemos vuelto después de un tiempo y nos han vuelto a sorprender con una carta renovada y exquisita así como un trato nuevamente superado a sí mismo en dos jóvenes y guapísimas chicas llamadas Siham y Marta.
 En ningún otro Hotel o restaurante de Barcelona nos han tratado con la delicadeza y simpatía de estas dos jóvenes. 
Cualquier restaurante se disputaría ofrecer el servicio de estas dos empleadas en su comedor. 

Otro detalle a destacar sería una calidad/precio insuperable.

Muchas gracias por todo. 

Hasta pronto, 

¡¡¡Repetiremos seguro!!!",5,2014,10,05
47,Un anniversario che ci rimarra' nel cuore,"In occasione del nostro 35' anniversario di matrimonio abbiamo trascorso un w.e a Barcellona in questo hotel.
Ci e' stata riservata una ""sistemazione regale"" che non dimenticheremo e che ci ha davvero emozionati.
Vista meravigliosa sulla piazza e sul Montjuic.
Che dire, ottimo hotel con all interno ristorante molto raffinato, personale  gentile e professionale.
Situato a 50 metri dalla metropolitana",5,2014,10,05
47,Molto bello e collegamenti ottimi,"Siamo stati 5 giorni e nonostante un diverbio iniziale con una receptionist davvero maleducata e presuntuosa che ci ha fatto molto arrabbiare,temevamo un soggiorno disastroso, in realtà è stato tutto ottimo e molto bello e la disponibilità di tutto lo staff è stato ottimo.
La struttura è enorme e tenuta molto bene,le camere molto belle e nuove, la nostra dava sull'Arenas e vedavamo parte della piazza,il monte Tibidabo e il parco Mirò,bellissima veduta.
Ha un ristorante giappo e un piccolo club,una grande area per la colazione che però non abbiamo usufruito poichè 10 euro a testa sono troppi.
Bellissimo il panorama a 360° dal roof top con piscina, utilizzabile nelle giornate afose,davvero molto suggestivo e particolare.
Collegato ottimamente con tutto, aeroporto, centro, mare, sia da bus,metro e treno con numerosissime corse e fermate.
Lo consiglio assolutamente per qualsiasi occasione pur non essendo in zona centrale,se possibile chiedete le camere ai piani alti,ottimo.",5,2014,10,02
47,Excelente,"Si ubicación es muy buena, el metro en la puerta facilita el acceso a cualquier punto.
Las habitaciones son muy modernas, calefaccionadas. El desayuno es muy rico y abundante ya que es buffet.

47,Ottimo!,"Ho soggiornato nel mese di settembre in quest'hotel e lo giudico davvero ottimo. Le stanze sono dotate di ogni tipo di comfort, c'è un clima molto tranquillo. Inoltre la colazione è davvero abbondante! Consiglierei sicuramente di alloggiare all'hotel Catalonia.",5,2014,09,10
47,Tutto come lo si desidererebbe!,"Tutto perfetto: cibo, disponibilità, servizi, pulizie! La vista sul Montjuïc inoltre è spettacolare!!

47,Bien,"Puede ser mejor.... pero excelente atencion del personal... un poco lento el.internet de preferencia hagan todo el uso del internet en el lobby. La ventaja es que es gratis.

47,Excelente,"Nos hemos alojado varias ocasiones en este hotel y siempre ha sido una estancia agradable y confortable. No tenemos una sola queja que expresar de ningún servicio, al contrario. Las comunicaciones son buenas, la ubicación excelente, está ubicado en la plaza de España, junto a la feria de muestras, el parque de Montjuic y el centro comercial arena, museos, etc.",4,2014,09,02
47,Le doy un 8!,"Estuve hace poco alojada en este maravilloso hotel. En realidad hice la reserva en el Catalonia Park Putxet pero nos desviaron a Plaza España debido a un problema de logística. A mi novio y a mi no nos supo un problema ya que está ubicado muchísimo mejor que el otro y además es más bonito. El hotel es impresionante, las habitaciones muy amplias con tv de plasma y lavabo con bañera tal y como pedimos. Lo único que nos supo raro es que no había mnibar: estaban los vasos y copas y la lista de los productos pero faltaba el minibar!!! No le dimos importancia ya que en realidad sólo queríamos la habitación para dormir después de un largo día enseñando a mi novio la ciudad de Barcelona.
Una atención buena por los recepcionistas y el camarero del bar a quien le pedimos un poco de hielo.
Sin duda, volvería reservar directamente en este hotel, muy recomendable :)",4,2014,08,21
47,Genial,"Me alojé en este hotel de la cadena Catalonia y me pareció excelente en muchos sentidos. Hacia tiempo que no sentía un ambiente de hospitalidad extraordinario como el que tuve cuando me alojé en el mes de julio pasado. La recepcionista que me atendió fué super amable y profesional y nuestra habitación en la planta 7 era genial. Hay mucha variedad de comida incluido un restaurante japonés cerca del lobby muy bueno. La situación muy buena, plaza españa, y numerosos transportes cercanos. Sencillamente excelente!",5,2014,08,20
47,Buena relacion calidad-precio,"Es un gran hotel con una ubicación perfecta.En plena Plaza de España. Enfrente la antigua plaza de toros que ahora es un centro comercial con una terraza preciosa para cenar. En la misma puerta el metro, para poder visitar Barcelona sin mover el coche del Parking. El personal del hotel encantador. Nos dieron una habitación superior a la contratada que era preciosa. La última noche cenamos en el restaurante japones Umo que pertenece al grupo del hotel y nos encantó. En la azotea está la piscina, aunque en Agosto llena de niños sin control. Todo en general nos gustó mucho.",4,2014,08,19
47,"Gute Lage, Roof-Top-Pool, aber kein 4*-Hotel","Wir haben uns für unsere Städtereise für das Hotel Catalonia Plaza am Plaza Espana entschieden. Der Platz ist mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln vom Flughafen mit dem Aerobus und dem Stadtzentrum sehr gut zu erreichen.
Das Hotel macht insgesamt einen ordentlichen Eindruck. Das Zimmer war ein Standard-Hotelzimmer wofür wir aber aufgrund der Ausstattung und Sauberkeit nur 3* vergeben würden.
Vom Frühstück waren wir etwas enttäuscht. Aufgrund der Größe des Hotels gleicht der Frühstückssaal einer Großkantine mit hohem Lärmpegel. Das Angebot war sehr sporadisch. Eine halbe Stunde vor Schluss war das Buffet komplett abgegrast und wurde auch nur noch teilweise wieder aufgefüllt.
Am zweiten Tag bekamen wir von einer Angestellten den Tipp, zum Frühstück die ""Gourmet Corner"" zu besuchen. Das Frühstückangebot war jedoch nahezu identisch. Vorteilhaft war jedoch, dass dieser Raum deutlich kleiner und ruhiger, somit angenehmer war.
Besonders erwähnenswert ist der Pool auf dem Dach des Hotels, zumal die Zimmer nicht über einen Balkon verfügen. Im Sommer ist ein Hotel mit Pool in Barcelona Pflicht. Eine kleine Cocktail-Bar rundet das Angebot ab.
Jedoch gibt es auch hier zwei Kleinigkeiten zu bemängeln:
1.) Der Pool ist über zwei Meter tief und es gibt keine Möglichkeit, sich irgendwo hinzustellen, d.h. man muss sich immer am Rand festhalten, wenn man mal ne Pause machen möchte.
2.) Deutlich zu wenige Liegen für die Anzahl der Gäste. Aufgrund der Größe der Dachfläche wären deutlich mehr Liegen möglich.
Insgesamt war es dennoch ein schöner Aufenthalt im Hotel.",3,2014,08,14
47,Bello!,"L'hotel si trova proprio di fronte alla piazza dove si tiene lo spettacolo delle fontane magiche (da non perdere)! Ho soggiornato qualche anno fa ma il ricordo di questo hotel è sempre nitido nella mia mente: pulizia ineccepibile, camere ampie e spaziose, colazione ottima. Non vicinissimo al centro ma ben collegato",5,2014,08,11
47,Hotel ottimo come base per visitare Barcellona,"Hotel in ottima posizione come punto di partenza per visitare la città, con stazione della metropolitana proprio di fronte, così come le fermate dei bus da e per l'aeroporto. Nelle immediate vicinanze si trovano le splendide fontane magiche di Montjuic, osservabili anche dalla terrazza panoramica della piscina, oltre ad un grande centro commerciale e diversi ristoranti. Staff sempre disponibile e gentile, ottima struttura e comfort di buon livello.",5,2014,08,07

47,Muy buena ubicación y servicio. Hotel muy moderno,"No pude disfrutar mucho del hotel porque estuve sólo dos días finalizando un tour por España, y era el hotel que habían elegido los organizadores del tour. La ubicación es excelente, céntrica y además cercana a la estación del metro. El personal es muy amable, gente joven que con mucha paciencia respondió nuestras preguntas y buscó las atracciones que le solicitamos. Las habitaciones muy confortables.",4,2014,08,01
47,Silenzioso,"Il silenzio ė il requisito basilare per un albergo, secondo la mia scala di giudizio. Ho pagato molto ma la camera al sesto piano con vista sulla piazza Espana valeva la spesa. La struttura dell'hotel non ė recentissima, ma ciò ė un punto di forza, perchė le pareti non sono di cartongesso e le camere contigue sono sfalsate in modo da contenere i rumori. Il risultato ė che la notte si riposa nel silenzio. La piscina sul tetto ė spesso affollata ma ė certo un valore aggiunto non indifferente per l'ospite. La colazione a buffet ė eccellente e varia, il caffė fatto al momento con ampia scelta tra le capsule Nespresso. Ampia selezione di brioches e affettati freschi, compreso il jamon iberico, frutta fresca e........
Le camere sono pulite anche se nel mio caso ho notato una certa rilassatezza dopo i primi due giorni di soggiorno. Il personale nel complesso ė gentile. Tornerei.",4,2014,07,29
47,dei giorni magnifici,"Ho soggiornato con la mia famiglia presso questo hotel dal 19 Luglio ad oggi 27 Luglio; allora prima di tutto voglio ringraziare di cuore Andrea, ragazzo che lavora alla reception, italiano, che ci ha aiutati tantissimo ad ambientarci e ad orientarci a Barcellona, dandoci tutte le indicazioni necessarie, molto professionale gentile competente e cortese; ho alloggiato nella suite al decimo piano, che dire? per me stupenda, silenziosa, pulita, ben attrezzata di tutto, personale dell'albergo che ci portava ogni giorno i cioccolatini, piccolo neo soltanto il check in avvenuto un pò ritardo perché la camera non era ancora pronta, e la piscina, che non ha un numero sufficiente di lettini quando é particolarmente affollata. Barcellona fantastica, sotto tutti gli aspetti, richiede un attimo di tempo imparare ad utilizzare la metro per andare nei punti di maggior interesse. Non ho consumato pasti in albergo quindi non posso dire, in ogni caso la zona é piena di locali e c'é un centro commerciale vicinissimo dove si può acquistare tutto ciò che può servire. consiglio: fate i biglietti in rete per la Sagrada Familia e per tutto Gaudì, ci sono le code; utilissimo l'ufficio informazioni turistiche che si trova in Plaza Catalunya. Ringrazio di cuore tutte le persone conosciute in Spagna durante questa vacanza, ringrazio la direzione dell'hotel per l'ottimo servizio e tutto il personale e Barcellona mi rimane nel cuore, voglio sicuramente tornarci",4,2014,07,27

Fue un capricho que nos dimos por nuestro aniversario. Pedimos una suit y todo muy bien. Nada más llegar nos dieron un pinchito de frutas, y estaba muy bueno.
La habitación era inmensa, tenia 1 baño con bañera y plato de ducha, 1 aseo y 1 sala de estar. Nuestra planta fue muy tranquila Y bastante alta. Teníamos buenas vista de la Plaza España.
El desayuno, un poco caro, para lo que nosotros comemos, pero era muy completo. Había de todo lo necesario. Café, zumos, yogures, cereales, embutido, bolleria, etc...
Está bien ubicado, con estación de metro y autobuses muy cerca.
Nos encantó todo.
Por poner una pega, fue que a la salida, la recepcionista pensaba que tenia 2 habitaciónes y quería que le pagase la otra, cosa que no tenía. Pero se resolvió bien.

C’è anche un ottimo collegamento con la metro proprio sotto l’albergo. Struttura non nuovissima ma in buona condizione - camere ampie, arredate in stile classico ma con gusto, letto comodo, beauty kit variegato e infinito, presenza bidet, il bagno non nuovissimo ma tenuto bene. Molta scelta a colazione (anche con prodotti senza glutine), qualità alta, è buono anche il caffe della macchina. Staff gentile e molto cortese.

47,100% recomendable para la realización de cualquier banquete!!!,"Por casualidad y una desavenencia con otro hotel, cosa que tengo que agradecer al destino, fui a parar al Hotel Catalonia Plaza para realizar diferentes eventos, que estamos llevando a cabo todos los fines de semana desde el pasado mes de marzo de 2014, y he de decir que estoy gratamente sorprendido tanto por el exquisito trato dispensado, como por su gran profesionalidad y seriedad.
Desde la primera toma de contacto con Carola, del departamento de convenciones, quien supo perfectamente adaptarse a nuestras exigencias y sentir nuestro evento suyo, lo que ha conllevado al gran éxito de todas y cada una de las cenas organizadas, se nota que estás tratando con grandes profesionales, y sobre todo, una gran entendida en materia de eventos, buscando siempre soluciones a los problemas que van surgiendo con el día a día, resolutiva y acostumbrada a trabajar bajo presión, pero siempre con una gran sonrisa en el semblante. Asimismo, sus diferentes compañeras Ylenia y Miriam, del mismo departamento, con quienes a lo largo de este periodo he tenido la suerte de conocer y trabajar, son personas cercanas, con iniciativa, que saben perfectamente lo que busca un cliente y sus necesidades, meticulosas y celosas de su trabajo, y muy preocupadas por el resultado final del acto organizado, y pasando finalmente por todo el gran equipo de restauración al mando de Xavi, con Carlos, José Luis, Julio y Tudela, siempre atentos a todo lo que puedas necesitar durante el evento y grandes trabajadores que se dejan la piel para que todo salga perfecto.
He de decir, que después de 15 años trabajando en la organización de todo tipo de eventos, nunca me había encontrado con un hotel tan bien estructurado, que no cojease en ninguno de sus departamentos, perfectamente organizado, con tantas ganas de trabajar, y sobre todo, con tantos profesionales de la talla del Hotel Catalonia Plaza.  
Dicen que las cosas no son especiales por sí solas, sino que las hacemos especiales las personas, y esto es lo que ocurre con el gran equipo que compone este hotel, que cada acto es único e irrepetible. Mi gran sincera enhorabuena a todo el equipo de convenciones y restauración del Hotel!!! RECOMENDABLE 100% PARA CUALQUIER TIPO DE EVENTO!!!!",5,2014,06,19
47,Bueno pero esperaba más,"El hotel en general está bien, las habitaciones correctas, el baño algo menos... La atención, eso sí, excelente.

47,Ottimo hotel,Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel favoloso con camera al sesto piano affacciata su piazza espagna. Silenzioso ottima la pulizia confortevole il letto e molti confort come palestra piscina sauna. Ottima la sua posizione x il collegamento con bus e metro.non abbiamo usufruito del ristorante dell hotel ma Di fronte si trova un centro commerciale che offre ottimi localini per colazione pranzo e cena a prezzi nella norma. Bellissimo anche lo spettacolo delle fontane luminose nel fine settimana che si puo godere anche dalla camera. Ci ritorneremo ,5,2014,06,10
47,Fin de semana perfecto!,"Un hotel más que recomendable. Ubicación perfecta ( muy cerca de Aeropuerto y del centro de Barcelona ), por no hablar del trato impecable por parte de todos los empleados. Si visitáis este hotel, debéis probar su Restaurante Filigrana, otro gran descubrimiento!",5,2014,06,02

El desayuno excelente.Se encuentra en Plaza de España a 5 minutos de la estación del AVE y totalmente centrico para tus reuniones y tus paseos. Excelente elección,4,2014,05,30
47,HOTEL A BARCELLONA,da madrid via aerea  a barcellona bagaglio non trovato avendo avuto un numero di telefono dell'areoporto abbiamo delegato le gentilissime signore della reception di informarsi il giorno dopo sono venute ad avvisarci che il mio bagaglio era all'areoporto mi hanno stampato il numero dell'ufficio dove andare a ritirarlo ci hanno chiamato un taxi e il mio bagaglio era di nuovo mio.Che non è forse gentilezza questa?comunque l'hotewl è molto bello è pulito c'è una colazione super il personale pronto a sostenerti nei momenti di difficoltà che altro si vuole?spero di esservi stati d'aiuto io lo RISCEGLIEREI DI NUOVO,5,2014,05,28
47,Spettacolare!,"Siamo arrivati a barcellona in mattinata e, l'autobus che si prende appena usciti dall'aeroporto, in 10 minuti ti lascia davanti all'entrata dell'hotel. Siamo rimasti molto contenti di non dover camminare con i bagagli. Come concordato sulla prenotazione online, il check-in era alle ore 13 ma, con assoluta gentilezza e disponibilitá, ci hanno tenuto le valigie in un deposito/guardaroba gratuito, fino alla disponibilita della stanza. 
La nostra stanza, pagata veramente poco, meno di 40€ a persona a notte, aveva una vista spettacolare! Affacciava direttamente sull'Arena, mentre sulla destra si godeva di una parte di plaza espanya e sulla sinistra si vedeva la sagrada familia in lontananza.
Appena arrivati in camera abbiamo trovato acqua e cioccolatini di benvenuto, e un buono per una degustazione sushi al ristorante giapponese umo (all'interno dell'hotel). Letto bellissimo, finestra enorme, avevamo un panorama assurdo dal letto, bagno grande con vasca da bagno, armadio enorme. Arredamento 4 stelle garantite. Aria condizionata. Tv satellitare. 
L'hotel in generale é un grande complesso molto ben organizzato con 3 ristoranti all'interno. Ottimo il servizio colazione, dal dolce al salato, scelta ampissima e qualita garantita. ",5,2014,05,24
47,Personale PESSIMO,"Non ve lo auguro mai, ma se dovesse capitarvi di essere derubati all'estero, in Spagna, a Barcellona... pregate non sia proprio all'hotel Catalonia. 

Nonostante ci avessero avvisato dell'alto tasso di furti nella città, mai avremmo pensato di essere ""in pericolo"" all'interno di questo hotel 4 stelle Luxor.

Innanzitutto, abbiamo aspettato ben 5 ore e mezza per avere la nostra stanza prenotata e proprio l'attesa ci ha sfiancate definitivamente portandoci alla distrazione momentanea di due minuti e dico due, verso le nostre borse, il tempo di girar la testa ed erano sparite, all'interno della hall dell'hotel, in un angolo appartato. Non abbiamo ricevuto assistenza dallo stuff in nessun modo, NESSUNO: ci siamo improvvisamente trovate senza telefoni, senza bancomat, senza contanti e senza documenti e nessuno si è venuto neanche a scusare. Una sorta di vigilante alla porta era sparito proprio in quel frangente, le telecamere non potevano essere consultate neanche dopo la denuncia alla polizia e tutte le telefonate all'italia ci sono state addebitate, se volevamo riceverle facevano storie. Scortesia data a pacchi, l'unica nostra fortuna è stata il conoscere persone del luogo che ci hanno aiutate e sostenute, compresi alcuni altri clienti dell'hotel.

La maggior parte dello stuff è pessimo, soprattutto gli addetti alla pulizia che fumano mentre puliscono (eravamo in una camera per non fumatori, non siamo fumatrici, rientrando la sera la stanza era pregna di odore di sigaretta). L'unico ragazzo che si è dimostrato comprensibile era un receptionist italiano, che ha denunciato anche la scarsità del personale numericamente parlando.

Per il resto un hotel come molti altri che ho visto: camera buona, confort di base, pulita. Nulla però che non abbia trovato in un albergo di 3 stelle ad Avellino, a parte gli accappatoi. Non posso fare prezzi di paragone in quanto ospite non sò il prezzo che è stato pagato, ma, a parte un ottima colazione continentale, non ho trovato niente di così speciale.",1,2014,05,23
47,Excelente,"Utilizamos sus instalaciones para celebrar un gran cumpleaños además de una excelente organización es un excelente hotel,un exquisito trato , calidez y calidad  una gran ubicación y una gran profesionalidad repetiremos seguro,",5,2014,05,19
47,Accoglienza pessima,"Ci siamo ritrovati in questo Hotel a causa di un così detto ''desbrigo''...a seguito di un problema con la nostra prenotazione in altro hotel, ci hanno portato qui dove siamo stati accolti dal muso lungo e ombroso del general manager presente all'ingresso alle 23 del 10.05...che dopo il nostro saluto non ci ha nemmeno degnato di un mezzo sorriso. Stanchi e bisognosi di relax ci siamo rifugiati in stanza pensando al nostro riposo, trovando purtroppo la stanza al primo piano piuttosto rumorosa. Poche ore di sonno turbolento prima di ripartire e al mattino presto ci siamo ritrovati lo stesso GM con lo stesso stile della sera prima...ne un sorriso ma nemmeno un saluto. Convinti che la buona accoglienza sia primaria soprattutto da parte di un manager di tale livello...abbiamo lasciato la splendida Barcellona con l'amaro ricordo di questa mancanza e la certezza che non torneremo a soggiornare dove non ci si sente a proprio agio",1,2014,05,15
47,"Habitaciones renovadas, genial","Todo muy bien y en habitación recién renovada. Estuvimos tan solo 1 noche, y genial. El desayuno es super completo y variado. Me encantó

La única pega que encontré es que no está del todo aislado del exterior, por lo que se oía el ruido de coches e incluso un grupo de jóvenes que gritaban.

Tiene carta de almohadas.",5,2014,05,13
47,Excelente Hotel en el centro de Barcelona,"A la excelente ubicación de este hotel, hay que añadirle sus inmejorables instalaciones y la gran profesionalidad de todos sus empleados. Igualmente, valoramos muy positivamente que el colchón estaba en muy buen estado y descansamos perfectamente, también es digno de destacar el espléndido desayuno.",5,2014,05,11
47,Puente de Mayo estupendo,"Este puente de Mayo he estado alojado con mi familia en el Hotel Catalonia Barcelona Plaza, en el que tengo que destacar la gran amabilidad del personal. La habitación muy espaciosa y con vistas espectaculares a la Plaza España y el desayuno muy completo. Muy bien comunicado a nivel de transporte para desplazarse con comodidad por toda la ciudad.",5,2014,05,07
47,Buen hotel,"Me dieron una habitación superior a la que había reservado con unas estupendas vistas a la Plaza de España. La habitación era moderna, recién reformada. Buen trato tanto en recepción como en el bar del hotel. Lo único que no me gustó es que en la página de hoteles catalonia te ofrecen un check out tardío entre las 3pm o 6pm según disponibilidad,que por ser semana santa no pudieron cumplir. En estos casos deberían avisar que no es posible ya que en mi reserva lo solicitaba  en observaciones.",4,2014,04,29
47,Ottima posizione,"Molto bello e direi pure signorile! Ottima posizione centralissima ! Dalla finestra della mia stanza vedevo le splendide fontane danzanti a tempo di musica e colorate!!

47,hotel bello anke se con letto scomodo!:),"Hotel bello, abbastanza moderno, pulito e luminoso...
Personale accogliente, camere standard con vista magnifica su Piazza di Spagna e uno sfondo colorato dalle fontane danzanti di Montjuic. Imperdibile per la comodità della fermata dell'Aerobus e per le 2 uscite della metropolitana appena fuori dall'hotel!!
L'unica pecca del soggiorno è stato il letto...molto scomodo! peccato, però questo non cambia di certo la mia valutazione per questo hotel.",4,2014,04,22
47,Trato vip!,Escojimos este hotel por su buena ubicación y el precio. Y repetiremos por sus instalaciones pero sobretodo por el trato recibido por todo el personal de recepción y de habitaciones. A parte tienen un restaurante japonés (Umo) increible!,5,2014,04,19
47,muy buen hotel,"muy buen hotel, buen desayuno, bien ubicado, pero con un pequeño problema, nosotros estuvimos en abril, ahora, y en la habitacion hacia calor, y como no es verano, no encienden la refrigeracion, por lo tanto debiamos abrir la ventana lo que hace que se escuche mucho ruido del transito.",4,2014,04,19
47,Comodo e bello,"Peccato aver trascorso lì solo una notte: stanze ampie e ben arredate; bagno bello e grande, fornito di tutti i servizi e gli accessori; personale molto cortese multilingue. È a un passo dalle ramblas e dalla movida...insomma ottima soluzione. ",4,2014,04,12
47,Un hotel inmejorable.,"Me senti como en casa por el servicio, recibi un buenisimo trato. La ubicación del hotel es inmejorable y tambien lo son sus instalaciones. Comi mejor que en ningún otro hotel que haya visitado.  Volveré seguro.",5,2014,04,04
47,Lamentable atención,"Nos cancelan la reserva tras estar pagada hace 4 meses, la explicación falló informático. No nos han avisado, nos desplazan a un Hotel con mala relación de precio y ubicación para la Feria Alimentaria, no dan más explicaciones, la primera vez que me pasa en mi vida, esto no es un 4 estrellas. En un hostal atienden mejor y son más serios con las reservas pagadas. ",1,2014,03,30
47,Gita scolastica,"Ottimo hotel in tutti i sensi. Posizione, pulizia e accuratezza, camere perfette e con vista su Piazza di Spagna. Personale gentile. Colazione e cena a buffet, abbondante e di qualità(cosa rara nelle gite scolastiche). I ragazzi sono rimasti pienamente soddisfatti",5,2014,03,28
47,Trato pesimo,"Me alojé en la suite del reloj del hotel CATALONIA PLAZA la noche de reyes, a los dos días nos percatamos de que habíamos dejado olvidada una cazadora en el armario, así que nos ponemos en contacto para ver si nos la pueden enviar.

El chico de recepción nos corrobora que la cazadora está y que nos la envía por mensajería, pero como volveríamos en marzo decidimos esperar para pasar a recogerla.
Ya en marzo, llamamos el día antes para avisar y nos dicen que pasemos cuando queramos. 

Al día siguiente paso a recogerla y sorpresa la cazadora no está, me dicen que sí que esta apuntado, que ese día habían guardado una cazadora de la suite y de iguales características que la mía pero que no la encuentran que me llamaran por la tarde. 

Esa tarde no llaman así que vuelvo a llamar y me dicen  que siguen buscándola y dejándome en espera de 5 a 10 minutos cada vez que llamo.
Así durante los tres días posterioriores sigo  llamando mañana y tarde y sin dignarse a llamar aún diciéndome que me llamarían.

El cuarto día después de llamar yo, me dicen que se habían confundido y que la habitación donde habían recogido la cazadora no era mi habitación sino la de al lado ( nadie se dio cuenta hasta el cuarto día) así que me pasan a la subdirectora diciéndome la misma mentira pero que la buscará y me volverá a llamar por la tarde.

Esa tarde me llama y me dice que no era la habitación de al lado sino la de abajo y que no pueden hacer nada más. Con toda su cara se inventan esta historia y pretenden que yo me la crea.

Son unos impresentables y unos caraduras, alguien del personal la ha robado y ellos no quieren hacerse cargo.",1,2014,03,15
47,Collegato perfettamente,"noi abbiamo avuta la ns. camera che affacciava proprio in piazza (molto bella) e in lontananza si intravedevano le luci delle fontane danzanti. La cosa  straordinaria era il collegamento. perfetto. il bus dal aeroporto fermava proprio d'avanti. 2 metropolitane appena fuori dalla porta del albergo, insomma meglio di cosi. accanto (veramente accanto) un centro commerciale dove abbiamo trovato un posticino perfetto per la colazione in quanto la stanza non la comprendeva.La stanza pulita,luminosa,grande. Una volta abbiamo cenato nel ristorante del albergo (eravamo stanchissimi) ma sinceramente il cibo non era niente di che. Il centro commerciale aveva delle terrazze con molti ristoranti, molto meglio quelli. La piscina (sono andata solo vederla) è molto piccola situata sul piccolo terrazzino.Ma comunque mi sento di dire che noi ci siamo trovati molto bene.",4,2014,03,11
47,hotel ideal en barcelona,"Mi familia y yo veníamos de ibiza a pasar un fin de semana, y tuvimos la suerte de alojarnos en este magnifico hotel, Vistas panorámicas de 360º sobre Barcelona desde la planta 11 donde estuvimos. Cuidados en la habitación hasta el ultimo detalle. Un bufett extenso y completo típico de hoteles catalonia, donde mis hijas pequeñas hacían palmas  cada mañana antes de disfrutar de la ciudad. Metro en la puerta del hotel, centro comercial cruzando la calle. En fin, deseando volver esperando que sean mas días.",5,2014,03,09
47,Desastre en el desayuno!!,"Nunca soy de hacer comentarios,pero hoy me he decidido escribir aquí,por que lo que he vivido en el desayuno de este hotel de ""4"" estrellas ha sido dantesco. estoy acostumbrada a viajar con mi compañía por todas partes del Mundo y en hoteles de mejor y peor calidad que este precioso hotel, pero creo que deberían bajar la categoría ""gracias"" a los clientes que tienen, imagino que el hotel está en crisis como toda España,pero no para que albergue a semejantes impresentables, el hotel esta bien dentro de sus años, pero la hora del desayuno ha sido catastrofica, un grupo enorme de unos 200 ""personajes"" han entrado al buffet con sus bolsas y tuppers para proveerse para la dura jornada que deberían tener en la estupenda ciudad de Barcelona, han vaciado el buffet, han dejado las mesas llenas de comida y los demas clientes hemos tenido que quedarnos con las sobras, ademas el guía exigía , mas comida para esos desalmado!!!

por favor. pido a la direccion que este tipo de gente (da igual de donde sean) los pongan a desayunar a parte!! Gracias.. y espero que mi compañia, escuche mi peticion de no volver aqui",3,2014,03,06

47,viaggio barcellona,"l'hotel ha soddisfatto tutte le nostre necessità:stanza bellissima, bencurata con ottima visione della città.La posizione è eccezionale ,in centro ma tranquilla, ben servita dai mezzi pubblici. La colazione ottima ,abbondante,Personale discreto e gentile,",5,2014,02,24
47,Sentirsi tra amici,"Per motivi di lavoro sono stata in questo albergo per 15giorni cosecutivi e vi assicuro che grazie alla gentilezza di tutto il personale mi sono sentita meno sola.
La posizione dell'albergo è strategica perchè è uno snodo importante di molti mezzi pubblici, compreso l'autobus per l'aeroporto. Altro punto importante è la vicinanza al centro commerciale Las Arena dove oltre a tanti negozi per lo shoppping, si può trovare un parucchiere e tanti ristoranti aperti sino a tardi.
Per diverse sere le mie cene le ho trascorse al ristorante giapponese al piano terra dell'albergo (che vi consiglio vivamente per l'ottima qualità del cibo a prezzi normali!)
Il buffet per la colazione del mattino è molto ricco.
Vorrei ringraziare tutto il personale per il loro costante sorriso e per la loro gentilezza.
Grazie!",5,2014,02,19

47,Zentral bedeutet hier: gute Anbindung aber auch Lärm,"ein sehr grosses in die Tage gekommendes Hotel, Service unfreundlich, Rezeption wirkt oft überlastet, was an den vielen Reisegruppen liegen mag, die ständig ein und auschecken. sehr zentral gelegen, was aber auch viel Lärm bedeutet, wenn Zimmer zur Plaza liegen, ansonsten der obligatorisch wenig schöne Innenhof, Zimmer sind okay, Betten sehr gut, Bäder komplett, alles sehr sauber, Frühstückssaal riesig, an Bahnhofshalle erinnernt, unpersönlich und kalt, Frühstück aber schmackhat und vielseitig, warum Roomservice nur japanische Speisen anbietet? ein Geheimnis des Hauses",3,2014,01,26
47,Un paradiso,"Arrivati a Barcelona, anche se la conoscevo bene nn credevo che l'hotel era proprio di fronte Plaza Espanya, invece era così...appena arrivati abbiamo subito capito di aver fatto un affare, e pensare che lo avevo preso solo perchè vicino il Palau Saint Jordi e le recensioni erano buone. Hotel bellissimo, pulitissimo, personale splendido, non vi nascondo che al Prox viaggio a Barcelona lo prenderò di nuovo perchè in estate si può anche sfruttare la piscina con una vista mozzafiato sul terrazzo...che dire una meraviglia di hotel...consigliatissimo",5,2014,01,25
47,MAGNÍFICA SUITE,"Este hotel tiene varios tipos de habitaciones muy diferentes, incluso se accede por distintos ascensores. Nos alojamos en la zona de las suites; todo estupendo, la cama comodísima, no apetecía levantarse, todo limpio, cómodo, amplitud tanto en el dormitorio como en la zona de aseo, el wc separado y la ducha también. Los amenities surtidos, no falta de nada, un gran detalle el de los albornoces y las zapatillas. El desayuno más que suficiente, y con productos diferentes a los que se encuentran habitualmente, como tarritos con paté, tortitas recién hechas, o nocilla, además de todo lo típico de los buffets. El trato del personal es bueno, te atienden con simpatía, lo único que no me gustó es la mujer marimandona de la zona de desayuno, quejándose de lo guarrra que es la gente, dicho con las mismas palabras que utilizó, más le valdría dejar esos comentarios para la peluquería o por lo menos decirlo en voz baja para que el resto de los huéspedes no tengamos que escucharlos, eso por no decir el trato hacia sus compañeros, como les manda, y la manía de elegirte la mesa en la que te tienes que sentar, si tan sólo eramos cinco o seis mesas y la sala es enorme, a mí no me tiene que decir dónde me siento, además tiene aspecto de poco limpia, su pelo en los dos días que estuvimos no parecía haber visto el agua y el champú, y para estar de cara al público y además en una zona de comida... ufff. Ah, el café de máquina, bastante bueno, y los zumos naturales. En recepción muy atentos. Cruzando la acera, un centro comercial, tres paradas de metro y a un paseíto de todo. En general todo estupendo. Volveremos.",5,2014,01,23
47,"Posizione favolosa, gran albergo",L'albergo non ha bisogno di presentazioni: è di ottimo livello e l'atmosfera è eccellente. È piuttosto incombente sulla piazza con la sua facciata spigolosa anni 50 ed esternamente non è proprio attraente ma dentro lo hanno ristrutturato con gusto e eleganza.  La posizione è ottima affacciandosi sulla piazza d'Espanya che offre tutti i  collegamenti per la città e per l'aeroporto. Un buon hotel davvero.,4,2014,01,19
47,La mejor vista al Montjuic,"Es un hotel grande La atención es  lenta y poco personalizada , sin embargo tienen un muy buen desayuno y una excelente ubicación. Lo mejor, disfrutar de una comida en la terraza de la ex-Plaza de Toros La Monumental, hoy convertido en Centro Comercial, que se encuentra al lado del hotel. Lo negativo: mucha gente, movimientos, maletas en el lobby. Poca tranquilidad. Lo positivo: Piezas impecables (aunque chicas), buena vista, piscina en la terraza y spa.",4,2014,01,09
47,centrale e bello,"siamo stati in questa struttura solo qualche anno fa,tre se non ricordo male,e ne abbiamo un ottimo ricordo.
la posizione è invidiabile e vicina a tutto. nel periodo natale-epifania poi, l'avenida reina maria cristina tutta illuminata che porta alle fantastiche fontane di montjuic è uno spettacolo da non perdere.
ottimo giudizio anche sulla colazione ed il personale.",4,2014,01,06
47,Capodanno perfetto,"Non è la prima volta che soggiorniamo in questo hotel, ed, ancora una volta, ci siamo trovati benissimo.
Alla reception personale solerte e cortese, ci ha proposto  la colazione a 10€ ed, avendola già provata, abbiamo accettato immediatamente.(Confermo che è abbondantissima e gustosa con cibi preparati al momento, ottima varietà sia di dolce che salato )  La posizione è eccezionalmente comoda per i trasporti in metro e per l'Aerobus, ma questo è già stato detto...il valore aggiunto di questo viaggio sono stati gli spettacoli di luci alle fontane, suoni. acrobati e fuochi artificiali che si sono tenuti dopo le 23 in piazza Espanya.....noi, dopo una buona cena, ce li siamo goduti dalla ampia finestra della camera, in pantofole e fuori dalla folla !!!    Torneremo sicuramente",5,2014,01,05
47,Ponte Epifania,"Ottima posizione, comodo per ogni spostamento, camera ampia e spaziosa, bagno deludente. Perdite d' acqua da sopra il lavabo, manca lo  spazzolone per il Wc, la ventola aspirante non funziona. Il ricambio della carta igienica centellinato.",3,2014,01,05
47,"freundlicher Service, saubere Zimmer","Wir sind spontan eine Nacht nach Barcelona gereist und ohne Buchung ins Catalonia Barcelona Plaza gegangen. Wir haben sofort netten Service erfahren und die Zimmer waren für den Übernachtungspreis mehr als angemessen. Außerdem liegt das Hotel an der Busanbindung zum Flughafen, was eine Rückkehr dorthin ungemein erleichtert. Weiterhin liegt genau vor dem Hotel die U-Bahn, welche in sämtliche Richtungen fährt, so dass man sehr gut angebunden die Stadt erkunden kann. Ich kann das Hotel nur weiterempfehlen.",5,2014,01,03
47,SI  Y  NO,"Si a la habitación , limpia sin ruidos con vistas a la plaza España todo tal cual se ve en  la web pero el desayuno fue un ""caos"" , comedor lleno, cuando por fin nos sentamos resulta que apenas quedaba nada para comer tenias que conformarte con pequeñas porciones de lo que quedara y eso en un cuatro estrellas NO puede pasar . Entramos al comedor a las 9:45 y cerraba a las 10:30 teniendo en cuenta la subida de precios por ser el 31 me siento estafado.",3,2014,01,01
47,Una elección EXCELENTE,"Nuestra elección fue al principio por su ubicación por la comunicación que tiene desde Plaza España con el resto de Barcelona. El hotel es fantástico en todo: trato del personal de recepción, del comedor, de la limpieza, de la entrada. Siempre con una sonrisa todos.

A todo lujo, el personal ejemplo de amabilidad y profesionalidad, limpio, cuidado y bonito.

Delusione totale, alla faccia delle 4 stelle...",1,2013,10,27

El trato fue excepcional y todo el personal del hotel fue muy amable, en especial una chica y un chico que estaban en la recepción por la tarde. Si he de criticar algún aspecto, la antigüedad del hotel, que considero que se podria remodelar. 
Por otra parte el restaurante fue correcto, aunque por debajo del nivel del hotel. ",5,2013,10,02

47,POSIZIONE OTTIMA!,"Classico albergone anni 80, che dimostra il peso degli anni. Camere abbastanza spaziose, abbastanza pulite, cosi come il bagno. Peccato per la puzza di fumo, nonostante fosse una camere no smoker. Accappatoi, ciabattine di spugna e buone le amenities. Microfono della doccia mezzo scassato....avrebbe il tutto comunque bisogno di una rinfrescata. Buona la dotazione del frigo bar con prezzi molto ragionevoli (3€ una lattina di coca...come un qualsiasi bar di Milano...). Ottima la posizione: in pieno centro, con negozi, servizi, mezzi pubblici vicinissimi. La mia camera dava sulla piazza: vista eccellente, ma rumorosissima anche per la insonorizzazione pessima dei serramenti. Lo giudico complessivamente nella media, senza infamia e senza lode, tutto sommato lo consiglio...",3,2013,09,24
47,Buena relación calidad precio,"Me alojé en el hotel una noche por trabajo. El hotel me pareció correcto en líneas generales. Creo que lo más importante a destacar es la relación calidad – precio (cerca de los 100 euros la noche). La sensación es de relativa frialdad en la decoración de la recepción, pero las habitaciones son algo más acogedoras.

La limpieza es buena. El mobiliario es muy funcional, sin ningún alarde ni nada destacable. La ducha es de cortina de tela, lo cual destaco porque pensaba que habría desaparecido a estas alturas.  La televisión me pareció un poco pequeña en proporción con el tamaño de la habitación.  La calidad del sueño no es mala, aunque en mi caso la almohada me pareció excesivamente blanda, lo cual es algo muy personal. En cambio si tuve más dificultades con el aire acondicionado que se mantuvo en funcionamiento durante toda la noche sin posibilidad de apagarlo por completo.

En todo caso, considero que son pequeños detalles sin importancia.

El parking por noche supuso unos 22 euros. El hotel cuenta con wifi gratuito, con conexión diferente para habitaciones y para zonas comunes. En mi habitación la potencia de la señal era algo escasa. No probé la piscina. 

La ubicación no es mala. Barcelona es muy grande y no es la mejor zona, pero está cerca de cualquiera de las atracciones turísticas más céntricas, por lo que nuevamente entra en juego la buena relación calidad – precio.

Entre lo más positivo, el desayuno me pareció especialmente bueno. Era muy variado y de calidad, comparado con hoteles de similares características hoy por hoy en la ciudad.

En definitiva, el hotel está muy bien para lo que se paga por noche.",3,2013,09,12
47,Centralissimo!!,"Un albergo che merita tutte le 4 stelle! Le camere sono davvero ampie e pulite, vista su Plaza de Espana, servizi ottimi, piscina, area fitness e ristorante. Dalla hall e la sala relax alla sala colazione gli spazi sono ampi e ben organizzati. La colazione è internazionale è prevede davvero una ottima scelta di alimenti dai dolci al salato alle crepes/uova cucinate al momento come più preferite. Il reparto frutta e dolci è molto fornito. La struttura dell'albergo è curata ed efficiente.
La fermata della metro è proprio all'uscita dell'albergo e la linea è quella rossa che collega le principali fermate della città. 
Inoltre proprio accanto all'albergo si trova un centro commerciale molto famoso che resta aperto fino a tardi e una serie di ristorantini sempre aperti e popolati.

Insomma..che dire a questo albergo non manca proprio nulla. Un ottimo compromesso per una vacanza che sia di lavoro o di piacere.",4,2013,09,06
47,Un sogno,"Purtroppo sono stato una sola notte in questo hotel ma è stata una notte meravigliosa, ottimo servizio, stanze pulitissime anche il frigo in stanza, vista su plaza espana meravigliosa... Sintetizzando tutto meraviglioso",5,2013,09,04
47,hotelazo,"El hotel lo tiene todo, muy lujoso. Como en casi todos, la wifi lenta como ella sola. El servicio y personal geniales. El desayuno magnífico, mucha variedad, hay de todo, sobre todo frutas, cereales y bollería. Ah! También bebida de soja, que empiezan a tenerla en cuenta.",4,2013,09,03
47,Uno spettacolo,"Un hotel così non si trova facilmente non solo a barelona ma per il mondo. Le camere hanno una visuale spettacolare su plaza de espana, quando si entra sia nella recepion che nelle camere tutto profuma di pulito, moquette nelle stanza, bagni extralarge, letto comodissimo,panorama superlativo. Piscina in terrazzo al 7 piano un gioiellino. Super Hotel",5,2013,09,02
47,Buen hotel,"Lo mejor de este hotel es la ubicación en plaza España con un centro comercial al lado, una estación de metro y Montjuic a 2 minutos caminando. 

Me alojé en una habitación con vista a plaza España y al castillo de Montjuic fabulosa, la habitación grande limpia y Bien decorada, la cama muy buena, el baño completo. 

El desayuno buffet completo, el precio del hotel de acuerdo a su ubicación. ",4,2013,08,24
47,Posizione meravigliosa!,"Ho lasciato l albergo proprio ieri ed ancora ho negli occhi la bellezza del panorama che si ammira dal terrazza della piscina! Proprio sulla piazza più bella di Barcellona( piazza Espanya), appena esci dalla hall, subito una fermata della metro. Posizione centrale ma nn certo sulla cafone Rambla. Peccato le stanze che di 4 stelle non hanno nulla e neanche molto curate ne eccellemente pulite. Però ci tornerei per la magnifica posizione. Lo consiglio!!!",4,2013,08,23
47,"non vale il prezzo ...Letto rotto , muffa in bagno , camera doppia adattata a tripla ..non consigliabile","siamo tre amici di piu di 50anni cadauno ma abbastanza esperti in viaggi all estero , prenotiamo una camera tripla con Booking.com per una settimana dal 09 al 16 agosto 2013 eur 200 per notte ....arriviamo alle 09.30am e naturalmente la camera non e ancora pronta , lasciamo il nostro bagaglio e torniamo verso le ore 15 . attesa dii oltre 30 minuti in quanto solo 2 persone alla reception prendiamo  le chiavi della camera 214 - secondo piano su sette- posizione con vista interna su un cortile brutto e sporco . .......e all arrivo sorpresina .....una camera doppia adattata a tripla - i due letti normali misurano 110cm il terzo letto misura 70 cm ma e' visibilmente rotto . in camera vi e' da sedere solo per 2 persone , in bagno tracce di muffa sulle piastrelle sopra la vasca e accessori da bagno graffiati . Nonostante la richiesta di cambio di camera ( naturalmente l hotel era al completo ) dopo un altra mezzora di attesa alla reception  abbiamo chiamato Booking.com chiedendo di annullare la prenotazione. Pensiamo che queste GRANDI STRUTTURE debbano fornire sicuramente un servizio all altezza di cio che dicono di essere (4stelle) ma sopratutto debbano curare lo stato generale delle condizioni delle camere . Il personale non e' stato mai scortese ma sicuramente poteva fare di piu e meglio .....NESSUNO e' venuto a vedere/verificare quanto da Noi reclamato ......DA EVITARE . ADIOS",1,2013,08,16
47,Esperaba mejor servicio,"El hotel está muy bien ubicado y eso suma puntos a favor. El problema es que la recepcionista que nos atendió al llegar, Marta, nos trató mal y nos mintió cunado pedimos una habitación para no fumadores. Negó que hubiera ese tipo de habitaciones. Pasamos una noche en una habitación cuya puerta principal cerraba con dificultad porque había estado mojada la medera y la puerta del baño directamente no cerraba, además de que el olor a cigarrillo era insoportable. A la mañana siguiente otra recepcionista, Linda dijo que el hotel contaba con un único piso para fumadores, el 1° y era allí donde nos habían mandado. Finalmente logramos un cambio de habitación porque insistimos, pero Marta no se disculpó de su mentira, que era muy fácil de descubrir. Tampoco había suficientes cajas de seguridad para los huéspedes en la recepción y un hotel de esa categoría debía prestar el servicio dentro de la habitación.",2,2013,08,16
47,Eh...la mia suite!!!!,"Premetto che conosco Barcellona come le mie tasche e ho alloggiato in diversi alberghi decisamente ottimi sotto ogni aspetto, ma la vista che ci si è prospettata davanti questa volta ha di gran lunga il suo perché; quindi va bene che è un'albergone con tante stanze e pieno di gente, va bene che c'è un delirio di persone che entrano ed escono; ma quando alloggi nella Suite Reloj tutto questo passa il secondo piano! Siamo rimasti senza fiato, perché pur avendo alloggiato in posti con la vista sul Paseo de Gracia ed i monumenti di Gaudì, quando abbiamo aperto la porta della stanza al Catalonia Plaza e ci siamo trovati dentro Plaza Espanya con vista Montjiuc c'era ben poco da commentare! Suite di 2 piani con due bagni e tutti i comfort possibili ed immaginabili, dalla macchinetta Nespresso alle bottiglie d'acqua ed al doppio frigobar, salotto con divano, poltrone, tavolo di marmo, guardaroba e cyclette e piano superiore con letto King e materasso comodissimo, 2 televisori e un sistema di domotica per oscurare la vista 360° della piazza, il tutto nella cassa dell'orologio dell'hotel, un'esperienza assolutamente da ripetere perché mozzafiato! Rapporto qualità prezzo ottimo, in quanto siamo andati durante i mondiali di nuoto e potevamo pagare di più. Se proprio devo trovare un difetto....la piscina, per nulla in linea con gli standard dell'hotel!",5,2013,08,15
47,"Si vuelvo a Barcelona, repetiré este hotel","La habitación está muy bien, amplia, cálida, tranquila, sin ningún ruido. El cuarto de baño también es cómodo, excepto la bañera que está un poco alta para meterse. La cama muy cómoda. El buffet del desayuno es muy completo y bueno, hay de todo y la sala donde se sirve es muy grande y no había colas. Preciosas vistas desde la piscina en la planta 7. El hotel está muy bien situado, la zona es muy bonita con la fuente mágica justo enfrente, preciosa, y el Palacio de Montjuic. Metro y autobuses, bus turístico, en la misma puerta para conectar con el aeropuerto y el resto de la ciudad. Centro comercial Las Arenas al lado. Está todo ahí mismo. Todo el personal del hotel muy agradable y atento. Como digo más arriba, si puedo volver a Barcelona, volvería a este hotel. Es ideal para visitar la ciudad unos días.",4,2013,08,13
47,terraza piscina hotel,"ayer visite con unos amigos la terraza del hotel plaza catalonia en barcelona, donde se ubica la piscina, teniamos unos vales para mojitos y observe algunas deficiencias que no corresponden a un hotel de 4 estrellas . tumbunas en la zona piscina rotas y pocas, creo que el servicio de mantenimiento es nulo NO QUIERO PENSAR EN EL RESTO QUE NO VEEMOS.",2,2013,08,11
47,buenas vistas,"muy buena experiencia, solo estuvimos una noche en habitacion premium, con unas vistas excelentes a la plaza deEspaña, habitaciones amplias, con todo detalle.
La piscina no es muy grande pero lo suficiente para refrescarte un rato, y las vistas desde allí espectaculares.
El desayuno muy bien y el personal muy atento y eficiente.",5,2013,08,01
47,Suite del reloj impresionante,"Mi experiencia en este hotel ha sido excelente, me aloje a finales de julio y mi reserva era de una suite y me cambiaron a la suite del reloj la pena es que no habia bañera de hidromasaje pero fue una sorpresa muy buena y si no fuera menos tuvieron un detalle muy bonito con mi pareja y conmigo y es que nos subieron el desayuno a la habitacion sin tenerlo contratado. Sinceramente vale la pena repetir en este hotel.",5,2013,07,24
47,Nel cuore di Barcellona....... suoni e colori delle fonatane di fronte a Montjuic,hotel in posizione strategica: assistere e contemplare i giochi delle fontane con i loro suoni e colori è il motivo per cui scegiere questo hotel che offre ottimi servizi sia per le camere che per il cibo garantito nella qualità e nella quantità.,5,2013,07,23
47,Las vistas de noche,"No estuve alojado pero si que subí a la piscina ubicada en la septima planta justo después del spa y pude tomar uno de los mejores mojitos que he probado en mi vida pero además con unas vistas increibles, que solo por eso valdría la pena alojarse en el hotel y pagar los 200 € que cuesta más o menos. Mirar las fotos nocturnas y después opinad...",5,2013,07,06
47,"Ottima posizione, ma complessivamente migliorabile","Ho trascorso 4 notti al Barcelona Plaza, e devo dire che la posizione di questo albergo è notevole. A pochi minuti dall'aeroporto El Pratt (25 Euro di taxi per i più pigri o 6 Euro di Aerobus) dalla prospiciente Plaza Espanya si raggiunge praticamente in un attimo qualunque punto di Barcellona via Metro o Bus, le cui fermate sono praticamente all'uscita dell'Hotel. Inoltre il centro commerciale Las Arenas è a meno di 100 m, e li si trova qualche negozio interessante, un market e diversi ristoranti. La reception mi è sembrata confusa ma complessivamente il personale è gentile. Le stanze sono discrete come dimensione...magari l'arredamento è datato ma assolutamente decente. La colazione a buffet è abbondante e di buona qualità anche se le bevande calde (cappuccino ecc) ve le dovete preparare da soli alle macchinette. Veniamo ai punti dolenti. Non c'è un ferro da stiro disponibile nè in stanza nè alla reception, quindi se volete stirarvi una camicia last minute (come a me spesso capita) sono 6 Euro a botta. Le stanze sono rumorose....un po' per la strada (io ero al secondo piano) ma soprattutto per gli sciacquoni che emettono un rumore assordante. Quindi sentirete ogni santa volta che qualcuno va in bagno nelle stanze vicino alla vostra. Altro problema è il comfort del letto: materasso durissimo (scordatevi quelli americani) e cuscini piatti e stretti (!!!). La rete Wi-Fi è gratuita in stanza e nella hall ma mi è capitato spesso di non avere segnale per ore. La TV, invece, è grande e decente....non so dirvi del minibar perchè tipicamente lo evito. Personalmente ci tornerei perchè la posizione è veramente comoda, ma preferibilmente se ci sono delle offerte.",3,2013,07,06
47,Una muy buena opción,"Estuvimos alojados en la junior suite en el nivel de la piscina. La verdad es que todo fue estupendo y las vistas desde nuestra habitación eran de foto. La ubicación es inmejorable, justo delante tiene la boca del metro y justo al lado del Centro Comercial Las Arenas. Si es cierto que se nota que el hotel tiene ya algunos años, nuestra puerta no encajaba bien del todo y nos constó un poco entrar, y el baño tenía ese olor característico que tienen los baños que ya son un poco antiguos (aunque estaba perfectamente limpio). Por la mañana, sobre las 08:00h entró en la habitación la señora de la limpieza por error, pero no hubo ningún problema y se disculpó enseguida. A pesar de esas pequeñas anécdotas, si se tercia, no dudaría en volver a alojarme aquí.",4,2013,06,28
47,Quattro stelle?,"Sono stato ospite dell'albergo per 3 notti. Posizione molto bella, non c'è che dire, ma il prezzo e la qualifica dell'albergo sono decisamente sovra valutati. Assolutamente nessuna cortesia in camera (minibar completamente vuoto, nessuna possibilità di preparare te o caffè) e nessuna possibilità di connessione wifi nelle camere. E pensare che sono stata ospite nell'ambito di un congresso internazionale! Spero che Barcellona possa offrire di meglio.",1,2013,06,27
47,Demasiado turístico,"Fui de viaje de trabajo y percibí excesivo movimiento turístico que no me agradó.
Realmente, está ubicado en un lugar cercano a la Fira (palacio de congresos y exposiciones), cerca de Monjuic. No es na zona excesivamente atractiva, en mi opinión, y no hay lugares agradables para tomar algo o picotear. 
El personal me pareció amable, correcto. El hotel es considerablemente grande. Las habitaciones están nuevas y son amplias. La decoración es agradable, película cursi, ideal para ir en pareja.
La configuración del baño-ducha, estilo americano. No hay un baño como tal. El lavabo está en la habitación.
La ducha es una cabina maravillosa.
Lo que menos me gustó fue el salón de desayunos: parecía una plaza abarrotada de gente. Un hormiguero. La calidad del bufete bastante justita.",3,2013,05,29
47,Buen hotel pero le falta en atencion a los huespedes,"Es un buen hotel, muy bien situado, tiene a 50 metros la entrada a el metro, las habiataciones son grandes, limpias y agradables, se descansa bastante bien, los desayunos son buenos y variados.

Lo malo es el servicio hacia el huesped, particularmente las personas de la recepcion quienes nunca estuvieron prestos a atender los requerimientos que hice y no mostraron ningun interes en el bienestar del huesped, en una ocasion pase 10 minutos esperando que alguien en la recepcion me atendiera, una cadena como esta no deberia tener un personal tan mal entrenado y con poca o ninguna vocacion de servicio al cliente.",4,2013,05,22
47,+magnifica situación+,"Fuimos a pasar un fin de semana de relax, y la verdad es que lo conseguimos, teniamos una habitación en la 8 planta i disfrutavamos de unas vistas de la Avenida Maria Cristina y de la montaña de Montjuic. La cama era gigantesca y el salón de la habitación era muy acogedor. El trato del servició es muy agradable y atento.
La ubicación del hotel es muy buena porque esta muy bien comunicado con el resto de la ciudad via bus, metro y taxi, asimismo al lado del hotel hay el recinto ferial de montjuic
y el centro comercial las arenas.",4,2013,05,20
47,EXCELENTE UBICACION,"Excelente ubicacion, el autobus del aeropuerto tiene una parada frente al hotel, la estacion del metro esta muy cerca y el centro comercial Arena esta a menos de 200 metros, donde encuentras restaurantes y almacenes de todo tipo. La habitacion que nos dieron era muy amplia y confortable, la atencion del personal muy buena. Lo recomendamos plenamente.
 
La caja de seguridad de la habitacion es antigua y para poderla usar debes pedir el mecanismo de cierre y la llave en la recepcion, debes dejar un deposito de 50 euros.",5,2013,05,15
47,de lo mejor en Barcelona,"+ Tenía una habitación estandar pero por 15€ más por la noche cogí una superior con vistas en la plaza españa, con lo cual me quedé muy satisfecho. Diría que es bastante caro pero la habitación es muy buena, junto con las vistas se puede decir que vale la pena su precio. 

+ enfrente estación de metro, con linea directa al centro, y también a unos metros del centro comercial las arenas.

- La unica pega es que había olor a cigarro que al principio no esta claro de donde procede, sin embargo lo más probable es que salga desde la ventilación en la habitación.",5,2013,05,11
47,"Hotel precioso, personal atento...","Pase dos noches en el hotel.. la habitacion en la 5planta tenia unas vistas increibles sobre la plaza.
la habitacion bonita, con cama gigante!

Tiene gimnasio y spa (este no esta incluido en el precio) ademas de una terraza con piscina y preciosas vistas.

El desayuno buffet vale 10€... 

Ah! tomamos unos vinos en el bar de abajo y los precios son muy económicos (1€/vino!)

Volvere! ",4,2013,05,01
47,Molto bello,"Ho soggiornato in un a suite all'ottavo piano con una bellissima vista sulla Fontana Montjuic che alla sera viene illuminata con diversi colori e una bella visuale di Barcellona. Accolti in modo molto gentile dal personale. La stanza o meglio ""alloggio"" è veramente grande e con tutti i confort, 2 televisori, macchina caffè con Nespresso, vasca da bagno incassata a pavimento, doccia con getti laterali. Colazione internazionale, dal salato al dolce e chi si lamenta non capisco cosa vorrebbe in più da mangiare. Macchine per latte, caffè, cappuccino semplici da utilizzare e con prodotti validi. Il personale che abbiamo incontrato molto gentile e disponibile e ci ha consigliato sempre bene su visite e ristoranti. La posizione è molto comoda per raggiungere il centro, la metropolitana è proprio di fronte all'hotel e con un treno si raggiunge direttamente Plaza Catalunya (5 fermate). Sempre di fronte all'uscita ci sono le fermate dei bus turistici per fare il giro della città. Proprio a fianco si trova Las Arenas, un grosso centro commerciale. I taxi sono a buon prezzo",5,2013,04,30
47,"Excelente ubicación, vistas y servicio","Iba a pasar el fin de semana en Barcelona en el Hotel Vueling y me reubicaron en una suite del Catalonia Barcelona Plaza. Un servicio excelente, las vistas a Montjuic increíbles desde la novena planta, cama muy cómoda y almohadas firmes. El cuarto de baño gigante con bañera circular y el servicio muy atento en todas nuestras peticiones. La insonorización es muy buena, pero las sirenas de ambulancias o coches policiales se escuchan como no puede ser de otra forma. Volveré sin duda.",5,2013,04,24
47,Para repetir,"Nos alojamos una noche y todo perfecto. Para empezar, el trato excelente (¡gracias, Mariana!), el desayuno espectacular (hasta te hacen la tortilla en el momento con los ingredientes que quieras), wifi gratis, habitación muy amplia y cómoda, y por supuesto muy limpio y moderno. Una pena no haber tenido tiempo de probar el spa y la piscina.

Colazione ottima sia nazionale che internazionale. Pranzo a buffet: c'era davvero di tutto. Ampia hall con tavolini e comodi divanetti. Camere ottime molto comode, servizi igienici buoni e funzionali. Stupenda la piscina da cui ho assistito ad uno spettacolo pirotecnico unite a giochi d'acqua delle fontane situtate di fronte l'hotel. Il personale è un pò freddino. Per il resto un'ottima qualità-prezzo per chi si vuol godere al meglio un piccolo weekend a Barcelona.",5,2013,04,17

47,Gran hotel,"Hemos pasado ahi la semana santa. La verdad que el hotel es una pasada. Tiene un hall bastante grande. Habitaciones amplias, cuarto de baño grande, camas grandes. Wifi gratis en la hbitacion (no todos los hoteles de 4* pueden decir lo mismo). Parada de metro en la puerta. Feria Barcelona y Montuic solo cruzando la calle. Además, tiene una terraza con una mini piscina con unas vistas espectaculares. Lo peor, las camas un poco incomodas y que la recepción siempre estaba llena de gente (además de alojamiento tienen servicio de conferencias). En definitiva, muy recomendable!",5,2013,04,03
47,Buen hotel frente a la fira,"Muy buen hotel, confortable y bien situado, frente a la fira, metro a la puerta y todos los servicios, incluido spa, masaje, piscina, parking, etc. Precio de fin de semana atractivo para su categoria.

Nos alojamos allí la semana pasada por negocios y no puedo por menos que agradecer la excelente disposición, profesionalidad y calidez de trato que nos brindó todo el equipo equipo humano del Catalonia Barcelona, desde la recepción al restaurante, y al servicio de limpieza de habitaciones. 
Muchas gracias a todos, especialmente a Marta por ayudarnos a encontrar el usb perdido. 
Esperamos poder contar de nuevo con Catalonia en futuras ocasiones.",4,2013,03,23
47,tristemente comune,"inizierò la recensione commentandone il titolo: niente di entusiasmante, tutto nella media, compresi i disguidi/difetti.
bagni con qualche componente arrugginito.
servizio pulizia camera: cafoni che non solo non bussano, ma entrano in stanza mentre ti trovi dentro (3 volte in 2 notti).
pranzo: quasi si seccano di cucinarti, e si mangia male..ma non è che a Barcellona abbia mangiato davvero bene altrove, per la verità.
riscaldamento stanza: non si può escludere. premetto che sono freddolosa, ma io e tutta la mia famiglia abbiamo sofferto con un condizionamento della stanza che non si può escludere, nè regolare, ed è impostato a tantissimi gradi..si secca l'aria, che diventa irrespirabile, e con essa anche le fauci, gli occh..un vero disastro (mio marito poi si è ammalato per 5 giorni successivi).
cortesia: nella media
capacità di risolvere i problemi: scarsa per via dell'assenza di elasticità;
attenzione al cliente: scarsa
posizione: almeno quella, discretamente buona...
costo: contenuto nella media, anche un pò al di sotto per essere un albergo centrale.
insomma...esperienza tendenzialmente negativa!
un hotel così grande dovrebbe avere più personale per poter dedicare attenzione al cliente, e rimodernare la parte strutturale e funzionale delle stanze e degli ambienti.",2,2013,03,01

La estancia ha sido muy cálida, y las vistas son estupendas, nos ha molestado un poco el ruido, creo que es normal por el lugar en donde esta situado. Nosotros lo recomendamos",5,2013,02,10
47,Mittelmässiges Hotel an zentraler Lage,"Direkt an der Plaza Espana gelegen, Metro vor der Tür, neben der Arena und direkt gegenüber der Fira Barcelona. Der Service und die Freundlichkeit beim Ein- und Auschecken waren mässig. Die Zimmer waren recht gross, wer einen guten Blick auf die Plaza Espana oder auf die Arena möchte, muss Verkehrslärm in Kauf nehmen, die Zimmer zum Innenhof bieten Ruhe. Das Hotel hat zum Glück keinen Teppichboden in den Zimmern und Gängen, allerdings verursacht der Kunststoffboden einen hohen Trittschall. Die Betten sind o.k., die Klimaanlage liess sich nicht regulieren und heizte ausschliesslich. Der Safe im Zimmer war defekt, liess sich nicht schliessen und die Duschbrause funktionierte auch nicht richtig. Das WLAN war gratis, ein Pluspunkt.

47,Todo muy bien... Menos el RUIDO.,"El hotel está muy bien ubicado, la limpieza de las habitaciones es excelente, el desayuno esta perfecto.. en definitiva, muy bien..
El gran fallo que tiene es que el aislamiento brilla por su ausencia. Las habitaciones que dan a la rotonda de plaza de España soportan un ruido vestial. Pitidos, bocinazos, ambulancias, coches, motos.... todo lo que pasa por la rotonda de plaza de España se siente en las habitaciones que dan hacia la rotonda, que son la mayoria. Para mi nada recomendable en ese sentido, no repito en ese hotel, únicamente por el tema del ruido y si repito, please, no me den una habitación que mire a la rotonda de plaza de España.

47,Mostrar mi agradecimiento por el servicio y el trato recibido,"Estimados Sres.,

Queria a través de estas lineas, mostrar mi agradecimiento por el trato recibido el pasado dia 4 de enero por la noche.

Fuí una de las pasajeras que decidió abandonar el avión de ryanair cuya experiencia se relata en esta noticia:

http://www.abc.es/sociedad/20130107/abci-ryanair-fallo-electrico-201301061319.html

Llegué al hotel sobre las 23,30 horas. Cansada, con sensación de abandono, de impotencia... En la recepción me atendió un chico amabilísimo, no sé su nombre, pero tiene barba, me recibió con mi ficha de check-in preparada, recordando mi reciente estancia en el hotel (también llegué a una hora similar en aquella ocasión, al ser una escala en mi viaje).
Me dice que no va a poder darme una habitación de la categoría superior que me dió la otra vez, pero que también iba a estar muy bien en ésta.
No solo he estado más que contenta con las habitaciones, sino por su cordialidad, hospitalidad, comprensión ante mi situación, la ayuda que me brindaron en todo momento para poder hacer una nueva reserva de vuelo (yo no disponia de portatil)... todo.  En general, fue maravillosa la atención del personal que se encontraba en recepción, pero más concretamente la de este chico y otra chica por la mañana, que fueron los que me atendieron.

No queria dejar de hacerles llegar mi agradeciminto. Por supuesto, que este será mi hotel en Barcelona a partir de ahora.

Un cordial saludo.",5,2013,01,14

La habitación grande y con hermosas vistas.

Si volvemos algún día a Barcelona iremos nuevamente a este hotel.",5,2013,01,07
47,Hotel accogliente,"L'hotel é posizionato in plaza Espanya. Ottimo punto e servito dalla metropolitana proprio davanti alla porta. A pochi metri si trova l'Arena, fantastico centro commerciale con supermercato, vari ristoranti e una terrazza da dove ammirare tutta la piazza e il museo Mnac poco più in alto. Situato a 4 soste di metro dalla Rambla. I ragazzi alla reception si arrangiano con l'italiano e sono tutti gentilissimi. Colazione internazionale non ricchissima ma buona. Non ho provato il ristorante. Camere carine con televisione lcd e canali rai.
Sicuramente ritornerò qui la prossima volta.",5,2013,01,04
47,Buon Hotel 4 stelle posizione centralissima,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo Hotel dal 30 dicembre 2012 al 3 gennaio 2013; ha l'enorme pregio di essere in posizione centrale (Plaza Espana), con la metro a un passo (due linee, L1 e L3) e di fronte la fermata del bus per l'aeroporto (consigliatissimo, passa ogni 5 minuti) 
La struttura è nella media per un 4 stelle; mi hanno però deluso i bagni, vecchiotti, con le porte scrostate , mentre vale la pena pagare un extra per la 1 colazione, sia continentale che italiana e con un caffé degno di questo nome; sulla terrazza c'è una bella piscina con una vista splendida sulla piazza, e sullo sfondo la fonte magica
Tutto sommato ci tornerei",3,2013,01,04
47,Policultural recepcion y amabilidad en todas partes,"He estado alojado solo tres dias en este hotel de excelente ubicacion, con dos metros justo en la puerta, la montaña de Montjuic enfrente, un centro comercial recien abierto en una de las plazas de toros en deshuso gracias a la ley antitaurina de cataluña, provengo de una familia hostelera de Mexico y aunque mi profesion es la de arquitecto he vivido en hoteles toda mi vida, he de comentar que me encantó al llegar a este hotel elegido al azar, por que desconocia la ciudad pero no la cadena, me impresionó la entrada al hotel grande amplia, tan grande y diversa como la recepcion ( una recepcion Policultural o Multiracial) , yo haría cambios en la decoracion ,la veo poco renovada solo parece que han cambiado mobiliario, no la decoracion paretal y la esencia del hotel que creo es de la epoca de las Olimpiadas, las habitaciones( yo tuve la suerte de tener una habitacion Premium sin cargo adicional y disfrute de esas ventajas, vistas muy buenas, una cama grande,etc..), subí al gym pero era para mi un poco escaso, la piscina no está climatizada y si noeres un valiente es dificil disfrutar de ella en invierno, eso si las vistas son magnificas( eché de menos un barecito en esa terraza que parece que no aprovechan, ya que el único bar abierto en la noche es un Piano Bar para mi triste si no es por el personal que alli estaba), el Restaurante Filigranas (de nombre muy torero cercano a la plaza) es recomendable, buenas carnes, y alguna delicia catalana, (las chicas del Restaurante ""Lo Mejor"") ,tb me pasé por el Monja, excelente jamon y buenos vinos. Cuando me acerqué a preguntar e informarme  a la Multiracial recepcion, daba igual cual fuera el momento para preguntar ellos estaban allí para informarme, para comentarme algo de la ciudad, (que vi que conocen y descubrieron lo que yo quería) quedé encantado con sus indicaciones, no se si volveré pero sin duda será mi eleccion en esta ciudad.

A la direccion le comentaria que deben hacer reformas mayores, cambiar el estilo del hotel que parece ya antiguo, un barecito en la terraza utilizando quizas esas habitaciones que estan en la torre del hotel a pie de Piscina o el Spa sería una buena Opcion, el Piano Bar lo cambiaria de ubicacion quizás tocando a la calle, cambiandolo de sitio entraria mas gente aunque se perderia la amena conversacion del mesero, la recepcion debe modernizarse en extructura. de todas maneras para el Turista esto son cosas inapreciables, solo arquitectos como yo y gente de la hosteleria pueden observarlo, disculpen si me entrometo en algo de Direccion personal pero creo que ustedes leen o deben leer estas opiniones y saber valorarlas en toda su extension, y amarren ese personal que es excelente, da igual si son las graciosas chicas de pisos, la estupenda recepcion o los meseros y meseras de Restaurantes Filigranas, Scotch bar, Garden Buffet,o Monja.",5,2012,12,29
47,Fantástico,"El personal de recepción es muy amable y además he tenido la inmensa suerte de que me dieran una suite impresionante, inmensa, con unas vistas maravillosas (lástima que no llevaba la cámara). 
Me he sentido muy privilegiada. Todo un lujo. MIL GRACIAS!!",5,2012,12,24
47,NOS HICIERON SENTIR COMO PRINCESAS,"La amabilidad del personal de ese hotel nos hicieron sentir como princesas. Reservamos una habitación doble por internet con oferta y cual fué nuestra sorpresa que nos dieron una suite la 801+802 de la terraza del octavo piso, con vistas impresionantes frente a los jardines del Palacio de Montjuich, plaza de España y centro comercial Las Arenas, vaya un espectáculo, la suite de enorme espacio,   equipada con 2 TV, con una enorme bañera, ducha de chorros, 2 baños, sala de estar con dobles sofás muy bien equipada de mobiliario, cafetera, Wifi gratuito, vaya un lujo y más cuando no lo esperas. El restaurante Filigrana nos encanto y por ser huespedes del Plaza nos hicieron un 20 % de dto. en la factura. Muy bien conectado por la boca de metro. Si lo tengo que puntuar para mi ha sido un 10.",5,2012,12,22
47,"Hotel genial, con personal muy amable y muy bien situado","Elegimos este hotel para hacer noche antes de coger un vuelo, y acertamos plenamente .No hicieron sentir como en casa . Unas grandes instalaciones, un magnifico desayuno y un parking muy amplio.
Al dia siguiente cogimos un autobus justo en la puerta que nos llevo al aeropuero.

Cuando volvamos a bercelona , volveremos sin duda.",5,2012,12,22
47,Ottima struttura,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel che ha una posizione davvero invidiabile. A parte il fatto che è collegato in modo ottimale con il centro di Barcellona sia con la metro sia con gli autobus, è anche ben collegato con l'aeroporto (la fermata dell'airbus è proprio davanti l'hotel). La struttura è quella di un buon quattro stelle, con camere soprattutto pulite e poi molto spaziose e con grande bagno (il nostro aveva anche la vasca!!!!). La vista poi su Montjuïc indescrivibile! L'unico piccolo neo...il riscaldamento centralizzato! Mai sofferto tanto il caldo...",4,2012,12,22
47,Barcellona bellissima !,"Ho soggiornato assieme al mio ragazzo a inizio dicembre in questo hotel.
E' un 4 stelle, molto grande e centralissimo; a due passi dalla metropolitana per poter raggiungere qualsiasi posto di Barcellona.
Personale molto disponibile e gentile (l'ultimo giorno ci hanno tenuto i bagagli in hotel in quanto avevamo il volo alle 20.00 e quindi siamo riusciti a visitare altri posti).
Non abbiamo usufruito della colazione in quanto era un pò cara e abbiamo sempre fatto colazione in bar piuttosto a buon mercato (apparte un piccolo bar vicino alla Sagrada Familia che per 2 brioches e 2 caffè ci ha fatto spendere 10.80 € ......... ).
A due passi dall'hotel c'è un grande centro commerciale ""Las Arenas"" che, oltre a negozi, dispone anche di molti ristoranti/tavole calde dove poter mangiare.
Se proprio vogliamo trovare un aspetto un pò negativo di questo hotel è che in bagno, il lavandino faceva fatica a scaricare l'acqua e la nostra stanza dava direttamente sulla strada che ovviamente era molto trafficata; ma per il resto tutto molto buono e la camera era bella spaziosa.",4,2012,12,21
47,"Buen hotel , pero le sobran los grupos.","Se que lo que voy a comentar es un poco incongruente,  estuve en el Plaza para un congreso/reunion de mi empresa, habitualmente los hacemos en diferentes hoteles de Barcelona y de Madrid, esta vez me tocó desplazarme a este hotel, el hotel en si no esta mal, comparti habitacion con ods compañeras mas, la triple es una habitacion interior sin mas, como la de cualquier hotel, se nota el paso de los grupos, en la epoca en la que hemos estado habia uno o varios grupos de turistas (no sabria decir si turcos, Israelies o arabes) estaba la recepcion que daba pena, no se movian de alli, comian, se traian comida de la calle, no parecia que estabamos en un hotel de 4 estrellas,pero solo por estos clientes, el personal de recepcion bueno en su justa medida, serviciales, informan de los que se les pregunta,etc.. la limpieza bien tambien, el restaurante bueno sobretodo el Filigrana, comida de brasas excelente, el buffet de desayuno, pues eso un buffet de desayunos donde los grupos de turistas llenan sus platos a reventar que luego dejan sin comer, una perdida de dinero en los tiempos qu estamos, lo dicho buen hotel pero si siguen teniendo este tipo de turista /grupo, se convertira en un hotel de playa en la ciudad tipo Salou como hemos visto tanto ultimamente por la tele.",5,2012,12,19
47,Un hotel 4**** muy cómodo y bien conectado,"Este hotel se encuentra en frente de la Fira de Barcelona y cabe resaltar que está super bien comunicado ya que frente la puerta está la entrada al Metro y a FGC.
Las habitaciones son amplias y cómdas, con baño con bañera, un buen escritorio y buena conexión WIFI gratuita. Muy limpia e insonorizada.
El desayuno está muy completo, con muchos zumos, embutido, surtido de frutas y cocina abierta.
El personal es muy amable.",4,2012,12,17
47,ottimo albergo,"Ottima la posizione, ottimi i collegamenti con l'aeroporto e con il resto della città e ottima l'attenzione al cliente. Noi abbiamo preso una bellissima suite per un prezzo più che accettabile e tutto si è rivelato superiore alle aspettative. La stanza gode di una vista stupenda, è ampia, caldissima e pulitissima. La vasca da bagno circolare con vista sull'esterno da sola vale l'intera spesa. Proprio davanti l'albergo c'è il centro commerciale Las Arenas, ricavato dall'ex arena de toros: comodissimo per gli acquisti dell'ultima ora e per mangiare qualcosa di buono quando si torna stanchi dal giro della città. Albergo consigliatissimo da tutti i punti di vista.",5,2012,12,10
47,Cuando el hotel se convierte en un protagonismo de tu viaje,"Hemos estado alojados en este hotel los días 6,7 y 8 de Diciembre. Somos un matrimonio con un hijo de 15 años. La intención era pasar unos días en Barcelona ( el puente de la Constitución) y buscamos un hotel que estuviese bien comunicado y una buena relación calidad / Precio. Pedimos un habitación exterior y, ante la imposibilidad de darnos una habitación triple, exterior y con un nivel optimo de confort, nos ofrecieron la Suite del Reloj.

Un obsequio que no valoramos en su justa medida hasta que no vimos la habitación. Se trata de una suite de dos plantas con vistas a la plaza de Espanya y los jardines del palacio de Monjuit ( ahora el museo nacional de arte catalán). Las vistas son espectaculares y el espacio; el nivel de confort hace que te sientas como en casa. 

Esta habitación que no tiene número en la puerta ( 442 ), que pone SR ( Suite del Reloj), te sorprende, ya, desde el pasillo. Cuando entras; la luz, el espacio, las vistas. la distibución, la calidad y cantidad de servicios, te sorprende todavía má... Este hotel superó todas nuestras expectativas. En especial, la atención del personal de recepción donde Meritxel, que es como se llama la chica que nos atendió, supo ver que lo esperabamos del hotel y se encargó, personalmente, de hacerlo realidad. Nos hemos sentido especialmente tratados y con la sensación de que ese trato era la norma en este hotel... un 10, en todo...
Como nota negativa, por poner algo que les ayude a mejorar, la moqueta de la habitación está pidiendo una reforma...",5,2012,12,09
47,Absolutamente recomendable,"En primer lugar quiero destacar la amabilidad del personal de recepción, pues son sumamente amables y hemos recibido un trato exquisito. Nos alojamos en una habitación muy confortable, limpia, insonorizada y con unas estupendas vistas (creo que era una Premium). El desayuno buffet es abundante y variado y con zumos naturales. Nosotros no llegamos a usar la piscina pero es otro aliciente más. 
La verdad es que de este hotel no tenemos ninguna queja y nuestra estancia de dos noches fue verdaderamente placentera. Pero es que además tiene una ubicación magnífica, en plena Plaza de España, que cuenta con una red de comunicaciones excelente (creo que la mejor de Barcelona). A la puerta del hotel hay una estación de metro, parada de taxis y también del Aerobús, que es el medio que utilizamos nosotros desde y hacia el aeropuerto (a solo dos paradas concretamente). Y enfrente, la parada de los buses turísticos, amén de infinidad de líneas de buses urbanos que tienen parada en la plaza de España. Y, para completar las comunicaciones, a tiro de piedra se encuentra la estación de Sants. 
Lo dicho, un hotel absolutamente recomendable. Por todo.",5,2012,11,21
47,100% recomendable,"¡De los mejores hoteles en los que hemos estado! El trato desde que entramos por la puerta fue excelente y nos dieron todo tipo de facilidades  e indicaciones. La habitación era espectacular, grande, comoda y con unas vistas increibles de la Pl. España por un lado y del Tibidabo por el otro. La cena la hicimos en el restaurante del hotel y salimos encantados tanto con la comida como con la atención personal. Para acabar bien con toda esta experiencia, el desayuno: Buffet libre con una gran variedad de comida recien hecha (tanto salado como dulce). En resumen, LO RECOMIENDO A TODO EL MUNDO",5,2012,11,11
47,Suite del reloj (hab. 412) espectacular,"Nuestro paso por la suite del reloj del hotel Catalonia Barcelona Plaza nos ha dejado un sabor de boca muy agradable. Las vistas son absolutamente maravillosas y te sientes dentro de una caja de un reloj... mientras todo el mundo mira el reloj desde la plaza de Espanya de Barcelona al otro lado de sus cristales estás tú... y eso no deja de tener su morbo. Esta habitación es un duplex, con sala de reuniones y sala de estar abjo y el domritorio en la parte de arriba. Limpieza correcta y trato muy agradable, con una muy buena relación calidad-precio (ojo, es más caro reservar a través de la web del hotel que a través de páginas web especializadas en reservas). Sólo echamos en falta una venta que pudiera abrirse (al ser todas las ventanas la parte de atrás del reloj de la plaza están todas selladas) y quizás el ruedo del minutero al desplazarse en mitad de la noche. Habitación muy erótica!",4,2012,11,06
47,LO MEJOR DE LO MEJOR,"Hemos estado alojados en este hotel del 2 al 4/11/2012 y es de los mejores hoteles que hemos estado. Por 25€ + nos dieron una habitacion con las vistas a la plaza de España impresionantes, en el cuarto de baño albornoz y zapatillas, agua, bombones todos los dias a las 6 de la tarde, tetera con infusiones y cafe. Y lo mejor de todo el desayuno, todo recien hecho hasta el pan, los cafes con leche pascual y cafe recien molido, bueno una maravilla la proxima vez que viaje a barcelona ni me lo pienso desde luego ire otra vez a ese hotel y por 75€+ me alojare en la suite que debe de ser impresionante.Aunque sea un poco mas caro vale la pena lojarse en este hote.
SIN NINGUN TIPO DE DUDA LO RECOMIENDO.",5,2012,11,04
47,Ottima posizione stanze pulite e spaziose,"L'albergo èin un'ottima posizione proprio sulla piazza d'Espanya, le stanza sono spaziose e pulite,garage privato a pagamento ( un po' caro .....22€ al giorno) ma comodo.
Non abbiamo provato la colazione e il ristorante dell'albergo......con tutti i posti carini in cui andare ci sembrava uno spreco!!!!! Consigliamo stanza interna, quelle sulla piazza , pur dando una vista bellissima, sono troppo rumorose.",4,2012,11,02
47,"Muy buen hotel, muy buena ubicación","Lo mejor de este hotel sin duda, es la ubicación, en pleno centro, paradas de metro al lado, plaza españa. montjuic, el centro comercial las arenas  etc.
La habitación muy confortable,pero sin demasiado lujo. Eso sí, la piscina demasiado concurrida y con mucho bullicio.
Repetiría sin dudarlo si no fuera por el precio, que me parecio algo caro",4,2012,10,09
47,"Ottima posizione, migliorare la pulizia","Sito in Plaça de Espana, fronte fontane, è un luogo ideale per visitare la città e per eventi presso la vecchia Fiera: l'Aerobus (sia per il T1 che per il T2 dell'aeroporto El Prat) si trova di fronte all'hotel, costa 5,75€ a persona. Hall di medio-grandi dimensioni con molti tavolini/divani per incontri di affari, wi-fi gratuito, poco personale al check-in per le dimensioni. Abbiamo deciso per un upgrade a Business per 50€notte in più rispetto alla tariffa base, devo dire che ne vale a pena: sala riunioni e salotto con TV da una parte, 2 bagni, 1 con solo WC, l'altro con doccia separata da una vasca rotonda interrata tipo jacuzzi, e dall'altra parte una camera che può essere o con letti singoli o matrimoniale con TV. Buona fornitura da bagno, la pulizia dello stesso non è assolutamente all'altezza: siccome i tappi degliscarichi sono corti, bisogna spesso estrarre la pipetta per far scendere l'acqua sia dei lavandini che del bidet e la sorpresa è trovare peli/capelli di ogni tipo...per una camera da quasi 200€/gg direi che è inaccettabile e cmq chi si occupa della pulizia se ne può render conto immediatamente dall'odore persistente che si sente nei bagni. Non abbiamo consumato colazione in hotel (non compresa, costa 16€gg/persona) ma ci siamo accontentati di cappuccio e briosche in un bar a 20m dall'hotel. Abbiamo consumato il cocktail di benvenuto (un ""Cava"" = bicchiere di spumante spagnolo) alla Cafeteria, il personale non è stato molto cordiale, quasi scocciato. Il primo giorno ci hanno portato verso le 8PM una bottiglia d'acqua naturale e un piatto di frutta offerto dalla direzione e la sera successiva 2 bon bon di cioccolato di bassa qualità. Nel complesso mi sento di dire che è un buon hotel ma che deve migliorare nel servizio di pulizia ed attenzione al cliente. Check out molto rapido.",3,2012,10,06
47,location perfetta,"Non è il nostro primo soggiorno a Barcellona, ma mai abbiamo trovato un hotel che abbia così a pieno soddisfatto le nostre aspettative.
Strutura molto bella con camere ampie e molto pulite, avevamo prenotato una camera standard , invece, con nostro sommo piacere, abbiamo avuto una stanza affacciata lateralmente su Plaza Espana....vista spettacolare!!!
Abbiamo avuto una accoglienza veramente calorosa e,dopo il velocissimo check in, abbiamo trascorso un pò di tempo nella hall spettando amici che ci dovevano raggiungere ed abbiamo potuto aprezzarne la bellezza il confort la connessione wifi e la possibilità di privacy pur in uno spazio così ampio.
Ottima la colazione !!
La posizione ,infine è ottimale per l'aerobus diretto all'areoporto, per la metro (2 linee con fermata di fronte all'hotel),e per la presenza del Centro las Arenas con negozi e ristoranti per tutti i gusti,
Non abbiamo goduto della terrazza e della piscina perchè il tempo non era ottimale, ma sarà una otttima scusa per poterci tornare e spero presto !!!!!",5,2012,10,04
47,Maravilloso y espectacular,"El hotel plaza catalonia, sin duda una buena elección si se trata de ubicarse en Barcelona, al lado esta la estacion del metro que directo te lleva a las ramblas, al lado derecho pasa el bus turístico, y en frente esta una parada donde se toma el bus que te lleva al aeropuerto, por lo que lo considero estratégico en relación al transporte, al lado izquierdo esta un centro comercial Las arenas (era la plaza de toros) donde si eres turista presentas el pasaporte y las facturas de tus compras mayores a 100 euros y te reintegran los impuestos, en este CC esta un asensor panoramico que tiene una vista maravillosa de la plaza espana, si tiene suerte solicite que lo ubiquen con vista a la plaza espana y desde el jueves comienza a disfrutar de la font de montjuic realmente hermoso y un espectáculo que no se debe perder, si no le dan vista a la plaza no importa tiene la ventaja que no escuchara el ruido de los carros, allí mismo se toma el bus que hace el tour al Monserrat, espero que este comentario sea de utilidad, se me olvidaba , para los venezolanos al lado antes de cruzar para el CC las arenas esta una venta de arepas. Muy buenas y precios solidarios.",5,2012,09,16
47,Mal trago en la piscina,"En las normas escritas de la piscina no pone que no puedes entrar con tu bebida,cosa que si pone que no puedes entrar con la comida y otras normas  de las cuales no entraré en detalle,para mi asombro veo que el camarero de turno me llama la atención por tomar un smirnoff ice con mi mujer tranquilamente, el por que, por que esta prohibido tomar bebidas en la piscina cosa que NO pone en las normas de uso de dicha piscina y SI pone por ejemplo que se use gorro de baño pero eso les da igual y NO llaman la atención a nadie,yo vi con mis propios ojos a gente con bebidas NO COMPRADAS en el ""bar"" por llamarlo de alguna manera y no les decían nada, en fin un abuso una discriminación y un atropello, mi mujer se fue llorando a la habitación al ver el mal trato recibido y hacernos sentir como unos delincuentes.",1,2012,09,10
47,Ottimo!,"Avendo soggiornato solo una notte non ho molto da aggiungere se non che mantiene ciò che promette.
Ottima l'accoglienza, la stanza ed i servizi in genere.
Il buffet a colazione è di tipo internazionale con una vasta scelta e di ottima qualità.",5,2012,09,08
47,Las segundas partes SI son buenas!!!!,"Qué suerte , dos veces que he ido a esta cadena y me sorprende la facilidad con que la calidad llega al cliente, me he quedado sorprendido de la amabilidad, atención y cariño con que se me ha acogido. Un gran Hotel pero mejor aún el personal.
No dejaré de ir...., será mi cuartel general en Barcelona.",5,2012,09,04
47,hotel perfetto!!!,"Ciao a tutti....come letto da tutte le altre recensioni confermo la comodità di questo hotel sia come posizione che come collegamento con i mezzi pubblici...metro a 10 mt dall'hotel e tram a 100 metri sia x il centro che per la spiaggia di Barcelloneta collegamento diretto con l'aereoporto tramite l'aerobus che ogni 10 minuti passa il pulman x i terminal 1 e 2 di Barcellona e viceversa!!....la mia camera era molto spazionsa come il bagno buono l'arredamento e senza neanche aspettarcelo ci hanno dato la camera con vista su Plaza di Spagna...spettacolare veramente..per nn parlare quando c'è in funzione la fontana magica con spettacoli e musica danzanti....molto carina....
non ho usufruito della colazione in quanto troppo cara..
lo consiglio vivamente...ah ultima cosa favorevole anche xkè vicino ad un centro commerciale dove puoi trovare di tutto sia x spuntino che per cenare..ottimi localini a prezzi buoni...",4,2012,08,28
47,OTTIMO HOTEL.. CI RITORNEREI!,"Ho alloggiato in questa ottima struttura con la mia fidanzata dal 5 al 9 agosto..devo dire che mi sono trovato molto bene..Innanzitutto è molto comodo e veloce il collegamento con l'aeroporto tramite l'airbus,il cui biglietto costa 9,6 se si fa andata e ritorno..ferma proprio a 10 metri dall'hotel,e passa ogni 10 minuti,inoltre ci sono 2 linee di metrò a 10 metri dall'hotel,comodissime x ogni tipo di spostamento,si era in centro in 10 minuti..la nostra camera affacciava con una splendita veduta di Plaza D'Espanya..la camera grande e confortevole,frigobar molto fornito..Le uniche note negative che ho trovato sono la colazione troppo cara(16 euro),e nessun canale in italiano..in terrazzo c'è una bella piscina con uno splendido panorama!L'Hotel inoltre si trova a 50 metri dall'Arenas,che è un centro commerciale,dove ci sono innumerevoli ristoranti..noi abbiamo sempre cenato lì la sera!qualità prezzo ottima..lo consiglio vivamente!x qualsiasi domanda sono a vostra disposizione,BARCELLONA è una città bellissima!",4,2012,08,27
47,Ottimo!,"Sono arrivato ieri in questa splendida struttura, ben collegata dall'aereoporto con l'aerbus a1 che con circa 6 euro mi ha lasciato proprio davanti all'hotel! 
Il personale è cordiale e disponibile, dovevo effettuare il check-in alle 14, invece mi hanno consegnato la camera alle 12! Il personale addetto alla reception è cordiale, anche come gli addetti alle pulizie ai piani superiori! 
Il wi-fi è gratuito, trovate la password su un biglietto che la receptionist vi consegna! 
È abbastanza centrato con piazza Catalunya, e la fermata della metro é proprio fuori l'hotel! Di fronte all'hotel c'è la Magic Fountain de Montjuic, che ci ha deliziati col suo spettacolo! 
Che dire più?!, ne è valsa la pena alloggiare in quest'hotel!",4,2012,08,26
47,Muy bueno,"Una noche de maravilla, mucha limpieza, muy buena habitación, inmejorable personal, desayuno excelente, y podría seguir así horas. Si vuelvo a Barcelona volveré al plaza sin duda. Muchas gracias

47,BELLISSIMOOOOOO,"ottimo hotel in tutti i sensi: comodo dall'aeroporto col bus con fermata vicino all'hotel.metro x centro davanti all'hotel e stazione a 10 minuti a piedi o con la metro.vista spettacolare su plaza espana.camera doppia con 2 letti singoli molto comodi e spaziosi,bagno grande con bidet.la camera era silenziosa nonostante fosse affacciata sulla piazza trafficata.uniche note negative a mio avviso erano:la colazione troppo cara,16 euro a testa,e nessun programma televisivo in italiano.poi all'ultimo piano c'è una bella piscina e un bel centro benessere.ottimo armadio in camera e frigobar fornito.avevamo il primo giorno un piccolo problema con il lavandino un po' intasato e lo hanno riparato subito.da ritornare anche per il rapporto qualità prezzo.",5,2012,08,25
47,Céntrico y con esplendor,"Buen hotel de cuatro estrellas. Sono la flauta y nos toco con vistas a Montjuit. Un poco de ruido pero, es la plaza de Espanya. La piscina en agosto refrescante. a un pasa el metro, bus turistico y la plaza de toros reconvertida en centro comercial. Volveremos.",4,2012,08,20
47,"buen hotel, mal colchon","Buen hotel en general, en algunos aspectos similar a un 5 estrellas pero con un grave problema con los colchones, cuando te acuestas hace mucho ruido pero piensas que moviendote lo menos posible no despertaras demasiadas veces a tu pareja.
El problema viene por la mañana por el dolor de espalda, al principio piensas que con que te golpeaste la noche anterior que ni te  diste cuenta, cuando le dices a tu pareja que mire a ver si tienes un hematoma te dice que a ella también le duele y llegas por a la cruda realidad: el agresor a sido el colchón.
Ademas me hicieron un cargo de 30 €  pero reclame y amablemente me lo devolvieron.
Hice la reserva por su pagina porque decian que me daban una botella de agua, un cóctel de biembenida, entrada al hotel tenprano y salida tarde.
La realidad fue que ni agua, ni coctel, llegamos a las 3 de la tarde y nos pidieron que esperaramos porque no habia habitaciones y lo del check-out tarde... acertaste a las 12 a la calle.",3,2012,08,15
47,Ottimo hotel. Ubicazione comodissima,"Confermo quanto letto nelle precedenti recensioni. Ho scelto questo hotel dopo averle lette ed e' andata come mi aspettavo. Camere pulite, reception disponibile ma dimenticatevi di avere i canali tv in italiano. Dopo una giornata in giro non ci sarebbe dispiaciuto, specie in un 4 stelle. Posizione comodisima per la metro ed il bus per l'aeroporto. Comodo l'arenas a fianco per le.colazioni e cene. Lo consiglierei. Molto bella la piscina in terrazzo se arrivi all'alba per un lettino.",4,2012,08,10
47,Posizione perfetta per visitare barcellona,"Io e il mio fidanzato abbiamo soggiornato due notti in questo hotel. L'arredamento dell'hotel non e' di certo moderno ma offre tutti i confort di un 4 stelle. Personale molto disponibile, pulizia delle camere perfetta, wifi gratis che funziona bene. Inoltre noi abbiamo usufruito della piscina da cui potete godere una bella vista su plaza d'espana. Il punto forte comunque e' la location. Centro commerciale accanto all'hotel, metro davanti, bus turistico che parte dalla piazza e numerosi autobus che ti portano in tutte le parti della città. Lo consigliamo a tutti anche per il rapporto qualità prezzo! ",4,2012,08,01
47,gustazo,"muy buen hotel y buen servicio.
nos trataron muy bien y buen bufette.
los empeados muy correctos y serviciales. 
Muy buena situacion y muy bien comunicado por transporte publico.

47,Me encantó,"Encontré una oferta muy buena de este hotel y le regalé a mi pareja una noche.
Me encantó, el trato en recepción excelente tanto en el check-in como check-out, Cuando llegamos y al entrar en la habitación nos faltaba una cartera lo dijimos y nos ayudaron a buscarlo en todo el recorrido.
Room service perfecto.
Piscina para refrescarte con servicio de toallas...
Para mi, es un buen hotel para alojarse.",5,2012,07,13
47,nos brindò poco.,"estuvimos en el mes de junio en este hotel, para ser de la categorìa que dice ser, es POCO.lo ùnico que distingo es la ubicaciòn, frente a la plaza España, la atenciòn mediocre, principalmente de la mesa de recepciòn, llegamos temprano, no tenìan el cuerto asignado, ni preparado segùn una de las empleadas, cuando consulto nuevamente con otra señorita, el cuerto estaba listo, jamàs nos ofrecieron refrigerio alguno por las demoras..cuando llegamos al cuerto encontramos el baño no en perfectas condiciones de higiene, lo observamos y le restaron importancia, habìa olor desagradable,habitaciones chicas, no conservan el descanso de los pasajeros, una noch habìa una fiesta en uno de los cuartos! con muchìsima gente en el..increìble.. y un sinfin de pequeños incidenes màs..bueno, no repito este hotel .-",3,2012,07,12
47,Un buon rapporto qualita'/prezzo,"Ho letto le recensioni e ho deciso che valeva la pena di provarlo. I punti di forza sono sicuramente la posizione e il personale alla reception (grazie a Kenia e Guillermo!). Senza che lo chiedessi mi e' stata offerta la stanza 650 che offre una splendida vista su Plaza Espana e uno sconto sul prezzo della colazione, che non era inclusa nella prenotazione. La stanza e' comoda e spaziosa e neppure troppo rumorosa, se si considera che si affaccia su una piazza molto trafficata. Il personale e' molto affabile e mi ha aiutato in tutte le occasioni, fornendomi tutte le informazioni di cui avevo bisogno. Vicino c'e' tutto: metro, autobus (turistici e di linea), centro commerciale.
Il collegamento internet in camera funzionava bene.
Ci sono delle cose da migliorare, in modo da meritare a pieno le 4 stelle.
Per esempio, la qualita' del buffet della colazione e del cibo in generale. Il cappuccino, ad esempio, era imbevibile.
Inoltre nella stanza mancava un opuscolo informativo sull'offerta dell'hotel (piscina, sport, etc.) e uno sugli eventi durante la settimana a Barcellona (ho scoperto per caso che nel weekend c'era una fiera proprio a due passi). Mancano anche un paio di canali televisivi in italiano.
L'area dove e' situata la piscina dovrebbe essere attrezzata con asciugamani e accappatoi in modo da evitare agli ospiti di dover portare la roba dalla camera e poi dover chiedere degli asciugamani extra.
Credo di poter consigliare questo hotel se cercate un buon rapporto qualita'/prezzo e la comodita' dei mezzi di trasporto.",4,2012,07,02
47,buon rapporto qualità prezzo,"se volete un hotel che vi lasci un ricordo speciale,non venite qui..ma se cercate una buona struttura con un buon rapporto qualità prezzo allora puo' far per voi.La posizione è buona perchè siete praticamente in piazza d'espana e davanti c'è la stazione della metro che vi permette di andare ovunque.per me è stata la scelta ideale perchè sono venuto per un concerto allo stadio olimpico e ho potuto muovermi a piedi.
la struttura è ordinaria senza alcuna personalizzazione ma assolutamente adeguata per pulizia e serivizi.la colazione è adeguata e la connessione gratuita.l'unico aspetto bizzarro è la cassaforte in camera per la quale è richiesta una cauzione.",4,2012,07,02
47,Buen hotel aunque comienza a estar un poco justo...,"Escogí una habitación en este hotel y aunque no me desagradó lo encontré un poco justo para su categoría y lo que ofrece. Es posible que necesite un buen lavado de imágen y volver a ponerse otra vez a la altura a la que se corresponde.
Nuestra habitación daba a la plaza España y sus vistas excelentes (estábamos en la planta 5ª), pero considero que la insonorización no es muy lograda (se oía demasiado el tráfico de la plaza).
Eran dos camas independientes unidas (debería de haber sido una única cama de matrimonio tipo king-size o similar), las amenities muy justas (un potecito de gel y otro de ducha para dos) y no habían zapatillas o kit dental (nos hubiera venido bien ya que se trataba de una sorpresa a mi pareja y no traíamos nada).
La ducha tenía algún desconchón en el lacado y el agua a parte de fluctuar en temperatura era muy justa de caudal.
En definitiva, no está mal, pero... necesita actualizarse.

A su favor, las excelentes vistas y lo céntrico. Si no se actualizan, no repetiría ya que considero que hay otros de igual precio y ubicación en mejor estado...
Respecto al desayuno, no puedo opinar ya que no lo cogimos así como otros servicios (bar, restaurante, etc...)",3,2012,07,02
47,"Espectacular,sencillamente espectacular.","Fin de semana en pareja, para pasar la festividad de Sant Joan en Bcn, soy un  cliente asiduo de hoteles, y para esta ocasión, pensamos en el Hotel Plaza por su emplazamiento y ser un lugar ideal para disfrutar de las verbenas de Sant Joan.  Al hacer la reserva con mucha antelación, pudimos reservar una Suite , a un precio muy ajustado, por lo que decidimos darnos un capricho. No nos defraudó en absoluto, al contrario, nos dieron la 1104 en la última planta, era enorme con una vistas magníficas, a la plaza España, con las fuentes y el palacio de Montjuic, en primer plano, no hay palabras, hay que verlo para creerlo.  Para las suites hay dos ascensores exclusivos, tiene un salón enorme con mesa de despacho y 6 sillas, un tresillo de piel y una tele encima del mueble de la nevera. Al lado un aseo por si estás en esa parte la la suite, después un pasillo que lleva a la habitación, pero antes  otra puerta que da acceso a un enorme baño con ducha y jacuzi incluido. La habitación muy  amplia, con un cómodo sofa, otra tele otro minibar, y una enorme cama de 2mts x 2mts, todo ello con unas vistas fantásticas. Tiene una piscina en la terraza, no muy grande, pero lo suficiente para  nadar unos largos. El desayuno, fue bastante correcto, sin destacar nada excepcional,. Del resto ya poco a destacar, tiene un buen restaurante con un precio ajustado y los salones muy cómodos y acogedores. En la parte negativa, tal vez necesita una renovación poco a poco del mobiliario de la suite, sobre todo del tresillo negro de la sala, y poca cosa más , el personal muy profesional y muy atento a cualquier indicación.  En resumen, si te puedes dar un capricho, por una vez, pide una suite, no te arrepentirás, ir mirando los precios, que hay dias que están asequibles.",5,2012,06,26
47,scoperto per caso,"Arrivata a Barcellona per passare un week end con il fidanzato e un altra coppia di amici,mi sono ritrovata nel hotel un po per sbaglio(visto un disguido di prenotazione al hotel tryp apollo)molto comodo dall aereoporta che dista solo 15 minuti di aereobus(fermata davanti al albergo)situato in plaza di espana  con spettacolare vista... la nostra camera era con vista verso l'arena(all interno un bellissimo centro commerciale con negozi e bar)stanza molto pulita e spaziosa,bagno molto grande con vasca/doccia.Unica pecca è non trovare neanche un canale italiano,personale gentile e molto disponibile.Fuori dall hotel si trova la metropolitana molto facile da capire,in soli tre giorni mi sono vissuta dalla mattina alla sera questa splendida città!

Justo en la puerta del hotel la parada de metro Espanya, lo que permite moverte por la ciudad sin problemas. Las habitaciones son muy amplias y confortables.  En frente del hotel se encuentra el centro comercial Las Arenas, con infinidad de tiendas y restaurantes, aunque los restaurantes entre semana cierran a las 22.30h, algo un poco extraño...
El desayuno es tipo continental, abundante y exquisito. El servicio excelente.",4,2012,06,12
47,"servicio, comunicacion i situacion imejorables",Mi empresa me reservó la habitación en este hotel ya que fuimos a un curso que nos dieron en sus salones. Me sorprendió el buen trato recibido por su personal y lo bien que se come. Es también muy recomendable para hacer turismo ya que está muy bien comunicado.,5,2012,06,07
47,Todo Excelente,"Somos de Shop-per Asesoría de Imagen y realizamos un taller de automaquillaje en una de sus salas para eventos que resultó ser todo un éxito.

La ubicación es  excelente ya que está muy bien comunicado, por lo que es fácil acceder desde diferentes lugares. Para nosotros ha sido una experiencia maravillosa que no dudamos en repetir!!!!! Os lo aconsejamos  Shop-Per Asesoría de Imagen",5,2012,06,06
47,Excelente situación,"El hotel no se puede encontrar en mejor situación en la ciudad, frente a la feria más importante de Barcelona. El hotel ofrece buen servicio, buena atención al cliente y las habitaciones son modernas. Las habitaciones con vista a la plaza son las mejores. El desayuno buffet es muy completo y me imagino que en verano la piscina del tejado debe ser sensacional, una pena que lloviera los días que estuve. Buena comunicación con el centro tanto con metro, taxi y autobús. El centro comercial que tiene al lado está bastante bien para distraerte por la tarde. Recomiendo el hotel tanto para trabajo como para escapadas de fin de semana, pues tiene todos los servicios que uno pueda necesitar.",5,2012,05,28
47,C'è di meglio!!!,"Ciao a tutti!!!
premetto di essere una viaggiatrice molto esigente!!! L'hotel gode di ottimi collegamenti con bus, taxi e metro.
Cesto di benvenuto all'arrivo, alla hall il servizip è eccellente!!!
Si tratta di un'edificio anni 90, la cui struttura interna avrebbe bisogno di un restyling. 
Io con mio marito abbiamo preso la suite n. 1103, da cui si gode un bellissimo panorama, sullo sfondo la Fontana Magica, che non abbiamo avuto il piacere di vedere accesa.
La camera di 60 mq, costituita da due bagni, camera da letto e sala relax, arredata con stile retrò, divani neri di pelle, finto parquet rossiccio, insomma, un pò triste!!!
Al momento della prenotazione abbiamo segnalato la necessità di canali televisivi in lingua italiana, per motivi di salute dovevo stare a letto, ma la ns richiesta non è stata accolta, pensate che.....!!!
Alle pressanti proteste di mio marito, i canali in italiano non si sono visti, ma in compenso il Direttore ci ha offerto la colazione gratuita per tutto il soggiorno!!! Cosa da noi molto apprezzata, la colazione è varia ed abbondante, dal dolce al salato.
La pulizia della camera è effettuata due volte al giorno, con cioccolatino annesso",3,2012,05,14
47,Magnifica ubicacion,"Me invitaron a un congreso y elegí el hot por su ubicación. Ademas en mis ratos libres solo tenia que coger el metro , que esta literalmente en la puerta del hotel, y en 3 paradas llegaba a las ramblas. Ha sido una experiencia maravillosa !!",5,2012,05,08
47,Ottima posizione,"Posizione comodissima si trova alla prima fermata dell'aerobus che parte dal terminal T2 dell'aeroporto, fermata della metro davanti all'ingresso.
La struttura è un pochino datata, bella la vista su Plaza de espana.
Personale gentile, la colazione è molto ricca.
L'hotel si trova vicino ad un centro commerciale con ristoranti e negozi molto utile se non si vuole cercare un posto per mangiare.",4,2012,05,02
47,ottimo e comodo x tutto.,"ottimo hotel in tutti i sensi: comodo dall'aeroporto col bus con fermata vicino all'hotel.metro x centro davanti all'hotel e stazione a 10 minuti a piedi o con la metro.vista spettacolare su plaza espana.camera doppia con 2 letti singoli molto comodi e spaziosi,bagno grande con bidet.la camera era silenziosa nonostante fosse affacciata sulla piazza trafficata.uniche note negative a mio avviso erano:la colazione troppo cara,16 euro a testa,e nessun programma televisivo in italiano.poi all'ultimo piano c'è una bella piscina e un bel centro benessere.ottimo armadio in camera e frigobar fornito.avevamo il primo giorno un piccolo problema con il lavandino un po' intasato e lo hanno riparato subito.da ritornare anche per il rapporto qualità prezzo.",5,2012,04,25
47,Eccezzionale!!!!,"Appena si sbarca in aeroporto ce l'aerobus che ti porta direttamente fino davanti al hotel. Hotel in ottima zona. Appena si esce dal hotel si trova l'entrata dalla metro quindo molto comodoa per spostarsi in citta.
Personale molto gentile e educato. Parlano solamente ingelese e spagnolo.
Bisogna lasciare 50,00 euro di cautione per la scheda che apre la porta della camera, altrimenti la carta di credito.
Colazione ottima con tanta scelta. 
Stanze spaziose e con vista a piazza spagna.
Molto pulito e sopratutto silenzionoso anche se fuori c'è un traffico pazzeso.
Consigliato a tutti. PS. Di fronte al hotel ci sono le fontane magiche da non perdere alla sera.
Nel interno del palazza accanto si trova un enorme centro commerciale per chi piace lo shopping.

47,Nulla di indimenticabile,"Hotel in posizione eccellente: fuori dall'ingresso c'e' la Metro. Bella vista panoramica dalle stanze che si affacciano sulla piazza e dalla terrazza con piscina. Molto caro per la tipologia della stanza: una ventina di mq molto scarsi, con letto queen, bagno con vasca/doccia (con il doccione non funzionante...). La camera e' molto pulita. Solita fornitura toilette per un quattro stelle medio. TV nuovo (probabilmente un 36""). Prezzo della camera (aprile 2012) €160 con colazione esclusa: altri 16 €  per un'offerta abbondante, ma di poca qualita'. La sala della colazione e' banale, fredda con personale abbastanza in linea con la sala.  Da segnalare la signora ""cerbero"" all'ingresso della sala colazione che appura con circospezione se hai diritto o meno ad entrare nella sala....
La hall e' piccola per un hotel del genere: soffitti alti, ma mq pochi.... Scomodo l'accesso alla sala colazione che non prevede (a meno che non sia nascosto) l'accesso ai disabili in quanto ci sono 6 scalini+altri 4 per entrare. Personale alla reception gentilmente scostante. In generale l'hotel e' banale e se non fosse per la posizione centrale (da segnalare pero' che il traffico nella piazza e' notevole), certamente scomparirebbe velocemente dalla memoria.",3,2012,04,21
47,Recomiendo este hotel,"Nos alojamos con amigos durante 4 dias. Cojimos oferta muy buena por internet y nos salio muy bien de precio, teniendo en cuenta de Barcelona es muy cara. Las habitaciones son muy comodas, bastante grandes, y el baño es grande tambien. El desayuno es impresionande, es enorme y hay de todo. el personal es super amable. La posicion del hotel es muy comoda, se llega a cualquier sitio en un momento, en metro o autobus. no tubimos que cojer taxi en nungun momento.

47,Barcelona Plaza,"Llegamos a este hotel del 29 de marzo y nos quedamos por 4 noches, nos pareció estupendo, las atenciones del personal del front desk no pudieron ser mejores, la localización es excelente, el mejor lugar para conocer Barcelona, ya que en la Plaza España converge todos los transportes y los autobuses turísticos, se llega a cualquier lugar muy fácil, nuestra estancia no ha sido excelente debido a que nos otorgaron un habitación que daba al interior y el ruido del comedor comienza desde temprano, pero al fin, temprano salíamos de la habitación también! 
Puedo recomendar este hotel a cualquiera!!",5,2012,04,16

47,Nicht zu empfehlen,"Der einzige Vorteil, das Hotel liegt günstig zur Messe. Mein Aufenthalt war geschäftlich, wir belegten ca. 50 Zimmer in dem Hotel. Viele unserer Zimmer lagen zum Innenhof und waren total überheizt, was sich nicht ausschalten liess. Beim schlafen mit offenem Fenster störte ein Generator der die ganze Nacht brummte.

Der Frühstücksraum verströmt den Charme einer Kantine. Sehr grosse Auswahl von durchschnittlicher Qualität. Sauberkeit und Betten sind ok.",3,2012,02,26
47,Hotel genial!,"Estuvimos dudando si coger una sola noche o dos, por aquello de si el hotel estaría bien, si la ubicación nos satisfaría, si el personal.... La verdad es que estuvimos muy a gusto, tanto la situación que era genial, muy bien comunicado con autobuses y metros, y relativamente céntrico. El hotel en sí muy correcto y la atención del personal perfecta, además íbamos con una niña pequeña a la que trataron genial. Por lo que evidentemente cogimos esa segunda noche que en un principio no teníamos claro. Os lo recomiendo!.",5,2012,02,26
47,Restaurante,"El lunes pasado fuimos mi pareja y yo a cenar al Hotel Plaza. La verdad es que no tenía ninguna expectativa, pero la decoración nos gustó mucho, relajaba, daba sensación de paz, que era lo que íbamos buscando después de un día estresante.
Los camareros fueron de lo más amable y lo más importante el pescado que nos tomamos estaba riquísimo. ¿qué más podemos pedir? ah si, el precio.... 22 euros. Genial!

47,"Günstig gelegenes Business Hotel, ideal für Messen","Ich hatte das Catalonia Barcelona Plaza Hotel wegen der guten Verkehrsanbindung gewählt. Der Flughafen Bus hält direkt an der Plaza Espana. Zudem kommt man mit der Metro oder dem Zug schnell in alle Richtungen. 
Ich hatte eine Suite im neunten Stock mit hervorragender Panoramaaussicht auf die Plaza Espana. Das Frühstück für 16 Euro habe ich mir gespart - in den Bars der Umgebung bekommt man für weniger als 4 Euro ein Frühstück. 
Das Hotel verfügt über ein umfangreiches Spa-Angebot, das ich jedoch aus Zeitgründen nicht nutzen konnte.

47,Mejor ubicado no puede estar.,"El pasado mes de Julio, hice un viaje organizado acompañando a unas quinceañeras por Europa, nos asignaron este hotel del cual puedo decir que su ubicación es de maravilla. Es un edificio enorme en todo el frente de las fuentes Mont Juic y al lado de un centro comercial construido en una Plaza de toros. Al llegar el lobby estaba repleto de gento, no había ni un solo asiento libre, para tomar el ascensor era una pesadilla, larga espera.
Teníamos las cenas en el restaurant buffet y las dos noches que pasamos allí el menú fue prácticamente el mismo. El desayuno estaba bueno y muy variado.
El personal del restaurante fue sumamente amable.  Habia wi fi gratis solamente en el lobby del hotel y por el uso de la caja de seguridad de la habitación había que pagar un importe diario de 5 Euros y dejar un deposito de 40 Euros.
Se nota que el hotel es usado para albergar a grupos grandes porque el movimiento era bastante. Nos comentaron que tuviésemos cuidado ya que habían muchos carteristas en el área y mas de una vez casos en los que se roban las maletas pretendiendo ser turistas. 
Las habitaciones eran de buen tamaño, cómodas y bien decoradas, no había para hacer te o café en la habitación ni tampoco obsequiaban las botellas de agua mineral.
El baño amplio pero se veía humedad en la bañera.  Para estar un par de noches esta muy bien, especialmente por la ubicación.",3,2012,01,15

Yo soy discapacitado y voy en silla de ruedas y tengo que decir que el hotel, en este sentido tiene algo que mejorar, sobre todo a la entrada principal. Pero nada de esto es obstáculo con la excelente atención que me prestó en todo momento su relaciones públicas la Señora Lilia Chabni.

No puedo decir nada que no sea bueno para dicho hotel, ya que el trato fue excelente, la comida,...enfin, todo. Estubimos en una sala privada, bastante grade (foto adjunta), en la que habia espacio para todo, tanto adultos comiendo, como niños jugando.

47,muy recomendable para estancia en barcelona,"solo tengo una opinion negativa  y es el olor un poco a tabaco en la habitacion ( y eso que era de no fumador), un ambientador un poco agradable ya haria la estancia perfecta. el resto es todo positivo tanto para parejas como familia. tienes el autobus del aeropuerto justo enfrente del hotel, la boca de metro y todos los autobuses para recorrer barcelona .un centro comercial para poder cenar o ir de tiendas si hace mal tiempo, montjuic justo enfrente y si te gusta caminar , desde plaza España salen calles hacia el centro dando un agradable y largo paseo, cuenta con piscina, gimnasio y masajes a buen precio y sino coges con desayuno justo al lado un pequeño bar para desayunar muy bien",4,2011,11,02

Este es un hotel 4* pero de los de verdad. La habitación era bien grande, con una buena tele, un estupendo baño, y una cama comoda.
El desayuno, a la altura de lo que se espera de un hotel de estas características.

47,Una Experiencia unica...,"Fuimos con unos amigo al hotel y dusfrutamos de un ambiente buenisimos, un servicio muy amable, y una excelente relación calidad-precio, me sorpredieron dos temas, el SPA, y el rstaurante, en el Restaurante Filigrana, dusfrutamos de una cena degustación excepcional. Todo, los entrantes, los platos fuertes, a mi particularmente me encanto la carne, los postre y la selección de vinos.

Y para teminar la velada, nos tomamos una copa en el PianoBar... Vamos una estancia ideal, seguro que la repetimos.",5,2011,03,17

47,"buen trato, buena ubicación y escelente restaurante","El pasado 22 de febrero estuve alojada en el Hotel Plaza de Barcelona por motivos de trabajo. 
La verdad es que me qeudé muy contenta. El servicio fue excelente, la ubicación inmejorable y el trato del personal impecable. 
Además tuve la oportunidad de probar su nuevo restaurante el FILIGRANA y quedé gratamente sorprendida al ver la calidad y servicio que ofrecia. 
Sin duda recomiendo el hotel para quién tenga que viajar a Barcelona e invito a los Barceloneses a que prueben su excelente restaurante.",4,2011,03,03
47,Súper recomendable,"La verdad es que me sorprendió muchísimo la relación calidad-precio de este hotel. En tiempos en los que no queremos gastarnos tanto dinero y tener una habitación y servicio excelente en una ubicación maravillosa (cerca de Montjuic, ideal para pasear tanto en invierno como en verano), el Catalonia Plaza resultó ser un verdadero descubrimiento. Soy de Granada y cada vez que venga a Barcelona pieso volver aquí. Por cierto, el restaurante del hotel, Filigrana, exquisito. Soy amante de la carne y creo que nunca me había comido un chuletón de buey tan bueno...",5,2011,03,03
47,Bello,"Sono appena tornato da barcellona, bellissima città!!!!!
L'hotel è un pò lontano dal centro ma con la metro ci si arriva in un attimo.
La colazione a buffet è ottima, dolci, bacon, uova, frutta, ecc per tutti i gusti!!!
La stanza era grande ma era comunicante con la stanza accanto ( non sembrava tanto sicura, ma alla fine è andato tutto bene ) il bagno era grade con una vasca dove potersi rilassare dopo una giornata faticosa in giro per la città. La pulizia non era tanto curato, comunque tutto sommato sono stato bene.

cocktail buonissimi al piano bar!!! =)",4,2011,02,28
47,Absolut nicht empfehlenswert,"Die 4 Sterne sind ein absoluter Witz. Im einen Zimmer waren WC und Bidet nicht richtig mit dem Boden verschraubt. Bei Benützung des Bidets läuft das Wasser deshalb den Fussboden entlang. Daraufhin ZImmer gewechselt: im anderen Zimmer Fenstergriffe locker und wacklig, Mängel an der Rezeption angemerkt, aber nach Zurückkommen aus der Stadt nichts repariert. Staub an den Rändern der Bettgestelle, Nachttischlampen an der Wand wackeln, Steckdosen hängen teilweise aus der Wand heraus, Schimmel und abbröckelnde Farbe an der Decke über der Badewanne. Macht insgesamt einen sehr schmutzigen Eindruck und das Personal ist nicht besonders bemüht die Mängel zu beheben. Extrem langsames Internet: Rohrpost ist schneller. Wenn das ein Businesshotel sein soll....",1,2011,02,22
47,Un hotel para relajarte y comer bien en un ambiente acogedor y cordial,"El fin de semana pasado estuvimos mis consuegros y mi marido y yo en este magnífico hotel donde pudimos disfrutar de un relajante masaje practicado por una masajista que además de muy atenta y servicial, tenía unas manos de oro. Después del masaje que nos dejó en una nube, comimos en el Restaurante  Filigrana del mismo hotel donde pudimos disfrutar de una exquisita y variada comida. Además destacar también el servicio de camareros tan atentos y como no tanto la amabilidad por parte del personal de recepción como de dirección con quienes tuvimos el placer de entablar una pequeña conversación para felicitarles por su magnifico trabajo.Felicidades a todo el personal por dar al cliente exactamente lo que necesita.",5,2011,02,09
47,Klasse Businesshotel -  tolle Lage,"Klasse Businesshotel -  tolle Lage

Für zwei Nächte in dem Hotel - Urteil gut bis sehr gut

Frühstück ist ok , für 16 Euro aber zu wenig.
Fitnesraum  eher einfach eingerichtet - Jeweils ein Gerät in durchschnittlichen Zustand
Abendessen im Restaurant war ok
Zimmer sind geräumig und sauber
Lage recht gut -
zum FC Barcelonastadion und in die Altstadt jeweils 25 minuten zuFuss",4,2011,02,03
47,Una noche inolvidable en el Piano Bar,"Estuve con un grupo de amigos celebrando un cumpleaños sorpresa en el Piano Bar del hotel y la verdad que fue increíble! 
El servicio que nos dieron antes del evento para organizarlo fue realmente de mucha ayuda,  nos facilitaron todo lo que pudieron.
Todo el evento duró unas 5 horas y durante ese tiempo no nos faltó de nada, los camareros, el maître y la persona que se encargó de la organización estuvieron todo el rato pendientes, fueron muy amables.

Lo recomiendo 100%!!",5,2011,01,12
47,Gran profesionalidad,"El dia 10 de diciembre celebramos en uno de los salones del Hotel Catalonia Plaza nuestra tradicional cena de navidad de empresa, desde el primer momento nos sentimos muy a gusto, tanto el trato recibido como la calidad de la comida fueron excelentes, Gracias por hacernos pasar una velada perfecta, repetiremos.",5,2010,12,24
47,me senti excelente,Es un hotel elegante con un personal muy amable et el punto forte yo creo que es la piscina. Si algana vez llegare en Bracelona sin duda voy a eligir el hotel Catalonia.,5,2010,12,22
47,"Hotel mit sehr guter Lage, insgesamt eher durchschnittlich","Das Hotel liegt am Plaza Espanyol mit direkter Metro und Busanbindung ins Zentrum der Stadt. Ein heiteres Treiben vor dem Hotel lässt schnell ein südländisches Gefühl entfachen, allerdings ist der Service am Check-in nicht perfekt, die Zimmer sind zwar sauber und bieten alles für eine Übernachtung, die Betten waren aber nicht zu gemütlich. Das Frühstück bietet eine hervorragende Auswahl für einen guten Start in den Tag. Das Abendessen im Hotel ist wiederum keine tolle Alternative zu den Restaurants in der Umgebung.",3,2010,12,19
47,Gracias por una noche maravillosa,"Este año queriamos hacer algo diferente para la cena de empresa y alquilamos una sala en la 7ª planta del hotel plaza, nos la recomendaron ya que tiene luz natural. La verdad que todo fue perfecto, el servicio, la comida que estaba buenísima y como la sala era espaciosa pudimos alquilar a un mago que nos amenizó la noche. La verdad que ha sido la mejor cena de empresa que hemos hecho en años. Gracias a todo el personal del hotel por su ayuda.",5,2010,12,19
47,Mitten in der Stadt,"Gegenüber der alten Messe und direkt an der Plaza Espana liegt dieses riesige, aber dennoch absolut empfehlenswerte Hotel. Die Metro ist praktisch vor der Tür, genauso wie die Busse der Stadtrundfahrt. Das Hotel ist modern eingerichtet und sauber. Es gibt große Zimmer und einen guten Zimmerservice. Für Touristen ist das Hotel genauso empfehlenswert wie für Geschäftsreisende.",4,2010,12,17
47,"Excelentes vistas , buena comunicación y muy buen servicio","Pasamos tres días con toda la família y fue excelente.
Habitaciones amplias y impecables.
Hotel muy bien comunicado, ya que está rodeado de metros y autobuses,...
Muy bien situado, ya que está cerca de Monjuïc, lo que te permite hacer buenos paseos con los niños.

También cenamos en el resturante ""Filigrana"" y también está todo riquísimo.",5,2010,12,12
47,EXCELENTE,"Es justo el hotel que necesitaba para mi viaje a Barcelona. Es muy cómodo, el personal muy amable y tienen un gran desayuno. Lo recomiendo a todos los que necesiteis hotel por esa zona. Además está a 3 paradas de metro de Plaza Catalunya.",5,2010,11,18
47,Ya no es un 4 estrellas,"Estuve alojado con mi mujer de 5 al 7 de Noviembre. Elejimos este hotel ya que esta frente a la feria de congresos de Barcelona, y teniamos un gran recuerdo de el , ya que estuvimos alojados hace cosa de 15 años, acabadito de abrir, entonces las habitaciones eran espectaculares. Actualmente el estado de las habitaciones es decadente. La mayor parte de la madera se ve clavillada, el aire acondicionado no funcionaba y ala habitacion de daba un sol de castigo.La bañera esta oxidada, y las juntas de el alicatado de bañera esta incrustado de moho negro, lo que da la imagen de falta de limpieza. Las toallas parecian estropajos de lo asperas que estaban, y lo peor de todo eran los colchones de la cama, parecian que los habian comprado de segunda mano, se te metian los muelles por toda la espalda. Hice mi reclamacion al dia siguiente de hospedarme, me pidieron disculpas, me llevaron un plato de fruta para hacerme la pelota, y me hicieron un 15 % de descuento en la factura. Ni haciendome un 50% me hubiese sentido compensado, ya que para lo que se paga por una noche,es una verguenza que una cadena hotelera de esta categoria de un servicio tan pesimo.Estuve alojado en la habitacion 646. Cuando hice el check out, un señor se llevo a la directora o a la jefa de administracion a ver su habitacion,ya que como yo escuche, le recriminaba el estado lamentable de la misma. SE me habia olvidado, en horas punta, el agua caliente apenas llega. Es una estafa pagar por esta habitacion, ya que este hotel solo tiene buena ubicacion, y eso si, un buen desayuno.Un saludo",1,2010,11,17
47,"Bellissimo Hotel Plaza: moderno, comodo ai servizi, pulito e molto spazioso!","Se siete intenzionati ad una gita a Barcellona soggiornate in questo hotel!

La zona è comodissima, la navetta dall'aereoporto ferma direttamente di fronte all'hotel così come la metropolitana e varie linee di autobus dirette in centro (pochi minuti e si arriva in piazza della cattedrale).

La hall è luminosa, accogliente e con il personale sempre disponibile.
Due ascensori portano ai piani per le camere degli ospiti che sono immense!
Ho soggiornato in una matrimoniale che era grande almeno 30mq, con una vetrata lungo tutta una parete con una splendida vista sul parco.Il letto era bigsize con ampia scelta di cuscini.
C'erano inoltre una scrivania molto spaziosa, la tv con vari canali internazionali, il frigobar,e la connessione ad internet. L'armadio, anch'esso molto capiente, disponeva di una cassetta di sicurezza.
Molto grande e funzionale anche il bagno, con vasca e doccia.

Bellissimo il salone per la colazione situato al primo piano al centro della struttura, il soffitto interamente in vetro conferisce un'atmosfera unica!
Il buffet soddisfa ogni esigenza: dolce, salato, frutta, cibi cucinati al momento e ogni sorta di yogurt e torte in monoporzione.

Da vedere la piscina sul tetto con zona solarium e palestra.
Spettacolare la vista dalla terrazza!!
Lo consiglio a tutti!
E' consigliabile tenere d'occhio le offerte su booking per questo hotel, spesso molto vantaggiose ( a giugno in offerta da 80 euro a notte la matrimoniale).",5,2010,11,15
47,Eine Übernachtung im Hotel.,"Aufenthalt in diesem Hotel für eine Nacht auf dem Weg von Nizza nach Prag. Die Pläne wurden auf der Piazza di Spagna und der Singenden Fontäne zu besuchen. Das Hotel befindet sich am Vortag gebucht. Anzahl der Blick auf den Brunnen gegeben. Nettes Hotel, schönes Zimmer, gutes Sanitär. Free Internet Wi-Fi mit einem guten Signalpegel. Im Zimmer Minibar, Klimaanlage, Fernseher mit Satellitenempfang. Lärm von der Straße zu hören, konnte aber Geräusche aus dem Flur zu hören. In der Nähe des Hotels befindet sich eine Bushaltestelle, wo Busse fahren zum Flughafen.",5,2010,10,24
47,Correcto en todo los aspectos,"Situación inmejorable, en plena plaza de España. Muy grande y como mucho volumen de huespedes. Frecuentado por gente extranjera (americanos, japoneses, arabes, ...)  en viajes de cruceros. Las habitaciones son grandes y bastante bien cuidadas. Disponen de WIFI gratis en la habitaciones y hall central. El salón del desayuno es increiblemente grande, como el de una boda. El desayuno esta orientado a los extranjeros, con cocina el directo y muchos platos calientes.",4,2010,10,17
47,Ottimo Hotel,"La posizione dell'hotel è ottima per visitare la città. Si trova direttamente su plaza de Espana e la metro si prende appena usciti dall'albergo.

Especialmente buena ubicación si te alojas en él para conciertos en Montjuic o el Palau Sant Jordi.",4,2010,08,16
47,Hotel Inmejorable,"he pasado 4 días maravilloses en Barcelona con mi pareja e visitando esa hermosa ciudad. Nos alojamos en el Hotel Catalonia Barcelona Plaza. Un hotel magníficamente situado. El metro justo delante con un montón de líneas así como el bus turístico. Por la mañana, desayunábamos tan copiosamente en su magnífico buffet que casi no teníamos hambre al medio día. Cuando llegábamos cansados a última hora de la tarde, nos pegábamos un chapuzon en la piscina deleitándonos de su magnífica vista. El trato también ha sido muy bueno así como la calidad de las intalaciones en general.",5,2010,08,11
47,Hotel in guter Lage,"Das Haus lieg direkt am Plaza España, am Fuße des Montjüic. Verkehrsgünstige Lage heißt tatsächlich: es ist laut. Direkt vor der Haustür ist ein stark befahrener Kreisverkehr, glücklicherweise verfügen die Zimmer über eine Klimaanlage und ordentlich schallisolierte Fenster, so dass man nicht ersticken muss.

Die Zimmer sind nicht sonderlich geräumig, aber ausreichend, um sich dort für 1-2 Wochen niederzulassen. Die Ausstattung des 4**** Hotels entspricht etwa 3*** in Deutschland. Es gibt kostenloses WLAN, eine Minibar, ein Bett, einen Sessel mit Tisch und einen Schreibtisch mit Stuhl. Im Bad befindet sich neben den Standards auch eine Badewanne.

Der Service an der Rezeption war in Ordnung, nicht überragend, aber herrje, ich hatte keine Extrawünsche.

Es gibt ein Restaurant, das Pizza etc anbietet und auch durchaus andere genießbare Dinge serviert.

Das Frühstück war sehr gut, umfangreich und nahrhaft und wurde in einem großen Saal serviert, was für die gemütlicheren Reisenden vielleicht nicht das Wahre ist, aber es gibt einen Zimmerservice für derartige Notfälle.

Im Großen und Ganzen ist das Hotel zu empfehlen.",4,2010,08,07
47,GRACIAS!!!!!!!!!!,"Muchas gracias por la maravillosa organización de mi fiesta de cumpleaños en la piscina del hotel, realmente quedo todo precioso.

Sehr schöne saubere Zimmer und sicher das Beste Frühstücksbuffet das ich jemals hatte! Absolut ausgezeichnetes Buffet!!!! Freundliche Mitarbeiter!",5,2010,07,03
47,Super Lage,"Direkt am Plaza Espana gelegen und damit idealer Ausganspunkt für die Stadt. Ziemliches Verkehrschaos aber tagsüber vor der Tür. Kaum Parkplätze. Tagsüber recht laut. Zimmer waren ok, peinlich allerdings das mir ein Zimmer eines anderen Gastes zugewiesen wurde der bereits eingecheckt hatte... Kostenloses Internet im Zimmer natürlich ein dickes Plus!",4,2010,06,02
47,Grata sorpresa,Mi empresa me reservó la habitación en este hotel ya que fuimos a un curso que nos dieron en sus salones. Me sorprendió el buen trato recibido por su personal y lo bien que se come. Es también muy recomendable para hacer turismo ya que está muy bien comunicado.,5,2010,05,09
47,Comodo e pratico per la posizione,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel un weekend per visitare la città.Ottima e comoda la posizione,essendo su Plaza Espanya e servito da metropolitana proprio fuori dall'ingresso e dai pulmann che collegano aeroporto e centro.Vicinissimo alla famosa Fontana Magica che si raggiunge a piedi,e vicino alla fiera che a qualcuno potrebbe interessare.
Le camere molto spaziose,ben arredate e pulite,cambio asciugamani tutti i giorni.Personale un po' sulle sue,non proprio amichevole.Colazione a buffett ottima con scelte di tutti i tipi,dal salato,al dolce alla frutta e yogurt,veramente l'imbarazzo della scelta.Cena meglio dimenticarla,anch'essa a buffett,poca scelta e tutto freddo senza neanche la possibilità di scaldare con un microonde (lo trovi anche in autogrill) e che dire dei camerieri sempre col broncio e desiderosi di cacciarti il prima possibile per chiudere il ristorante.
In definitiva comunque va benissimo per le visite veloci,ma scegliete solo bed & breakfast.",3,2010,04,16
47,Grata sorpresa,Mis amigos me sorprendieron para mi cumpleaños con un viaje a Barcelona y escogieron el hotel Catalonia Barcelona Plaza por su ubicación y tamaño.

47,Días de descanso en el hotel Catalonia Plaza,"Disponiamos de unos días libres en marzo y decidimos ir a Barcelona. Reservamos el hotel a través de internet, su ubicación nos pareció buena ya que sin estar en el centro histórico de la ciudad, siempre he creido que dichos lugares son para visitar no para vivir, está muy cercano y muy bien comunicado. El precio, para ser Barcelona, también es competitivo. Las habitaciones están límpia y dispone de todos los servicios, parking, restaurante, desayunos.. Nuestra estancia fue muy comoda y agradable.",5,2010,03,06
47,8,"Hotel céntrico, limpio, cómodo, personal muy educado y amable.",5,2010,02,28

Desde lugo volvere!",5,2010,02,28
47,Gran elección,"Estuvimos el pasado fin de semana con unos amigos ya que teníamos una boda cerca del Hotel y reservamos 3 habitaciones para aprovechar el fin de semana en Barcelona.
El hotel es muy cómodo , muy bien situado para moverse, con parking y habitaciones muy amplias.
El trato fue estupendo, lo recomiendo si teneis que moveros por esa zona , relación calidad - precio muy buena",5,2010,02,28
47,Ubicación ideal,"Mi empresa reservó el hotel para la feria MWC por su ubicación, es ideal, está a 2 minutos caminando del hotel y la verdad que es un lujo ir a trabajar caminando. El desayuno es fantastico también.
El wifi es gratuito cosa que representa una ventaja.
Mi mujer ,que me acompañó en esta ocasión, también comentó que la ubicación es ideal ya que enfrente de la puerta del hotel hay una parada de metro con dos líneas que te permiten llegar a plaza Cataluña en tres minutos y a la zona de compras de las diagonal en 10 minutos ( líneas 1 y 3 respectivamente )
Finalmente a ambos nos sorprendieron las veladas de jazz en vivo en el piano bar del hotel.
Si tenemos o queremos regresar a Barcelona sin duda volveremos a este hotel",5,2010,02,26

47,Pass auf! Kreditkarte Nummer hier gestohlen,"Beim ankommen habe ich wie immer als Garantie die Kreditkarte kürz an der Rezeptionistin gegeben. Gerade nach meiner Abreise haben Sie angefangen meiner Konto zu lehren.  Ich habe meine Kreditkarte nur dieses Mal in Spanien ""gebraucht"" und bin sicher, dass das Hotel Personal direkt verbunden mit dem Diebstahl sind.  

Als ich Kontakt mit der Manager aufgenommen habe um das Diebstahl zu untersuchen hat er anstatt Hilfe geleistet nur das Hotel verteidigt. Ein gutes Unternehmen hilft die Klienten mit einer Diebstahlversicherung in einem solchen Fall.  

Deswegen sage ich, pass auf mit diesem Hotel, etwas stinkt und es ist nicht nur in den kleinen, dreckigen Zimmern oder grauen Lobby. Du kannst viel schöneres in Barcelona finden!",1,2010,02,11
47,Es mas de lo que yo esperaba para un viaje de placer ¡¡¡,"Hola  a todos¡¡¡

Es la primera vez que entro a una página de estas (tripadvisor)...pero creo que merecería la pena, ya que cuando una tiene una grata experiencia también es bueno remarcarlo y que los demás lo sepan...
Fui a este hotel el week-end pasado y la verdad superó mis expectativas para un viaje de placer (con mi pareja)...fue una estancia muy romántica a pesar de que el hotel tenga más un perfil de  gente de negocios; sin embargo me pareció un hotel muy acogedor, relajante, moderno y calidad precio muy buena y la habitación muy amplia y mejor vista no podía tocarme...bastante bien ubicado ya que para un fin de semana que iba, no podía perder mucho tiempo, y me fue muy beneficioso no perder tiempos muertos en transportarme...
Por otro lado remarco la atención tan profesional pero a la vez cercana del personal en general...notando en ellos las intenciones de hacer lo más grata posible mi estancia...
Sólo puedo amigos que recomendaros este hotel y que disfrutéis como yo de las vistas tan agradables que hay...como el Palacio  Nacional de Monjuic y dar un paseo romántico (como yo lo hice :-) por el ANILLO de Monjuic , alrededores como de la hermosa ciudad de Barcelona¡¡¡

Saludos a todos,

47,Buen servicio y mejor ubicación,Recomiendo este hotel sobre todo por la amabilidad de su personal y por su buena ubicación. El desayuno buffet es muy completo y lo sirven en un salón donde no tuvimos que esperar para sentarnos. Las habitación era normal en decoración pero muy grande y sobre todo estaba muy limpia.  En 5 minutos se llega al centro de la ciudad en metro y con el bus del aeropuerto llegamos en 15 minutos al hotel.,5,2010,01,07

47,Buena ubicación,"Hotel ubicado en la Plaza de Espanya, desde donde hay conexión directa por bus al aeropuerto y con la boca del metro justo en la puerta.

47,No me gustó,"Un hotel de 4 estrellas, en plena plaza de España en Barcelona.Está cerca de la Feria y del aeropuerto, pero creo que de ningun lado más si vas andando.Las habitaciones antiguas y descuidadas. La calefacción pésima. El personal del hotel pasable sin llegar a extraordinario. Me dieron una habitación con vistas a un callejón y a una casa ocupa.Deprimente. Ojo con el minibar, que puede darte una sorpresa.",2,2009,02,04
47,"Ubicación, instalaciones y servicio: excelentes.","Me habían hablado bien de este hotel por su excelente ubicación y buen servicio. Así que reservé a través de unos amigos residentes en Barcelona.
Había estado en otros hoteles como el Diagonal Princess, más nuevos, pero el Catalonia Plaza me convenció más.

Ubicado en la Plaza de España y muy bien comunicado con todo, es amplio y con unas vistas increibles. El servicio de habitaciones y de restauración es notable y muy acorde a la relación calidad-precio y las instalaciones son amplias y elegantes. 
El personal de recepción fue muy eficiente y siempre atento a cualquier petición. En mi caso fueron varias. Y eso, que el hotel estaba con una ocupación alta.

He quedado muy satisfecha y con la intención de volver (ya sea por trabajo o por ocio) y , como no había estado en ningún hotel de esta cadena, he querido dejar constancia de mi experiencia.",5,2008,11,26
47,un excelente hotel,"el hotel está ubicado en la plaza España,  parada del bus  del aeropuerto. hay una estación  de metro en la puerta y varias líneas de buses locales tiene  su parada allí, lo que hace su ubicación muy recomendable.

Un hotel  recomendable y a un precio más que razonable.",5,2008,11,10
47,"Un buen hotel, en una mejor zona.","Hemos estado cinco días en el Hotel Catalonia Plaza de Barcelona y quería comentaros que ha sido estupendo. Las habitaciones muy muy amplias, el hotel muy limpio... el resto de las instalaciones no puedo deciros porque al hotel ibamos a dormir y poco más, y nuestra reserva no incluia desayuno (justo a la vuelta pasando un taller de neumaticos se puede desayunar unas tostadas a un precio medio razonable 6,10 € café + tostadas x 2 personas)
El metro está justo en la puerta del hotel y el aerobus te deja enfrente justo en 15-20 minutos y te recoge prácticamente también en la puerta.
Me parece una buena relación calidad / precio, dentro de lo carísiimos que son todos los hoteles en barcelona.",3,2008,09,15
47,Trato pésimo,"Me he llevado una gran decepción con este hotel. Tenía que quedarme una noche más de lo previsto y después de decírselo al personal de repección de todos los turnos posibles parece que finalmente había quedado claro y no había ningún problema. Mi sorpresa fue cuando llego a mi habitación y no puedo abrirla, me dicen en repección que no tenían claro si me iba a quedar o no, y por eso deciden bloquearme la tarjeta de entrada a mi habitación con mis maletas dentro. Fue indignante.",1,2008,01,14
