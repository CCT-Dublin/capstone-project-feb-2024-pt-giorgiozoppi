61,Can’t recommend this hotel enough,"Fantastic hotel.  Really friendly, helpful staff.  Brilliant location and stones throwaway from Barcelona Cathedral and La Rambla.  Stayed here for 3 nights with a friend and cannot fault the hotel.  Lovely rooftop bar where we ate 2 nights and had cocktails; definitely not to be missed if you stay here. Very centrally located for getting around Barcelona. We used the hop on hop off buses which were about an 8 minute walk away.  Highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again",5,2024,10,17
61,Two days at H10 Madison,"Great location next to the Catedral de Barcelona in the gothic district, close to a taxi stand and a short walk from Pl. Catalunya. Great reception with impeccable service. The breakfast included an option for a spectacular buffet as well as à la carte orders. Daily fresh pastries and fruit, as well as specialty coffee and Cava! Room was well appointed and came with a Krupp coffee machine as well as a fabulous shower only outdone by the wonderful balcony.",5,2024,10,10
61,"Good central location, quiet atrium view room","Overall decent hotel, quiet atrium view room, very well situated with plenty of restaurants in walking distance, less than 10 minutes to Plaça Catalunya. Friendly helpful staff. Roof top bar just OK.  Hot breakfast food not so good which is why for us its only 4 not 5.",4,2024,10,10
61,H10 Madison Barcelona,"Both front desk and staff were friendly and approachable, eager and able to help when needed.  Outstanding location for exploring Barcelona.  Clean and comfortable rooms.  I will look to stay at the H10 Madison on our next visit to Barcelona.",5,2024,10,09
61,Exceptional,We stayed here for several nights while we toured Barcelona. The staff are friendly and very helpful. We stayed in standard rooms that were spacious with great amenities. The bed was comfortable and we had a balcony that overlooked the street below. We made use of the pool on the roof as well as the bar. Everything was great and we’d love to stay again!,5,2024,10,06
61,Amazing!!!,"I can’t say enough good things about this hotel. First of all the location is exactly where you would want to be in Barcelona, the heart of the gothic quarter. 
Decor and cleanliness are excellent, good sized rooms with a fridge, coffee machine and large TV. Our room had a small balcony with a table and chairs. Room was cleaned and restocked daily. We asked for a mattress topper and kettle which were waiting for us when we arrived back after a walk. The rooftop bar serves food and drink with spectacular views of the city. There is also a heated pool and sun lounges. Only 1 English TV channel and that’s BBC news.",5,2024,10,04
61,Fantastic Hotel,"This was a fantastic place to stay. The staff were very friendly and approachable. We made a couple of requests for our room whilst there and these were achieved very quickly. The room was spacious, with a double shower and a small balcony. The location in front of the Barcelona Cathedral was amazing as we could walk to all the local shops and places to eat. We ate at the hotel on a couple of nights The food was very good quality and prices were comparable to the local restaurants. Views from the roof are stunning either day or night We are already thinking about staying here again",5,2024,10,04
61,Little Gem Hotel,"We've just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel and everything about it was perfect. Every member of staff we encountered were so helpful and pleasant, they couldn't do enough for us to make sure we had a great time. We were in rooms 105 and 106 which had a street view and we loved having the windows opened listening to the hustle and bustle outside. The whole hotel was spotlessly clean, rooms were so spacious and the rooftop bar/restaurant was so beautiful to sit with a glass of wine overlooking the city. Definitely will be our go to hotel whenever we visit Barcelona again.",5,2024,10,02
61,Nice hotel but.....,"Absolutely lovely hotel and wouldn't hesitate to stay again.  We arrived late for a pre cruise stay, ate on the rooftop restaurant which was great. 
Breakfast next morning was also lovely.  Everything in the room was good.
Areas for improvement...
Only coffee pod machine in the room.    No instructions and couldn't use it, good job us brits had a kettle  !!
At Breakfast there was no spare cutlery available if you had cereal,  just have some on the side and also milk for tea. We  asked twice for milk and didn't get any.
The pool cleaner soaked my wife's bag and shoes when cleaning the pool area. No common sense, the pool opens at 9 so why clean at 10 ?

Small areas for improvement but still a good hotel",4,2024,10,01
61,Great stay,"Central hotel in nice area.  Easy walk to everywhere.  Helpful staff.  Quiet comfortable room. Good restaurant and great breakfast to set you up for the day.  Would definitely stay again- and am very fussy!  Busses stop outside, handy for metro.  Great Citizen coffee shop next door too.",5,2024,09,30
61,Outstanding experience,"Great service, great location, outstanding rooftop pool and bar. The hotel is perfect placed close to all the small streets and paths in the Gothic area.  We loved the hotel, the check in was easy and the staff seemed to enjoy their work, which came through to the customers. We also visited the hotel last year, and the hotel was so kind to send us an appreciation off which only made us even more happy about this hotel,  We stayed with some friends who came along, and also enjoyed the hotel. And more is on their way.",5,2024,09,29
61,A wonderful break in Barcelona,"We arrived at the hotel for our four night stay just after midday on 15 September, we did not expect our room to be ready yet but to our surprise it was.  Check in was very quick and efficient and we were told that we had been given an upgraded room.  The room was wonderful and overlooked the street in front of the hotel. The rooftop pool and bar was lovely and the food was good, we ate there on one evening.  Breakfast was amazing, so much choice!! We really enjoyed our stay in Barcelona and would come back, and of course stay again at this wonderful hotel.",5,2024,09,28
61,The perfect antidote,"Wonderful hotel, excellent staff, delicious food, very comfortable rooms. We arrived about 1 pm, and our room was ready. Roof top pool a must. Dinner on the roof by the pool is perfect. Barcelona is crazy busy, this hotel is the antidote for a packed city.",5,2024,09,27
61,Perfect,"We are currently in room 702, we got here so early as our cruise disembarking was so efficient, the guys on the desk could not have been helpful and accommodating. 

The room and hotel is just beautiful and perfectly located. We have had a glass of wine on the rooftop and sat by the pool enjoying the incredible views. 

We will stay here again without a shadow of doubt. Love it thank you",5,2024,09,24
61,"Fantastic location, lovely staff but small rooms","A fantastic location in the gothic quarter and an oasis of calm from the hustle and bustle outside. The staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfasts were excellent. I travelled with my sister and we had asked for a twin room. However we had a double bed when we checked in. I asked for it to be made up as two singles but that wasn’t possible: they just put two sets of single sheets side by side on the double bed. 
The room was very quiet - good double glazing - but was also quite small. I don’t think there is room for twin beds in their Classic rooms although they don’t make that clear.",4,2024,09,23
61,A Dream!,"We got married in Barcelona in August of 2024 and our guests stayed at H10 Madison. We also had our welcome party the night ahead of our wedding on the rooftop at H10 Madison. Sandra, the Reservations Manager we worked with to plan this, was absolutely wonderful to work with. She was incredibly accommodating and made planning the welcome party so easy on us and it turned out perfect. Everyone on the staff, the servers, bartenders, managers, front desk, etc., went out of their way to be helpful and friendly--they made this trip what it was for our guests which was so amazing. The accommodations were beautiful and well-kept. The location was also very conveniently located and easily walkable. I can't say more good things about this hotel and highly recommend it to anyone either looking to stay here and/or plan an event!",5,2024,09,16
61,Best Hotel in Barcelona with an exceptional Staff!,"My friends and I were a group of twelve from Texas and we had a great 3 day stay at this beautiful hotel in the center of Barcelona. The rooms were perfect size and very nice. The common areas were spacious for gathering as we headed out to activities. The staff was so personable and helpful with every question we had. Special thanks to Evelyn, Karla, Albert, Glenn, Khadim, and all the rest of the staff that make this hotel the best in Barcelona!",5,2024,09,14
61,Lovely stay at H10 Madison,"We had a wonderful stay at H10 Madison. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was bountiful and very tasty. Our room was clean and very spacious. They provided bath robes and slippers as well, which was a nice touch. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2024,09,13
61,Amazing Place to Stay,"If I could give this hotel a 10 out of 5 I would. The staff is what really makes this place. They are so attentive, helpful and go out of their way to make your stay the best ever. It may not be a 5 star hotel but I would say the service is even better than some 5 stars I have stayed in. 
The location is excellent with good walking proximity to a lot of cool neighborhoods, restaurants and shops. The room itself was also great. Well appointed with good storage. We had a junior suite as there were three of us. 
The rooftop bar has excellent food quality. This will definitely be the place we stay when we come back to Barcelona. Incredible experience.",5,2024,08,31
61,Great City Centre Location,"Excellent value for money hotel in the centre of Barcelona. Rooms were well kept and clean, the rooftop pool was beautiful and the location was perfect - only around 20 minutes walk to some of the major sites. The only downside I would say is the amount of sunbeds around the pool, once or twice we went up to find one single group of people had taken all the beds and left their things on them so no one else could use them whilst they were away - but not something I think the hotel could actively do something about unfortunately. Service by the pool was great and the hotel reception staff were always very welcoming.",5,2024,08,29
61,SIMPLY THE BEST HOTEL EVER!!!,"We stayed for 3 nights and this hotel we absolutely think it is the best hotel ever. Customer service beyond fantastic, location unbelievable, and the vibe of this hotel is incredible. We enjoyed our stay so much that we are planning on going back in October. Thank you guys.",5,2024,08,29
61,H10 Madison in Barcelona (Prime Location),"We recently stayed at H10 Madison in Barcelona while attending a wedding, and I can’t recommend this hotel enough. The location is absolutely perfect—you can easily walk to the beach and visit all the major attractions. With so many great rooftops in the area, the one at H10 Madison stands out as a fantastic spot for a quick bite and some relaxation.

There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance, making it incredibly convenient for dining out. The rooms were comfortable and well-appointed, and the room service was excellent.

One of the highlights of our stay was the front desk team. Whether it was day or night, they were always amazing and eager to help with any requests we had. The doormen were equally impressive, especially Khadim. He was not only helpful and charming but also made a point of remembering our names and engaging in great conversations every time we passed by.

I would definitely stay at H10 Madison again in the future. It’s a truly convenient and welcoming place to stay in Barcelona!",5,2024,08,19
61,Excellent Hotel,"We had a great stay. It was probably the best customer service I've ever had at a hotel. Everyone at the front desk was nice and helpful; the person who checked me in even remembered my name a couple days later. When we arrived, someone came right out and brought our suitcases in. Then they offered us lemonade. Because we had a longer stay, they left us champagne and cake in our room. The rooftop restaurant is great. One of the waiters, Francisco, is super friendly. The pool is small, but nothing compares to swimming on a roof with the views, including a cathedral right nearby!",5,2024,08,18
61,Relaxing Stay!,"This was a relaxing stay at a great location. The hotel is  near Cathedral De Barcelona and walking distance from most tourist spots. We stayed in a classic triple room. The room was well laid out. The bedding was extremely comfortable. The daily breakfast included with our stay was much better than what we expected. Their omelette were our kids favorite. I really liked the waffles with dolce de leche. The restaurant at the terrace was great for a late night snack and drinks. The server (a slender guy, can’t remember his name) was very good at providing recommendations for drinks and meals. We all loved going to the terrace restaurant just because of the service quality.  There are also some decent restaurants across the street to try a well. We will definitely stay here if we are back.",5,2024,08,12
61,Loved this hotel,This hotel hit our sweet spot. Not to large boutique hotel in a great area with great customer service. But this hotel goes further. Offers a great breakfast which is amazing.  Choose from a menu And a buffet. A rooftop experience which is amazing (small pool great bar atmosphere after a busy day site seeing. We loved this place and so happy we are returning in a weeks time,5,2024,08,10
61,Lovely stay in the city centre,"Great Hotel, amazing service throughout the hotel. Nice rooms with air-conditioning, pool and restaurant. Great location for La Ramblas and 10 minutes walk to the Placa de Catalunya where you can pick up the ""Bus Turistic"", which reception gave us a leaflet and plenty of information.",5,2024,08,10
61,Best Hotel Ever!,"We went here for our honeymoon and it was the most amazing hotel! The staff was so incredibly kind, helpful, and attentive.  The staff members who cleaned our room were so kind, thorough, and quick!  :) We have never stayed at a more spotless hotel.  

It was in a wonderful location in the middle of the Gothic Quarter, close to many wonderful restaurants, shops, pharmacies, etc. 

We loved the rooftop terrace with the small pool, nice seating options, and bar/menu.  The food was excellent every time, especially the patatas bravas!  

A special thank-you to Manuel, Javier, Sara, Ana, and Francisco for your hospitality, lovely conversation, and kindness!  We are so grateful we could stay at the H10 Madison!!!
<3 Sarah and Daniel",5,2024,08,08
61,Outstanding,"I am particular about hotels, but this one ticked all the boxes. 
- outstanding staff
- great location
- luxurious rooms
- delicious food
- beautiful roof terrace with poolside service 
- excellent air conditioning (important in August!)
- thoughtful touches, such as welcome drinks, quality chocolates on your pillows
- beautiful lobby with complimentary drinks
- they know how to look after you on special occasions (birthdays, anniversaries)
- bathrooms with nice amenities

I usually look for hotel brands I can trust to be reliably and consistently excellent, such as the Four Seasons or JW group.  I will be adding H10 to this list as I was very impressed with this hotel. 

One recommendation for the hotel: have a separate time of day for adults only in the pool. It is a very small pool and small children overtook it screaming and such. I saw adults leave. It is such a beautiful little pool and would be nice if adults could use and enjoy it.",5,2024,08,08
61,"good location, cosy room with powerful aircon","We stayed at the H10 Madison end July 2024 and book a room with extra bed. The room is in good size (32 sqm) and well maintained. The aircon and ceiling fan is really helpful as Barcelona is very HOT! The hotel's location is convenient for attractions, shows and restaurants.  The hotel staffs (i only know Pedro) r all very kind and helpful. Last I really enjoy the breakfast, the Spanish ham is so delicious. We had a wonderful stay and would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2024,08,01
61,Comfortable stay .,"Nice hotel with amazing staff , small but clean rooms and next to everything you need to do and visit in Barcelona …

Good breakfast , nice location a little noisy . Everything you need is in a distance of a 5 min walk .

Highly recommended. Should return here.",5,2024,07,28
61,Amazing,"Never really bother writing reviews but on this occasion I felt this hotel deserved it. 
We’ve just returned and had a fabulous time. The hotel is well situated, clean and the staff are just lovely. The breakfast was lovely and staff also especially Orien who provided us with restaurant information for my partners birthday. After a long day walking it was lovely to enjoy a dip in the pool. We would certainly recommend this hotel.",5,2024,07,27
61,Fantastic hotel and location,"The perfect location to visit this beautiful city.  The hotel staff couldn’t do enough for us.  The room was well equipped and very pleasant.  The breakfast choices were amazing.  The option to have a hot cooked breakfast was an added bonus and the bacon was delicious.
The roof top bar and pool were a great way to unwind after a day of sight seeing with its fabulous view of the Cathedral and square.
One of the best hotels I’ve stayed in and being so central was an added bonus.  Thank you for making our stay so perfect H10 Madison.",5,2024,07,26
61,Excellent service,"Excellent  professional service, grate hotel location, delicious breakfasts. Special admiration for the view from the roof terrace and swimning pool. 
This all this made our holidays in Barcelona unforgettable and worthy of gratitude to the H10 hotel company.",5,2024,07,25
61,Amazing hotel in the perfect location!,"Fantastic stay! The hotel is perfectly located a stone's throw away from the Barcelona cathedral, the Gothic Quarter, and countless fun shops and restaurants. Our room was clean, quiet, and the bed was quite comfortable. The staff made us feel very welcome and went out of their way to answer any questions we had, provide restaurant recommendations, help us book taxis, etc. Would highly recommend H10 Madison for anyone visiting Barcelona!",5,2024,07,23
61,Loved this hotel!,"H10 Hotels are our new go-to's! We loved this place. Perfect location, great amenities, kind staff -- can't recommend it enough! There's plenty to do in the area, but we also enjoyed our afternoons by the pool. The food is good, drinks are great, we had a wonderful time!",5,2024,07,19
61,Perfect hotel. Great location,"Located steps away from the Barcelona Cathedral, this is well located. Not on La Rambla, but still within walking distance. You can get to many sites in Barcelona on foot from here. Rooms are clean and comfortable. They have a rooftop bar, restaurant and small pool. Views from up there are great as well. Breakfast is included and is excellent! You can get made to order eggs, omelettes and crepes. Would definitely stay there again. join the H10 loyalty program on their website to get a discount when booking.",5,2024,07,19
61,"Perfect stay, central to everything.","This hotel was excellent for a B& B. Travelled from Wales and wanted something central. A taxi from the airport was 40 euros, considering we have never been here before it took us right to the door. The hotel staff always had a smile, and a nice greeting. The hotel rooms were very comfortable with air conditioning, though no kettle so no cups of tea in the room, there was a coffee machine. There was also no iron so take a travel one if needed. The roof top pool was excellent, with waiter service, very nice food, and a complete bar to order from. The pool was lovely and cool, with complimentary towels, so leave the room ones in the room. It was very clean and spotless throughout. Breakfast was delicious, with a vast choice of fresh fruit, cheese, bread, meats, and a cooked option from the menu. We booked a 2 day site seeing bus tour for 44 euros each. With the red and blue route, you seen all of Barcelona. We never seen any pickpockets, or any trouble with beggars. We would definitely come back to this hotel on our next trip here. Thank you to all the staff for making our euro city break lush.",5,2024,07,18
61,Well Done Rooms and Great Service,"We stayed at the H10 Madison hotel for 3 nights after a cruise in June. This is one of the best hotels I have had the pleasure to stay in. The rooms were well done and large, and the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. It has a great rooftop pool and bar which is a great place to unwind after a tough day of site seeing. Having stayed in quite a few hotels around the world over the years this is definitely in the top 5. 

Just want to callout and thank the front desk staff which are amazing!",5,2024,07,17
61,amazing hotel,"Loved this hotel.  The location was perfect, right next to Barcelona Cathedral.  It was a pleasure to be able to walk to everything and then have drinks and sit by the pool on the rooftop deck with amazing views.  The staff at the hotel was top notch.  Would stay here again when we come back.",5,2024,07,14
61,Fabulous Place,"The Hotel was 5 star, The employees are 100% professional. The Hotel is centrally located in a very safe area. The rooms are very clean and well equiped. The roof top bar is nice and you're given a free drink. They even providied us with a Breakfast to go on the way to the plane.They are the best choice for we cruisers to use for our stop overs. Will use again.",5,2024,07,11
61,Barcelona Dream,"We loved our stay at H10 Madison in Barcelona. It is an amazing hotel, with a luxurious feel and the location and proximity to exploring the beauty of Barcelona was perfect for our family. I should preface this review by noting that, we had originally booked here in 2020 when the world shut down due to COVID and they were great about refunding us, and I knew we would eventually re-plan the trip again and finally stay here. We loved the cava and refreshments in the lobby, and my kids enjoyed the candy jar. We booked two rooms, to have some space from the kids, well worth it hah! The rooms were lovely and quite spacious plus nice bathrooms/showers and good lighting. The rooms had windows that opened with a view across the streets below. Perhaps the best part of this lovely hotel is the wonderful top floor balcony overlooking the Gothic Quarter below. We visited the balcony for snacks and drinks with the kids several times. They loved the smoothies. We also had a family breakfast at the hotel restaurant one morning and the food was excellent. We tried so many good things there. Great service as well. One of the best breakfasts we had in Barcelona actually. Our kids loved it. The only negative was that one of the elevators was out of service during our stay, so sometimes that meant long ways or taking the stairs up. It was also easy to call a cab from the lobby or right outside the hotel due to the location. This is non-hotel related, but a downside in Barcelona is that we experienced exorbitant taxi prices initially, my daughter and I speak some Spanish, but the second they know you are foreign, they jack up the cab fare considerably beyond the cab meter amount and claimed it was because we had extra people. Tourists be aware and ask about prices in advance.  We loved the hotel though, and would stay there again in the future.",5,2024,07,10
61,"Excellent Hotel, Great People, Some areas for improvement","The hotel is at an excellent location - steps away from The cathedral and gothic quarter. Check-in was smooth, and efficient. Manuel at front desk was very friendly and service oriented. Rooms are good. Breakfast is very good and the service was excellent. 

All the people across front desk, Avenue (the breakfast restaurant) and the rooftop bar are very warm, friendly and guest centric.

We had a problem with Housekeeping which is an area of improvement - two consecutive days our room was not serviced till early evening/late afternoon, and both days we had to request the front desk to get the room cleaned. The quality of housekeeping could also be better. However the hotel responded quickly and efficiently to our complaints, apologised, fixed the issue and made small gestures like sending a cake and waiving off roof top bar charges. We Appreciated their response.

Recommend the hotel strongly.",4,2024,07,09
61,My New Favorite,Probably one of my favorite hotels in Europe. This is a smaller boutique hotel with fantastic touches. The staff was excellent. Rooms were very well appointed and clean. The rooftop bar had an amazing view and the staff was just top-notch. The location in the Gothic Quarter is perfect. I can't say enough good things about this hotel.,5,2024,07,04
61,Excellent Staff and Location,"H10 Madison is located at a prime spot for exploring the Gothic area. We arrived around 8AM and definitely needed a siesta. Luckily, Sara at check in was able to accommodate us and we were in our room before 10AM. Staff, Room, Breakfast and location are excellent. I highly recommend a visit to the rooftop pool to take in the cathedral view.",5,2024,06,29
61,"Great stay, great staff, very nice breakfast","Stayed for 2 nights for a business trip. Arrived at 3 oclock in the morning. Staff was exceptionally friendly, kind and eager to help and support. Manuel at reception took the extra mile to suggest where to dine and walk around for the 2 hours had available with high accuracy, fully meeting my expectations. At Wednesday morning, hotel staff (Pedro if not mistaken - young with relative curly hair - sorry man for not memorising your name)  also took the extra mile to wait on the road and find a taxi for me at pick hour which really saved my day. Roof bar staff (lady bartender and waitor) also were that kind and served me just seconds before closing (an amazing bloody Mary). Mil gracias guys. You have a great team! 👍 ",5,2024,06,27
61,Fantastic location and great staff,"I've stayed in this hotel before, over 5 years ago, and chose to stay again. The rooms are comfortable, the staff is helpful and friendly, and the view from the roof is beautiful. Comfortable beds and good showers and in the perfect location to get to everything in the Gothic Quarter.",5,2024,06,25
61,Great place to enjoy your stay and sights,"Great location, walking distance to everything! 
The hotel staff was so helpful and friendly and the hotel was very clean and nice! I was surprised how big the rooms were, had heard Europe hotels were small! 
They had a roof top restaurant and pool, with a beautiful view! 
The food was good and a wonderful place to relax after touring all day!
In the lobby everyday they had Champagne, lemonade and fruited water for your enjoyment!
The only draw back was the breakfast was not included and I believe it was 25.00 euros each, so we opted for many delicious cafes in the area 
Highly recommend!",5,2024,06,25
61,Top hotel,"Excellent hotel, within walking distance to the Marina, gothic quarter , beach and metro. We loved our stay here. The rooms were spacious and modern, food was excellent and the staff very efficient and helpful. The roof top bar and pool offer great views of the city.",5,2024,06,20
61,Weekend trip,"Stayed as a party of 5 for 3 nights. Rooms are clean with enough space, comfortable beds and lovely toiletries. Breakfast had fantastic selection and service was even better. It was always a pleasure to see Oriel (won’t be spelt correctly!) at breakfast. He offered recommendations for places to see and restaurants to eat at which all worked out perfect. The roof bar had a quiet and pleasant atmosphere although there wasn’t a lot of space for a sunbathe. Our favourite part of the hotel was the night manager Khadim. He is such a friendly helpful person and greeted us in every evening as though he was waiting to make sure we all got home safe. Location is perfect and centralised. Thank you H10 for a fantastic weekend!",5,2024,06,18
61,Fantastic hotel,We stayed here 1 night before our cruise. The facility was nice and in a great location. The staff was the absolute best. It is a quick ride to the cruise port. Restaurants close too. There is an inexpensive place for breakfast across the street.,5,2024,06,18
61,An awesome stay at H10 Madison,"The hotel is in an awesome location, and very close to the Cathedral. Lovely lobby and interior space with new finishes. The front desk staff were extremely accommodating and kind.  Luciano was so nice and made sure I had everything I needed on the rooftop terrace.  The pool and bar area is great and has a pretty view of the cathedral and city area. Overall, I had a wonderful stay.",5,2024,06,13
61,Very Inpressed,"First time in Europe for me.
The hotel was in pristine condition. Clean, upgraded and a very different and pleasant atmosphere.
Every member of the hotel could not have been nicer and more accommodating.
The chef in the breakfast area made the most interesting and tasty dishes.
The location was close to all of the action in the streets.",5,2024,06,10
61,Excellent Hotel with Wonderful Service,"We selected the H10 Madison for a two night stay following a Mediterranean cruise.  This was our first time in Barcelona.  We really loved our stay.  The location is very nice, easy walk to gothic quarter, sights, restaurants etc.   our room was clean, comfortable, and quiet.   The front desk staff were all very pleasant attentive and helpful.   We got assistance with a restaurant recommendation which was fantastic plus taxi assistance.  I had originally booked the hotel for one night then added a second night later, long story but I was very pleasantly surprised to see how they connected the two reservations to make sure we stayed in the same room both nights.   Breakfast was not included for our stay but we really enjoyed it.  You can order hot food from the menu plus select from an array of cold items plus water fresh squeezed juice and sparkling wine.  Croissants were delicious.    The rooftop area is just lovely.  It features a small pool with 10 loungers which have very comfortable cushions plus a bar /restaurant with ample seating for a good number of people.  You can easily see the Barcelona Cathedral which is close buy as well as Sagrada Familia which is further away.   We enjoyed wonderful service for lunch by the pool plus cocktails.    We were so leased with this hotel stay.  It was our first H10 experience and judging by this stay we wouldn’t hesitate to book with them again.",5,2024,05,28
61,"Overall a great hotel, despite issues","1) The view from the terrace is just like you see it in the pictures 2) The location is PERFECT 3) The staff is highly professional 4) lovely lobby, refreshments available 5) Our room would have been perfect, except: 6) Unfortunately there was a funny sewer like smell in our room 115 that we complained about, they tried to fix it and did make it better, but residual smell lingered and we had to keep the windows open and ceiling fan on. They gave a small compensation.",5,2024,05,27
61,Wonderful 4-5 star hotel in perfect location,"We stayed in this beautiful hotel for two nights.  We had a beautiful 3-person room on the 2nd floor facing the street with two pairs of French doors.  The location is perfect in the Gothic Quarter close to the cathedral.  

Our room was perfect and the hotel staff were very welcoming and helpful. They have a lovely restaurant with delicious breakfasts and a very nice rooftop terrace bar/restaurant. We enjoyed the rooftop on a couple beautiful nights. 

I'd highly recommend this hotel. You will not be disappointed.  You can walk to many sights, stores, and restaurants.",5,2024,05,27

61,A beautiful luxurious hotel with great service,"Having visited Barcelona many times I knew exactly that I wanted to stay somewhere central (as it was a short trip) with a rooftop pool for the children. I did a lot of research and was very happy with my choice. I knew as soon as we arrived that the hotel was going to be good as there was a gentleman stood right outside the main entrance telling us as we we pulled up in a taxi that we are staying at a beautiful hotel. 

The welcome was warm and it was a lovely touch that they have complimentary Cava, still & sparkling water and sweets in the reception area to help yourself.
The decor of this hotel is absolutely lovely and stylish and there are a couple of comfortable seating areas in the lobby.

We had a junior suite for 2 adults and 2 children and the room was perfect and extremely spacious. The pullout sofa was the best I've seen in any hotel and the main bed was very big and extremely comfortable. 
The whole hotel is extremely clean and high tech. They had thought of absolutely everything.....there was a Nespresso machine in the room, complimentary water, slippers, robes, beautiful products from Ritual, lots of extras you don't find in many hotels.
The hotel is very close to the Cathedral (Not Sagrada Familia) and close to Plaza Catalunya and the Ramblas.
The bathroom was huge with a double shower and double sink with big fluffy towels!

There is a beautiful terrace with great views of the city and a nice plunge pool with lounge beds and tables and chairs with table service. The food is simple but good.
We had breakfast included in our rate which was lovely and included everything you could think of and more (both buffet & alla carte).
The guys on the desk are great and will help you with everything you need.

Our airline cancelled our flight on the day we were leaving and rebooked us onto another flight the next day so we needed to find accommodation for an additional night. We had actually already checked out of the hotel and a quick search on the internet was showing that this hotel was full however we went back and spoke with Pedro directly who was extremely helpful and kind and found us a room at a good rate as they had just received a cancellation.  

We had room service one night as it was late for the children and we were up early the next day for an early flight and the food arrived quickly and was lovely and warm.

The hotel is actually quite small but has a really fresh and luxurious feel to it and is perfect for a city break. Although not the cheapest H10 hotel you will love it! It's a  great hotel in a lovely central location and I'd stay again for sure.",5,2024,05,14
61,Great Choice for Centrally Located Hotel,"Great location, great staff and very conveniently located.  Clean nice linens and the bed comfortable.  There is a rooftop bar and small pool with a nice view.  You’re far enough away to not have any late-night noise disruptions, but still very close to Las Ramblas as well as buses and train stops.  Taxis are everywhere, so if a bus or train isn’t appealing, it’s very easy to catch a cab.",4,2024,04,28
61,"Great hotel, great location","A great spot in a great location.  The staff were extremely helpful. There was free  speaking water and cava each evening. The best part is the rooftop pool and bar. The room was a typical size in Europe (small). Had an issue with the shower door not keeping all the water inside the shower, but not a big deal.",5,2024,04,22
61,Luxury and location,"H10 Madison is a lovely option right around the corner from the cathedral.  From start to finish it feels luxurious, from the beautiful lobby with its welcome bottle of Prosecco and constant supply of fresh water to the library to the hotel restaurant.  Rooms are spacious and well-equipped.  Rooftop balcony has a bar and small pool with lounge chairs; both the cozy downstairs lounge and the rooftop area offer a welcome respite for your sightseeing.",5,2024,04,22
61,"Location, Amazing Staff, Super Cute Hotel!","This hotel exceeded our expectations, excellent staff, very helpful and willing to help with any questions you may have. Very cute boutique hotel and the location is excellent. Walking distance to most attractions, the cathedral, La Boqueria market, bus and subway station, as well as the beach. Most places are 15 minutes walking distance to your hotel. And there are several great restaurants on the same street as this hotel. I will definitely return here.",5,2024,04,15
61,Exceptional in every way,"I had never heard of the H10 brand but was supremely impressed by this hotel in every way during our four night stay in April 2024. The location is ideal-- straddling the Gothic/old city, the Eixample neighborhood, and with easy subway access on a number of lines depending on where you are going.  It's also a beautiful building with a lovely rooftop bar (good food, not terribly expensive either) and a swimming pool (which we did not use). The staff were  incredibly polite and genuinely helpful.

The rooms were not large but sufficiently spacious and extremely well furnished. There was the typical free coffee, but also free water and a fridge, which was much appreciated. The bathroom was also very spacious and elegant with superb towels and gowns and a lovely rain shower.  And much to my happy surprise, there was no street noise permeating the room. 

(FYI, there's another H10 hotel, the Cubik, just a few doors down that is also very nice. IF for some reason this one is unavailable, check that too!) 

All in all, I would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2024,04,14
61,Lovely hotel in the heart of the Gothic Quarter,"Great hotel in a perfect location for exploring the Gothic Quarter and seafront. We had a view of the old cathedral from our balcony and the view from the roof terrace was amazing. Our room was a good size and spotlessly clean. The staff at the reception desk were super helpful, they recommended restaurants and made bookings for us. The breakfast offering was great, buffet and also cooked selection. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2024,04,14
61,Wonderful hotel in a great central location,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 5-night stay at the H10 Madison Hotel in late March.  Room 306 was terrific - at the end of the hall, quiet, with a small balcony, where, if you looked to the right, you could catch a glimpse of the Barcelona Cathedral amazing. Friendly and accommodating reception staff, quick and easy check-in process, we were greeted with champagne and given a map of the city with circled highlights to see and do.  While the room was on the traditionally European smaller side, it was extremely clean, nice, and comfortable.  Lots of different lighting options to alter the ambience, both in the bedroom and the bathroom. Was pleased that there was a ceiling fan to keep air moving.  Enjoy the many electrical outlets in both bedroom and bathroom. And immaculately, clean, modern bathroom with modern fixtures, marble floor, frameless marble rainshower and the largest, softest bath towels ever. Terrifuc water pressure and temperature and great bath products. Room included a safe, closet, minibar. We were provided two complimentary bottles of water daily. Be sure to join the H10 loyalty program to receive a discount on your hotel rate plus a gift for joining, which was a voucher for a free drink per guest at the rooftop bar. On our first night, we received a welcome box of artisan chocolates, what a delightful surprise. a very good bed and even better pillows. The room included a desk with a chair and lamp if you needed to do a little work or reading.  There is also an upholstered guest chair with a side table for sitting.  The hotel is in a terrific central location with easy access to many Barcelona sites, either by foot or mass transit  daily champagne is available in the lobby, and there was also nightly turned down service with chocolates left on the bed.  Great room, darkening drapes, and plantation shutters to allow for a good night’s sleep. Nice rooftop bar/restaurant with umbrellas featuring heat lamps and a small plunge pool with incredible views of the Barcelona Cathedral and city.  I’m pretty sure I’ve just discovered my favorite new European hotel chain. These folks do everything right and exceeded expectations with pleasant surprises. I will definitely look to stay at their other properties in other cities and countries and highly recommend them.",5,2024,04,11
61,No Gym and no arrangement for one,"No GYM IN 2024, No hot porridge and no Decaf tea Unbelievable !!!
I really wanted to love this place but in 2024 not having a gym is really shocking and not a 4* hotel standard. 
I asked about the arrangement with a gym mentioned in some reviews and this does not exist anymore.  
This morning they served 'orange juice' described as fresh but tasted like they had definitely mixed it with something. overall the dining experience was a little lacking- no hot porridge either. Finally they had no decaf tea and had never even heard of it. It's the little things people.

On a positive note, the cleaning was brilliantly done, the staff very friendly.",3,2024,04,10
61,Great hotel in a great location,"Great hotel in a great location! The rooms and public spaces are lovely and well done. The hotel is in the middle of the gothic quarter so it’s close to many things, including great coffee shops and restaurants. The staff were also kind and helpful. We would definitely stay here again!",5,2024,03,31
61,Perfect location!,"Visited this weekend for my daughters 21st Birthday. The staff were fabulous from the moment we arrived. So pleasant and welcoming. They had even left a birthday treat in our room which was spotlessly clean.
The location couldn't have been better. 
Our only small gripe was the roof terrace. Whilst it is stunning and a welcome addition to a central hotel, €72 for 4 cocktails, patatas bravas and a caesar salad seems excessive. My burger and her steak on one night were not cooked as asked either. Staff however did take away and cook further without issues. 

Overall, highly recommended. What made it for us, was the staff.",4,2024,03,18
61,Nice experience,"H10 Madison is a very nice hotel located in city center, near by Barcelona Cathedral and Gothic quarter. Metro station is 5 minutes walk.
Hotel room is very nice, the breakfast is good and hotel staff is very professional and kind.
There is a wonderful view on the rooftop with a small bar and small swimming pool.",5,2024,03,14
61,Great Stay H10 Madison Barcelona,"A great stay in the heart of the Gothic Quarter in Barcelona. Walking distance to many remarkable sites and great restaurants. The staff and management were completely engaged, unbelievably helpful, friendly and accommodating. They were really guest focused. The lobby, rooms and rooftop bar/pool were beautiful and comfortable. The concierge service was always informed, ready and available. A special thanks to Glenn and Erick, as they went beyond the call of duty to help me resolve a last minute FC Barcelona football ticket situation. I highly recommend staying here.",5,2024,03,13
61,Worth revisiting,"This was such a luxury hotel I wish I could stay there again. Very comfortable rooms, friendly staff (got our room organized ahead of time), and a stunning view from the rooftop pool of the Barcelona Cathedral. The tapas and wine in the rooftop bar were also excellent.",5,2024,03,13
61,A great hotel with excellent service in the Gothic quarter,"This is an excellent hotel, well-placed for sight seeing, very welcoming with staff that think about how to make your stay memorable. We went there for a weekend to celebrate my wife's birthday. They welcomed us with a glass of fizz and answered our questions about directions and orientation very clearly. The next day when we came back they had thoughtfully left a bottle of fizz to celebrate my wife's birthday!
The breakfast are very good and the sevice so friendly; the rooftop bar even in February is a good service and well used, people were even using the splash pool but not us! We had a junior suite and the facilities were very good and comfortable; large room sitting area, great bathroom and those little chocolates on the pillow and pyjamas arranged! There were. some of the best services we have had on our travels. They provide a tapas service at the hotel until late at night but there are very many good restaurants locally and the Metro is not far for the various lines and the Gothic quarter locally is great to explore with many off grid surprises like the bodegas del vermud!
It was a a great weekend backed up by a lovely responsive service by everyone in the hotel. We will go back there!",5,2024,02,29
61,Great location. Excellent breakfast. Lovely staff.,"We stayed 4 nights in a lovely junior suite. Really spacious and quiet accommodation - great for the 3 of us - 2 adults and a teen.  We stayed over Valentine’s and we had lots of treats left for us which was such a nice touch. The roof terrace bar has great views, lots of heaters and blankets to keep us cozy on the chilly nights. We didn’t eat on the terrace but the selection of drinks was great. We were always given extra treats by the staff. The breakfast is amazing. A large range of hot and cold foods. Lots of fresh juices and cava which was a welcome bonus. Trust me it goes great with breakfast! The staff in the restaurant and the terrace were so lovely and were always helpful and friendly ensuring we had a great service.  The hotel is in a great location for all attractions with most being in easy walking distance. Though we found taxi prices very reasonable - it cost €7 to the hotel from Sagrada familia. The reception staff like the other staff were always very welcoming. Lots of cafes, bars and restaurants close by.",5,2024,02,19
61,Weekend trip with family,"We spent a lovely few days at this well situated hotel. Very close to the cathedral and a wide selection of eateries. The rooms were nicely decorated, clean, good amenities and spacious for a city centre hotel. Staff were very helpful and friendly. There was a good selection of food, hot and cold, at breakfast. The rooftop pool and alfresco bar, which served food, were a pleasant addition with views of the city. The only downside is that evening meals were not served in the restaurant, only in the rooftop bar and there was no bar indoors. Not sure of the reason for this but we still spent a few hours each evening enjoying the city skyline with a few beverages. This was the second h10 hotel we have stayed at and have not been disappointed so will be looking at staying in another next time we visit Spain.",4,2024,02,17
61,"Great people, great place","This is an excellent hotel in a very convenient location for all that central Barcelona offers. We loved our room (115) and appreciated the rooftop bar - although it was early February.
But it’s the people who make a hotel experience great and the Madison personnel were exceptional: friendly, patient and helpful.
Our thanks to all and a special thank you to Glenn. We arrived late afternoon and by early evening, unpacked tired and hungry after a day’s travel we didn’t feel like wandering around looking for a suitable place to eat. So we asked Glenn to suggest somewhere nearby to get a good meal. He immediately booked us in at La Cuina De Laietana, a few minutes walk away, where we enjoyed a really fine Spanish supper. 
We will definitely book into The H10 Madison next time we’re in Barcelona.",5,2024,02,11
61,Beautifully Renovated Hotel with Friendly & Accomodating Staff...Mostly,"I'll start with con: one specific server in the downstairs dining/ restaurant was undeniably SUB PAR: Shecalways attended our table late as in 2 to 3 tables could enter and sit after us and she'd always attend those tables before ours. She once chastised me when I  sat alone at a two person table for several mintutes , thinking I would be eating alone, then moved to a larger 4 person table once I learned my party was headed downstairs to join me, even though she had never attended to me in those minutes I sat and waited and there were a plethora of open available tables. Same server would bring room temp coffee, even though I would receive hot coffee when I walked up to exact same barista and obtain HOT coffee. Every time I we asked for cream for our table, she pretended she had no idea what it was, so we just made it a habit to ask the other servers, til I eventually just started my day at the nearby Starbucks . She made it more than apparent the week we were there that she did NOT want us there.

PROS: I could go on & on about the ""bad"" apple, but one bad apple does not spoil a bunch. The remainder of the dining servers, who also worked at rooftop bar, went above and beyond! The front desk staff were friendly and accommodating. It's a beautifully renovated hotel and rooms were as expected (looked like photos on website), There were  built in bedside tables with charging docks on either side. My room had two balconies although it only faced street (unfortunately whereconstruction was taking place below) it allowed us to people watch while winding down with wine when returning to our room in the evening before heading back out for dinner/shows. They maintained flow of champagne/cava in theclobby which was great added bonus as we met up with friends & met new ones while congregating in the two small, quaint 1st floor beautifully decorated sitting areas before or after our days full site seeing trips .The rooftop restaurant was a festive added touch ( although ground very slippery when it drizzled rain so where rubber button grip shows if it's rained that day), with a clear view of the cathedral both day & night. We were in short walking distance to Les Rambles for great shopping & walk to Placa de Catalunya for even more shopping as well as tour bus line stops.",5,2024,02,06
61,Great hotel and close to everything!,"What a great hotel, wonderful staff and a perfect location.  From check-in to check out the staff could not have been nicer. Everything was perfect in our room when we arrived and what a treat the second night when we found little chocolates on our pillow. All of the stuff we encountered were wonderful but Ruth is exceptional. When we return to Barcelona we will definitely stay at the H 10 Madison again. Enjoyed it so much that we are now looking at an H10 hotel for our visit to Berlin.",5,2024,01,24
61,Very nice hotel,"A wonderful experience!  H10 Madison is in a central location that's perfect for exploring the Gothic quarter.  The hotel is clean and quiet and the staff is friendly, multi-lingual and professional.  Breakfast was tasty with a great selection. Enjoy a drink or food on rooftop bar.   Would definitely return!",5,2024,01,13
61,Excellent Hotel,Excellent hotel. Having read the reviews prior to booking I wasn’t disappointed with the hotel. I am regular traveller with business and was so pleased with this choice. Staff were excellent all the way through the hotel. Welcoming and really accommodating. I would have no delay in booking with this hotel in the future. Superb location and stunning views.,5,2024,01,08
61,Four days in Barcelona with my six year old daughter.,"The location is great- central, but not on a main road.
Staff were all very helpful and friendly.
Room was clean and comfortable.
We paid extra for the breakfast and it was worth it. They did a great job at catering for us as gluten free guests.",5,2024,01,06
61,"Best Hotel, Great Location.","This was our second stay at a H10 hotel. The first was back in 2019 where we stayed at H10 Montcada.

When I was looking to book again, I compared pricing between both hotels and H10 Madison was slightly lower than H10 Montcada. Luckily both are in the same area, which is an excellent location to stay in Barcelona. Located just off via Laietana, you have El Born on the east side and Gothic quarter on the west side.  The  Mercat de Santa Caterina is just a few blocks away, as well as the Palau de la Música Catalana.  The Mercado de La Boqueria on Las Ramblas is a 10 minute walk from the hotel. On the corner of via Laietana and c/de Sant Pere Mes Baix is a Carrefour market (great for toiletries, snacks, wine, and vodka) and Capppuccino, a place for coffee and tea. 

Our room was on the 6th floor, #612. It had a small balcony where you could look out to the right and see the Cathedral. Inside the room were windows that also faced the Cathedral.  Being on the 6th floor we heard no noise at all when we closed our soundproof windows. That was really nice. One woman we met said her room, first floor, was very noisy, as she could hear the trash trucks empty the bins that were just outside her window. 

The room had a small sitting area and a very comfortable bed. Nice large bathroom with bright lights. I hate being in hotels that have dark bathrooms. The shower had good water pressure. 

Amenities include bathrobes, slippers, a vanity kit, lovely shampoo and conditioner, hair dryer, and a safe located in the closet. 

The bathroom had shelving under the sink and there was a decent amount of counter top. I do wish they had hooks on the bathroom walls (to the right in my photo) for things to hang. There's plenty of room to do this. 

The staff are top notch. Excellent service and very friendly and helpful. 

In the lobby was a table that had a bottle of Cava; and water. That's a nice touch.

Love the rooftop area with the bar and great views of the city. They had heated lamps for the cold nights.

H10 Madison is rated as a 4-star hotel, but I consider it a 5-star hotel. 

H10 Hotels will always be my go-go hotel anytime I'm in Barcelona. 

Lastly, if you become an H10 member, you will get a 5% discount on your bookings.

",5,2024,01,04
61,I would not stay anywhere else in Barcelona,"I cannot praise this hotel enough. When I read the reviews before booking my stay, I thought to myself ""surely there has to be something wrong/surely these great reviews cannot all be true""-but they were! I booked two rooms-one for myself, the other for my elderly parents. This was their first visit to Barcelona. Starting with the location-it is ideal for exploring Barcelona on foot and it is also easy to hail a taxi. There were plenty of restaurants within walking distance. The location is perfect.

Regarding the hotel team/staff-they could not do enough to make our visit more enjoyable. They made it clear to us on more than one occasion that they were there for us for anything we needed. 

We booked two Classic rooms-they were perfect for us. Ample wardrobe space to hang clothing, with a couple of shelves/drawers for folded underwear, etc. The shower temperature was excellent-lots of hot water and the pressure was excellent.

What struck me about this hotel was how bright the rooms were-the lighting was amazing, unlike many hotels where you may have one or two lamps and one light in the middle of the room & the rooms seem dark. The H10 Madison has a lot of lighting which makes getting dressed and reading, much more pleasant. 

I opted out of housekeeping but the housekeeping team were always on hand for extra towels, water or other bathroom amenities. 

The bed was super comfortable with lots of pillows. 

What I really valued was how quiet my room was-the soundproofing was excellent. I was facing the Cathedral so I did hear the chiming but it never lasted long and it was part of my Barcelona experience-I really loved it. If you can get a room facing the Cathedral-do. The view is stunning when the sun rises. 

We dined at the Rooftop bar on one afternoon and Alberto brought us some blankets to keep on our laps as it was a little chilly-honestly, the hotel staff could not do enough for us. They are all so lovely and professional. 

I want to say a huge thanks to all of the staff in the dining area: Theo, Alberto, Ravi, the waiter who was getting married (I am unsure how to spell his name but it starts with an ""O""), & all of the lovely reception team-Jemm, Manuel, Sara, Ruth, Sandra & others who's names I did not remember to note down. You are all so lovely and professional, and you really do make the hotel as special as it is.  

I honestly cannot fault the hotel.

If I was to make any recommendations or give feedback to the hotel (and this is really just a recommendation-not a criticism), it would only be to please consider having more plant based options at breakfast, i.e., vegan/plant based cheese or yoghurts. I loved their avocado on toast and the fresh tomato in olive oil that I spread on my roll, but it would have been great to have been able to have some plant based cheese on alternative days. 

I would definitely give the H10 Madison a 5/5 and without a doubt, I would book this hotel again when I return to Barcelona.
 
Thank you to the entire H10 Madison team. You really are a super bunch who deserve all of the praise you receive. ",5,2024,01,04
61,Best Hotel in Barcelona,Staying at the H10 Madison is a 5 star experience from them minute you walk in the door. You will receive excellent customer service from everyone. The rooms are extremely comfortable. Ask for an interior facing room if you are a light sleeper. The breakfast is amazing. You will look forward to it everyday. The location is perfect. It will pain you to leave. Rodolfo at the front desk was fabulous at helping us with every detail upon our departure. Staying here was delightful and we can't wait to return. ,5,2024,01,03
61,Very impressed,"The hotel is perfect! Well located in the Gothic Quarter, the hotel offers an incredible view of the cathedral and is within walking distance of many attractions, restaurants, and public transportation. The Palace of Catalan music is very close to the hotel and is worth a visit. 

We are a group of 3, and it's often difficult to find ""nice"" rooms for 3 in Europe. The triple room was a good size for me and my two adult daughters, with double sinks, and a privacy partition for the shower and toilet stall. 

The decor is fresh and upscale, with plenty of outlets and a decent hair dryer, much better than I expected from a hotel. Thoughtful amenities like a shoe shine sponge, toothpaste and toothbrush, and comb were provided in addition to shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, and lotion in large containers attached to the wall. Plush robes and slippers are a nice touch. 

Glass water bottles were replenished every day. 

Front desk staff was super friendly and helpful, especially Manuel, who offered excellent suggestions for restaurants and provided us with a map and directions. I heard him helping a guest with missing luggage, and he was so kind. 

The rooftop bar area has an incredible view, especially at night. 

There was water, lemonade, and sparkling wine in the lobby at all times, along with cute marshmallows. 

Very impressed and would return and recommend to others. ",5,2024,01,01
61,Multi-generational family trip success,Great location!  We walked almost everywhere but Park Guell.  The hotel is modern and clean.  The roof top was beautiful.  My kids swam in the pool three times while we where there.  We would stay here again in a heart beat.,5,2024,01,01
61,best hotel for honeymoon trip,"best hotel for our honeymoon trip in 3 countries. very close to the center, rooms are very new , nice view. the people who work here gave us many amenities for honeymoon and they were always happy to talk to us. come here!",5,2023,12,30
61,Lives up to expectations!,"Having read the excellent reviews of this hotel, I half expected to be disappointed but no, this is an outstanding hotel that offers friendly service and well presented accommodation at good value for its price point. We stayed in a junior suite and a cathedral view room and both were very comfortable. The staff were welcoming and helpful. The breakfast was very enjoyable- both the buffet and the cooked selextion. Great poached eggs! I recommend this hotel for people who are visiting Barcelona for the first time as it is well located for everything in easy walking distance.",5,2023,12,29
61,"Great centrally located hotel, with beautiful rooftop views.","We stayed at H10 Madison for  three days before our Mediterranean Cruise.  The hotel is in the middle of the Gothic Quarter.  Our room was very clean, modern and comfortable.  The staff were amazing, even going out of their way to find my Kindle that got caught up in the bedsheet changes one morning. (It ended up in the laundry room!)   We were able to walk to most of the sites we wanted to see, and found great restaurants in the area.  Our only complaint was the noise from multiple street repairs starting quite early in the morning.  The rooftop bar is a great way to end the day with a cocktail and the beautiful views of the city.",4,2023,12,28
61,A lovely hotel,"This is a lovely hotel with helpful and friendly staff. It is well located centrally in Bcn, close to the cathedral and the plaza Catalûnya. There are plenty of eateries nearby, and access to public transport is good.
The room was not huge, although the bathroom was big and had a double shower. It is modern, well appointed and comfortable.  Big towels, Rituals amenities and a full-length mirror are the kind of thoughtful touches we appreciate. 
We loved the rooftop bar and restaurant with its glimpse of the Sagrada Familia and full view of the cathedral. Seating is outdoor, but in winter there is heating and rugs, so it was enjoyable to be outside. 
We received a surprise room service visit with a bottle of cava and cake to celebrate my partner’s birthday ( they must have noted it from his id). 
In all, a really nice place to stay, highly recommended.",5,2023,12,22
61,"Location, location, location (and good quality!)",Amazing location mere steps from the Cathedral and only a few minutes walk to both the Gothic quarter and El Born districts. Rooms are surprisingly spacious given the central location and front desk staff is fantastic. Would definitely come back here!,5,2023,12,22
61,Beautiful hotel- great value,"From the moment we arrived the service has been excellent. Reception welcoming and really helpful with directions and  restaurant recommendations
Breakfast fantastic. Mix of buffet but also freshly cooked hot food to order  both a savoury and sweet course. Daughter loved the crepes
Shout out to Oriol always smiling and very welcoming to breakfast
Roof top bar lovely, both a bar and restaurant.   it  does have heaters but probably best enjoyed when it’s warmer 
Rooms lovely bathrooms great
Great location next to the cathedral  on a side street so no noise at night
Not a huge hotel so you do get a better personal service",5,2023,12,17
61,"Brilliant hotel, staff and location ","This is a brilliant hotel in the gothic quarters. The check in staff were extremely friendly and  polite. We booked two rooms next to each other. The rooms we booked were on the smallish size but perfect for us. Absolutely clean and brilliant showers. On arrival we were given chocolates and some pastries. Everyday we got a box of Lindt. We didn’t have breakfast at the hotel as there’s loads of coffee shops on your door step. 

Location was brilliant. We walked everywhere. The Barcelona cathedral is less than 5 minutes and the market as well. A short walk to La Rambla. Barcelona is a great walking city. We used the taxi to La Sagrada, Park Güell and the oceanfront. Lots of restaurants everywhere. 

I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again. ",5,2023,12,08
61,Great Hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"Extremely friendly stuff from the reception to the restaurant. Even when I forgot a jacket in the room, they were on it and made sure it would be shipped to me asap.
Very good breakfast, great location and modern rooms with large bathrooms. 
I would always stay there again",5,2023,12,05
61,Brilliant stay celebrating 40th Birthday,"Well what an excellent stay my partner & I have had celebrating her 40th birthday. The hotel is beautiful & clean, the staff were friendly & attentive, and the breakfast was wonderful. Was given bubbly on our arrival and went straight up to the roof terrace where we had some lovely tapas overlooking the City. The complimentary bottle of bubbly and cake placed in our room was a lovely & unexpected surprise on the Saturday which was my partners birthday. We felt really welcome here and would recommend the Madison to all. Overall brilliant stay.",5,2023,12,04
61,Really nice boutique hotel with a great central location,"My wife and I finished off our anniversary trip at this lovely Boutique hotel. The hotel looks really classy and has a central location in the gothic quarter, close to Las Ramblas and near the cathedral. The location is great and highly recommended as most sights are within walking distance (aside from La Sagrada Familia and Park Guell). 

When we arrived we were welcomed warmly by Glenn and Manuel and we were also offered some welcome drinks. Glenn had been in touch before our stay and communication was prompt. The hotel is relatively small and we took our own luggage to the room. The room was compact, had a nice balcony with all amenities required. For our anniversary we were given a note, luxury collection of chocolates and cakes as well as some alcoholic drink. Upon advising them of that we don't drink alcohol they promptly changed it to mocktails which were delicious. 

Breakfast had a mix of buffet and a la carte. It is on the ground floor restaurant and was a real fine dining experience. I was very high quality and the service was really good especially from ""Oriol"" who had such positive energy and was genuine, honest and so professional. 

There is a rooftop bar and restaurant with great views. It is a nice place to just chill out, it also has a pool area. 

In general service was mixed and a little hit and miss. There seems to not be enough staff at the hotel as we had to wait a while for kettle, cups and tea bags (often the front of house had to come to give it to us). Front of house staff didn't seem to know much about what is going on locally or didn't really have any good restaurant recommendations. 

At checkout the front of house was rather firm and not very flexible and whilst appreciating it was a busy time some adjustment would have been appreciated. We also arranged an airport taxi through the hotel and were charged excess fraudulently. We raised the issue with the hotel and they successfully addressed and resolved the matter promptly. 

All in all this is a really good hotel and with some tweaks can become exceptional. We would highly recommend for the convenience,  exceptional location and great breakfast. ",4,2023,12,03
61,H10 Madison ticks all the boxes for a visit to Barcelona! ,"Location, room,  service, and cleanliness were  all top notch!  I have stayed at several Barcelona luxury hotels and this one tops them all. Breakfast area is gorgeous and the food is fabulous.  Rooftop bar and pool should also be experienced!  The views are incredible! ",5,2023,11,12
61,Great stay!,"Such a lovely hotel, the decor is stylish and the roof top bar with pool is great in the sun.
all the little extras made you know you were in a 4* hotel, from the robes to bottled water to lovely friendly staff willing to do as much as they can to help
Good location, definitely stay here again",5,2023,11,12
61,Great experience ,"This hotel exceeded our expectations. The property is beautiful.  It is well maintained and very welcoming.   We had a double room with a balcony.   The room size was good, with an oversized bathroom and comfortable beds.  The lobby, rooftop area, and restaurant were beautiful.   The welcome drinks were appreciated!  
The location worked well for us.  We could walk to everything we wanted to see.  The area also felt safe.
The best thing about this hotel is the staff.  Everyone was warm, helpful, professional, and fun.  They all seemed to enjoy being there.  They made our stay very enjoyable.   A special thank you to Alberto and Maurice.   ",5,2023,11,07
61,Long weekend for friends 50th,"Fantastic experience, literally no negatives - had a great long weekend! Great friendly staff, great location, great cleanliness, great food, great views from terrace and overall a lovely atmosphere. Not usually one to return to the same place as like trying different ones but would definitively return here",5,2023,11,06
61,Pleasantly Surprised,"Beautiful hotel. Great location. Staff at the front desk were very helpful and professional. Plenty of good restaurants and shopping in the area. There is a restaurant conveniently located inside the hotel. However, we did not eat there. We did enjoy a few cocktails at the rooftop bar. Also enjoyed their pool while there. The views from the bar/pool area are wonderful! Would definitely stay here again.",5,2023,11,02
61,Barcelona vacation ,Beautiful Hotel in the heart of the city. Walking distance to Barcelona cathedral and all the city has to offer. The roof top is an excellent view and staff is accommodating. Only negative I found during my stay was the hotel is on an alley with lots of motorized bikes driving and traffic noise….also there’s some noise associated with garbage trucks during the night so bring ear plugs. ,4,2023,11,02
61,Amazing hotel ,"Amazing hotel. The best I’ve ever stayed in. Staff are so friendly and helpful. Location is great. We stayed on 5 th floor. View of Barcelona cathedral from our balcony. Huge comfy bed spacious bathroom with robes slippers lovely toiletries. Breakfasts are amazing so many choices. I’m coeliac and they gave me a gluten free package that had warm baguette, museli, croissant, crackers  cake etc. It was my partner’s birthday and we had complimentary cava and cake in our room. The roof top terrace pool and  bar is a fabulous way to relax after sightseeing. They have gluten free Estella damn  lager Great food  views  and  excellent service. I can’t fault this hotel and definitely recommend it ",5,2023,11,01
61,"Great hotel, spectacular location!","A wonderful hotel PERFECTLY situated in Barcelona.  Nice breakfast - seriously good!  Spacious, luxurious room with a great bed and large bathroom.  Clean, modern, comfortable.  Did I mention the great location?  GREAT LOCATION.

Highly, highly recommend!  Super friendly staff, lovely rooftop.  ",5,2023,10,31
61,Cannot rate our stay in the this hotel highly enough.,"We arrived late in the aftenoon after a 30 hour journey from Austraila.
Swissair left our bags in Zurich for a full 5 days 🙁, but the welcoming and friendly staff in the this hotel made our first visit to Barcelona memorably wonderful.
Our room had a balcony from which we could see the cathedral.  Room was well appointed with good bathroom and comfy bed.
Breakfast was varied and tasty with a great combination of buffet items and a la carte options. (probably the best we had during a 6 week trip through Stain, France and Italy)
Location is central making it easy to walk pretty much everywhere.
But without doubt the standout for us were the staff.  From reception to the houskeeping and restaurant staff everyone was so polite, friendly and helpfull.
We will definitely be back 🙂",5,2023,10,28
61,Bravo H10 Madison!!!,"Just got back from Barcelona and Portugal, with my wife and 6 friends,  and I'm happy to say that the H10 Madison may have been the best Hotel I have ever stayed in.  Everything from the room, the bathroom, the amenities, the location. Just Perfect!  Located next to the Gothic Quarter, made easy access to many of the great sights of Barcelona. We always ended our day with drinks on the roof top bar and pool area.  WOW!  The daily free CAVA was an extra treat.  If I had to say one thing that was a little off it's that Uber drivers can't ever seem to get within a block of the hotel (Taxi drivers can but not Uber) when dropping us off.  That could be because of the quiant location just down the street from the Barcelona Cathedral.  Bravo H10 Madison, if the other H10's are like you, you have several new fans!",5,2023,10,26
61,"Fabulous hotel for sightseeing,  comfort and ambience.","Wonderful hotel, ideal location, lovely helpful staff, great room, so quiet, really comfortable bed, fabulous breakfast,  lovely rooftop bar. Absolutely loved it and would love to return. We enjoyed very tasty tapas and the monitor were the best!",5,2023,10,24
61,Stay Here,Everything was excellent! Room was large and very clean. Loved the roof top bar and pool. Everyone working at the hotel was very helpful. I would choose this hotel again. Location was great and the price was more than reasonable.,5,2023,10,22
61,"Antoni Gaudí and the H10 Madison, I didn't know I was a fan until I got to Barcelona","The H10 Madison is located about 3 blocks from Plaça de Catalunya which is a major transportation hub for Barcelona. The AeroBus, which runs from Josep Tarradellas Barcelona-El Prat Airport starts and ends there. Also, the Barcelona Metro is available there and the Hop On, Hop Off bus routes start and stop there.

The hotel is nice. The rooms are adequate, not huge but not too small. The front desk and the roof top bar staff are friendly and helpful. We utilized the roof top bar and pool almost every day. It was nice to return to the hotel and review the day’s events there. The views from the roof top are awesome and include La Sagrada Familia and the Cathedral of Barcelona. 

The Placa Nova, is about a block from the H10 Madison. It’s a large square associated with the Cathedral of Barcelona.  There are many activities that happen there. We saw groups of young men doing acrobatics, women singing and others playing instruments. There always seemed to be something going on.

Our group did take the Hop On, Hop Off bus, both the Red and Blue Routes. Sites we visited using the bus included: Park Güell, which was designed by Antoni Gaudí, the Gaudí House, another interesting design by the same guy and the Sagrada Familia, also by Gaudi. Plus, many other places including the beach.

The H10 Madison is near many interesting places, is a nice and friendly place and has a great roof top bar and pool. I would highly recommend this place to anyone",5,2023,10,13
61,Very nice hotel and staff,"Very good hotel in everything, location, service, recipe. The rooms are clean, the staff is polite and helpful in everything. The breakfast is wonderful. All the famous places are near the hotel. I would like to say thank again to all the staff",5,2023,10,12
61,Great hotel and staff,"We continue to love everything about this hotel and staff.  The front desk staff including Jemm, Ruth and Sara are ever so friendly and helpful.  Early arrival luggage storage; no problem.  Restaurant recommendations great.  Interfacing with taxi at hotel to ensure correct fare (a previous problem) addressed.  Great staff!!  The room on 4th floor was comfortable and quiet.  Housekeeping on top of their game.  We had included breakfast which far expected our expectations with a very attentive wait staff refilling our coffee; a delight. We will return next year,",5,2023,10,11
61,You’ll be happy here.,"From arrival to departure, and everything in between, this is a wonderful hotel. The room was well appointed and spacious for a city location. Slept like a log. The staff is attentive, helpful, and very friendly. They must be very happy to work at this hotel. It’s easy to be happy at the roof top pool and restaurant. Walking distance to just about everything. Two thumbs up.",5,2023,10,10
61,A PERFECT Hotel Stay! ,"This is one of the best hotel stays we have ever had! The location was perfect, the room was beautiful, the service was excellent, and the views from the room were immaculate! There were so many amnesties included in this hotel. The bed was incredibly comfortable. We look forward to going back to Barcelona to stay at this incredible hotel again! ",5,2023,10,04
61,Lovely Hotel,"The hotel is conveniently located, hotel staff are extremely helpful and when asked recommend restaurants for us to dine in, also made the reservations on our behalf, the hotel is clean and comfortable, lovely rooftop terrace and bar overlooking the Barcelona Cathedral, I would recommend the H10 Madison.",4,2023,10,02
61,Best hotel ever!,"What a special experience we had staying at this lovely hotel! Perfectly positioned near the Playa de Catalunya and the bus tours and some of the nicest restaurants in Barcelona. The staff are so friendly and helpful and nothing is too much for them, great range for breakfast and very clean rooms. The rooftop terrace is just so special for relaxing day or night. Just can't recommend this hotel enough!",5,2023,09,28
61,Clean and convenient location,"After traveling with a bus tour in Portugal for 11 days and the “4 Star” hotels were subpar, we were weary and hoping for a hotel stay of 4 more days to be equipped with AC that worked, a space to open my suitcase, plumbing that didn’t leave us standing in shower water, and an outlet by the bed to plug in my CPAP. 
Thank goodness we walked into a gem that was also rated “4 star”!
The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. They made dinner reservations for us, called cabs, gave recommendations for sites and restaurants and had the Cava and cold water in the lobby ready and waiting throughout our stay! 
The room was clean and always refreshed with clean towels and toiletries. 
Breakfast was included in our plan and it was delicious! Order off the menu was included with the breakfast buffet. 
The lobby is like an art museum and the roof top bar was a great place to hang out after a day of sightseeing or after dinner. The view was pretty good as well. 
I would highly recommend! 
The only downside was the pool which had limited seating and could have used a little maintenance.",5,2023,09,27
61,Could not be better,"Very very super. Friendly staff, great breakfast. Rooms are giant by European standard. Clean, huge comfy bed. One of my best hotel experiences from anywhere. Great location. 15 minutes to the Gaudi, on doorstep of great shopping and eating.  ",5,2023,09,27
61,Great location in Barcelona.,This hotel is near the Barrio Gothic.  It is on a side street that is near the large plaza of the Church.  There are many restaurants and shopping nearby.  The reception staff was so helpful with making dinner reservations and assisting with our itinerary.  The room was comfortable and had everything we needed of good quality.  It is a **** hotel.,5,2023,09,24
61,A perfect stay!,"Absolutely amazing stay! From start to finish, the team were attentive, genuinely nothing was ever too much trouble. The rooms were perfect, and kept immaculately clean. We were amazed at how well the doors onto the balcony kept the noise from the road out! The breakfast was perfect each morning, there was so much choice - and all of it delicious. The rooftop bar was just the icing on the cake, it was beautiful up there, and they served really great cocktails. All in all, the hotel made our stay in Barcelona perfect, and I’d truly recommend to hotel to anyone - in fact I’m envious of future visitors - enjoy your time there!",5,2023,09,22
61,Good centrally located hotel,"Following positive reviews my daughter and I stayed for 3 nights on a city break with. British Airways. The hotel is centrally located to visit all the sights and numerous tapas bars nearby. Our room was on 4 th floor at the back and therefore very quiet, the bed and pillows were comfortable and the shower facilities were good. All staff were friendly and professional. Would definitely recommend this hotel",5,2023,09,22
61,Really nice hotel with great location.,"From start to finish, this place was great.  We stayed for 2 nights after a cruise.  It's perfectly located, just down the street from the Barcelona Cathedral.  La Rambla is about a 10 minute walk.  The Sagrada is less than 1.5 miles.  We dropped off our luggage around 9:00 and they e-mailed me when the room was ready (around noon).  They cheerfully printed my flight boarding passes. There's a rooftop bar with tapas - both excellent.  The rooftop view is spectacular and wait staff friendly.  Food and drink prices are reasonable.  The King room was spacious, air conditioned and comfortable.  Huge double shower.  I forgot to put the ""tidy up"" sign out when we left for the day.  When I got back mid-afternoon I asked for a clean-up.  Someone arrived within 5 minutes.  Every staff person I talked to spoke English.  Did not use the pool but water felt comfortable. Well worth the money.  I hope to stay there again!",5,2023,09,18
61,Stunning City Break in Barcelona.,H10 Madison is superb on every level. It is ideally located to explore Barcelona. The staff are exceptional from Reception to both dinning locations. The rooftop terrace offers fantastic views over Barcelona and the plunge pool was very welcome on the warm September evenings. We are already planning to return next year. Thank you for a wonderful City Break.,5,2023,09,14
61,First time family trip,"Best  hotel in old town. Great service, bar and restaurant on 8th floor with a view. Staff was excellent. Very clean. Best part is everything is walking distance. You can enjoy the vibe of Barcelona, something is happening near the cathedral plaza. We enjoyed nearby Local shops, restaurants as well as gothic old town tour.",5,2023,09,13
61,Perfect!!,"Perfect location, well appointed clean rooms, staff is very attentive and better than 5star hotels.Mr Kahlid was exceptional at the lobby.Roof top pool and sitting area was awesome.
They serve water, sparkling wine the whole day in the lobby. It was a nice touch. There are some very good restaurants nearby",5,2023,09,12
61,Best location pool with a view,We loved this hotel right at Old Town. The rooftop pool has a beautiful view with a great restaurant & bar. So perfect to relax.The hotel is very modern and clean . Loved the friendly helpful staff and they put Cava & drinks in lobby to welcome guests.,5,2023,09,04
61,Amazing location and great staff,"From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with a cava and friendly staff.  Our flight got there early, so they checked our bags, offered us a complimentary and the kids some snacks and gave us a map and suggestions to pass the time.

The pool is small and the rooms are small, but it is located minutes from all the main attractions, in a safe and entertainment busy area.  Great location, amazing restaurant suggestions, trust them!

Only downfall, only one elevator was working and there was a bit of wait with luggage and 6 flights of stairs to the pool and patio.

But it gave us a reason to exercise lol",4,2023,09,03
61,Amazing break,"Absolutely loved this hotel, the rooftop pool and bar really are what makes it. Staff lovely and friendly. Room was a good size. Great area. We slept well until the last night when the room above made noise all during the night, sounded like something heavy falling on the floor every couple of hours. Got woken up a few times by that and drunk people, not ideal when you need to be up at 7am for a flight. We didn’t get a welcome drink on arrival which was a bit disappointing but won’t knock a star off for that 🤍 had a great holiday, was our 5th time to BCN but first time at this hotel and would definitely come back",5,2023,09,03
61,A Gem of a hotel...,"This hotel was a real gem! Right in the heart of the old city, a block from the Barcelona cathedral, and walking distance to an incredible variety of activities. The staff are friendly, efficient, and accommodating. The rooms are very comfortable, and shockingly quiet, given the noise level from the busy city streets below. 

My only critique is that they have only two tiny elevators, barely large enough to accommodate four or five people snuggly. One of these elevators was out of service for the duration of our four day stay which was a minor inconvenience at times… 

This is a fabulous hotel, and I would gladly go back there tomorrow.",5,2023,09,02
61,Fantastic Stay!,"I had a fantastic stay at this hotel. The hotel was centrally located and walking distance from many wonderful shops, bars, restaurants, and sights. The staff was extremely well-mannered and professional. They spoke English perfectly and were able to provide me with many excellent recommendations. They treated me extremely well. I highly recommend adding the breakfast option to your stay - the food is delicious and the value was outstanding. In addition, one of the best parts of my stay was the rooftop bar. The pool was a wonderful feature with unbelievable views of the city. The drinks and food were outstanding quality and reasonably priced. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel for your trip to Barcelona. ",5,2023,08,31
61,Highly recommend this hotel,The hotel was wonderful from arrival to checkout. The staff are friendly and helpful.  The breakfast was excellent. The room was large and quiet with everything we needed. The only slight negative from our stay was one of the lifts was out of order. We would definitely stay here again if we are in Barcelona.,5,2023,08,30
61,Stunning Barcelona city break,"We stayed here for two nights before meeting up with the family in North Catalonia. Fantastic hotel, our room was spacious and we loved the balconies, it’s perfectly situated on the edge of the gothic quarter with boutiques and tapas restaurants just feet away, 10 mins walk from Place de Catalunya where you can find all the bus tours and buses to the airport. 

The breakfast was delicious with so much choice, the roof top bar served excellent food and delicious cocktails - and the staff were absolutely lovely. We had a wonderful stay and would definitely seek out an H10 in future!!",5,2023,08,29
61,Excellent location,"Definitely a 5 for location , central enough to walk to almost all the major attractions.
Our room was quiet , great air conditioning and enough space to get the suitcase open . Breakfast is certainly pricey but it has everything you need to get you through the day . 
The only negative is the attitude of some of the staff . Most on reception are great , except for one guy in particular in the afternoon/ evening. It’s not great to see him continually lounging back on his chair playing on his phone . It was the same at the pool bar . A couple of staff have some real attitude problems . Disappointing and needs sorting by the management.",4,2023,08,27
61,Hidden Gem!,Hotel is in great location and has a rooftop pool!  You can order drinks and snacks poolside too and view from rooftop is amazing.  We all enjoyed unwinding at the pool each night.  Front desk was extremely helpful.  Very nice hotel- would gladly return.,5,2023,08,27
61,Great hotel,"We stayed at H10 Madison for 3 nights prior to a 9 night med cruise We just loved everything about this hotel The location was perfect, easy walk to La Rambla and the beach .  our favorite was the rooftop bar and pool The views are magnificent, we stopped there every night to relax after a long hot day.  The rooms are spotless, air conditioner worked great, the front desk was very helpful, calling taxis, giving directions Will definitely stay here again",5,2023,08,22
61,Amazing Hotel!,"If you're looking for luxury and a convenient location for the Old Town look no further. We stayed at H10 Madison for our 10 year anniversary, a City break without the kids and it was bliss! The roof terrace is an Oasis of calm amidst the busy City and the view of the Cathedral is breath taking! I'd defiantly recommend this Hotel to anyone, I can't imagine finding a better Hotel in Barcelona! Water is supplied in your room daily, complimentary Cava is available in reception (and with Breakfast!) and the staff cannot do enough to help you. Just great!",5,2023,08,22
61,Superb Barcelona experience,"From check in to check out the staff and facilities were 100% perfect. I left my CPAP machine in the room on departure, and called the front desk from the cab, and they made arrangements for it to be shipped to our home in Florida. A-1 service throughout!
Convenient location in the ""old city"", but top-notch accommodations.",5,2023,08,19
61,Fantastic Stay,"A fantastic experience! Do not hesitate staying at this hotel! The staff is amazing. We felt pampered the entire week. Location is perfect in the charming Gothic Quarter. Centrally located:  beach (25 minute walk) the market, Las ramblas all minutes away! 
 We also spent time in El Born (Picasso Museum area). Tons of great restaurants (cal Pep a must) and cocktail bars. Hotel is just beautiful in every aspect. Traveled with my two daughters. King sized bed and full bed with balcony. Coffee machine and water each day. Housekeeping did a fantastic job with turn down service complete with chocolate. Fresh towels each day and Rituals bath products ( shampoo, conditioner, body wash and lotion). The breakfast was superb. Everything you could hope for! You also have the option to order from the menu in addition to enjoying all that is offered. The staff was incredible.  The rooftop was very special. Plunge pool and plush lounges were a welcome sight after a day of touring (open until 10 pm).Poolside snacks and drinks available until midnight. Fantastic view of the cathedral and Sagrada Familia. Cava, lemonade and water was always available in the lobby. No detail left unturned. A wonderful staff and a wonderful.place to call home during a Barcelona holiday.",5,2023,08,08
61,Fantastic stay,"We stayed here for 2 nights last week and the hotel was so lovely! The lobby area smelt amazing and the staff were all super friendly and helpful, especially Manuel ( he was excellent and nothing was too much trouble). Check in was easy, we were early so they stored our bags for us and took them up to our room once it was ready. Room was lovely and clean, plenty of space and great view looking out over the front of the hotel. Rooftop pool and restaurant was great, we ate there once and the food was nice. Really lovely views over the cathedral, nice chilled vibe. Location was fantastic, central to all places and we could walk pretty much anywhere. Would highly recommend and definitely stay here again. Such a great trip!",5,2023,08,08
61,Great place to stay,"I think it's one of the most stylish 4 star hotels I've ever been to.

The staff was very very friendly, The room was quite small but very well organized with all the modern equipment hidden behind fashion.

I hope next time in Barcelona I will be there too.",5,2023,08,07
61,Anniversary trip ,"Absolutely loved this hotel the staff could not be more helpful. Great location in the gothic quarter, it was perfect and We most definitely will be back. Roof top bar was great and views from it were lovely ",5,2023,08,03
61,Thanks for a great stay!,"Outstanding hotel. Beautiful building, centrally located in the City. Room was quiet and comfortable with a large and well laid out bathroom area, easily large enough for the three of us. Staff was exceptional, from the front desk to those working in the dining areas. Rooftop lounge is quiet and relaxing, and the breakfast that was included with our stay was excellent. Would be happy to return. ",5,2023,07,25
61,Cool hotel,"An overall cool hotel in a good location 
Good solid breakfast buffet with very friendly service and staff.
The room was nice. We had an aircon issue and staff attempted to fix it and offered an upgrade but to be frank this should have been double checked before arriving!
Overall it was good and the restaurant and pool is a welcome bonus to sit outside in the afternoon and evening!",4,2023,07,25
61,BAD!  Our personal belongings were taken from room.,"Bad experience!  We had a problem with the air conditioning blowing barely cool, not cold air for the first couple days.  That made it hard to sleep since it was too warm and never got colder than 25 degrees Celsius in the room.  That’s with the A/C on max cold and fan on high.  It took 2 days and multiple attempts from the maintenance staff to get the air to blow colder.
The BIG problem was some of our belongings were taken from our hotel room while we were out.  One of my wife's outfits was gone when we returned to the room.  We immediately let the front desk know.  Unfortunately, no one was able to locate our belongings and they’re gone for good.  Since there aren’t cameras in the room, the hotel wasn’t able to see what happened.  A few different maintenance and housekeeping employees were in the room that day while we were gone.  Who know what may have been going on and exactly when our belongings were taken?  We were very disappointed and almost checked out and left that same day.  We have never had items taken or missing from any hotel or travel.  We were offered free breakfast but rarely eat breakfast and had plans already scheduled for the mornings.  We only used the free breakfast one time.  That does NOT at all make up from items taken from our room.  Other than that, nothing was done and it was more of an ""oh well, nothing we can do.  you're out of of luck"".  We asked for additional compensation for the missing items but were not given any.   What a terrible way to handle theft of our personal property.  I have no trust in H10 Madison and will never stay there again.  We do not recommend this hotel due to our belongings being taken and how it was handled.  This put a dark cloud on our stay in Barcelona and gave us a negative, unsafe feeling the rest of the time we stayed at H10 Madison.  We stressed about what might go missing each time we left the room.  A very bad experience and we are extremely disappointed.  We still can not believe someone took our personal belongings from our room.  Just a very, very bad situation with a terrible outcome.",1,2023,07,23
61,Good location and a roof top pool!,"We were greeted warmly upon check in and offered complimentary Cava sparkling wine after traveling from Madrid. Our room was spacious and the rain shower was nice. The hotel is in a good location, we walked everywhere, mostly. You will need taxis to get to some of the major tourist attractions for sure such as Sagrada Familia church and more. Breakfast was good I just wish the servers were a bit more friendly. They need to smile more. The best part of this hotel is the rooftop pool! The view from up there was pretty nice. You can see the water and the cruise ships too. You can walk to the water from this hotel in about 20 minutes.",4,2023,07,22
61,Top Notch Everything!,"My husband and I recently stayed at H10 Madison after researching hotels that offered a more boutique experience. We loved our stay here. The highlights were as follows: a warm welcome from the front desk (Manuel) who promptly stored our bags and notified us via text when our room was ready (it was ready early), our lovely room with a view of the Cathedral de Barcelona, an amazing housekeeper who worked so hard on our room and the floor during our stay, a kind bar/pool staff who were always busy and went above and beyond to be sure everyone on the rooftop were taken care of (one day I got overheated and without prompting--the waiter brought over small towel with ice in it and told me to put in on the back of my neck and checked on me twice to be sure I was okay). I could do on and on about the staff and the condition of the hotel. My husband and I agreed that if we are fortunate enough to return to Barcelona that we will ONLY stay here. ",5,2023,07,20
61,Lovely time in Spain,"We stayed at the H10 Madison for a few days after our cruise. Very well situated, clean, modern and beautiful roof top pool which we thoroughly enjoyed. The staff were super accommodating & helpful whenever we had requests or questions. Definitely would stay here again. ",5,2023,07,18
61,Luxury on a budget,"From walking into the hotel and being greeted with sparkling wine, to the beautifully clean and spacious room, the complimentary champagne and chocolate covered strawberries to celebrate our honeymoon, getting to enjoy the picturesque rooftop terrace for the afternoon or evening and it’s spectacular views, receiving remarkable service from each employee - H10 Madison was incredible. ",5,2023,07,18
61,Great place to stay while in Barcelona,"We visited Barcelona in May and reserved a deluxe room at the H10 Madison based on the very good reviews.  These reviews are well deserved.  Informative and friendly staff, great location and the room was great: spacious, clean with a comfortable bed and pillows.  ",5,2023,07,16
61,Excellent location ,"Loved the location, loved the free champagne for breakfast & in the foyer, loved the breakfast. Loved the roof top bar & the pool. Hated how small our room was & hated how expensive the roof top bar was. ",4,2023,07,14
61,Good location and very comfortable rooms with excellent breakfast.,"Check in very easy vouchers for welcome drinks to their rooftop bar. Hotel is centrally located but the railway station is a taxi ride. Room was excellent with a very large well stocked bathroom. His and Hers wash hand basins and also His and Hers showers. The breakfast is excellent although limited vegan choices. As well as the buffet there is  a menu from which you chose the main breakfast items egs, omelettes etc which are freshly prepared. My only criticism was the coffee which I found undrinkable. On the first day I had my first and only breakfast coffee and it was just awful. The other two hotels I used in Spain, in Madrid and Granada used coffee machines which offered a range of excellent tasting coffees. However that apart this is an excellent hotel very friendly, efficient breakfast staff and the breakfast is excellent and I would have no hesitation returning.   ",5,2023,07,11
61,Fantastic hotel centrally located,"My wife and I visited the Madison at the end of June 23 staying in a Junior Suite. We had a great time and would definitely recommend this hotel. 
Location  - a stone's throw from the cathedral (NB not Sagrada Familia) and around a five minute walk from Las Ramblas and the stop for the Aerobus to El Prat. There are plenty of restaurants and bars nearby, including a lovely little place on the cathedral square called Cafe D'En Victor. 
Room - The room (4th Floor) was very well presented with excellent air con, a very comfortable bed and a massive double walk in shower. For what we paid we considered it great value. 
Food - The breakfast was superb with a very wide range of things to choose from the buffet plus hot items (eggs, omelettes) cooked to order from the menu. We've stayed in higher starred hotels and not been as impressed!
Service - Again, very good with really helpful reception staff (who kindly gave us access to our room much earlier than expected). The staff at breakfast were friendly and efficient as were those at the roof top bar. The latter is a really pleasant place to enjoy an evening drink with views across the city that take in Sagrada Familia, the cathedral and other interesting buildings taward the port area. 
The one small quibble was the lack of sun beds around the small (and it is small) splash pool. While there isn't that much space they could easily fit in a few more and, perhaps, move them out of the way once evening comes. On a related note, it's also really annoying - not the fault of the hotel - when guests  ""reserve"" sun beds and disappear.  
All-in-all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will return on our next trip to Barcelona. ",5,2023,07,07
61,Lovely hotel,"This was a lovely hotel. Room was nicely furnished with plenty of hanging space and drawers. Added bonus was a coffee machine , free water every day in mini bar and ceiling fan.

Room was spotless although my wife preferred a tub.,5,2023,06,05
61,Nice place to stay,The service at the hotel was excellent and helpful with suggestions of things to do. The pool was nice but small. The restaurant menus should add more more Spanish menus items. The rooms are very nice and showers large. Housekeeper did wonderful job cleaning. Unfortunately due to a large construction project on the Main Street in front of the hotel there was a lot of really loud noise. ,4,2023,06,03
61,Great Location in Heart of Barcelona,"This hotel is right in the center of Barcelona--a great location walking distance to many tourist areas, shops, and restaurants.  It was one of our favorite hotels during our three weeks traveling in Spain.  The rooms were very nice, clean and quiet.  Our room had a small balcony with a view of the quaint side street and the cathedral in the background.  The staff was exceptional!  We were Club H10 members (free) and received free drink upon arrival and a free drink coupon for one day during our visit.  The rooftop bar was our favorite, and we had drinks there each night.  The only critique is we felt the breakfast was overpriced and opted to get a coffee and croissant sandwich at one of the many coffee shops near the hotel.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2023,06,02

61,Room with a view is false advertising,"Love the rooftop. It’s very mellow with only a few people. I had a drink there solo 2 nights before dinner and enjoyed the view and ambiance. 

I got the cathedral view room and it’s false advertising. I could see a sliver of the cathedral through one of the tiny windows if I sat on a specific spot on the bed. Even then the curtains wouldn’t stay open so I had to push the floor lamp against them.",4,2023,05,29
61,"Very nice hotel, great views from sun roof, and extremely helpful front desk",Very nice hotel centrally located.  Sun Roof has a great view.  We really appreciated how helpful and on top of things the front desk people were.  (I should have gotten their names so I could mention them).,5,2023,05,29

The hotel offered great amenities and room were stellar.  Front desk staff were very helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. Restaurant staff were pleasant and friendly and all worked well together. We have another trip planned in 2024 and will definitely re-book here. There are other H10 hotels in Barcelona but I highly recommend th Madison.

The hotel location is particularly good (we walked almost everywhere), our room was quite lovely and well designed, it was quiet (we faced the inner courtyard), the rooftop bar/pool has excellent food and drinks and a spectacular view, and the downstairs restaurant is excellent (and worth the price of breakfast if you are hungry).   Special mention to the front desk - incredibly helpful, solicitous, full of excellent advice on places to go, restaurants and the like.  Booked tickets for various venues and made dinner reservations for us.  Rodolphe the front desk manager was exceptional.   ",5,2023,05,29

61,A Hidden Gem,"Just about a US city block away for the Barcelona Cathedral, the H-10 Madison is an outstanding hotel with a friendly and professional staff.  Our room was lovely, with complimentary bottled water, robes and slippers. I wished that I could re-install their bathroom at my home; spacious shower. Loved the eco conscious toilet and shower features. The breakfast is not only a buffet but there are also made to order items.  You can eat as healthy (or not) as you wish, from daily fresh homemade yogurt to rich pastries. If you don't want the hustle and traffic of a center-of-downtown hotel, this is the place to be. Still lots of restaurants, small shop shopping and historical finds. AND there is wonderful rooftop dinning with a spectacular view. If the H-10 Madison and this staff were in the US, I'd do a staycation quarterly.",5,2023,05,22
61,Our chosen hotel,"Great flight to Barcelona, car transfer to hotel
A great welcome by Randolph, then our treat started. It was a great room with a good view.
I am not going to mention their names because they were all fantastic and looked after us so well.
The breakfast was fabulous, and the waiting staff were great.the top floor terrace bar had  great food. No creamer. Fantastic staff.
Reception went above and beyond for us. Thank you all for making our holiday enjoyable.

It included mini sandwiches, a cheese and a deli board, mini fruit çups and slices, mini danishes as well as the usual expected items. I would highly recommend considering this hotel if you're staying in Barcelona. ",5,2023,05,20

61,H10 Madison: Barcelona ,"This is a very nice hotel located in a wonderful area of the Gothic quarter in Barcelona. I found the staff to be very helpful, warm, and friendly. They helped me to arrange some outings that I wanted to take, but couldn’t do online. The rooms were nice and clean. The food in the restaurant was very tasty. I would definitely stay here again next time I’m in Barcelona.",5,2023,05,18

61,Best hotel ever!,"Perfect place to stay!  The H10 Madison location is fantastic for walking everywhere in the Gothic quarter and even to Barceloneta beach.  Staff was super helpful and friendly, our room was quiet, and breakfasts were great too.  What was most special is the rooftop terrace with amazing views of the Barcelona Cathedral on one end, and the Sagrada Familia on the other end.  Wonderful tapas and drinks and a great place to relax after being out and about the city. ",5,2023,05,17
61,Great hotel in an awesome location! ,"We had a great stay at the H10 Madison. The location was perfect for walking to so many areas. The room was comfortable, quiet and clean.

Only issue was construction happening on the main road, but that isn't in hotel's control",5,2023,05,16
61,Great stay,We enjoyed this hotel.  The staff was friendly and the front desk spoke in English and provided valuable assistance.  Nice rooftop area.  Our room was very clean and excellent.   The hotel is in an ideal location both for the Gothic center city and El Born.  We enjoyed both!  Do not miss El Born!,5,2023,05,16
61,"Perfect Location, Perfect View","Beautiful hotel with stylish amenities. Staff very attentive to your needs. Rooms were clean, modern and comfortable. The bed was a little too stiff for me and like most newer hotels, it’s difficult getting use to having to access power in your room having to insert the keycard all the time. You can’t charge your phones Kir other electronics if the power is out. To turn on lights you have to insert your card and that wakes up your partner, say if you wanted to go to the restroom at night.  Other than that, which I understand is to help conserve energy, the room and hotel is beautiful. The roof top bar is splendid and quaint, Would definitely stay again",4,2023,05,14
61,Amazing Hotel,"We arrived on Thursday for three nights. We checked in at 2pm and were told room was ready on the fifth floor room (503)We were offered a welcome drink on arrival & because I had joined the H10 club, we were given a voucher for a complementary cocktail for the poolside bar on the 8th floor.
The room was a quiet one with twin bedded rooms. It smelt lovely when we entered off a lemon scent . The bathroom was art deco design and we had a side view. Room came with two bottles of complimentary water each day plus a coffee machine.
The first afternoon as we were tired  from travelling we sat around the plunge heated pool on the 8th floor. We enjoyed the free gin cocktail and paid for some more drinks together with pizza and chips. The pool bar staff were very attentive . There was a box of clean towels and there were about 9 sun beds. The roof top overlooked the old cathedral and had great views.
The next morning we went down for breakfast which was in a beautiful room next to reception. We were greeted by Manuel again from the pool bar staff team. We were offered orange juice with some pink bubbles and cava. Nice touch for a luxurious breakfast. Each table were given a basket of bread and croissants. You could order scrambled eggs, poached eggs and extras such as mushrooms and tomato. There was also a buffet laid out with cheese, breakfast quiche, hams and pate together with fruit, fruit juices, breads, cereals and amazing cakes and donuts. It’s one of the nicest breakfasts I’ve had in ages. There was even different squeezed juices labelled in mini bottles. 
The hotel is well located and near the Rambles and we visited the Musica hall which was very ornate. The reception staff are so lovely and lent us an umbrella one night as it was rainy. Nothing was too much trouble for them.
One of the nicest attributes of the hotel is the way the staff gel together and it’s a lovely team of people that is very well run. Would definitely return.",5,2023,05,14
61,New Yorkers and friends visit Barcelona,Loved the welcome Cava!  Room was clean.  Hotel was quiet.  Loved the rooftop bar/pool.  Also was a great location.

61,Wonderful Staff and Service,"We had a wonderful stay at H10 Madison. We stayed in a Junior suite, and the room was very spacious, with a couch, bench for seating, double shower head, and plenty of room for storage. The breakfast was well done, with a continental selection and also the ability to order eggs and sweets from the menu. We loved the rooftop bar as well, it has gorgeous views of the cathedral. 

But, most of all, the hotel staff set this hotel apart from all others! The staff was pleasant, very friendly, and always eager to help. Sara and Manuel gave great restaurant recommendations around the city and were always very happy to help!",5,2023,05,13

From the welcome glass of cava or sparking water, to the small details like amenity kit in the bathroom, lovely espresso machine complete with tiny biscuits for each cup, modern decor, comfortable beds, complimentary bottled water, welcome pastries in the room, and, let me not forget the rooftop restaurant! This is not your average ""hotel restaurant."" We ate dinner our last evening there and had amazing tapas, amazing service, and fabulous drinks. All while on a rooftop overlooking the Gothic Cathedral and the rooftops of the Barri Gothic. The neighborhood is perfect for exploring most of Barcelona on foot, and the staff is friendly and helpful. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel, and would definitely stay here again if ever in Barcelona. ",5,2023,05,12
61,"Perfect location, great service. ","We loved staying at H10 Madison.

61,Great hotel in a great location,"Great hotel in a fantastic location, the h10madison really contributed to our enjoyment of Barcelona. Situated in the Gothic Quarter it is within walking distance of the Picasso museum, Sagrada Família, the marina/beach and all of the other tourist destinations, yet it was also super-quiet at night. The staff were excellent and really helpful. We had most dealings with Sara in reception and Oriol at breakfast -  both were faultless and the staff in the rooftop tapas bar were similarly friendly and helpful. The room was really clean, quiet and a perfect temperature with a really comfortable, large bed. If we were ever to return we would stay here again without hesitation! ",5,2023,05,10
61,Great hotel in Barcelona's gothic quarter,"This has to be one of the best hotels I have stayed in. It is steps away from the Cathedral in the heart of the gothic quarter, near restaurants and bars.

61,FADOUA IS ONE OF THE MAIN REASON TO STAY AT THIS HOTEL: SHE IS AN ASSET.,"We stayed for a week and I must say that the highlight was the service provided by Fadoua: a wonderful, helpful and friendly lady who cleaned our room to perfection everyday.  I must mention Sara, Albert and the delightful Manuel in reception.  Thank you for connecting the cable to the TV.  The staff is what makes this hotel a perfect one.  It is central and the rooms are very quiet.  Some things need improving: a kettle in the room instead of that noisy useless coffee machine and get rid of the hinges on the headboard.  I kept hitting my head with them.  Leave the fridge empty for people to put their milk, etc., and finally, there is no railing to dry the wet towels.  In any case, we shall go back next year.",5,2023,05,07
61,AMAZING- we will be back,We had the best stay here. Everyone was so so nice. Everything was extremely clean. The shampoo and conditioner everything was amazing. We had a little balcony with  the most perfect view. We would def come back here. Obsessed. Perfect location. ,5,2023,05,06

The reception staff, Jemm, was so friendly and accommodating, We arrived at 10 am after 40 hours of travel and we were greeted with “your room is ready”. I know that this is not the norm but was so appreciated. She gave us so many tips, maps on where to go etc. the housekeeping  staff are exceptional, their discreet way to service your room is seemless. The upstairs bar/restaurant was sublime. The team are so friendly and professional. I would stay here again without a doubt. Thank you so much H10 Madison ",5,2023,05,05

61,Beautiful Hotel with Highest Quality Service,"H10 Madison in the heart of Gothic Quarter is absolutely one of the most beautiful boutique hotels and was the highlight of my trip to Barcelona in early March.

Upon arrival, we were greeted by a very welcoming front staff that was courteous, friendly, patient and all too willing to accommodate. They provided complimentary upgrade of the room to a view of Cathedral of Barcelona which was breathtakingly beautiful, quaint, well-appointed.

The bathroom, cleanliness of the room, well-designed space, and modern yet simple elegance were spectacular features of the hotel.

At the top is a bar, terrace and small pool with the most breathtaking view of central Barcelona. 

The complimentary breakfast with hot customizable dishes was divine in addition to the most amazing staff! Smiling, courteous, good-humored, and epitome/highest standard of hospitality I've experienced.

Rooms were reasonable rate - with included breakfast. Only downside was the elevator was not functional for 1-2 days of the stay. However, did not regret the extra exercise :)",5,2023,04,29
61,No complains!!,"Stayed here for 4D/3N.Location was great.lots of tourist spots nearby.convenience stores,coin-laundy,the beach,shopping,etc. all within a 10-20 mins walk away
the staff were great,especially the breakfast crew! breakfast was amazing and so was the coffee! great value-for-money!",5,2023,04,27
61,Great location in Barcelona!,"This is the second time we have stayed at the H10 Madison. Great location, not far from the Catherdral and La Rambles, nice and clean rooms, and great customer service. We were on a cruise this trip and half our group stayed at the hotel.",5,2023,04,23

book here . We going to be back",5,2023,04,22
61,Fantastic hotel with amazing service.,"We just spent four nights here and the experience was fantastic. The location was perfect for us and the rooms were very comfortable with a mini bar, expresso machine and a great shower. 

That said, the real differentiator was service. Our rooms weren’t ready but they stored them, emailed us when they were ready AND had our bags in our room when we came back. 

Mornings got off to a great start with their breakfast. It was fantastic with both a buffet and made to order options. The crew opening at 7:00 were amazing and friendly and really set a great tone for the day. We will stay here again for sure.",5,2023,04,22
61,Superb hotel and staff.,"From enabling an early check in to the final goodbye the staff were superb. Special mention of Oriol at breakfast for making our stay relaxing armed with all the information on choices. Room excellent, location excellent. Great splash pool on the roof top supplemented by a great bar.",5,2023,04,20
61,Exceeds expectations ,"I have just returned from a four night stay with my two boys. From the moment we arrived to when we left we were given the most wonderful service from every member of staff. The hotel is well located, styled beautifully and immaculately clean. The rituals products are very nice and I am glad the hotel is reducing plastic waste by using larger bottles. The roof terrace is lovely and the pool is kept warm. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel or return here again if I am in Barcelona.",5,2023,04,12
61,"Ambience, staff, amenities (for a four star hotel) are its winning attributes","So glad I booked this hotel for my Barcelona short stay.  The location is excellent - just next to Gothic Quarter; in fact, I walked from parc guell to Sagrada familia back to the hotel - so that’s how convenient the place is.  Yet the hotel is quiet, so you can be assured of a nice sleep.

I booked a junior suite, but it’s not really a “suite” per se, it’s more like a larger regular room.  I must say it’s strange to have the shower room equipped with two rain shower heads - I mean, even if the two people sleeping together are partners, it’s quite unlikely for them to shower simultaneously (the two shower heads are two feet away) right?  If they did, they would do it for intimacy and probably a super large shower head would suffice.  What I would have done at the design stage was to convert one of them to a side spray - now, that experience would be heavenly!  

In the room are all the necessary amenities for you - it’s cute that the toiletries are pre packed inside a takeaway toiletry bag!  Two bottles of water are provided daily.  There is also a coffee machine, but it serves only small amounts of drink per serving (I personally would have preferred a regular kettle).  There is an easy-to-use safe.  The bed is large and comfy, with lots of pillows (good!!).  Lightings are easy to control.

In fact, the entire hotel premises is very tastefully done.  Even the waiting areas downstairs are beautiful.  

Wi-Fi connection was very strong.

Breakfast was another thing to look forward to.  Cold spreads were buffet, and hot food could be ordered from a decent menu.  Food came well presented too.  Service staff were most friendly and helpful - well, everyone I met throughout my stay was so!

I didn’t go to the rooftop bar or pool so no comment there.

You won’t regret booking this hotel.  Hmm, perhaps a regular room will do, since a junior suite didn’t seem to offer much more.",5,2023,04,12
61,Great hotel in every way!,"This hotel is really top notch! First the LOCATION is perfect - can easily get almost anywhere with a walk which was great.  in the Gothic quarter stones distance from the cathedral.  Second, the SERVICE was unbelievable - for example, they surprised me with a bottle of champagne and cake for my birthday and i didnt even tell them it was my birthday also at breakfast they gave me a glass of cava, again total surprise.  Third, the ROOM was really nice and clean.  Very spacious.  Fourth, the ROOF DECK had incredible views and awesome comfy vibe for pre-dinner drinks.  Highly recommend this hotel!",5,2023,04,09

61,A great place to stay in Barcelona,"What a wonderful hotel in every way. The location makes it an easy walk to almost everything.  Combined with amazing staff, decor and lovely rooftop terrace all made it a great place to stay.  This is our 2nd stay and will be back again. Highly recommend. ",5,2023,04,06
61,Great stay!,"Great visit to Barcelona and a wonderful stay at this hotel. We had requested a quiet room and we’re given a junior suite on the 4th floor. Room was spacious and the extra bed for our child was big enough and comfortable. Mini bar well stocked. Plenty of natural light despite being at back of hotel and the blackout blinds worked! Bathroom was spacious with double monsoon shower and double basins. Staff on reception, the terrace and at breakfast couldn’t have been more helpful. They were particularly kind to my son helping him practice his Spanish every day!  We had some great restaurant recommendations too! Would definitely stay here again.",5,2023,04,03
61,GREAT HOTEL ALL-AROUND!,"We like the H10 Hotel group across the board; they provide great service, clean large rooms and a lovely bilingual staff (if need be).  The staff is professional and very warm, they gave us tips, TLC, an adapter for our American plugs, a bottle of champagne and a piece of cake simply for calling our room mistakenly about a taxi.  We were touched!  Muchisimas gracias a todos!",5,2023,03,31
61,Great hotel in the Gothic area.,Great location walking distance to all the attractions or subway stop to get there.  Staff was friendly  and the complimentary cocktail at the rooftop bar was a nice touch. Many restaurants to choose from just blocks away. We would definitely stay there again if we return to Barcelona. ,5,2023,03,30
61,Superb!,"The hotel is great, would highly recommend it. We arrived early and were greeted by very friendly staff and a gorgeous smell, I wanted to bottle it!
Our room wasn’t quite ready but we received a complimentary drink and they then emailed to confirm we could have our room. 
We had booked a classic double and it exceeded expectations. It was spacious and very well appointed. Very comfortable bed with quality linens, 2 balconies overlooking the front of the hotel and cathedral (room 211). Plenty of wardrobe space, large full length mirror, large free safe, coffee machine and fridge. The bathroom was lovely with a large shower, Rituals products and a professional hairdryer. 
As H10 members we got some free chocolates and a drink at the bar. The rooftop terrace is great, plenty of tables and chairs with views and a fab place for drinks. 
We ordered a burger here one night and it was very tasty. Otherwise didn’t sample the food as we were room only. 
The location is spot on. So central, we walked most places. It’s less than 5 mins walk to Plaça Catalunya so very convenient for the airport bus and any tours. El Born is just 5 mins away too for some lovely bars and restaurants which we much preferred to the more touristy areas. 
Would stay here again in a heartbeat so just book! Thank you for a wonderful 4 nights.",5,2023,03,29
61,Very comfortable stay in central Barcelona,"My Junior suite was very enjoyable except the no-view on the 4th floor. Stayed only 1 night but will surely come back if the price is right.

Otherwise, the room was big, modern, great bed, big tv, closet and mini-bar. The very best was the marble bathroom and the large shower. Rituals products are very good, I really enjoy them in H10 hotels.

Didn’t try the breakfast as it wasn’t included in my room price but enjoyed a free drink on the room top bar and terrace. Excellent service from the staff.

I would recommend this place to people who needs a comfy and luxury hotel stay in central Barcelona, near the Cathedral and Plaça Catalunya.",4,2023,03,28

61,Lovely stay,"Lovely hotel, great location. The staff were all genuinely nice people.

The rooftop bar and pool are a lovely place to chill out. ",5,2023,03,24
61,Our first visit to Barcelona  (Hopefully not the last!),"The hotel is superbly located in the Gothic Quarter. The staff greeted us warmly and offered us water/cava whilst booking us in. The whole process was quick and easy and the staff most helpful. The young man gave us maps and explained our location in relation to places of interest and marked places on the map for us to visit. Our room was clean and tidy and there was a tray with cava, cake and glasses beautifully arranged   waiting for us. (It was my birthday treat!)
The breakfasts were amazing with an excellent choice of buffet and/or cooked food and the staff were efficient, friendly and very helpful. Reception staff also booked trips for us. A great hotel overall and I can highly recommend it.",5,2023,03,24
61,Great Stay ,"The H10 Madison was fantastic.  The staff at the front desk were all friendly and welcoming, and went out of their way to get us information about any restaurants or sites we wanted to see.  Our room was lovely and bright, and spotlessly clean.  Beds were very comfortable.  It was nice to have doors that opened to let fresh air in at night.  The rooftop patio was a great place to go for a drink in the evening.  Location was convenient to everything.  I would stay here again. ",5,2023,03,21
61,Great location - fabulous staff,"The hotel is just steps from the Cathedral and the Palau de la Musica, and surrounded by restaurants within both the Gothic Quarter and El Borne. We walked pretty much everywhere, except to Park Guell which was quite far north. The rooms are well equipped and had windows that opened to an atrium for fresh air. Very nice place to stay for however long you are in Barcelona.",5,2023,03,17
61,"Amazing hotel, the best staff ","Stunning interior.  Very nice staff.  Breakfast and meals at the rooftop restaurant are delicious.  Each of the above details makes us come back for sure. We have been to many places, but this one just amazed us. The hotel deserves five stars.",5,2023,03,14

Although we are very critical people we cannot say anything wrong about this hotel.",5,2023,03,13
61,Fantastic Stay at the H10 Madison,Thoroughly recommend the hotel. Lovely clean spacious rooms and great facilities. Food at breakfast and the rooftop terrace was fantastic. However it was the staff that made it - from the super helpful receptionists to the great serving staff at breakfast and the attentive and wonderful serving staff (particularly Alberto) at the rooftop terrace. Can't wait to return.,5,2023,03,13

Every single staff member we encountered was exceptionally courteous, kind and helpful.  We chose to include the breakfast offered at the hotel.  The breakfast was marvelous and the staff in the breakfast room were so friendly and kind.  The hotel is also conveniently located to so many attractions within walking distance as well as easy access to taxis or metro.  Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel ",5,2023,02,27
61,Stylish hotel with great staff,"An elegant hotel, located in central Barcelona. The property has many comfortable rooms and a  rooftop Terrassa with pool and lovely views of the cathedral.
Smooth check-in assisted by Pedro, where we were quickly taken to our clean and spacious room on the 1st floor. At breakfast we were looked after by Cecilia, Aldric, Jennifer and Ravi and offered a full breakfast with many choices including made to order hot food such as omelette and pancakes.
Transportation to the hotel from the airport was easy on the Aerobus and just a five minute walk from Plaça de Catalunya.
Some midnight noise from nearby bar and restaurant customers, but I accept staff can't control events outside the building.",5,2023,02,25
61,Exceptional Stay,"We only stayed for two nights (should have been 3 due to fog cancelling two flights ) 

The hotel allowed us to check in on arrival 
The reception staff were very accommodating and helpful with our queries and we were offered drinks to refresh. 

Room was fabulous complete with gowns for the children and adults - lovely touch. 

Breakfast service was outstanding and the food was high quality. 

Roof top facility was brilliant, though bar not open in the evening we could still sit and enjoy the atmosphere.  We did have to vacate when the heaters were turned off though.  

Restaurant tapas was super and the cleanliness of the hotel could not be faulted! 

The night porters were just the best too. 

The staff working during my stay from 15-17 Feb were exceptional a real credit to the chain ! 

Highly recommend",5,2023,02,23
61,Great hotel and location,"Our first trip to Barcelona and the Hotel is wonderful.  Near the metro and the several Rick Steves walking tours.  The staff is exceptional including Pedro and Manuel at the desk and they helped arrange tickets at the last minute to Camp Nou for a Barca game.  We would recommend adding in the breakfast to the reservation as the food was delicious and the service excellent and helped to fuel us for the day.  The roof terrace was nice and if you want to swim the pool is heated.  All in all, a great place to stay for our week in Barcelona.  ",5,2023,02,22
61,Vacation ,"Great location and great service from the staff.
For a hotel of this standard there needs to be a fitness room which is the reason why its not getting full rating. Rooftop terasse are really great. Rooms are standard. ",4,2023,02,19
61,"Amazing hotel, fantastic staff","We had a really great stay here,from the friendly and professional check in with welcome drink to the service at breakfast and lunch, this hotel and especially the staff, truly amazing. Room was lovely,very well accommodated and comfortable. You must try and get to the roof terrace,that not only gives great views but is just a lovely location for lunch. Overall an amazing hotel with fantastic staff.",5,2023,02,18
61,Great hotel ,"Fantastic hotel, all aspects of our stay were brilliant. Family of four with two teens so we had two rooms - both comfortable & tastefully decorated. Amazing bathrooms with lovely toiletries. Our rooms overlooked an internal courtyard so really quiet, nice to be able to sleep with the balcony door ajar to get a breeze in. 
Breakfast was amazing! The quality and selection of food was great. 
Staff were all brilliant, throughout the hotel, so friendly and helpful. Our 15 year old is learning Spanish and the staff were all really kind and encouraging chatting with him.  
The location of the hotel is great, a lovely area, nice and central, with several metro stations/lines within an easy walk. And the rooftop bar/pool area is gorgeous too, plenty of sunshine and shade and stunning views.  Highly recommend. 

",5,2023,02,18
61,Wonderful stay!!,"Fabulous experience. Excellent staff and accommodations, cannot wait to return. My husband and I absolutely adored our room and everyone at H10. The location was perfect - many restaurants and bars close by. ",5,2023,02,11
61,Fab,"Stayed here for 3 nights and what a good choice it was.  Reception staff are lovely.  There’s a roof terrace bar with amazing views of the city.  Location is excellent…..we walked everywhere.

Breakfast is wonderful with plenty of choice and gluten free bread and croissants available.

Our room was nice - we had an interior one with a courtyard view.  Massive double shower with gorgeous Rituals toiletries and you can stream Netflix etc to the telly.

I’d never stayed in a H10 before but I definitely will again.  Join the H10 club for free drinks.

Ooh and I nearly forgot - free cava in reception and at breakfast happy days!!",5,2023,02,09
61,Great hotel,"Very nice hotel with great location, very near to sights and the Rambla. The staff was very friendly and helpful, so made you feel very welcome. The room was clean and comfortable - best hotel bed I have tried. Breakfast was delicious. Restaurant was fine for lunch too, but the menu not really suitable for proper dinner.",5,2023,02,09
61,Brilliant Staff and Brilliant Hotel,"Fantastic staff and very clean hotel.
It was our 25th anniversary and I contacted the hotel to arrange chocolates, wine and balloons for my partner, which they set up in the room upon arrival. We were both in for a surprise that the hotel upgraded our room free of chargeas well. Thank you Pedro and all of the wonderful staff that work there. Nothing was too much for them and they were all so friendly. So many choices for breakfast there will be something for everyone including Cava for breakfast and during the day which was very appreciated coming back to the hotel and having a glass or two sitting in the reception area relaxing. There is a roof top bar that has a small pool and the water temperature was  32 degrees even when it was cold which felt so warm. Our flight back to the UK was cancelled and the hotel had room and put us up for the extra night and again this was no problem (we will be claiming this cost back from BA)
To get to the hotel was so easy. If you are flying in to terminal 1 you take the aerobus, bus number A1 from outside the terminal and you get off at the last stop and there are only 4 stops including that one and the hotel is 5 minutes from there. A brilliant stay and we will definitely be booking this hotel next time we go to Barcelona. ",5,2023,02,08
61,"Great Location, Friendly Staff, Nice Rooms","Centrally located hotel near the Gothic Quarter. The rooms are nice and comfortable. We were placed in an accessible room (I think? Maybe?) so the bedroom area was about the same size as the bathroom. In other words, the bathroom was huge with a double shower and double sink and the bedroom was a bit on the tight side. The bed was comfortable. We did not have a view - the window opened to a shaft - which meant it was very quiet and dark, i.e. good for sleeping. I think that street facing rooms might be a bit noisy. We had an espresso machine and a mini-fridge that was stocked (they charge for the items in the minibar). The roof deck was large and the pool pretty big for a roof deck. Nice view around the city. The food was also good but you are better off going into the city since it was a little expensive for the area. They provided self-service cava and sparkling water in the lobby. The staff were super nice. The night-man was awesome. He knew us by the time we left and was always smiling and saying hi. We also stayed at the H10 Montcado and I liked this one a lot more. I would absolutely stay here again.    ",5,2023,01,31
61,"Great location, hotel without remarks","An amazing hotel of which we can’t find any real negative points. Located at the borders of the gothic quarter which gives you instant access to a beautiful area without much traffic, while still being easily accessible by vehicles from the other side.  Also only 200 meters walking from the urquinaona metro entrance which gives you easy access to all highlights (we can recommend the metro ticket for 24 or 48h if you come for a short visit, and if you come by plane, combine it with the areobus which gets you probably faster to the city center than any taxi….)  rooms are very clean and up to date with nice comfortable beds.  Breakfast is a nice buffet with included also some optional a-La-Carte choices.  For dinner I could recommend to find one of the many restaurants nearby, however you might require reservations upfront or it might be difficult to get something.  For those who are visiting in winter: still bring your pool outfit, despite being only 11 degrees, the outdoor pool at the roof was still 33 degrees hot and a welcoming refreshment.  The rooftop terrace closes around 5PM in the evening on colder days since it is located in the shade later on the afternoon so it might become a bit colder.",5,2023,01,31
61,"Lovely rooms, incredible service and extremely quiet!","We spent 4 nights at the location near the Cathedral and it was a great experience from start to finish. We had a beautiful room w/a view of the Cathedral. The staff in both the reception area and the restaurant were helpful and professional. We do not speak Catalan so english being spoken as well was very appreciated. A special mention about Glenn in reception. He helped make reservations (Catalan required) at one restaurant and always had a warm welcome when we passed by. Loved the Rituals products and more than anything else, the quiet at night in this vibrant city. The rooftop pool and bar were fantastic despite the low temps. We would stay there again and will recommend it to others!",5,2023,01,31
61,"Best, Best, Best","The best choice in our Barcelona trip!!! Everything was perfect when we live here, especially the service. We’d like to book this hotel again if we visit Barcelona another time. Thank all the staff here. THANKS!!!",5,2023,01,26
61,The perfect hotel for us,"Simply great hotel for the following reasons:
1. It is very clean and nature friendly
2. We have selected a big room which was comfortable and very quiet
3. Don't miss the breakfast ... it is amazing
4. Location is great - Within walking distance from most attractions
5. Above all - All staff members are so helpful, friendly and always smiling

We will come back!!",5,2023,01,25
61,"Heart of Barcelona. Location, location and beautiful hotel","Stayed for 4 nights. Centrally located in the gothic quarter (3 min walk to Barcelona cathedral). Short walks to all the top sites with the exception of Park Guell (57 min walk). Modern and neat room with nice bathroom. Added feature was able to connect phone to TV to stream what ever you want. We had a window view of the cathedral that never got boring, which is the same view when entering the hotel. Become a H10 member before booking. Get a free drink at the bar. Nice added touch was the courtesy bottled water, bathrobes and champagne in the foyer in the afternoons. Terrace has pool with more great views of cathedral (place to unwind after a day of exploring). Had breakfast on the last day, it was decent but preferred to eat out to take in all the offerings of Barcelona. All Staff were friendly and accommodating. Taxi rank just outside hotel too. ~40 Euro to airport. In short would definitely stay here again. Watch out for online deals too. ",5,2023,01,24
61,Cannot fault H10 Madison Barcelona in any way,"All staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough for us
Hotel is extremely clean,great choice at breakfast,excellent choice of drinks in both bars.Staff very helpful when booking attractions or taxis",5,2023,01,23
61,Revisit after 13 years !!!,"The location is excellent, we walked everywhere and felt safe.   January weather is so mild this year.
The gentleman that served breakfast made the best design on cappuccinos, he made us feel so welcome every morning. 
We will definitely stay here again.
",5,2023,01,22
61,Excellent property located in the city center,"My wife spent a few days in Barcelona before our Mediterranean cruise and stayed at this property at the recommendation from a friend.  We arrived early in the morning (9am) after an overnight transatlantic flight.  I knew that we were way early but the clerk said that she would get us into a room as soon as she had a clean one.  She said that we could go to the roof were the pool was located and relax there and she would come get us when we had a room.  the weather was wonderful so my wife and I relaxed pool-side in some very comfortable loungers and actually were able to nap for 2 hours before she brought us a room key and sent the bellman up with our luggage.

The room was very comfortable with a king size bed, small lounge chair and table with chair along with a large flatscreen TV.  It had a nice closet with a safe.  It also had a very modern bathroom with a large shower.  We were very happy with the room.  

The top floor as I mentioned had a small pool and loungers along with a bar with some food options.  We had a certificate for a free drink and enjoyed having a few glasses of wine taking in the view from the roof.

The staff was very service oriented and made great recommendations for restaurants.  The location was great in city-center and we were able to walk to dinner 3 nights from the property.  When we needed a taxi, the staff was able to take care of this for us.  

Overall, it was a great choice to stay here and really started our vacation in a great way.",5,2023,01,22
61,Beautiful. Amazing. Calm. Peaceful. ,Amazing beautiful hotel. Would stay here again. From complimentary champagne to great service it was worth the price. The pool was beautiful and is just like the picture shown by the hotel. There’s also a bar accompanying the pool which is great to relax. ,5,2023,01,22
61,Great base in the Gothic neighborhood with EXCELLENT rooftop views!,"I visited Barcelona with my sister for the first time in January 2023. This hotel was an option with Portugal Getaways. The location in the Gothic neighborhood was the perfect base for exploring. From the get-go the staff was so welcoming and friendly. The room was incredibly nice - beds were firm with a little cushion, pillows were plentiful, the shower was wonderful with plenty of hot water. We had robes and slippers, an operable window with shutters on the corner of the first floor. The rooftop restaurant, warm plunge pool was a real treat! Alberto was very sweet, helpful and had great recommendations.",5,2023,01,19
61,Wonderful Stay!,"We really didn’t know what to expect from this hotel, but wow, were we pleasantly surprised and impressed!!! First of all, the location is amazing - easy to get to anywhere you’d like to go! The staff were so nice, friendly and helpful (a special thank you to Alberto at the rooftop bar!). The room was clean, spacious and comfortable and also quiet. We definitely recommend staying here!",5,2023,01,19
61,One of my favorite hotels!,"Wouldn't stay anywhere else in Barcleona! Although part of a larger chain, this hotel feels like an independent small boutique hotel. Perfect location near Barcelona Cathedral and many other sites in and around the Gothic Quarter. Very comfortable room with lots of space, good AC, quiet, comfortable bed. My room looked into an interior ""courtyard"" which means there wasn't a view, but it did mean it was very quite and dark in room and I slept really well. Amazing roof top restaurant/bar and pool with spectacular views. Breakfast is the BEST I've had at any hotel - ate downstairs every morning and it was worth every penny! Perfect way to start the day. Delicious food, lots of options, and very friendly and helpful staff. Front desk staff also very nice and helpful and everyone speaks English very well. ",5,2023,01,15
61,Amazing hotel,"I really liked the hotel, the city center, 5-7 minutes by foot to all significant historical cities. Quick check-in, regardless of check-in on Saturday, checked in at 10:00 am. A nice breakfast, a varied selection, and even champagne who love in the morning. Perfect room, cool bathroom, beautiful cosmetics. The view from my room was on the wall (204), but it didn't bother me, I think if I had asked, I would have moved with a view of the street. In general, there was a feeling that it was 5 stars.",5,2023,01,15
61,40 years anniversary ,"Great experience for our 40years anniversary, the staff was really kind and supportive while not been too much at the same time. Breakfast was super nice, good quality and variety, the open pool also always nice to experience in winter season.",5,2023,01,14
61,"Great hotel, great location","I’m so glad we chose to stay at the h10 Madison when in Barcelona. The hotels location was fabulous, right in the heart of everything and only a short was to Las Ramblas. The roof top pool was a lovely place to relax after sight seeing and the roof top bar was lovely for a pre dinner drink. The rooms were nice and well equipped. Would defiantly stay here again.",5,2023,01,06
61,Perfect hotel in Gothic quarter,"Loved this boutique hotel we found fairly last minute!! We are a couple in our 40s during our first time in Spain. After a long flight delay we arrived in the evening and were greeted by reception staff who were extra friendly and very helpful. The rooms are beautiful with lovely bathrooms. Location is in the gothic quarter and was perfect to walk to hot spots while just enough away where it wasn’t too hectic. There’s a coffee place across the street, good Italian restaurant next door, and a market on the block (we bought water and some snacks). You can walk to the tour bus stops as well. I would not think twice about booking this hotel.",5,2023,01,03
61,Really good stay at a very nice hotel in the heart of Barcelona.,"H10 Madison is a really nice inviting hotel, in an old newly renovated charming building, with a great location in the the gothic area in Barcelona city center, but on a quiet side road, so no traffic noise. Plenty of opportunities for dining and shopping in the area, where we felt completely safe to go at all times.

Good-sized double room with french balcony, low-noise aircon and fridge with minibar. Espresso coffee, cookies and 2 bottles of mineral water every day, free of charge. Wi-fi worked fine for our needs.
Large, beautiful bathroom with french balcony, good bath-products, bathrobes and slippers. The room and bathroom was thoroughly cleaned every day
Very friendly and service minded staff. Great restaurant with delicious breakfast buffet including a la carte options. Roof terrace with pool and bar and fantastic views of the city.

The price for accommodation over New Year was, in comparison with our usual budget, a bit on the expensive side, but I guess that's to be expected when you want to stay centrally in a big city like Barcelona. On the other hand, most things are within walking distance so minimal costs for transport.
We can warmly recommend the H10 Madison hotel.",5,2023,01,02
61,Delayed 60th Birthday treat….,"My wife initially booked our 3 night stay for my 60th birthday in 2020 but unfortunately we were beaten by COVID…… we finally got to go in October 2022 and it was definitely  worth the wait.. The hotel and its staff were brilliant and the rooms were very nice. The  rooftop bar was brilliant in the evening and by day the views over Barcelona were spectacular. The rooftop also has a swimming pool and sun loungers which we enjoyed on our last sunny afternoon. Location wise the hotel is very good, next door to Barcelona cathedral and only a short walk to several bars and restaurants.",5,2022,12,28
61,Great stay in Barcelona!,"Amazing amazing stay at H10! The staff from the front desk, room serving staff, and the restaurant both for breakfast and the rooftop were all amazing.

Can’t wait to come back!",5,2022,12,15
61,Perfect quiet getaway near the center of BCN,"My wife and I wanted a hotel close to the center but in a quiet area. The Madison was perfect. It is tucked away in a quiet part of the Gotic but only a few steps away from Placa Catalunya. Nice shops and restaurants nearby. 
The room was comfortable and the staff great.
Don't forget the roof top terrace bar. Nice even when it is a bit wet.",5,2022,12,14

61,I'll be back!,"You'll find this hotel to be in a great location and walkable to most attractions, restaurants and shopping.  In addition, it was quiet.  The room and bathroom were lovely.  We stayed in a junior suite.  I liked the fact that the toilet had a door, there were two shower heads and a double sink. The mini bar and coffee bar were nicely stocked.  Our room was cleaned very quickly.  There was no iron but the housekeeping staff brought one up right away.  The staff at the front desk, servers in the dining room and housekeeping were all very attentive, accommodating and pleasant.  The breakfast was delicious.  It was the only meal I ate here so I can't comment on anything other than that, but it as very good with quick service.  The rooftop bar was a nice addition - great views and drinks with again - friendly staff. Overall this was a great place to stay and I would stay here again and recommend it to others!",5,2022,11,30
61,Super Hotel in a Super Location,"We stayed 4 nights in this hotel at the beginning of November. Our corner room was spacious and very quiet at night, with a comfortable king bed, modern bathroom and quiet a/c. Breakfast was included and available 0730-1100 hrs in a beautiful room with a wide selection of cold food served buffet style plus a good range of hot foods ordered off a menu. The multilingual breakfast and front desk staff were friendly and efficient. The hotel has a rooftop pool and restaurant/bar with wonderful views. The location is fantastic. A few minutes walk to many of Barcelona’s major attractions and a 15 minute taxi ride to Sagrada Familia. Lots of great restaurants nearby and a grocery store across the street for drinks and snacks. We will definitely stay there again.",5,2022,11,14
61,Excellent 4 star +s hotel.,"Very helpful staff, nice rooms, great location.  8th floor bar/restaurant servers very good food and drink.  My wife’s sangria was one of the best ever.  Tapas entries were tasty and perfectly spiced.  Staff made dining suggestions for off site restaurants that were also very good.

61,Fabulous stay,"We had the most FABULOUS stay. The staff were competent, friendly, and professional. Every aspect of our stay was lovely. The breakfast was fantastic, especially the poached eggs and bottomless fresh squeezed orange juice. Can’t say enough positive things about our experience. Stay here!",5,2022,11,13
61,Best hotel experience.,"By far, one of the best hotels we have stayed at!  Lots of little touches such as chocolates, biscuits, bottled water and espresso machine in room, and a welcome glass of sparkling wine. Warm and helpful staff.  Great experience.",5,2022,11,13
61,Quiet inside & great location ,This hotel has a great location. A major thoroughfare nearby gives easy access  to taxis but it is very quiet inside and an easy walk to many places inside Barrio Gothic. The staff are very attentive and pleasant in many ways. We opted to buy the breakfast separately so it seemed expensive but the one day we ate in the hotel we really enjoyed it and it was well worth it. The rooftop bar is a perfect place to relax and have a few tapas!,5,2022,11,13
61,Short break Barcelona ,"Lovely hotel near the gothic quarter, friendly efficient staff, Fantastic breakfast lots of choice and fresh food , would highly recommend this hotel due to location and friendly staff and. Cleanliness ",5,2022,11,12
61,Best hotel experience EVER,"The people working at this hotel are incredible. They're professional, kind, and make you feel like you're the only guest there. The bed was more comfortable than even my own bed at home, the rooms are spacious and nicely decorated, and I couldn't find a single thing to complain about during our entire stay (and I'm normally a complainer). When I travel to Barcelona again next time, I won't even think twice about booking this same hotel again. I'll definitely be back.",5,2022,11,10
61,Great visit,"Excellent friendly service   Lovely lounge simulating a cozy library with quiet nooks for reading or nursing a drink. Small room as rooms tend to be in large cities, but well-appointed. Fantastic  shower.",5,2022,11,10
61,Great vibes,"I fell in love with Barcelona through this hotel. The concierge staff was so accommodating and friendly! I have to give a huge shout out to Alberto and Raúl at the bar upstairs for providing ASTOUNDING customer service. The entire hotel staff did. This hotel is quaint yet modern, the rooms are soundproof and the beds were so comfortable! I would definitely stay in this hotel chain again, anywhere in the world.",5,2022,11,09
61,nice modern hotel in good location,Great location- walking distance to most attractions- but it is far from Sagrada prob 30 min walk fyi. The beach was about 30-minutes too. Close to La Rambla/Merado and plenty of action. The reception was very welcoming and helpful with reservations and directions. The front desk recommended the Palace Musica  and I'm so happy this did- definitely worth checking out beautiful setting and a perfect photo spot! The room was very comfortable with a great shower. Modern and clean. The rooftop has beautiful views and the pool was very enticing even though we never had the time to go in.  One of our highlights from Barcelona was a paella cooking class- check out The Paella Club! With only 2 nights here happy to have stayed at this hotel.,5,2022,11,08
61,Great location and comfortable ,"Great location, and surprisingly quiet for a city location. Wonderful warm welcome from staff, great rooms and products etc...didn't eat in as wanted to explore, and didn't make use of the pool but might another time...great views from rooftop bar but drinks wise you obviously pay for the privilege...but no matter, great hotel, slept well and would visit again! Will look out for this chain again! ",5,2022,11,08
61,Best location and best service,"I have only positive feedback about H10 Madison hotel. Stayed a few nights and everything was smooth and flawless. Starting with check-in Glenn was very efficient and fast, Albert was also very helpful arranging taxi services for our trips. Special compliments to Ravi who assisted us with breakfast menu. Overall, hotel is very clean and very well maintained. Staff is super helpful. Rooms are  pretty large and well equipped. Bathrooms carry Rituals toiletries. Rooftop pool and bar is a nice way to relax after sightseeing. One of the best location in Barcelona, close to most of major attractions. Definitely recommend it.",5,2022,11,07
61,The Place to stay in Barcelona,"If you are looking to stay in Barcelona, don't look further this is the place! 
Arrived before check in time, hotel staff at reception were super helpful with our luggage, the hotel's building is beautiful and location just a block away from Barcelona's Cathedral was ideal for us. The inside of the hotel is beautifully decorated, and you can tell they take very good care of it. One of the highlights is the rooftop with a pool and bar, great views of the city, very relaxing and great food I would recommend the red wine Sangria!
The rooms are very spacious and nicely furbished, family of three and we were very comfortable we had two beautiful balconies in our room and could see the Cathedral.
Major attractions are walking distance, plenty of restaurants and bars nearby. I'd strongly recommend breakfast at the hotel; the food was delicious plenty of options hot and cold. All the staff went out of their way, they were brilliant, we only stayed three nights and hey would remember our preferred drinks and food. 
This hotel is Excellent! Will stay there next time I'm in Barcelona!",5,2022,11,07
61,A Hidden Gem in the Gothic Quarter,"This hotel is an absolute gem, tucked away on a quiet street in the Gothic Quarter, a block from the Cathedral.  The staff are to be commended for excellence in professionalism, service and customer satisfaction. They went above and beyond to ensure guests are pampered. ",5,2022,11,07
61,Location is amazing and service to match,Can’t beat the location! So close to the old quarter and  stunning views from the roof terrace. Fantastic service throughout our stay. Breakfast really good with a buffet and an a la carte option. The weather was unseasonably hot so the roof top terrace and pool was amazing. All credit to all the staff at this hotel you make a huge contribution to a personalised experience. Would not hesitate to recommend.,5,2022,11,04
61,Very satisfying stay!,"The H10 Madison is in a perfect location, only a few minutes walk to the main attractions of the Barrio Gothic, the Eixemple, and other major sites. It’s within throwing distance of the historic Barcelona Cathedral, and a short walk to Las Rambles.

Sadly, I didn’t discover until our last day that this hotel is also across the street — mere steps away — from an amazing mom & pop bakery that serves the best churros imaginable. 

In addition to the location, the hotel staff is top notch. The front desk provided instant responses and advice. The maid service was outstanding. The hotel even left us a surprise platter of chocolate strawberries and champagne when they learned it was our anniversary!

I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2022,11,04
61,Magical barcelona,"The hotel staff made the experience just magical, especially the breakfast staff, the breakfast had a huge variety of foods, the rooms and hotel were immaculate. If I come back to Barcelona I will definitely come back to this hotel.",5,2022,11,03
61,Excellent stay at this beautiful hotel,"We have just returned from a really great stay in the H10 Madison. We stayed in a junior suite it was lovely and spacious, the bathroom was very large and modern. There was a coffee machine and kettle in our room, which we used. 
 There are road works going on outside the hotel and they gave us a perfect room that was quiet 2the rear of the hotel, the views weren’t scenic but this did not mattar at all to us. 
The restaurant, Bar and swimming pool are on the roof and we loved this. The views were amazing at night and the atmosphere was just what we wanted.
The food and drink were lovely and the waiter was very helpful & we did not want for anything. 
I require Gluten free food and I had informed the hotel when I booked & the service I got was second to none. I was delighted well done to all the staff. 
We will definitely recommend this to others and will look forward to returning again some day. ",5,2022,10,27
61,Brilliant hotel in the heart of the old city,"Excellent hotel in a great location.  Staff are very friendly and knowledgeable, and for us it was great that they all spoke really good English (as my Catalan/Spanish is very poor!).  Rooms we’re very comfortable and there was no noise from the road below, we also had fabulous views of the cathedral, which was a bonus.  The top floor terrace was great place to relax and unwind after a day out.  I’ve stayed at other H10 hotels in other cities and I’d have to say this is my favourite.  Perfect location from which to explore the old city and in very easy walking distance to many good restaurants, cafes and bars.  Would definitely recommend.",5,2022,10,26
61,H10 Madison highly recommended,"What a lovely hotel perfectly situated in Barcelona.

The rooftop was a real plus- great views- drinks- and just a nice spot to unwind! Great boutique hotel in perfect location.,5,2022,10,15
61,The Perfect Place to Stay in Barcelona!,"Look no further! The H10 Madison is the best place to stay in Barcelona. We visited this wonderful city for 6 nights in September and one of the things that made our visit to Barcelona so special was the way we were treated at the H10 Madison. To say that the staff goes above and beyond is an understatement. As seniors traveling alone without the assistance of a tour director we particularly appreciated the staff at the front desk. They helped us book restaurants and gave us advice on traveling to sites around the city. This hotel is in a fabulous location. You can walk everywhere and we did! The rooms are modern and well appointed and very clean. My husband celebrated his birthday the night before we left and when we got back to our room after dinner there was a chilled bottle of Cava and a small birthday cake waiting for him in our room!!!! We were so touched and impressed with this beautiful gesture and will always remember the H10 Madison for making his birthday in Barcelona so special. As others have mentioned, this Hotel is a block from Barcelona Cathedral where there's lots of activity in the evenings; juggling, musicians, acrobats. It's a great place to go and watch the action for a while, then go back to the H10 have a drink at the rooftop bar and relax.",5,2022,10,14
61,Our favorite hotel,"Where to start?! Background: We’re both 60 and have been traveling for over 30 years. We had such a nice stay here that we’ve decided this is our favorite hotel. 

Booking was easy online and a confirmation email quickly received.

Check in : Arrived very early in the morning so knew we would need to wait for our room. It was so nice to be greeted warmly with the offer to call or email should the room become available earlier than the 3pm check in time. We left our luggage and took off to explore hoping for a call. (Which we received:)

Location: Amazing to see the Cathedral from the front door and rooftop lounge! So central we walked everywhere. Lots of eateries near by-and the meeting place for our tapas tour was only a block from the hotel. Grocery store across the street.

Room: clean quiet comfortable room darkening curtains with the best shower (shampoo shower gel etc provided). AC,Usb outlets, and an amenity kit too. Mini bar is extra but in room coffee included (we didn’t have any).

Public spaces: Eclectic design and cozy spots to sit and enjoy a glass of cava in the lobby. Restaurant for breakfast is also nicely decorated. Plenty of cold choices at the buffet and hot made to order selections were delicious (omelet, waffles, etc). Food presentation was well done. Rooftop pool and lounge- our home away from home esp after a long day of sightseeing. Nice to relax and have drinks and some snacks outside. Our last night was cool and there were heaters - and we witnessed a waiter give a guest a blanket also. Which leads me to the best part of our stay—the people. Everyone was so warm and genuinely wanted to make sure we were having a good time. We felt very pampered and appreciated all their hard work in making our stay exceptional. We hope to return some day.",5,2022,10,13
61,Outstanding Hotel and Staff,"The H10 Madison was the nicest hotel we have stayed at.  It was right in the center of the Gothic section of Barcelona which made for daily walking excursions all around town.  The staff was amazing and we felt very pampered during our stay.  The rooftop bar made for great atmosphere and wonderful cocktails.  We did not eat much at the hotel, but the breakfast buffet was stupendous, with anything you could think of on the menu.  If we ever return, we would probably stay again, or even at one of the many other H10 hotels in the area.  ",5,2022,10,12
61,Nothing could have gone better!,"We stayed there 2 nights after a 2 week tour.  Desk personnel were very helpful, could answer any question and were genuinely friendly.  It was spotless, very stylish and quiet.  They ordered a 4 am taxi for us and met us at the elevator to help with our bags.  Nothing could have gone better!",5,2022,10,12
61,Exceptional and well priced,"Incredible location in the heart of the city. Perfectly situated on the border of el barrio gotico and El Born. Only minutes walking from La Rambla and Plaza Catalyuna. 

The roof top pool and bar has an incredible view of La Catedral de Barcelona, which is a two minute walk and on the other end you can see Gaudi’s famed La Sagrada Familia on the other end.  

The rooms are perfectly sized and provide all the modern amenities.  The bathrooms are very well lit, clean, and modern. The shower was very large and has a rain shower head.  

The customer service from the doorman, to the reception, to the service staff is exceptional. 

We will definitely be staying here again when we come back. ",5,2022,10,11
61,Amazing hotel,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at H10 Madison.  The staff was extremely nice and helpful, the room was very comfortable and the bathroom was large, clean and well-appointed.

61,Nice hotel in the Gothic District,"This is a boutique hotel that has great service, nice amenities, such as cava and sparkling water in the lobby and a rooftop bar and pool. Rooms are updated. The front desk helped us with recommendations and reservations. The only suggestion I have is that housekeeping, on occasion, did not supply us with the appropriate amount of towels and toilet paper.",5,2022,10,08
61,Loved this hotel,"We loved this perfectly situated hotel. We joined the H10 club which treated us to certain perks. Our room was modern, comfortable and fairly big. The closet had lights which was nice. The room had all the amenities one needs. We enjoyed drinks at the rooftop bar/restaurant. The staff treated us extremely well from check in to checkout. We will definitely be staying at H10 hotels again.",5,2022,10,02

61,"Great, great, great!","Loved the location, staff and the rooms.  The rooftop pool was a great chill place to retreat to after a day of sightseeing. The cava served in the evenings in the lobby didn't hurt either!

61,Excellent Stay,"The staff at H10 Madison was superb.  Everyone was friendly, courteous and helpful in regards to our stay at this hotel. Housekeeping was excellent and fulfilled all our daily room requests.

61,Barcelona's Hidden Gem!,"We loved our stay at this hotel ! The front door, concierge and reception staff were friendly and very solicitous to our every need. The hotel was conveniently located and is situated within walking distance of many restaurants, shops and points of interest. Our room (a junior suite) was very spacious, the bed was extremely comfortable and the shower is the best we have ever had at a hotel -- plenty of hot water and the water pressure was good and strong. The double showerhead and double handheld wands were a surprisingly nice feature. The hotel features a lovely rooftop restaurant/bar with a panoramic view of the city. We also enjoyed nightcaps (good Spanish brandy) and tapas/meals at Luigi's, an Italian Restaurant/Pizza parlor that is conveniently located just next door.  We consider this hotel to be one of Barcelona's hidden gems and would definitely stay here again... and again!",5,2022,09,26

Great thoughtful touches like Champagne in foyer and a special appreciated Birthday cake and bubbles.
I would definitely stay again.",5,2022,09,26
61,Wonderful hotel in Gothic District,"The hotel was top rate in all departments.  The desk staff was very friendly and helpful.  The restaurant servers were friendly and very efficient.  The room and its amenities were more than satisfactory.  The roof top bar/restaurant next to the pool was a wonderful place to relax at the end of the day.  Overall, one thing that was impressive was the cleanliness of the entire hotel.  The location is in the Gothic District, two blocks from the Cathedral of Barcelona.",5,2022,09,25

61,Fantastic hotel in Barrio Gothic - highly recommended !,"Excellent hotel in the Barrio Gothic, yet without sound nuisances. Our room was large, very pleasant, bright, in pristine condition, with a large bathroom and great bedding. The rooftop bar looked great but we never had a chance to really try it out as we were out most of the time. The breakfast buffet is wonderful, and the staff is ever so helpful and attentive.
A definitive ""must return"" place !",5,2022,09,19
61,Best Hotel in Barcelona!,"This was the best hotel we’ve ever stayed in! My husband and I went for our honeymoon to Barcelona. The hotel provided us an upgraded balcony room and dropped off champagne and strawberries with a nice note congratulating us. The H10 Madison was in the perfect location to be close to all major attractions and the beach. There is a great Italian restaurant next door but it is also very walkable to delicious local authentic restaurants too. The hotel will provide recommendations for anything you wish to see. They will help with museum tickets, order a taxi, and even mailed our postcards to the US for free. The rooftop area is a perfect place to relax with beautiful views. The hotel lobby is immaculate and their breakfast was delicious with a lot of options. Price wise this is a great value compared to other European cities. I would love to stay here again if we are lucky enough to return to Barcelona and would recommend the hotel to  everyone! ",5,2022,09,18
61,Excellent hotel," Great service and excellent staff. Always willing to go the extra mile! Spotless rooms, clean sheets and towels every day.  Breakfast was superb with an excellent choice of food.. Would highly recommend. Will be returning.",5,2022,09,18
61,Central location,Central hotel in Barcelona to explore. Room was small was but clean and adequate. Had to wait ages for our room to be ready. Gave a drinks voucher as compensation. Don’t bother with the pool it’s just the size of a very large bathtub. Cocktails are good. Breakfast was good. Great service. Lots of restaurants around. 10 minutes walk to las ramblas.  Took a tour bus which took around most of Barcelona’s tourist places. Went to the Barcelona football stadium which is great for football fans.,4,2022,09,15
61,Excellent all round,"Very convenient location for many sights, especially for walking around the Gothic Quarter. Light, airy, comfortable room. Quiet too. Really friendly and welcoming staff. One of the best breakfast buffet spreads I’ve seen. Lovely ambience in the rooftop bar and restaurant, with great views too.",5,2022,09,15
61,Perfect!,Honeymooned and spent a whole week here. It was absolutely perfect. It’s right in the middle of the historic district of Barcelona. Walking distance to lots of restaurants and shops.

61,"Great location, staff and breakfast","This hotel is located in the old town area which is really beautiful.  the staff are all friendly, the hotel is spotless and the breakfast is terrific, both a sit down is included with the buffet.  the roof top pool is peaceful with about 10 lounges.",5,2022,09,08
61,We did a number of local tours and boarded a cruise ship at the end of our stay.,Very friendly service at the front counter and good English speaking attendants. Excellent breakfast selection. The only hitch was that one of the elevators were not working a few times during our stay.,5,2022,09,05
61,Lovely Hotel in and Excellent Location,"From the moment we arrived we were treated like special guests.  We were early and allowed to leave our bags until our room was ready.  The hotel is in a fabulous location in the Gothic neighborhood.  Many streets to explore and a variety of restaurants and bars.  It is just a short walk to the Rambla, which is full of people, shops, restaurants, and the St. Joseph Market. The Cathedral is right next to hotel and an easy landmark, making getting back to hotel easy when walking.  There are signs for the Cathedral everywhere.  Several good restaurants are close by, especially Luigi’s, which is right next door.  I could eat there everyday!  Pedro and Albert were especially attentive to us during our five night stay, exchanging entrance tickets for us, making recommendations and suggestions for walks and dining, and pouring us a glass of Cava after a long day.  Every hotel should have such friendly and caring front desk staff.  Our room was spacious for Spain standards, modern, quiet, clean and comfortable.  There are two French doors looking down to the little courtyard and the rooms across the way.  No outside view.  We chose the room for the king bed. It did not bother us on this trip, as we spent very little time in the room during the day.  We used the nespresso machine in the room for our morning coffee, sitting comfortably on the chair and couch in the room, then went across the street for a bigger coffee and treat.  In the late afternoons we spent our time sitting on the beautiful rooftop patio, enjoying a cocktail while admiring the view, and, people watching the beautiful young people in the pool.  Food was good. We are just beginning a month long trip in Spain and I fear The Madison has raised the bar for our expectations.",5,2022,09,02
61,I wish I could give more than 5 stars!,"This is one of several in Barcelona and a terrific location near Metro, Las Ramblas (but not close enough for its noise), and winding streets leading to   larger plazas with sightseeing and shopping. The concierges, Manuel, Jemm, Albert and Glenn were kind, friendly and helpful.
Dining-Breakfast was included in our rate and so lovely. Our waiter Oriol finally convinced me to try the Poached eggs on our second day and I should have tried them sooner! He, Judith and Cecillia could not have been kinder at our 3 breakfast days. The rooftop dining, lounge and pool are so nice it’s tempting to stay up there indefinitely! Siri and Judith were our servers and charming and friendly as we had come to expect from this Hotel. Room: Best bed and bedding of our many hotels in our lives. We had a small sitting area and a good size bathroom with a long sink so it worked for 2. Storage is limited but that is normal for city hotels.
The bath and body products are amazing, usually I have allergies to hotel stuff. We had a ceiling fan and silent a/c. I thought the windows when closed were great sound insulation, except some long running fireworks one night, but that’s to be expected. The hotel is an historic style with elegant decor. I put the H10 app on my phone hoping to visit their other properties but this one will remain a favorite hotel experience in our memories!",5,2022,08,19
61,Great Experience ,Great place to stay. Central to many points of interests for touring. Close to many great places to eat tapas and shop.

61,Great Location near Barcelona Cathedral,"I know it's a chain, but this particular H10 property is just lovely and in a great location if you are looking for a room in Barcelona but don't enjoy the late-night noise of Las Ramblas.  The rooms are clean and comfortable, it's very easy to grab a cab, catch a bus or walk to the train station at Placa de Catalunya to explore.  The roof top pool area is so nice to sit in the fresh air at night and enjoy a glass of wine. I had a view of the Barcelona Cathedral and wouldn't hesitate to book this hotel for my next visit to Barcelona.",5,2022,08,15
61,Amazing Hotel,"We booked into hotel Madison for a short break as it was our wedding anniversary. 

I have gone over 300 business trips to almost 30 countries over the last 20 years, I have to say Hotel Madison is one of the best hotels I have stayed at. 

From the beginning, late night check in the staff were very friendly, accommodating and went out of way when we dropped a glass in our room at 1am..

The staff at the restaurant on the pool, breakfast restaurant were very friendly. 

Food was amazing, my 11 year old wants to visit the hotel every year. 

I would highly recommend the burgers, cocktails at the pool. 

What made our stay so incredible was the employees and our look forward to staying with you again.

61,Amazing,"Loved everything about this hotel! We stayed at another hotel in Barcelona for 2 nights after & our biggest mistake was leaving H10 Madison.

. Service is amazing - it was our anniversary whilst we were there & the team brought us up some cava & chocolate strawberries which was so lovely. Every day when the cleaners came they left a little chocolate on the pillow (such a nice touch).

. The pool area is spot on, the sun loungers were so comfy and the hotel just created such a chilled out atmosphere. The sun loungers can get busy but they have loads of space to sit on the tables & chairs near the pool.

. The food during the day was really nice & not too pricey.

. The rooms are even nicer in person & the bathrooms were amazing.

. Fantastic location in the centre of the Gothic Quarter.",5,2022,08,11
61,3 perfect days stay in Barcelona ,"Centrally located, very clean and cute hotel. Delicious breakfast and wonderful staff. Though it is not the cheapest option for staying in Barcelona, but to me it is worth to pay a little bit higher but get the service you deserve. ",5,2022,08,07
61,2 days in Barcelona before a cruise,Great hotel in a great area of the city. Even has a view of the cathedral. I would recommend this hotel for couples and for families. The roof top pool and bar area were very good and the staff very friendly. ,5,2022,08,07
61,Good hotel for a few days in Barcelona,"Very good all round.  I stayed two nights with my 11 year old son. Room was clean, not big but perfectly adequate. Checkin was well organised. Great roof top swimming pool and bar area. Pool is small (like it seems all Bcn hotels)  but bar area by pool was bigger than average with lots of chairs and sofas. Breakfast was good, not the best I’ve had in Bcn but absolutely fine. Communal areas were nice too. Location good. Staff friendly.  I would stay there again and it’s certainly up there with other 4 star hotels I have been to in Barcelona.",4,2022,08,07
61,Faulty shower door,"Just left this hotel nice hotel but very upset as on check out I was asked to pay 250 euro why ? My 14 year old used the shower , and when she finished the room was flooded on inspecting the splash guard had come away from the door . Water leaked down into receotion , Ruth who on duty came to my room , and accused by children of taking turns in the shower messing and flooding the room on purpose I explained to her that we were having food upstairs and there was only one girl having a shower and it was not her fault it was due to a damage door she would not step away from the door and I felt totally attacked she threatened me with an extra bill of €250 later on I explained to her what exactly had happened and showed her evidence of the broken door she apologised but also was demanding an apology from me which I did not understand
  I’m checking out of the hotel I was asked to pay the money which I negotiated down to €150 pedro handled the situation very well there was no managers there to discuss this and it was very unfair as it was an accident that the shower door is broken so beware if you have children and having showers 
Feel Disappointed as he spent a lot of money there and tipped really well to the other lovely staff members cannot say the same but Ruth she was very rude and made up a story about what happened to the manager who believed her and did not even take the time to discuss it with me",1,2022,08,07
61,Fantastic hotel in a great location.,"What a fantastic hotel. The staff are so welcoming and helpful. 

The location was spot on, in the gothic quarter and a great place to use as our base for exploring Barcelona. 

The public areas and rooms where clean and modern. Great food and drinks available. 

We had a truly fabulous stay

Highly recommended",5,2022,08,05
61,Great Hotel in a Great Location,"I stayed at the H10 Madison in July with my husband and 17 year-old son. It was a great stay and very convenient for walking to many sights. Our room was a triple- with ample space and a great sturdy pull-out couch bed for my son. Our room did not have a view to the outside street (it was to a narrow open-air courtyard). But, that was fine as we didn't spend much time in the room.  And, the room was very quiet. You would not know you were smack in the middle of Barcelona. The AC worked great during the July heatwave. 

The best parts of this hotel, in our opinion, are the rooftop pool and bar and the breakfast buffet/ a la carte service. The rooftop  has a small pool, but it's so refreshing after a hot day of touring. There aren't a whole lot of lounge chairs, but people come and go. So, eventually you'll probably get one. The bar/tapas area is also great and the staff who work there are friendly and helpful.

The breakfast every day was wonderful as well. There is an adequate buffet plus you can order off the a la carte menu at no extra charge. My husband and son especially enjoyed the homemade belgian waffles with chocolate sauce. 

The location of the hotel is great- right down the street from the Cathedral and the Gothic Quarter and close to Las Ramblas. We did take a taxi to Sagrada Familia and Parc Guell, mostly because of the extreme heat while we were there. I highly recommend this hotel if you are planning to visit Barcelona.",5,2022,08,04
61,Great hotel just sort out the iron & ironing boards,"Our 3rd stay at H10 Madison and we love it

So central for getting around Barcelona 

The roof terrace staff have been amazing; think they got to know us as they knew the drinks we wanted.

Our only criticism being a 4 star superior hotel is the lack of iron and ironing board. Took 3 attempts with reception staff to finally get one as they didn’t have enough. Surely a 4 star superior hotel should make them standard in all rooms, don’t like wearing creased clothes but had no choice for 2 days. 

Apart from that highly recommend staying here and we will be back.",5,2022,08,02
61,Excellent,"We arrived here a few days ago  and we are simply impressed by the amazing and friendly staff. 
Everyone  is so accommodating and friendly. It just make fun to go upstairs to the Rooftop or downstairs for breakfast. A really great team here!! 
Thanks a lot for that !",5,2022,07,31

Bar worth visiting, and nice breakfast
Room with sofa bed good enough for a family of 3, with a tall teenager",5,2022,07,28
61,End of cruise stay,"Great location in the Gothic Quarter. Very large room for Europe standards. Very clean and tile work made for an enhanced appearance . Separation of shower and toilet was appreciated. Rooftop pool and bar gave a nice area to wind down after a day of touring. Finally, all staff members we encountered were extremely friendly and helpful. Laura behind the front desk was well organized in her skills handling large groups of guests checking in at the same time.",5,2022,07,27
61,Stop searching. This is the “just right” hotel. ,The best staff. Immaculate. Location perfect. Services great. Food fresh.  Room lovely.  Couldn’t have been better.  AC worked through the July heat wave and rooftop pool had a great breeze to take break.  ,5,2022,07,27
61,Excellent choice for your Barcelona Vacation,"Great hotel. Awesome location. It was wonderful to have the pool area to relax after a hot day of touring. The bed were really comfortable and the rooms were quite efficient with space. Even more important, the air conditioning worked really well and was quiet.

Also, I am terrible with my sense of direction. It was really easy to find the sea for a morning run and find your way back.",5,2022,07,26
61,"Amazing Hotel, Location and Views",This hotel is in an amazing location and great views of the Cathedral de Barcelona.  I had a lovely snack on the rooftop terrace and it was an easy walk to la Ramblas.  The breakfast was great as well.  And the staff was amazing.  I would highly recommend this boutique style hotel.,5,2022,07,25

61,Great Location in Barcelona,This is a wonderful hotel in a great location with really helpful staff. Could not fault it. Their rooftop bar with great cocktails and fantastic views was a treat after a long day exploring the beautiful city of Barcelona. ,5,2022,07,22
61,Wow hotel in Barcelona,"Couldn’t have been happier with this hotel choice for our first trip to Barcelona. It was even better in real life than the website which is high praise. 
Ideally located in the Gothic quarter/ Barrio Gòtic - literally 200m from the Barcelona Cathedral of which you have a perfect view from the beautiful rooftop bar/pool area. We spent most of our time exploring this area with its winding streets. 
The room although not big, was not tiny either and was perfectly appointed - and super quiet. We had room 301 which faced an internal courtyard so we heard no noise. Aircon and ceiling fan a must! Super modern and luxurious bathroom with double shower - I loved it and took interior inspo for my future home. 

The rooftop is definitely the jewel in the crown. We knew july would be hot in Barcelona so this was our number one criteria in finding a hotel - to have access to a pool to cool down. The pool is small - approx 7m X 3m with only 10 Sun loungers and then lots of deck chairs and shaded seating at the bar. But we never struggled to find a bed when we wanted. Definitely more an adult hotel/pool - only 1 out of 4 days did we experience kids at the pool so it was pretty serene. Nice ambience and music and bar opens from 12-12. Staff very friendly, prices a little on higher side. We are and drank at pool bar on rooftop but didn’t eat in restaurant otherwise.

Hot tip - amazing Italian restaurant called Luigi’s beside hotel (2 doors up to left). What a gem! We are here twice during our stay. 

Highly recommend and would 100% return!",5,2022,07,21
61,"Great location, clean and friendly hotel","Well kept, small hotel in a great location.  Cleaning of rooms were thorough and front desk staff helpful (assisted with reservations).  Location is great…in gothic quarter close to Barcelona Cathedral (which makes it easier to find).  Close to a couple of restaurants that we really enjoyed (Luigi’s and Rose Negro).",5,2022,07,18
61,Great hotel and staff,"Really enjoyed the location of this hotel and the friendly staff. The room was just big enough and the bathroom was clean and modern. The location was amazing as it is in the Gothic District with so much to see, do, and eat. I would highly recommend staying here when visiting!",5,2022,07,18
61,Fabulous hotel in a perfect location,"We just returned home after a 4 night stay here which was fabulous. The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are large and airy with good facilities, the rooftop terrace and the pool is amazing. The staff are friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back.",5,2022,07,14
61,Awesome Hotel. ,"The friendly, helpful service, recently refurbished room, terrific spacious shower, rooftop plunge pool and bar, terrific full breakfast buffet (extra cost, but worth it) and terrific location near the Barcelona Cathedral were among the many reasons we would highly recommend this hotel.  This hotel surpassed our expectations. ",5,2022,07,14
61,"Stylish, comfortable hotel with great staff ","Wonderful hotel, great staff, loved it! Stylish, comfortable hotel with a beautiful rooftop bar. Excellent breakfast. Staff very friendly and helpful. Definitely our favorite place we stayed on our summer travels.",5,2022,07,14
61,Comfortable and posh ,Very accommodating and welcoming. The front desk is a five star group that is extremely helpful and polite. Great location as you are right in the hustle and bustle. The rooftop pool is amazing with great views and good vibes. ,5,2022,07,11
61,Marvellous and relaxing short holiday,"This short holiday was originally booked for June 2020 but the lockdown forced a postponement until June 2022. We arrived on Friday 17 June and were made to feel most welcome by the staff. They helped in recommending lovely restaurants as well as places to go. Our visit was to see the wonders of Antoni Gaudi and we were not disappointed at all. Getting back to the hotel each day was like returning home.
This hotel is well located in the Gothic area and an easy walk to all forms of transport.
The whole hotel team got to know you very quickly which made our stay all the more relaxing. They even knew my birthday (which my wife and I had kept quiet about) and there was a little birthday cake at breakfast  that morning.",5,2022,07,05
61,"Great location, nice rooms and friendly staff","It's just about the perfect location for family vacation to Barcelona.  It's well centered between the Gothic Quarter, the Rambla and Placa de Catalunya.  There are many great restaurant options within a 10 minute walk.  It's a short taxi to the Gaudi sites.  

The rooms are slightly larger than you typical find in Barcelona.  We had 2 rooms for the family of 4.  The front desk helped ensure they were on the same floor and gave us some great family friendly ideas on restaurants. We also enjoyed the views and tapas on the rooftop restaurant.  

FWIW... We were traveling from the US.",5,2022,07,04
61,"Great location, great experience of Barcelona","We had one of the best times thanks to the friendly staff at H10 Madison. As soon as you enter the premise you are welcomed with an amazing fresh aroma. The rooms are extremely well organized and spacious. The location is the best part as its in the heart of the gothic towers and walking distance to most tourist sites in Barcelona. Too many great choices for food, drinks, cafes & more. I will absolutely recoomend this place and would love to come back and stay here.",5,2022,06,30
61,Excellent hotel for a fun filled weekend,"I booked 5 rooms in this hotel for myself and my friends as our home during the Primavera festival and I cannot recommend it enough. Firstly the rooms are beautiful, nicely air conditioned, comfy beds and beautiful shower and toiletries facilities - and hats off to the cleaners that tended to our room as it was spotless every time. We spent most of our day at the pool and I cannot thank the staff there enough, they were attentive, always had fresh towels available and given we were a group of 15 that wasn't an easy ask. Thank you for such an amazing experience and everyone here deserves recognition for their friendliness, professionalism and just being great hosts. We will 100% be booking again for next year and I cannot wait.",5,2022,06,30
61,Lovely stay,"We had a short 1 night stay at this hotel, but it was absolutely wonderful! The staff was very friendly, the room very nice and clean, and the breakfast was lovely. The location was also great with easy walking to different areas. I would definitely stay here again!",5,2022,06,27
61,Outstanding assistance ,"The front desk personnel (Glen) were outstanding! They helped us do much.  Always friendly and helpful. He scheduled covid tests for us, found us a laundromat. Everyday we needed some kind of help and Glen and the front end staff were so helpful ",5,2022,06,25
61,Outstanding hotel and desk staff,"We spent 4 nights here at the end of May. The location is incredible, which is why we chose it. When an old building was renovated to make this hotel, it was done beautifully. We were on the 3rd floor in a “junior suite.” It is in no way a real suite, but is a larger room than their regular ones, and had a nice sofa along with an oversized desk. There is also a double closet, a refrigerator, and complimentary water. We needed the space because we had to travel with so much luggage. 

The bathroom was special, but in a way that looked fancy rather than being practical. There was a long bathroom vanity, but the whole thing was filled with two shallow sink bowls, with no place to put your toiletries. There is a separate room with the toilet, but all the separation walls and doors are glass, with just portions being frosted to afford a false sense of privacy. The shower is double - meaning two rainfall heads as well as two very modern shower wand type things. Two people could shower together, and even have a water fight if they wanted to. But… the shower floor was so slippery that we barely wanted to take a regular morning shower. 

The mattress and bedding were lovely. The best thing was the help of several people at the front desk. We needed help getting Covid tests (when they were still required.). They set up the appointment for us, and arranged for a taxi. The main time that we needed personal service was when I developed some worrisome health issues. They made sure that a doctor came to our room, he did an exam and wrote me several prescriptions. Then the same man at the front desk kept checking with my husband about how I was doing. 

On our last night, we visited the rooftop. The pool was busy with children, and the bartender was overworked. But it was a lovely area, and we enjoyed a couple of hours there, gazing off at the cathedral and ocean in one direction, and the Sagrada Familia and Montjuic in another. 

We would recommend this hotel to anyone, as it isn’t far to La Rambla, Plaza Catalunya, or the Gaudi buildings on Passeig de Gracia. The gothic cathedral is literally at the end of the street where the hotel is located.",5,2022,06,23
61,Great staff and location,Super helpful and very nice staff.  They helped me get tickets for tours of historic sites which I had tried to do on my own and couldn’t manage.    Awesome location.  Excellent cleaning of my room daily.  Cava to welcome you.  Wonderful hotel!,5,2022,06,20
61,Excellent Hotel,"We booked a City break for 4 to Barcelona flying with British Airways. On arrival at the hotel the staff were extremely polite and courteous allowing us to access our room 2 hours early. The Hotel in all respects was fantastic and in a superb position for sightseeing. The room was spotlessly clean and tidy and met our needs.
We would thoroughly recommend this Hotel to anyone and we intend to stay there again.",5,2022,06,20
61,Great Time,"We had such an amazing time. The room was comfortable and clean, staff was very friendly and helpful and the location cannot be beat. The restaurants are super convenient and have great food and drinks. ",5,2022,06,20
61,Great hotel for first trip to Barcelona.,"We just returned from a 5 night trip to the Barcelona and we stayed at the H10 Madison. The hotel was not only in a great location for exploring the City, the staff was friendly and helpful.  They helped with reservations and suggestions about what to do in the City.  The rooms were well appointed (although my one complaint is that they need more than 2 small drawers for clothing) and the roof top pool and restaurant was a perfect way to end the day after a long day of touring.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2022,06,19
61,"Clean, Quiet, Great location and great staff","My husband and I loved this hotel.  Marc and the front desk staff, Alberto and the other staff at the rooftop bar were so friendly and helpful.  We loved them all.  The hotel is very clean and very quiet.  It's located in a nice area close to many restaurants, bars, etc.   Overall great experience.",5,2022,06,16
61,Fantastic! ,We stayed for 2 nights before our 8 day cruise and for 1 night after the cruise. The hotel staff was excellent! They assisted with taxi bookings and my return Covid tests for the US. Loved all of it- especially the rooftop bar. The views were beautiful. ,5,2022,06,16
61,Barcelona Haven,"Welcoming hotel on a small side street near many winding alleys offering shops and restaurants.
Comfortable room with a nice bathroom.  View was an inner courtyard for us but there are street view rooms also.
Rooftop terrace and pool with views of Barcelona was a special treat.  
Morning breakfast offered all types of choices including made to order omelets.  Champagne also if you wish.  Room was quiet and pleasant.",5,2022,06,15
61,Excellent stay,"Clean, nice, quite, friendly staff. Wonderful experience!!!! Helpful finding things to do around Barcelona. Wonderful Hotel!!!! 5 stars. Room came with coffee, caramel biscuits & water. Special backpacks & robes provided for children.",5,2022,06,15
61,Nice place to stay in Barcelona,"He had a wonderful stay at H10 Madison. We were three couples that stayed at the hotel for two nights before a cruise. The room was fine. A little smaller than what we would have liked but we weren’t in it very much. The bathroom was a great size and well maintained.
The hotel is located in a great location with plenty todo in walking distance. Check in took a little long but the free champagne and cold water helped. Be prepared to pay 23 euros for the breakfest if you want it. We would return to this hotel again.",5,2022,06,14
61,Beautiful hotel!,"We loved our stay at the H10 Madison. It’s a lovely and elegant hotel, very comfortable and quiet, with a gorgeous roof deck. Great location in the edge of the Gothic quarter and the staff is warm and helpful. We will be back!",5,2022,06,11
61,Pre-Cruise Stay,"We spent 3 wonderful nights prior to our Mediterranean cruise in May 2022. Quality people, fine room, rooftop bar and pool with outstanding views and food and excellent breakfasts in a great location.",5,2022,06,10
61,A fantastic break,"I have just returned from a four day trip with my teenage daughter. The hotel is in a great location just a few minutes walk from La Rambla, shops, restaurants, cafes & supermarkets. The hotel is spotlessly clean, the room was really lovely (515), a super comfy bed, the bathroom was just gorgeous with a massive shower & huge fluffy towels. The rooftop pool & bar really made our stay special, it was so nice to relax by the pool after a long day sightseeing & shopping. They supply towels by the pool which was also nice. The rooftop menu was really good & not as expensive as you'd think for a central hotel. The staff are really lovely, helpful & kind, I couldn't fault them. We'll definitely be back. ",5,2022,06,04
61,Everything was just excellent!,"Just came back from a 2 night stay and honestly have to say, one of the best hotels I’ve stayed in. Everything was just excellent! The rooms, the cleanliness, the food and most importantly the staff. Nothing was too much and just so friendly!! The free Cava in reception was also a nice touch😂. Can’t wait to book again! Thank you H10 Madison.",5,2022,05,09
61,Fab hotel - fab exeperience,"We stayed here last week with our two teenagers for 3 nights.
Really enjoyed our stay - the staff at the hotel were friendly and happy to help with any request. The ladies that served us at Breakfast were fantastic. 
The bed in our room was super comfortable and breakfast was fresh, varied and delicious.",5,2022,04,26
61,"Lovely hotel, great location","We stayed here for a long weekend in April 2022 as a couple with no kids. The hotel is perfectly located, just a stones throw from the Cathedral, shops and Gothic Quarter.

The room was a good size, cleaned everyday and the buffet breakfast excellent. The Omelettes and sides were really tasty, and the staff were. Wet helpful and couldn’t do enough for us.

On a hot sunny day, then the roof terrace is a perfect place to relax, unwind and take in the views. 

My only negative feedback would be that the service at the roof terrace bar was painfully slow. The staff members did at least acknowledge that service was slow, but it did take about 30 mins to have two cocktails delivered to our table. 

If they had more staff members working on the warm sunny days, we would have definitely spent a lot more money on food and drinks. 

On checkout we did spot a roof terrace drinks/food charge that had been incorrectly added to our bill, but it was corrected with minimal fuss.",4,2022,04,21
61,"Great Hotel, Amazing Value","Stayed 3 nights at the H10 Madison and it was overall a great experience. I wasn't familiar with the H10 chain and was honestly a bit worried that for the rate the hotel was going to be very low quality, but was pleasantly surprised. The hotel looks like it was completely renovated a few years ago as everything was updated and in great condition. Staff was friendly. Really appreciated the little touches from the hotel like free welcome chocolates & drinks, fresh waters every day, and free cava each afternoon. The hotel is in a good location near the Gothic Quarter while still quiet. I definitely recommend the hotel, was an amazing value. Would certainly stay at a H10 hotel if I ever find myself in Spain again.",5,2022,04,20
61,Great location,"We spent 5 nights in Barcelona. This hotel is very centralized and close to everything. We felt safe walking to most places even at night. Staffs were super friendly and the amenities are great. My kids love the  super warm heated pool. They wanted to go swimming every night even though it was kinda cold(60 degrees). Can’t beat the Cathedral view from the roof top bar. One season why I put down 4 stars instead of 5 because they charge extra $50 per night per kid, which I find it odd and a bit overpriced considering it’s the same room and the kids sleep on the same bed as us. Never ran into this extra charge at all the hotels we’ve stayed at before and we’ve traveled a lot. Great hotel regardless.",4,2022,04,20
61,Loved the Rooftop Restaurant with Cece,"We were staying at the hotel in the Cathedral Square. But, we saw this hotel and we’re escorted to their lovely rooftop restaurant/Bar where my friend and I had the pleasure of being attended to by Cece. What an asset this hotel has with her!! She was charming, kind, thoughtful. We enjoyed her throughly. Our lunches were fantastic and drinks were even better. We liked our hotel, but because of the kind and thoughtful service. We will be staying here on our next visit.",5,2022,04,20
61,Great hotel in a good location,This hotel is very comfortable and the staff are all very friendly and helpful. The breakfast offerings are fantastic. It is a short walk from the Placa Catulunya stop for the airport bus and Ia Rambla.,5,2022,04,14
61,Horrible and robbed of an extra night that didn’t stay,"Horrible service! I had to leave earlier and checked out well before noon and they said they were going to charge me an extra night which I would not be staying. Never have I heard such a thing. I asked to talk to a manager and the front desk lady simply said the manager is not there and pretended to call someone and said that they were going to charge me more money for nights not spent . Ridiculous! Obviously apart from robbing me a night they will rent out this mini room. 
The day I arrived the room was micro mini and asked to move to a better room and the gentleman in the front said that the next day they would change us. We were never changed rooms. Also, we waited hours the first night for towels that the own front desk had to bring them to us late late .
Will never return to this hotel. Do not recommend it to anyone. I have stayed in so many Barcelona hotels and never had I experienced such a surreal moment where they charge you more than what you stay!!! I felt robbed! And the front desk offered ZERO help ! Sad and unhappy! Don’t stay here!",1,2022,04,14
61,Stunning rooftop views,"When did up staying at another hotel nearby for arrival, but for our departure after traveling Spain we chose H10 madison. I'll be honest, we were worried that the stay  wouldn't be as amazing as our first hotel was, however, while this is a chain it really exceeded our expectations. The room facing the cathedral is magical, great place is a sip your coffee in the morning. The rooms are really modern and chic, so comfortable. There's also privacy with how the rooms are laid out. Again, the best part about this hotel is the location. So close to the cathedral and so walkable to all the other stuff around Placa de Catalunya. The rooftop pool is really gorgeous, though I did not use the pool we all went up there for pictures and we got some of the best pictures from the trip. All in all I think this is a hotel that's bordering onto luxurious but for the value you really can't get much better.

TLDR: Great affordable option for a luxury-esque stay, perfect location and comfortable modern rooms.",5,2022,04,12
61,Highly recommended,"Stayed here for 4 nights with our daughter and son-in-law we were very impressed with all aspects of this fine hotel, all the staff we met were absolutely brilliant, always happy and very helpful.It was our daughters wedding anniversary and on the first day they had champagne and cake brought to their room! Breakfast was very good with all you need, again the breakfast staff were brilliant. So I would say if you visit Barcelona then visit H10 Madison you can't go wrong!",5,2022,04,12
61,Marvellous stay,"We had a lovely stay at the H10 Madison in early December. The room was beautifully clean, the hotel staff helpful and courteous and a breakfast to die for.  Course upon course of beautiful food, we felt compelled to eat EVERYTHING!  

Even though it was an unpredictable time of year we were able to enjoy the rooftop terrace although sometimes under the blankets provided by the hotel.  However, we did have one beautiful hot day out of the 4 we stayed which was wonderful down at the beach.  

As it was during the midst of Covid we had a multitude of things to remember and fill in.  The staff at reception helped us so much with this, even down to the computer keyboard which wasn't set out the same as the English ones.  

This was our first ever stay in Barcelona and thanks to the H10 Madison, we hope to visit again.  

Thank you (and sorry it has taken so long to write a review)",5,2022,04,06
61,Brilliant Stay!,Brilliant stay in this hotel. Staff were excellent across the board. Reception very helpful - always helpful as were the breakfast staff and the bar staff on the rooftop!  If you need a hotel to staff in Barcelona this is the one!  We have now even joined the H10 club and intend to stay in their other hotels around Europe and further afield. ,5,2022,04,02
61,Perfect stay in Barcelona,"It’s hard to know where to start as this was just the most wonderful 4 night stay in Barcelona as part of our honeymoon. We arrived early on Monday 28th March after a very early start, we were greeted with a very friendly welcome and a glass of Cava and our room was ready. Our room (206) was just perfect. The view of the Cathedral from our balcony was simply breathtaking. The room was clean, the bed very comfortable and the shower wonderful. High quality products for use in the bathroom (rituals) so no need to bring shampoo, conditioner or shower gel! The hotel is in such a fantastic location to see all the main tourist attractions, we walked for miles everyday! The weather was changeable during our stay, but the hotel had plenty of umbrellas to hand which we could borrow. . We had breakfast most  mornings  which was varied, plentiful and delicious. The highlight for us was the rooftop bar! Just a little piece of paradise, having a bottle of wine and the hotels very delicious croquettes was a great way to relax for a couple of hours . Views are just breathtaking and a sun trap in the Spring sunshine. A big shout out to CeCe (Cecelia) who was just a ray of sunshine and an asset to the hotel. Thank you H10 Madison - we will be back. ❤️🇪🇸",5,2022,04,02
61,very comfortable but..........,we loved the hotel and room was great. Breakfast buffet was excellent and staff all friendly. Location is perfect. We stayed 6 nights and for most of the week it was cool and windy. As a result the roof top bar was not really the place to be and because of the wind it was closed for part of the week. We were disappointed that they advertise a Riverside restaurant inside the hotel but this was closed  as its seasonal. As a result there was no place to get an evening drink or meal that was inside the hotel offering somewhere warm and comfortable. There are a lot of good restaurants and bars close by but if you did not want to venture out in the rain in the evening the hotel was not able to offer anything. As a result it is given only 4 stars and not 5. I think the hotel should not advertise a facility that is not available. Otherwise it was a nice hotel.,4,2022,03,29
61,Family vacation,"Hotel is located in prime location.
Staff is very good and friendly.
Room is very attractive 
Hotel is very clean.
we would surely suggest this one to our friends and family.
They also did arrangement for transportation at very good price.

61,Great stay,"Stayed 3 nights in the hotel on a couples break. We booked a city view room which was well worth it. Staff all excels t throughout our stay. We also ate breakfast in hotel each morning, fresh made eggs and sides, tasty waffles and a nice crisp cava. 

Rooms very tasteful, a big comfy bed and a hot waterfall shower. A great location which made this hotel ideal for a city break",5,2022,03,29
61,A terrific upscale hotel experience in the Gothic Quarter,"My spouse and I were very happy with our stay in the H10 Madison. The front desk staff was professional and helpful; the room was beautifully designed and comfortable; and the Avenue restaurant on the first floor serves a nice breakfast. The location is excellent, just blocks from the Cathedral of Barcelona and Palace of Catalan Music and an easy stroll to La Rambla and Passeig de Gràcia. There is a terrific rooftop cocktail lounge (with no indoor seating, so plan your attire accordingly.)  The bed was comfortable.

You can get some street noise, as is common with any urban hotel. But we have nothing but praise for our experience at H10 Madison.",5,2022,03,27
61,"Fantastic location, friendly staff, great roof top bar","We loved our stay at H10 Madison!!  The rooms were very clean with cozy robes.  The bed was super comfy as well.  The roof top bar was amazing.  Food, drink, view and pool - all spectacular and affordable.  
We left something in the room upon check out and the staff was extremely helpful in shipping it to our next stop in Spain.  So grateful for their help! You can walk to all main attractions in Barcelona from H10 Madison.",5,2022,03,21
61,"Great People Here, Thank you Carlos and Victoria","The people here are absolutely amazing. The hotel is nice enough but the bartender Carlos, who speaks amazing English and Spainish, was one of the best people I have come to know. He works hard, is smart, and when I was shy, he got me talking. Carlos is a great bartender as he recommended a lot of good drinks. He also helped me find diverse and interesting spots around the city. In general I would say that without this man, my time here would not have been as fun.
The next bartender is like to thank is Victoria. She and Carlos are a great team and work hard. She is very fun to talk to as being from here, she gives me great insight. She is also a lovely lady to talk to in general! She also made my time very enjoyable",5,2022,03,16
61,Excellent Hotel,From arrival o this splendid hotel to leaving today. Everything was beyond expectations. Staff were polite and helpful. Breakfast was plentiful. Rooms were outstanding and thoroughly cleaned each day we were there. Would definitely look to go back again,5,2022,03,14
61,"great stay, check out the roof","It was a good location for walking to sites, but also had nearby metros.  Excellent staff with tips for the area.  Comfy bed and a hot shower.  I thought it would be loud at night as we were only second floor but them walls were thick. The rooftop bar was lovely. Have a drink at the bar as the sun goes down before heading out for tapas.",5,2022,03,13
61,Worthy of multiple stays,"Highly recommend this centrally located, well appointed hotel. The staff has been very friendly, the rooms are among the nicest I have had at any 4star hotel and the breakfast is delicious. There are lovely touches like the palmiers left as a welcome, the complementary cava and water bar in the lobby and the terrace bar with excellent views of all the old treasures buildings. I will definitely stay again.",5,2022,03,08
61,Great!!,"מלון מעולה! במיקום מושלם. 5 דקות הליכה משדרות הרמבלס.  מיטות נוחות, חדרים מקסימים, מעוצבים ונקיים, צוות נפלא ואדיב. על הגג מסעדה חמודה עם ריהוט כיפי ונוף יפה ובריכונת קטנה. כיף אמיתי! מומלץ בחום!! נעשתה חשיבה על כל פרט ופרט. החדרים שקטים. מהחדר שלנו היה נוף יפה.
אין לי ספק שנחזור! מומלץ ביותר. נפלא.

Great hotel! In a perfect location. 5 minutes walk from Ramblas. Comfortable beds, charming, well-designed and clean rooms, wonderful and courteous staff. On the roof is a cute restaurant with fun furniture and a beautiful view and a small pool. Real fun! warmly recommended!! Every detail was thought of. The rooms are quiet. From our room there was a beautiful view.
I have no doubt we will be back! Highly recommended. Wonderful.",5,2022,03,08
61,Outstanding hotel,"The Madison is easily an almost-perfect hotel:
Rooms are large and quiet - even on lower floors.
Beds are comfortable, climate control works well, the desk in comfortable and has power outlets. The bathroom is spacious and shower water pressure is great.
The room has a safe large enough for a laptop, along with sufficient clothing storage space.
The reception staff is helpful and friendly and the hotel restaurant offers a good value with excellent service. 
The rooftop pool has stunning views and offers a respite from a hectic day of business meetings.
The location is good, close to a metro station and plenty of great restaurants and shopping.
The Nestle espresso machine and free water bottles, along with a fridge round out a well-thought and modern room.
Just great. Thank you for an outstanding week-long stay.",5,2022,03,07
61,Excellent hotel & location ,Excellent location & hotel would stay there again as it’s in an ideal safe place 5* very central and walking to attractions or accessing the metro so easy.  Relaxing at rooftop bar after a busy day of sightseeing is a must :-) friendly welcoming staff thoroughly recommend.,5,2022,02,16
61,Average is a good word…..,"A pretty fair summing up- it’s average and nothing more. Some of the staff are nice, maybe a little too attentive and intrusive at times, but nothing ridiculous. 

The room however is pretty bad (509) with the constant smell of sewerage and the shower literally flooding the whole room because the seal is broken. Mentioned both to reception and nothing was done even though we were there 5 nights. 

This may get rated highly, but there are far better hotels than this- stay in one of those instead.",3,2022,02,13
61,Highly recommended!,"Clean, friendly, excellent location, we were so happy that we picked this hotel in Barcelona and would highly recommend. Very good price and we were made to feel like royalty. They put a beautiful bottle of fizz and strawberries in our room for us to celebrate our honeymoon which was a wonderful surprise. Within walking distance of the top spots/main attractions. ",5,2022,02,08
61,Love This Place - Perfect Central Hotel,"Love this central BCN hotel. Ideal location, clean and modern, super close to most tourist things, ideal for a long weekend. Super friendly staff, helped with great advice, great drinks and positive energy. Loved every minute we were here.

- Super central, can walk to most places, great for bars and restaurants
- Fun, friendly staff - special thanks to Reuben on reception for great bar tips
- Beautiful breakfast room & great food selection - thanks to Ravi for looking after us every morning
- Huge room, great big bed & very hot double showers (Junior Suite)
- Terrace bar & pool were great fun, even in January
- Super clean everywhere, the property is well managed and cared for
- It’s got a beautiful, happy vibe throughout. 

Really, loved every minute we were here.",5,2022,01,23
61,Great hotel and helpful staff,"We visited this hotel in mid January,the place was quite quiet,the room was very clean and the sheets and towels were changed daily and pretty much everything you need 
The roof top bar had great views over the city and the heated pool a nice touch even though we didn’t use it 
Breakfast was served down stairs and had both English and continental selections so plenty of choice and the staff were great 
All in all a great visit to a lovely city",5,2022,01,18
61,Lovely trip to Barcelona,"What a lovely hotel in the perfect position to explore the city.
It was welcoming, clean and comfortable. The breakfast each morning was also delicious.
The roof top terrace was great and even in the winter month they had the heaters on and offered blankets for comfort. We even managed a morning in the heated pool.  Will most certainly stay here next time.",5,2022,01,08
61,"10+ for service, rooms, rooftop, location","Excellent holiday at this hotel, the views are incredible from the rooftop bar/pool. Service and food great up there as well! Location is close to a lot of attractions in Barcelona, and we were there for Three Kings Parade, where we stood on the balcony and watched. Ruben was there at reception, very good English and so professional! Rooms were a nice size, bathroom had 2 sinks and ample space, extremely clean, and just a great vibe throughout hotel.",5,2022,01,08
61,Wonderful hotel in a wonderful location,"This is absolutely a first class hotel. It has everything that you will look for in a top rated luxury hotel: a fantastic location with the view of the cathedral., spotless rooms , very smartly furnished  stocked with quality amenities, a beautiful rooftop terrace with  a small heated pool as well as bar and food service, great breakfast and friendly and knowledgeable staff everywhere. 

Our only regret was that we only got to spend one night before our cruise and one night after our cruise here. We certainly intend to come back for a much longer stay in our next visit to beautiful Barcelona.

Room tips: it is much cheaper to book the breakfast with your room rather than paying separately at the property. Become a member of H10 hotels for free before booking and you get a voucher for two free drinks at the terrace bar",5,2021,12,31
61,3 night winter break,"All staff we came across were very helpful and allowed us to check in early. Great location everything within walking distance or a short taxi to attractions further out from the centre and a supermarket right across the street. Room was perfect for our needs, with a spacious bathroom, street view with the cathedral in sight, spare pillows and 2 full length mirrors! Housekeeping also came daily. Would highly recommended this hotel and will definitely return in future! 
Top tip - become a H10 member for a complimentary drink on the beautiful rooftop bar! Heaters a blankets are also provided ",5,2021,12,22
61,Fantastic hotel,"Best hotel on our whole trip. Hotel is conveniently located near the old quarters and close to everything. Hotel looks new and is clean & nice. Rooms were bright, clean and very comfortable with good amenities. Staff were excellent, very friendly & always ready to help. ",5,2021,12,20
61,Outstanding!,"I enjoyed very much my stay. 
The location, the room quality, the breakfast and above all the kindness and helpfulness of all the staff were above and beyond any expectations. 
I highly recommend this hotel in Barcelona!",5,2021,12,16
61,Beautiful Hotel,"We recently stayed at this centrally located H10 hotel and we were more than impressed with everything about it.
We received a warm welcome from reception and a voucher for a welcome drink on the roof terrace which was lovely.   Our room was excellent with all the facilities you could expect from a 4 star hotel.   Bathroom was fabulous with all the hot water you could wish for, beds were comfortable and the room was so quite too.
Breakfast was good, however, I feel that the Omelette could have been served hot, not tepid but that is my only niggle.

I would certainly stay at this lovely hotel again.",5,2021,12,14
61,Perfect stay at H10 Madisom,"This hotel was above my expectations and I highly recommend it for many reasons.
First of all, the rooms are modern and very well appointed. They have great soundproofing, no noise from the street or from adjacent rooms, corridors. For me this is super important. The air conditioning/heating makes no noise and is very effective.
Location is perfect, walking distance to pretty much everything you want to see in Barcelona. Metro and bus stop are very close. 
Staff is very nice and always ready to accommodate any requests.
The rooftop terrace is really nice and has beautiful views of the cathedral. 
Breakfast was plentiful and tasty.
I will definitely go back!",5,2021,12,06
61,Missed potential,"(+) The location was certainly convenient at the heard of Barcelona. Spacious and well lit room (junior suite) and nicely decorated. the check-in experience was smooth as it occurred during the week.

(-) We did not appreciate room cleaning starting at 9:00 am and especially on weekends. We’ve asked housekeeping to stop but we got ignored. we complained to the reception (apparently we were not the only guests complaining about noise) and the response was flabbergasting, on one hand, the receptionist was saying our comfort is important to the hotel, on the other hand, she also said cleaning starts at 9:00 am as per policy of the hotel and “now you’re awake anyway”! The receptionist didn’t even try to listen and kept interrupting and was very dismissive and quick to offer “free breakfast” as a way to get over with the complaint which is not what we wanted and honestly a bit insulting. Next morning cleaning started at 9:00 again. The bed was broad but the mantras was very hard. Sheets were not cleaned after several days of stay.",3,2021,12,01
61,Great hotel between Barri Gotic & El Born,"Excellent hotel in a fantastic location between Barri Gotic & El Born. 

The room we stayed in was very clean, with comfortable bed and pillows. Adequate wardrobe space although we could have done with somewhere to store clothes that didn’t need hanging up. There were a couple of draws for underwear. 

The bathroom was spotless, the room we stayed in had a double sink and a double shower with a range of toiletries. Face clothes were provided, as were dressing gown & slippers. 

We didn’t get to eat in the restaurant but did use the terrace bar, with its fantastic views over the city. Drinks prices here were also reasonable for a hotel. Being November, it wasn’t over hot but the addition of heaters above the chairs made it comfortable to spend time sitting up on the terrace, just taking in the views.

A lovely gesture from the hotel that we really appreciated was returning to our room to find a bottle of chilled Cava, a cake and a note wishing me happy birthday. 

We’ve stayed in H10 hotels before and they’re always good value. I’ll definitely be back to this one.",5,2021,11,25
61,.,What a great location to find. I loved the room it was clean with a beautiful view. The hotel also has a roof top; nothing like observing Barcelona from the roof top with a cocktail. The staff were super friendly especially Ruben who assisted us with our queries and kindly also gave us recommendations of where to go in the city! It’s a 5 star from me and will definitely be returning to stay here!,5,2021,11,20
61,Perfect!,"Great modern & clean hotel! Great central location! Friendly & helpful staff! Room cleaned every day. Mini bar restocked every day!  Complimentary bottles of water every day. Chocolates on the bed occasionally. 

Couldn’t really ask for anything more.",5,2021,11,13
61,Excellent boutique hotel,"We stayed here for two nights, prior to getting on a cruise. We had a Courtyard view room, which felt like a mini suite. Excellent bathroom! Loved the roof top bar and ate there as well with a classic tapas style menu. Breakfast was included and there was an excellent buffet selection as well as cooked to order. Close to Las Ramblas but by no means in the middle of it, so it seems like a little oasis of calm. We would certainly return and also look at using this brand of hotels in other locations.",5,2021,11,12
61,"Great hotel, ideal location","This was our first trip abroad since February 2020 and since we booked the original flights our choice of destination changed three times. So glad we ended up in Barcelona and the H10 Madison. From the moment we set foot in the hotel we were made to feel welcome, really friendly and helpful staff. The hotel has real character, modern with artwork throughout. Our room was spotlessly clean, spacious and had a brilliant shower. We appreciated the complimentary water, the USB points at each bedside were really useful. The hotel was relatively quiet but the bars on the ground floor & roof terrace were open as normal. It is in an excellent location, at the end of the street is the Cathedral, just five minutes away is La Ramblas and Place De Catalunya where the airport buses stop and start. The streets around the hotel have restaurants, coffee bars and shops. Would definitely recommend this hotel and stay there if we return to Barcelona. ",5,2021,11,12
61,Love this hotel,"Wonderful staff, best breakfast, near to centrum and beach. 
Good service, clean bathroom.

Breakfast included vegetables, fruits and sweets, portions was in good size which helps avoid throwing away food. 

I definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2021,11,10
61,Amazing Breakfast,"Super comfortable rooms, friendly helpful staff and a great breakfast. Thank you to the lovely waitress who was so kind to my elderly dad who ordered almost everything on the menu for breakfast (and ate it all)! Amazing views from the rooftop and a great location for walking in Barcelona.",5,2021,11,09
61,Fantastic stay,"We have just had the most positive experience at your wonderful hotel from the  very warm and helpful staff to the comfortable rooms where we looked forward to returning after long days of sightseeing. As ex cabin crew, we’ve stayed in too many hotels to count but this one is definitely up there with the best. We will certainly be recommending it. Thank you.",5,2021,11,05
61,Great mid range hotel,"Great location on edge of Gothic quarter - so close to sites and shops
Everything in the hotel felt modern & clean
friendly staff
great rooftop bar - views & cocktails were fabulous
Good breakfast buffet",4,2021,10,31
61,Worth it,Rooms were clean and well organized. Attention to detail. The staff is professional and eager to help. The rooftop is very nice as well and so is the restaurant. Would definitely go there again and look forward to it.,5,2021,10,28
61,Amazing,"Incredible hotel! Super clean and peaceful!
Staff members are very helpful & breakfast food is great!
They welcome me during my birthday with sparkling wine and a very nice chocolate dessert in my room, such attention to detail.
Definitely coming back!",5,2021,10,27
61,Fabulous!,"Excellent in all ways - the room was clean and very comfortable bed with lovely linens, friendly and helpful staff, great location where you can walk to many shops and restaurants, fabulous breakfast and an amazing rooftop terrace overlooking the cathedral, / city scape - highly recommend staying here!

61,The H10 Madison Hotel-- A Perfect Place to Stay in the Center Barcelona.,"From the moment I checked in, I felt like a welcomed and valued guest at the H10 Madison.  The check in process was smooth and friendly and I was in my room in no time. My room was clean, comfortable, and it completely met my expectations for size. I spent the first night at the rooftop bar and had exceptional service from Victoria and Luis.  The tapas were fantastic and the drink selection was excellent. Best of all was the incredible view from the bar-- what a great retreat from the busy city streets below.  I returned the second night to have a cocktail at the end of my evening because the atmosphere was so relaxing and the staff was so good.

The front desk staff did a remarkable job of highlighting some areas in the city for me to visit during the day and during the evening. 

Transportation to the hotel from the airport was easy on the Aerobus (10 Euro return fare) and the hotel was a mere five minute walk from Placa de Catalunya stop.",5,2021,10,25
61,Awesome.,"Great stay. Great location. Nice rooms. The showers are awesome and the service as well. Everyone was super nice. Good people, especially Ruben. I recommend H10 to anyone traveling to Barca. 10/10 would write a review again.",4,2021,10,23
61,A Great Location in Barcelona!,"My fiancé and I spent two nights at H10 Madison and had a wonderful experience. It is incredibly well-located in the old city of Barcelona and walkable to all of the major sites and shopping destinations. 

We arrived after a very long and delayed travel day and Ruben was incredibly pleasant and personable - his warm welcome really turned our day around! We were offered complimentary drinks on the rooftop, which provided great views of the city and reasonably prices tapas and larger plates in a great atmosphere. We ended both our nights on the roof and loved it. The service was great as well. 

We stayed in the Cathedral Room, which was just enough space for two nights and had a great view of the Cathedral. The king bed (a rarity for Europe!) was very comfortable and the shower was amazing (another rarity for Europe!). 

Several of our friends also stayed at H10 Madison and had equally wonderful experiences. Highly recommend this hotel as your home base for exploring Barcelona.",5,2021,10,21
61,Superb,"Stayed her with friends to celebrate a 60th birthday , hotel staff were wonderful and went above and beyond to make sure the birthday was celebrated well. 
 Rooms were lovely and clean with nice rituals toiletries. Breakfast was excellent. We only used the pool once as too busy out and about sightseeing etc but the roof top area was a lovely space to come back to and relax. The hotel is in a lovely location and we found it very easy to walk everywhere . We would definitely stay here again in the future .",5,2021,10,20
61,Amazing All-around!,"We stayed at the H10 Madison the before our cruise and at the H10 Urquinaona Plaza at the end of our cruise, and preferred the Madison. To be fair, I think I paid for a nicer room at the Madison but the room and bathroom there were huge, especially as far as European Hotels are concerned. Everyone on staff was friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was delicious. In case anyone else is interested in Urquinaona, we had a beautiful terrace there, but when the doors outside our room closed, it was loud enough to make us both jump every time. The rooftop terrace was smaller at the Urquinaona too but the lobby was grand and there was a ground-level terrace that was nice. The bathroom was tiny with a see-throughish door, and the theme of eyeball decor throughout the hotel combined with mirrors decorating the restaurant, created an odd Big brother is watching vibe. 

Maybe because we stayed at the Madison first, it just felt more like home but for us, but the accommodations, restaurant, rooftop terrace, and staff made the Madison a nicer stay and we would definitely book it again!

Afterthought: the location of both hotels was great!",5,2021,10,15
61,"Lovely hotel, great staff","Well located in the Gothic Quarter, this hotel has a terrific roof desk and pool with views of Barcelona Cathedral at one end and the Sagrada Familia at the other. The roof deck has comfortable sofas and chairs and a great bar staff. The food served was always top notch. Front desk staff are excellent, always helpful, friendly and good humoured and happy to make sightseeing suggestions and arrangements. The hotel has a great breakfast room with a splendid assortment of options and a charming staff to serve you. Ravi was particularly delightful. Our room, a Cathedral room on the second floor, was perfect, immaculately clean with balcony and small sitting area and spacious bathroom. Rarely have we stayed in a hotel and left without some criticism, but this is hotel was perfect - we loved every minute of our stay and would return in a heartbeat. Two thumbs up.",4,2021,10,12
61,Robbed!!!,"I love this hotel and the personnel are extremely nice but I cannot give them 5 stars for one primary reason.  Their security stinks!!  We were waiting outside with our luggage for a taxi to take us to the cruise port and were robbed standing right by the front door.  One piece of our luggage that had our passports, money, cpap, iPad and medications was taken from us.  It was a team that distracted us for less than a second and before we knew it, our belongings were gone.  You would think a nice hotel would have some sort of security.  Oh well!  Lesson learned.",3,2021,10,06
61,Good for what it is,"Visited in September with friends.

Pros:
- great central location for exploring Barcelona with lots of shops/restaurant/ gelato shops nearby and a supermarket 2 minutes down the road
- cheap 
- clean and really nicely decorated
- staff friendly 

Cons:
- not enough sun loungers- there are about 8 or 9 and usually there are about 6 people waiting for one. Don’t stay here if you plan on having a pool day or two. 
- the pillows are rock hard! I’ve never had neck pain but developed for the first time during my stay here! When I asked if they had any other pillows, reception told me ‘no, have you tried sleeping on your back?’. Unintentionally  funny, but not helpful. I ended up sleeping on a folded up dressing gown for the rest of the trip. 

All in all it is a great option if you want a cheap central nice modern hotel. There are no frills.",4,2021,10,04
61,Beautiful hotel,"Stunning hotel in a lovely area of Barcelona. The staff were helpful & friendly, the rooms spacious & spotlessly clean. My only criticism is that service at the pool area was rather slow. I had to stand at the bar on a number of occasions when ordering drinks, in a hotel of this class I’d have expected to be approached & have my order taken, the bar staff were continuously busy however so extra staff are required perhaps? I would most definitely visit & stay again. Thank you.",5,2021,09,29
61,AVOID - Don't Stay Here for the Pool!,"I booked this hotel specifically because it had a pool (which is the basically the main image of every advertisement the hotel has... including it's main image on TripAdvisor). This hotel is VERY BIG (which is great), however, on their massive roof deck they ONLY HAVE 9 SUN LOUNGERS. As you can see in the picture I posted they have a very spacious roof deck where they have many tables and chairs, but they only have 9 sun loungers (pool area circled in red). They could easily fit more sun loungers if they remove some tables and chairs during the day time as no one uses them. I have seen many hotels in Miami with similar size roof decks fit many more sun loungers on their roof while still maintaining a nice seating and bar area. It's a shame the hotel has a full staff on the roof for 9 sun loungers. I feel pretty deceived, and I am glad I am only here for a 3 night stay and just have 2 more nights here. I can't believe I paid such a premium for a pool I couldn't even use today when the weather was 82 degrees and sunny. On a positive note, the staff here is extremely professional as you would expect at any 4-4.5 star hotel like a Hilton, Kimpton, etc. I can't believe I paid such a premium for a pool I can't even use. If you don't care for a pool this place is fine although you could easily find a cheaper place that is just as nice without a pool. If you are looking for a hotel with a roof you want to relax on and enjoy the pool avoid this place.",2,2021,09,26
61,Nice hotel with comfortable beds.,"Wonderful hotel in Gothic quarter. Jemm at the front desk was a wonderful young woman who helped me with finding bus route to Tossa  de Mar. I hope they promote her within the organization. The staff were friendly and accommodating. Rooftop was enjoyable place to relax.  Also, this hotel had the most comfortable bed I ever slept in.  3 day stay midweek.  It appears their prices go up as the weekend approaches.",4,2021,09,24
61,Great Hotel with Great Amenities,"We stayed here for 7 nights and had a great experience.  The front desk staff was extremely friendly.  The hotel was very clean in the public areas and the room itself was cleaned daily.  Free coffee and a free bottle of water is provided daily along with a reasonably priced mini-bar to purchase other drinks.  The rooftop terrace has a beautiful view of the cathedral and drink service is excellent as well.  We did not use the pool at all during our stay.
The hotel is in an extremely good location for lots of shops and restaurants.  We easily walked down to the pier from the hotel as well as to La Sagrada Familia.  
I will definitely be checking out H10 Hotels in other locations after this stay!",5,2021,09,23
61,comfortable quiet hotel pre-cruise,"We landed in BCN at 0900, arrived hotel ~ 1030.  They stored our bags until we could check in later about 1400.  Very clean, quiet, comfortable room.  Front desk staff VERY helpful and friendly.  Stayed 2 nights, had their breakfast buffet on day of check out.  Fairly close to Barcelona Cathedral.",4,2021,09,19
61,Great find!,"We came across this hotel in planning our Spain vacation and it worked out perfectly.  It's in an ideal location, just a few blocks and easy walk from Las Ramblas, Placa Catalunya, and Gotic Catedral.  Nice little pool and area to have drinks on the roof.  Rooms are nice and spacious compared to some others we stayed in.  Staff was always very friendly and helpful.",5,2021,09,17
61,Perfect location and amazing service ,"We had a wonderful time staying at the H10 Madison. We arrived quite earlier and the staff kept our bags so we could go out and explore, the arranged to call us when the room was ready and had us on a priory list for an early check in which was appreciated. The hotel is in the perfect location and so easy to walk to most sites in Barcelona or easy to access via Metro. About a 25 minute walk to the beach as well. The roof top pool and bar was great and so nice to have after a day of sight seeing. Cocktails and drinks were really reasonable as well. Staff all super friendly and helpful with directions and recommendations. Can’t wait to stay again! ",5,2021,09,12
61,Weekend break originally booked 2019,"This hotel is situated in an excellent location.walking distance to many locations. Near to the harbour with restaurants and the beach.The service at this hotel was exceptional, staff were so friendly and helpful. Standard room really nice. Comfortable bed, lovely shower.
I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona and would come back. 
I can say that Barcelona has been one of my favourite destinations I have been to
",5,2021,09,07
61,Beware! Pickpockets in area,This area here hotel is located is unsafe. I had my phone stolen from me as I stepped one foot forward out of hotel as I was waiting for a FreeNow car (Uber in Europe) in less than 5 minutes. I never moved passed the entrance staying right at entrance to the hotel.  I notified hotel staff what had happened they were not helpful at all. I had to leave to airport quickly thereafter so I couldn't escalate the problem with police. I had written a previous review but hotel had it taken off TripAdvisor which is ubsurd.  Shame on you TripAdvisor,1,2021,09,02
61,"Clean, spacious rooms with helpful staff","The rooms are lovely, clean and spacious. The bathroom in particular was very modern with a really good rain shower. The staff at reception are very helpful and attentive; always happy to give recommendations.
The only thing to be mindful of, if you want a sun lounger by the pool you need to be there early.
Would definitely stay again.",5,2021,08,20
61,Cathedral view bait and switch to dumpster view on 1st floor with agoda,"I’m giving this hotel a low rating because somehow between h10 and agoda there was a bait and switch where the cathedral room turned out to be a loud room on the first floor with a view of a garbage dumpster that was unloaded by a very large and loud garbage truck several times even during the night.

The hotel staff was not sympathetic with my situation either during my arrival or after realizing their was a mix up. They took no responsibility whereas  I would expect a high end hotel to sort it out on the guest’s behalf. 

Agoda was actually helpful and didn’t blame the hotel. Ultimately, the hotel and agoda agreed to refund two nights since the room I tried to book wasn’t available but it took a bunch of calls to agoda and almost zero help from h10. 

Hotels like h10 act like their victims of agoda but in truth agoda is helping them sell their inventory and it’s not good hospitality for the hotel to put the onus back onto the customer to deal with such a mix up. they’re willing participants in such booking channels and should help guests out. 

I will say the room was very, very nice and I did sleep very well despite a lot of initial noise from the aforementioned procession of nocturnal garbage trucks. The lobby was gorgeous and had beautiful art. The location is great too. If you’re a light sleeper be sure to book cathedral view or bring earplugs. If you’re booking through a channel like agoda, a call ahead to confirm what you booked is what you’ll get is advised.",2,2021,08,11
61,Amazing Hotel in Prime Location,"My girlfriend & I stayed here during our time in Barcelona and this hotel well beyond exceeded our expectations! 

We were recommended the hotel by a close friend who had stayed here about a month prior. Upon arrival Reuben at reception greeted us with open arms, great restaurant recommendations and first class service. The rooms were chic with a double balcony providing great views of the Barcelona Cathedral. There is a rooftop pool and bar providing surreal 360 degree views of the Gothic Quarter and surrounding areas. We enjoyed some light snacks and cocktails one afternoon after spending the day running around the city. I would also note the hotel is in the best location -- under 10 min drive to the beach, ~10 min walk to El Born and ~15 min subway/metro to Las Rambles.

We will definitely be retuning to stay here our next time in Barcelona!",5,2021,08,10
61,Lovely hotel with lovely staff!,"Recently stayed here for 6 nights as a couple and we really enjoyed it a lot!

We received a great welcome from Ruben and were upgraded to a lovely junior suite because we are H10 class members. Also received a bottle of cava in the room and in the bar, thank you!

The room was large, clean and the bathroom spacious and with a nice shower, and of course with nice Rituals toiletries! Bed was really comfortable too. AC worked well (this is very important for us). Even though the room was facing the street, it was also quiet at night.

Rooftop great! The pool is more than big enough and it was so nice that they kept it open until midnight (nothing better than a late night dip). The bar area is also large, cosy and the service quick and efficient. Chillout music was nice and added to the atmosphere.

Breakfast was good, but obviously a bit more limited than usual (pastries were a bit boring, very limited cheeses, no smoked salmon or cava as you would expect in a hotel like this). To be honest it became a bit boring after a few days even though the a la carte options were decent enough. Nespresso machines were often out of order, a bit annoying. The only downside to our stay actually...

The location was great and for the first time ever we didn't need to take the metro once during our stay (we have visited Barcelona many times and will make sure to stay in the same area and/or hotel next time).

Hotel decor is beautiful, a lovely eclectic mix of vintage and design pieces.

We will return!",5,2021,08,06
61,BEST OF THE BEST,"One of the best hotel stays we have ever had!
Reuben & Roodolphe at reception made us feel like we were at home!
They went above and beyond to make our stay special!
Cava and chocolate covered strawberries to the room to really make our honeymoon amazing!
The bed was the biggest bed I've ever slept in, super comfy!
The shower was big, powerful and a waterfall shower head!
Rooftop was amazing, food & drinks by the pool overlooking cathedral! Very chilled out vibe, relaxing music!
Thanks for everything, we will be back!",5,2021,07,28
61,Great hotel in the Gothic Quarter,"Great hotel all around. Very friendly and accomodating staff. As an example we asked if we could use a gym and they gave us a day pass to a super upscale gym for free. 
We had a twin bed room which was very clean, great shower with very good water pressure. Only critique would be that the twin beds were a bit small and not on the same level as the rest of the hotel. 
Rooftop terrace was great, pool is not that big - you’re not swimming laps - but very nice to get cooled down in the middle of the city. 
Location is very good, we loved the Gothic quarter around it with a lot of good restaurants. 
Very much recommended.",5,2021,07,21
61,"Perfect location, beautiful hotel","I stayed 6 nights at this hotel during my recent city-trip to Barcelona. The location of the hotel is perfect. It is close to a subway station and bus lines. The old quarter around the hotel is beautiful with many restaurants and shops. The cathedral is merely steps away. 
The hotel room I had – a deluxe double – was spacious and nicely furnished with a comfortable bed, couch table and chairs. It had a  Nespresso machine, save and small closet for hanging clothes. I requested a quiet room so I had no view. The bathroom was also very big and bright. Each day you get a bottle of water for free. The breakfast, which I had included in my booking, is really worth the extra price. It had a good selection at the buffet, plus you got a basket of breads at your table and could order freshly cooked items as well. The staff in the restaurant is friendly and efficient. 
The staff at the front desk were really nice and very helpful in giving directions or printing out travel documents. 
I used the rooftop bar which is a nice place to sip a glass of wine after a busy day of sightseeing.
All Covid measures were met and I felt completely safe at the hotel. 
I would definitely recommend this hotel and would book again, should I ever travel to Barcelona again.",5,2021,07,20
61,"Excellent service, great location","We stayed here 2 nights and thoroughly enjoyed the location and the friendly people working the front desk. They were so helpful. We relied on them more than once to help us with travel website issues like booking Sagrada Familial tickets and train tickets. 

In addition, I foolishly left some clothing items hanging in the closet and the front desk arranged to have them sent to me at the final hotel on our tour. It took a few days to make it happen, but I got the items before returning to the U.S. 

We also loved the breakfast. So many delicious options!",5,2021,07,13
61,Great staffs and centre of Barcelona,"We have booked last minute for our visit in Barcelona, after long driving the reception welcome us with her best smile and most friendly greetings (Laura she is the best!!) she helped us to book restaurants and gave a lot of tips of visiting the city. We really like her and each time we pass reception with joyfulness. 

The hotel is located in the centre of Barcelona, super convenient to go anywhere. We “almost” walk to everywhere we want. Shopping and eating are all reachable. 

We will certain come back to this hotel again 

Btw the pool on the top is small but great enough for kids to enjoy and adults to enjoy the sun.",5,2021,07,10
61,Do Not Miss This One!,"I don't even know where to start. This is one of the best hotel stays we've ever experienced. Even before we arrived, I was emailing with the amazing concierge, Ruben F. He walked me through everything I needed to know- from Covid protocols to airport transfers, restaurant recommendations and beyond. We requested an early check in, and while there was no guarantee, our room was ready when we arrived. Check in was seamless! The hotel itself is beautiful- the lobby is spotless and welcoming.  Our room was so comfortable!  Amazing water pressure in the shower (and the rainfall showerhead is a luxurious touch), beds super comfortable, and the most adorable little balcony overlooking the property.  But the best feature of the hotel by far is the rooftop. The pool is refreshing and lovely with comfortable loungers. The view from the roof is spectacular and the food is excellent! (Our picky vegetarian teenager is obsessed with the veggie burger). And I can't say enough about the waitstaff. From the first day, Miguel knew our names and how we take our coffee. He and his colleagues, Alice, Carlos, Alexandra, Mica and  the whole staff treated us like old friends. And breakfast in the mornings is a must. Ruben G always greeted us with a big smile, and the food there is excellent as well. And I haven't even mentioned the location! Right in the Gothic Quarter, you are close to everything!  And whatever you want to do,  the stars at the desk, Ruben, Jemm, Laura and the rest will help. From a taxi to a dinner reservation to Metro directions- they even arranged Covid tests in the comfort of our room since our travels required it. If you have the opportunity to stay here- do not miss it. We are already trying to figure out when we can come back. Thanks for the best week ever!!!",5,2021,07,07
61,Tops in Spain,"We stayed here both on arrival for a few nights and then again the night before leaving back to the states. Was really impressed with level of service especially considering we are still dealing with covid times.  Excellent communication over email before heading to Spain. Big shout out to Bruno who really helped us through the whole process since our flights changed a few times and we were hoping to check in early to rooms, which he helped us do seamlessly. The hotel is in an excellent location, the pool is a special treat after a fun day of sightseeing, and the rooms are very comfortable and quiet.  We travelled around Spain for a few weeks doing a mix of hotels and airbnbs and this was by far our favorite accommodations.  The comp breakfast was awesome and icing on the cake.  We look forward to staying here again in the future and checking out other H10 properties. ",5,2021,07,04
61,Amazing hotel experience with the most amazing location!,"I was here for 4 days with my girlfriend. We really enjoyed our spectacular stay here at H10 Madison, and there is nothing that we can even complain about. Everything exceeded our expectations, from the stylish rooms to the outstanding rooftop lounging area with a pool and bar. The staff was also extremely friendly and helpful with everything we needed.
We would love to come back again!",5,2021,07,01
61,Covid-19 Refund,"i had paid for 3 rooms to this hotel, however due to covid 19 could not attend, have been very helpful in refunding me all my money.  Cant wait to be able to visit this beautiful hotel when we can finally travel",5,2021,06,29
61,"Excellent location, super friendly staff, nice rooms","We booked three nights at this great hotel in the most central location and really enjoyed our stay. Walking distance to many cites. The reception desk was extremely friendly and provided great dinner recommendations.

The rooftop bar with the pool (not too large) was a good spot to relax before dinner. Rooms were clean and offered very cool bathroom designs.

Would definitely book it again.

On a different note: The hotel also tried to help us with getting our mandatory Covid test at a nearby laboratory, but our timing was too tight so we decided to get tested at the airport which was super inconvenient, took two hours and many other passengers probably missed their flight due to the poor management and us not having booked a prior appointment online. Would have been helpful if the hotel staff had been able to inform us about the testing situation at the Barcelona airport since many guest might run into the same difficulties getting their needed Covid tests.",5,2021,06,28
61,Barcelona H10 Madison,"Best trip ever!! Amazing hotel with an incredible view, amazing service and great host by Ruben F. Vargas! Thank you so much for everything.
I can really recommend this hotel and the perfect service. Will come soon back! 
Hotel is located perfect and you will love the rooftop pool with an amazing view. Words can’t describe how much we loved it!",5,2021,06,27
61,Fantastic staff at lovely hotel!,"Such a lovely hotel with the best staff! The reception staff really went out of their way for me - so friendly, polite and super efficient. Big shout out to Laura, Ruben, Pedro (and all the staff) who were excellent! 

Hotel is very well located - walking distance to all the main shops, restaurants etc. 

Rooms were super clean and tidy. Again, fantastic cleaning staff. Couldn’t really fault it. 

Roof top bar and pool is cute. Pool is quite small but lovely views and nice to relax and enjoy a sundowner. 

Thank you - would definitely stay here again!",5,2021,06,23
61,Wonderful stay! Except breakfast.,"Very good service! The staff was very helpful!! H10 is located in a great area within a walking distance to everything. The breakfast was terrible! Never had so bad bacon in my life haha! I would not recommend to include breakfast. Instead take a 5 minute walk and have your breakfast at Caravelle, same price but just very delicious breakfast. The rooms in h10 are beautiful, the bathrooms are spacious and very beautiful as well. Unfortunately we had a room next to the elevator, which was very annoying since we could hear everything from the hall. 
H10 corroborate with Holmes Place which is a nice gym near by, it’s included in the price which is a great service as well. It’s possible to park you car near by in Saba for 29 euros a day.",4,2021,06,20
61,The hotel management needs to take action,"The hotel has all the basic amenities you would expect from hotel of this price in Barcelona.

The hotels checkin process is average and as H10 members we were supposed to get two free drinks upon arrival which we asked for at checkin but were never given.

The location of the property is the hotels best asset.   Full stop.

If you want an average hotel with average service at its best in a great location this is a hotel to book.

Now for the items of concern.

The street noise is very loud inside the rooms and the noise is constant all day and all night.   With the sounds of garbage trucks  picking up trash bins and emptying them over and over being the primary noise you will have to endure.

The staffing level is completely inadequate.  The staff can be very friendly and professional. However Many times during our 10 days stay the staff were so completely overwhelmed they became agitated, unpleasant and very rude to the hotel guest.   The hotel lounge seats by the pool and inside the restaurant was only ever at half full yet they struggled to provide an acceptable level of basic service with the staffing levels the hotel provided.   This issue is not a performance issue but a staffing  level issue that management is responsible to address.

The cleanliness of the hotel was notably below acceptable.    The common areas had dishes and garbage placed on the tables
for hours before being removed.   The guests had no choice to leave it on tables as the hotel has removed all waste bins for the all the common areas. Not a single one is present outside of the guest rooms.  This and the total lack of bathroom inside the rooms (except for toilet) is a result of very poor hygiene policies by the hotel management and not staff performance.

I wish the staff the best as I feel they are being abused and taken advantage of by the management of the hotel.   This is particularly appalling given the workers have had to endure reduced wages and lack of pay altogether for nearly two years leading up to my stay.",3,2021,06,16
61,Perfect hotel experience ,"This was the first time I had a trip to other country since COVID out break. I have to say H10 Madison gave a perfect holiday. The hotel is really new and decorated really well. We have our room cleaned thoroughly everyday. My boyfriend and I also really enjoyed their double showers. The toilet was huge and nice. 
My favorite part of h10 madison was their rooftop. They have a rooftop bar, open everyday. We had so much fun time over their. The cocktail they have were perfect. We tried so many of them and they were not even pricey. The  bartender, Miguel. He was so nice. Made us so many awesome drinks and shared a lot of fun part of Barcelona. 
 Great hotel, we will definitely live their again! 
",5,2021,06,09
61,Guest,"This hotel is closed until July 31! We had a reservation that was cancelled. How can I write a review for a hotel that canceled our reservation the day before we arrived?
They did however get us a room at another H10 and it was great",5,2020,07,18
61,Location and wonderful staff - everyone!!,"We stayed here for 6 nights and have to say we were so pleased with our selection.  Great little hotel, with a great and helpful friendly staff.  We chose a room with a small balcony where you could look over the little street (and see the Cathedral down the street. Quiet room.  The front desk staff was continuously wonderful thoughout our 6 night stay and they also helped us purchase tickets and timeframe for seeing Park Guell and Sagrada Familia.  We walked everywhere from our hotel (location was great!!!), except to Park Guell which the hotel ordered a taxi for us.  There is a roof top bar, which is really great, especially if the weather is nice.  However, this would be our only small  disappointment in that, it could have been run a little smoother and needed more staff up there for help.  We chose to include breakfast with out stay here.  We thought it was great, and it is how we like to start our day, no stress, food was very good and local meats, cheeses, etc, you could order a hot egg dish as well, and there was orange juice and Cava for mimosas.  The breakfast room staff was great too!   We are planning on returning to Barcelona, and we would stay here again without hesitation.",5,2020,05,25
61,An Excellent Choice,"This hotel was perfect for us. The location within steps to the Cathedral and in the interesting Gothic quarter was fabulous.  We were in walking distance of so many sites, including Placa Catalunya, LaRambla,  the Gothic quarter & many of the Gaudi houses. Easy transportation with closeby Metro Stations and buses.  We choose a room with a Cathedral view, albeit oblique.  However from the rooftop pool and bar area you got a fabulous view.  The staff were super attentive, spoke english perfectly and brought champagne and treats to our room without us having ordered.  We spent two weeks prior to the complete shut down, and despite the uncertainty the staff continued professionally.  Spain is now going through the worst of the Cov-19 epidemic and I pray that all from the hotel are safe and that they will be able to open in the not too distant future.",5,2020,03,22
61,Fantastic location and hotel,"From the moment we were offered a welcome bubbly drink on arrival to when we left 3 days later everything was wonderful. Quiet room, comfy bed, great front desk staff, proximity to sites and quality restaurants. Would definitely stay there again in the future. ",5,2020,03,18
61,Great location immaculate hotel!,"We stayed here with our 6 month old baby. It was her first trip abroad. I did a lot of researching as I always do on hotels that are of high quality, have a good location and have recent very good/excellent reviews. But as my OH is an accountant they have to be reasonable too!
Upon arrival we were greeted with a glass of cava and water, the staff were very friendly.
The room was more than adequate and Frankie had her own queen sized ‘cot’ (it was a pull out bed but massive for her) I was worried she’d start rolling but I surrounded with cushions/pillows and was fine. Also she had her own dressing gown (too big but nice touch. Our bed was huge and so comfy. The location was spot on, right in the heart of it and we had a nice view on the Main Street. Which did make it a bit noisy but I had ear plugs so didn’t bother me. The hair dryer was decent so ladies don’t need to take their own! The shower was the best we’ve had. We had stupidly forgotten toothpaste so when we opened the little goodie bags hotels offer now there were mini tubes of it! Along with spa like shower gels and shampoo that smelt amazing. The roof top pool was gorgeous and the views were fab. The pool was small and warm. It was great for March but can imagine in July it would be way too cramped. Can’t comment on the breakfast, we didn’t have it as was £20 each but were plenty of cafes so didn’t bother us. We somehow managed to leave our passports in the room and didn’t find out till check in at the airport so hotel arranged taxi to bring them to us!! Luckily had enough time! We were clearly a bit disorganised on this trip!",4,2020,03,15
61,"Brilliant hotel, perfect location","Just returned from a weekend break at the H10 Madison and what a find it was! A lovely, modern hotel with fabulous rooms and staff that made our stay feel very special indeed. Little touches like the welcome glass of Cava and biscuits in the immaculate rooms. A slight problem with a blockage in the shower was fixed within minutes and followed up later that night with a bottle of bubbly and chocolates waiting in the room.
The rooftop bar with plunge pool was the perfect place to spend an hour relaxing, looking out onto the 13th century cathedral.
Everything we wanted was within a 30-minute walk - cathedral, Sagrada, Marina and La Rambla was only a few minutes away. Lots of restaurants and tapas bars nearby completed the stay.
 We would  recommend H10 Madison to anyone wanting a first class hotel, with fabulous staff, in a perfect location.",5,2020,03,10
61,Great location; Excellent Hotel and rooftop pool!,We stayed 6 nights here and highly recommend this hotel. The room was comfortable and clean and the location was super: right by all of the great neighborhoods and restaurants of the Gothic Quarter; Born etc. Great to be by the Square where the airport bus leaves every few minutes as well - again walking distance. A quick metro ride to Part Guell. The hotel rates were very reasonable and the rooftop terrace and heated pool were extra bonuses - swimming in March was no problem! The staff at the front desk are very friendly but young - they need to be better trained on the area and recommendations for restaurants etc. - many did not know what restaurants I had  researched..The exception was Ruben - he was fantastic on recommendations and knew the area perfectly and was always ready to assist with anything. Great place and highly recommend! ,5,2020,03,07
61,Beautiful hotel & friendly staff,"We have spent 4 days in this gorgeous hotel.  The reception staff (Pedro if I remember well) was always smiling, helpful & friendly.  Each time you enter the lobby (be it from the elevator or from outside) you get a welcoming smile and ""Good afternoon"", ""Ola"", ""Good night"".   My partner is in a wheelchair and without having to ask (or having booked it) we have received an adapted room for people with disabilities, which I thought was very nice.    
The room was clean and spacious for a city hotel.  Even though we we located next to the elevator (which I personally do not like) we have not had any problems with noise coming from outside or the corridor.  The rooms seem very soundproof!  
Breakfast was included in our package, so there was a decent buffet and you could get ""A la carte"" dishes without any surcharge.  I like this idea of sustainability, this way eggs, bacon, waffles, pancakes, ... which have not been eaten will not need to be thrown away.   Breakfast also included freshly squeezed orange juice & cava.  A big thanks to the restaurant personnel (name I have remembered are Jesus & Judith) for making us feel welcome & remembering what we wanted to drink during breakfast :)  
The rooftop bar/swimming pool area was also very clean. Even though it was only end of February-early March, sitting there in the sun with a drink & some 'nibbles' was a nice way to end our stay there.  The personnel there was also very friendly!  They seemed surprised that we had folded the grey blankets & returned them to them after we had used them & that we had replaced the beds where they were (we had moved them to get some more sunshine :-) )   
The hotel is not cheap, but it's worth it's money.  
Maybe one little 'disappointment' We were there for my partner's 50th birthday (last november), it was passed on to the hotel by our travel agency & was on our hotel voucher - so maybe we had expected to get some drink in the room as little gift, but again, that's just a detail and will not affect the way we think about the hotel.",5,2020,03,04
61,Great location,"Super location, very clean, staff is super friendly.  Nice touch with champagne available in lobby.  Very reasonable rates.   Bathroom is sizeable.  Bed is great.  Roof top bar is fun and has great energy (better than Hotel Como).  ",5,2020,03,02
61,Second to none,"We booked the H10 Madison having read many of the reviews on here and we were not disappointed. We stayed in a classic double and it was big enough and as nice as it could have been. 

There were dressing gowns and slippers in the room along with not only good quality toiletries, but a pack with toothbrushes, a razor, shaving cream etc. 

The breakfast was superb, with a good buffet of pastries, meats & cheeses (including iberico ham and manchego cheese), fruits, yoghurts, cereals and more. There is also a menu from which you can order a cooked breakfast, which was very nice. 

The rooftop bar & pool is a wonderful place to relax at the end of a busy day, with lovely views of the cathedral and across Barcelona. 

Lastly, and most importantly are the people. From check-in with Pedro on reception, through Jesus and Miguel behind the bar to Judith and Jesus (again!) at breakfast, none of them could do enough for you and everything was done with enthusiasm and a smile. 

I hope none of you take any notice of this review, because I want to be able to get back in next time we are in Barcelona. 

Oh, and the location in the Gothic Quarter is fantastic, less than ten minutes walk from La Rambla, and five minutes from the Barcelona Touristica hop-on, hop-off bus tour. Use the aerobus from the airport to Plaza Catalunya and walk the 7-8 minutes to this fantastic hotel (6 euros each). ",5,2020,03,01
61,Wonderful stay,"Happy to recommend this hotel.  Rooms were very nice, staff quite friendly, and excellent, excellent, location.  The rooftop was the best part, with drinks, views, and a simple food menu.  We had some live music as well, which I gather is a regular thing.  Everyone was super nice, and the price was very reasonable.  Great combo of location and price and delightful rooftop entertainment. ",5,2020,02,29
61,Hermosa,"We loved this hotel. It was clean. The price was reasonable. The staff very friendly . The terrace was gorgeous. The tapas delicious and the view spectacular.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone. It was first time there and it was a great vacation.",5,2020,02,25
61,Great hotel,"Friendly staff and great location.  It is close to the old town and many restaurants and shops are walking distance.  The amenities in the room are good, too.  We didn't have a chance to try the rooftop bar - next time!  ",5,2020,02,25
61,Nice hotel with firendly staff,"Nice and well-located hotel with extremely gentle and friendly staff. Rooms where clean and the bathroom was excellent. Breakfast was an all-time high!

61,Couple of days away,"What a fantastic hotel, lovely staff at desk & very helpful too was offered a glass of water or fizz while being checked in, got to our room & it was just stunning fresh flowers there, some wafer treats double shower with dressing gowns & slippers, on our second day one of the staff came to our room & gave us a lovely small box of chocolates which were just gorgeous, also u could sit in the foyer to have a read & you could help yourself to the drinks & nibbles there, there was a lovely restaurant. Can’t wait to come back as there’s still so much to do in this magical city",5,2020,02,23
61,Exceptional Hotel,"We stayed at the H10 Madison for 6 days while vacationing in Barcelona and we had a wonderful experience from the day we arrived to when we left!  The hotel is in the heart of the Gothic section which was a great location!  The hotel staff, especially Asier, Ruben and Naima were so welcoming, friendly and helpful!  Upon our arrival we we offered complimentary Cava which was also available in the lobby at any time for guests.  They also surprised us with complimentary cookies to celebrate Valentine’s Day.  The room was exceptionally clean.  The bed was so comfortable and the bathroom was beautifully designed with modern shower heads.  It was one of the nicest hotel bathroom I have ever seen!  The room was quiet and the temperature control was perfect.  They had a beautiful roof top terrace overlooking the cathedral with a heated pool!  I can’t say enough about our stay at this wonderful gem of a hotel and the exceptional staff!!

61,Brilliant stay ,"I can see why this hotel is top 10 in Barcelona. Whilst it is a 4 star hotel I think it is actually a 5 star hotel in terms or rooms, decor, rooftop pool and general service of all the staff. The location too is great. Having stayed all over the world I would 100% recommend this hotel. ",5,2020,02,20
61,Amazing Hotel,H10 Madison is an amazing little hotel in the heart of Barcelona. The staff are very helpful and personable. The room was clean and comfortable. The roof top pool/bar area is beautiful with the most amazing views. The location couldn’t be better. It’s walkable to great sites and wonderful restaurants. Couldn’t have chosen a better hotel!,5,2020,02,20
61,Loved this property!,"We were so happy with this property we are looking at staying at one or more of their other properties.

The room was beautifully designed (I am a professional designer so these things matter to me), the rooms are very quiet from both the street and the other hotel guests. 

The staff was fantastic! Helpful, professional, patient.

The roof deck with pool and bar is such a lovely discovery. 

Lastly, the location was wonderful, walking distance (for the physically fit) to almost everything!

61,Wonderful!,"H10 Madison was a delight.  The hotel was in a great location.  The room was large, clean and very well maintained.  Espresso and little treats in the room.  Water, candy and sparkling wine in the lobby.  Staff was always incredibly helpful. Highly recommend.  ",4,2020,02,19
61,Wonderful hotel - perfect location,We stayed at this hotel for 6 nights while touring in Barcelona.  Very helpful and efficient front desk.  Comfortable clean and quiet room.  Only downside was no fan or ventilation in the bathroom.  Excellent breakfast with wide variety.  Hotel is in easy walking distance to most sites & metro.  30 minutes by taxi to the airport.  Deserves every praise.,5,2020,02,15
61,"Excellent hotel, great location, amazing staff","This is simply an outstanding hotel with a superlative staff and a great location in Barcelona's Gothic Quarter. We stayed here for 6 nights. Our room was marvelous-- not huge, but certainly roomy enough-- with a very comfortable bed and a great shower. But what really sets this hotel apart is the friendly, attentive, and very professional staff. From the front desk to the rooftop bar to housekeeping and more, every hotel employee we encountered showed genuine interest in our comfort and happiness and could not have been more helpful. Barcelona is an incredible, magical city, and the staff at H10 Madison made our visit even more memorable. ",5,2020,02,12

Actually everything asked for was attended to with polite, warm effienncy.   
Rooftop area, brilliant with plunge pool temperature at 32 last week.  Should have taken swimwear.",5,2020,02,11
61,Thoroughly recommend ,"Spent 4 nights at this hotel, had been put into a basic room but they changed it when I pointed out we had paid for the best room. We had one with a small balcony and view of the Cathedral. Large superking bed which we always require. Comfortable. TV with many channels no English ones except news. Fridge nice and quiet, air con and heating unit. Modern large shower room. Excellent toiletries and super thick towels. Dressing gown and slippers which were handy for the pool. Staff were excellent, friendly and helpful. Glass of cava on arrival was welcome. 
Breakfast good selection, cava on the Buffett too. Good location walked a lot. But also took taxis which were cheap enough. 
Now to the crowning glory of this hotel. The rooftop. We had afternoon drinks up there, swam in the heated pool, marvelled at the views, morning coffee in the sunshine. Sunbathed, had lunch. It was truly the best spot, we were lucky to have 19-22 degrees so made full use of it. Towels are provided on the sun loungers. It had a lovely relaxing atmosphere. We recommend this hotel. ",5,2020,02,09
61,A perfect place to stay,"We've just spent 3 nights at this hotel in beautiful Barcelona and had a wonderful time. The hotel is in a great location, a short walk to the aerobus stop or the metro. In fact we walked everywhere, except to the Sagrada Familia, due to the fabulous central location. The hotel is modern, well maintained and smells lovely! It has the friendliest, most helpful staff. The bed was the comfiest thing I've ever slept in and our room, although fairly small, had everything we needed including a great view. Breakfast was delicious with plenty of choice. I really can't fault it and would definitely stay there again. ",5,2020,02,07
61,"Great location, excellent staff","Great location, very helpfully staff. Our room was very clean and modern. It had a nice view of the cathedral and the Main Street. Great location in the centre of Barcelona. We chose the breakfast with the room, the breakfast buffet offered Nero is cold options meats cheeses fruits croissants deserts. Plus you also order of the menus for hours options. I would highly recommend the breakfast option to start the day. ",5,2020,02,07
61,City tour,Great service! Great location. The hotel have opened pool and bar on the roof (with great view on Barcelona Cathedra) even on Fabruary. The breakfast is great! I strongly recommend this place! 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍,5,2020,02,04
61,Lovely experience,There is caring service and warm feeling during my stay. The location is perfect for most attractions in the old city area in 10-15 minutes walk. I will definite go for it for my next stay with H10. It is value for money and highly recommended.,5,2020,02,03
61,"Adorable, charming boutique hotel","I loved this little quaint hotel.  The room was nicely fitted- although my room was a handicapped access room and was quite short on floor space. Bathroom large and comfortable, and the bed was very good.  The location is exceptional, right in the middle of the gothic quarter.  Hotel restaurant was fantastic, service was warm and friendly, the food very tasty and fresh, and the ambiance was charming.  The hotel wasn't cheap, so it would have been nice to have a view from my room, but everything else exceeded my expectations.",4,2020,02,02
61,Wonderful hotel,"My husband and I stayed in this hotel for a week during a recent visit to Barcelona. It was a wonderful experience. The staff was so accommodating, the room was comfortable and immaculately clean, the breakfasts are lavish and delicious, the rooftop pool area is great for relaxing. it is well located and easy to get to all tourist locations. We loved it and highly recommend this hotel.",5,2020,01,30
61,Delightful hotel experience,"My husband and I recently spent a week in Barcelona and stayed at this hotel. We Had a wonderful stay. The hotel is very centrally located, close to everything but on a quiet side street, so one had the feeling of being away from the hustle bustle of the city. Our room was lovely, immaculately clean, comfortable, with Juliet balconies outside the floor to ceiling French doors, which added unexpected charm. The staff could not have been more helpful, the breakfasts were lavish and delicious, and the rooftop pool area was lovely and relaxing. We unreservedly recommend this hotel.",5,2020,01,30
61,Best place to stay,This was the best hotel to stay in in Barcelona because it was in such a great location Very central to the gothic center.  It was walking distance from any major attraction we were able to walk great distances and not even notice it and everything was within a small amount of euros can drive. The hotel is extremely clean the staff was very helpful and kind. Overall this was a great experience will definitely book at the hotel again.,5,2020,01,28
61,Sehr gut gelegen,"Very nice Hotel, staff is friendly, central location close to Ramblas. Rooms are nice and clean, sweets and water served everyday. Foot at the Restaurant was exellent.  Absolutely nothing to complain. I wluld book any time again. ",5,2020,01,22
61,"Amazing Hotel, Amazing Staff","We booked this hotel for our recent family trip to Barcelona after reading the many wonderful reviews. I honestly didn't understand how a hotel could be reviewed so highly so we gave it a shot. It was great! First, location is unbeatable. We walked everywhere.  Second, hotel itself is fabulous - boutique (about 7 floors), quaint, homey. The rooms are very nice and the bathrooms are clean and modern. Third, the staff is unbelievable. The front desk was always willing to help (thank you, Asier). I've never seen a waiter as happy and competent as Domingo every morning (and his colleague, Ravinder). And when we were stuck after the football game and couldn't get a taxi, we called Stan at the front desk who scrambled to find us a ride home. When he couldn't, he sent Abbas (hotel security) in his personal car to come get us. That is service! Whether you are with a family, a significant other or yourself, I would highly recommend the H10 Madison. No doubt I would stay there again.",5,2020,01,21
61,Nice central location in  Barcelona,"The H10 Madison is central to all the sights and sounds of this city particularly the Gothic Quarter.  Barcelona is pretty walkable too. Rooms were very efficient, and a welcome drink was offered in the bar to patrons.  It would have been nice to have breakfast included during our stay.",4,2020,01,17
61,Excellent hotel in heart of city,"After a recommendation from friends we stayed for 3 nights at this well appointed and convenient hotel using Secret Escapes.
This was our first visit to Barcelona and wanted to be handy for the main sites and this proved to be the case. The welcome was friendly even though it was near to midnight and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful throughout. The breakfasts were of a high standard and you could order you hot option. Beds were comfortable and the rooms very dark- a big plus point for restful sleep.
Overall, a lovely city matched by the hotel!",5,2020,01,16
61,Great hotel,"We stayed here for the weekend. The hotel is in a central location - we walked to the sagrada familiar (30 mins), and the beach/harbour (20 mins). There are plenty of bars, restaurants & shops nearby. The room wasn't huge - not as big as your average Premier Inn, but it was clean & comfortable with everything we needed. The rooftop plunge pool & bar was good. Our room rate included breakfast, there was plenty of choice & meat/fruit/bread was good quality. Our taxi from the airport was €30. Overall very happy & would stay again!",5,2020,01,13
61,Centrally located fantastic hotel with lovely roof terrace/pool,"I stayed here with my husband. A lovely 4 star hotel. Very professional staff. We had a room with a balcony. Smallish room but the bathroom was very spacious! The shower was very large and powerful! We had breakfast included and this was fantastic-continental breakfast and cooked to order with an extensive menu choices (bacon, sausage, eggs, beans, etc and pancakes and other sweet treats). The roof terrace not only had a fantastic views - Barcelona Cathedral and Sagrada Familia but it also had a pool. I had a swim as it was heated. ",5,2020,01,12
61,Winter couple’s getaway,"Great advice trip advisor! H10 Madison was just right for a couple’s 3 day getaway in Barcelona. Welcome in English and super friendly Front desk staff. Room clean and totally comfortable. Bathroom modern nice design and clean. Bar staff and restaurant comfortably stylish, but we didn’t choose to eat hotel, if you know what I mean. This is a hotel you can book without fear. it met all our expectations.",5,2020,01,12
61,Second time around,"Stayed here for our second trip to Barcelona. It’s excellent. Staff are engaging, breakfast is outstanding, some rooms are bigger than others and we had a bigger one and it was perfect. The proximity to the cathedral and main square is so close and restaurants and La Rambla are easy walks. Couldn’t be better. ",5,2020,01,11
61,Amazing! ,"The hotel is amazing, excellent service and location, large rooms - get the classic cathedral, complimentary cava on arrival. Nothing more to ask for. Would recommended this hotel for anyone looking to stay in the heart of Barcelona but away from the noise of La Rambla. ",5,2020,01,09
61,WOW!,"Celebrated my 68th Bday at Madison. Arrived around 9 am after cruise and got our deluxe room immediatly. Most quiet and absolutly beautiful large well designed room.
Roof top area is great to relax and enjoy the view while enjoying a cocktail. Staff very accomodating and enjoyed the bubbly offered in lobby. Best location, 5m to the Ramblas, Place Catalan and bus to airport. Close to major sites (Catedral, Palau de Musica).",5,2020,01,08
61,Best Hotel to stay in Barcelona,"Great location, great staff, fair prices, great rooms !  Our favorite place to stay in Barcelona!

Walking distance to the Cathedral, Placa Catalunya, Las Rambla, in the heart of the Gothic neighborhood!

The rooms are great and the hotel quite new ! 

Definitely our place of choice in Barcelona ! We will be back !",5,2020,01,08
61,Just what i needed,"Ok as with all my points theres good and bad! First the bad... we booked through Expedia and included flight transfers.  Finding the desk at the airport was hard work and not very clear ,then the driver dropped us off at another hotel telling us we had to walk the rest of the way to our hotel, what makes it worse is as we fly home on a Sunday nobody seems to know where we need to pick him up from so looks like we will get a cab . Breakfast at the hotel is €24 each so we gave it a miss and went to the local cafes and starbucks which is on the corner , we also gave the hotel restaurant a miss as we thought it may be just as expensive!  However we were wrong as the prices seemed very good. And thats the bad points ,and so to the good points..... location is great walking distance to alot of the sights ,staff are all very helpfull and friendly and as for the room number 309  its 9/10 the bed was enormous and very comfortable the room was clean and tidy with all the usual, except a kettle ... it did have a coffee maker but its no good if you fancied a cup of tea . On the roof is a small pool and roof terrace with a bar and plenty of seats and sun loungers.At night theres very little street noise to a good nights sleep is to be had. Would i stay here again....oh Yes ",5,2020,01,05
61,Excellent Hotel,"Have been to Europe many times, by far this hotel is the best one I have stayed in Europe. We were offered a room with balcony with street view, everything ended up perfect, and we were satisfied with our 4 nights stay. Best location, coolest amenities, captivating decoration, professional and friendly customer service, good breakfast, above all, close attention to every detail. There might be several prestigious hotels in Barcelona, IMO, if this hotel could top other famous ones, it would be its rooftop boasting swimming pool and panoramic city view. if you look for best hotel near Gothic Quarter, this is the one for you.",5,2020,01,04
61,Great friendly Hotel in the centre,Just returned from a new year break to this wonderful hotel. It is in a very Central area near the cathedral with  lots of restaurants nearby .The hotel has a rooftop swimming pool which is heated all year and overlooks the streets below also you can have drinks and food on the rooftop when we stayed there it was cold 11 c but the heaters provided enough heat to be pleasant as for the rooms they are truly gorgeous with high end fittings and fixtures however my only criticism of the hotel is in the room. Because of there perfection to get it right they have missed a few little details .One no where to hang your coats and two you will need a degree to work the coffee machine for first time. This is my only grip and a special mention has to go to the breakfast staff all of which were more than professional and attentive .The breakfast was very good too with an array of traditional bacon eggs etc to cakes and so on .As for the reception staff no complaint here always on the ball and a good knowledge of the area and hotel .would I stay again oh yes .would i seek it out above the hundreds of hotels in Barcelona yes i would well done staff,5,2020,01,02
61,Great Hotel,"Love this hotel, great location, helpful friendly staff. The rooftop bar and views are awesome.  Walking distance to the Cathedral and the Gothic district. Planning another Barcelona visit and will definitely stay there again.",5,2019,12,31
61,Beautiful New Property,"I stayed three nights at H10 Madison in late November and early December 2019. My stay was fantastic.

The welcome drink of cava was quite nice. The common areas of the hotel is modern, new, and fresh, as are the rooms and bathrooms. The amenities were well stocked and always replenished. The evening turn down service with the chocolate was a nice touch. Plus the room had a ceiling fan and A/C that worked amazingly!

Though I had little interaction with the staff, they were always friendly and seemed happy.

My only ""complaint"" is that the staff should have informed me of a marathon/race that passed by the hotel and blocked one of the main roads. I had to change plans one morning as I could not cross the road.

All in all, though, I would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,12,29
61,"Wonderful, new hotel in a great location","Our family of 4 loved our 3 nights in Barcelona at H10 Madison! We had 2 rooms which were quiet, very clean and nicely decorated! The hotel is really very new! Our rooms (while a little small) were a great place to relax after a day on our feet wandering around the beautiful city! The bath products smelled heavenly! There were many great touches which made our stay much more comfortable like water bottles replenished daily, local cookies and cava as a welcome drink, slippers, bath amenities and chocolates at night! The staff was really the best aspect of the hotel- Asier, Pedro and Glenn really went above and beyond in making us feel welcome and at home! Their recommendations for restaurants and sightseeing were excellent! The rooftop deck also had great views of Barcelona! ",5,2019,12,29
61,Probably One of the Best in Barcelona,"This was our first visit to Barcelona, so we were concerned about where to stay. This hotel had a great review on blogs and Trip Advisor due to its location and the reputation of the hotel. We took a cab from the Easyjet terminal and it took about 45 min in traffic (it was half that on the return trip) for about 50 Euros (4 of us). Make sure you have the address ready for the cab driver to plug in. H10 Madison is in the Gothic District where we wanted to be. The hotel is clean with an excellent staff. If you make a reservation online, join their club at no cost and you will have a glass of wine for each person on arrival day. We chose a little larger rooms so we had a king bed and a couch in our rooms. The standard rooms are smaller. The bathrooms are modern and clean and have a walk-in shower with a toilet closet. Most of the employees speak enough English that you can communicate. There is a rooftop outdoor pool and bar with a great view of the surrounding area. Even in December it is warm enough to sit up there and look out. The front lobby is small but clean. They always have water and some bubbly drinks available. There is a small coffee maker in your room. This hotel was a great stay for us. I don’t really recommend the hotel breakfast since it is pricey and you can find so many great meals near you.  For a small breakfast with Americano coffee we hit some of the local shops.  ",5,2019,12,23
61,Great Hotel,"I stayed there for 8 nights with my family. The hotel is very well located near Barcelona Cathedral which hosts Christmas Market in December. We arrived at the hotel at 9am after 15 hours flight. Although there is no shower facility, the hotel arranged for us to shower at a gym about 10 minutes walk from the hotel. This is great for us to start our trip. There is a great churros place just opposite of the hotel which always has a long queue. There are plenty of restaurants and supermarkets nearby. The top floor terrace is great with the view of the cathedral and Sagrada Familia. The room is nice with cathedral view from the balcony. The breakfast at the hotel is great with lots of choices to choose from. Very very happy with the hotel and services. ",5,2019,12,21
61,Mom’s 75th Birthday!,"Great Hotel, Great location!  The hotel is beautiful. We had a Jr. Suite. It was still fairly small compared to America but it wasn’t a problem. The hotel is very beautiful and it’s within walking distance of so many things. The Hotel staff was always friendly and helpful. We would definitely recommend!!!",5,2019,12,16
61,A lovely base,"I'd absolutely recommend the H10 Madison. It was a comfortable, welcoming hotel in an excellent location. The rooms were spotless, spacious and quiet and the staff was polite and helpful. Would stay there again!",5,2019,12,14
61,"Excellent location, professional services and beautiful property","We stayed at the H10 Madison Hotel in Barcelona for five nights in November.  The hotel location is within 5-15 minutes walking distance to Barcelona Cathedral, La Rambla, Arc de Triomph, Casa Batllo, Casa Mila, and El Born district. La Sagrada Familia is a little bit further away so we took the taxi, which only cost 7 euros.   The property is modern, exceptionally clean, and beautiful.  There is a nice roof top terrace where you can relax while enjoying a drink and tapas.  The hotel lobby had complimentary water, cava and chocolate which was a nice bonus. Our room provided a peek at the Barcelona Cathedral and had all the modern convenience that made our stay a wonderful experience.  The best part was the staff.  Everyone including the front desk, the restaurant and the bar staff was helpful, professional and courteous to us.  We highly recommended the H10 Madison!",5,2019,12,11
61,Wonderful hotel,"My wife and I stayed at this beautiful hotel and we could not be happier. We had reserved at a separate hotel that was also in Gotic quarter but in looking through the reviews, it was clear that H 10 was significantly better rated - the reviews were right on point. Upon arriving they had a glass of champagne for me and my wife, the front desk was happy to accommodate a last minute upgrade. The room was very spacious, clean and felt like home. The cleaning staff is superior and the proximity to the Cathedral was amazing. The terrace is breathtaking- we have recommended this hotel to friends that are planning their trip to Barcelona. Absolutely loved it!!! ",5,2019,12,11
61,Lovely hotel and staff,"Spent 3 nights at this hotel and I have to say it was a very pleasant stay. 

The hotel room was nice and clean. 

The staff was also very friendly and helpful.

We had breakfast included with our room and there was selection of delicious food available to us.",5,2019,12,10
61,Beautiful Hotel -- Beautiful City,"Wonderful hotel in a great part of the city.  Great room -- very comfortable with all the amenities.  Very attentive staff.  Roof top bar is a real plus -- terrific view of the city, especially the old cathedral.  Only negative -- no fitness center onsite.  Nevertheless, we clearly would stay again!",5,2019,12,08
61,Great location in Gothic Quarter,"We stayed here only two nights, but we’d come back in a heartbeat. Staff was super friendly and helpful; they gave great recommendations and were accommodating with our schedule. Beautiful rooms. On the small side, but totally comfortable for a couple. Bathroom was nice size with rain shower head. Beautiful  small balcony where we could see the top of the cathedral. Very clean. Highly recommend. ",5,2019,12,08
61,Good accomodation,"Took a chance that there would a room available for us. Was the best choice ever.
The location is straightforward.
Complimentary breakfast is more than sufficient.
Polite staff and always helpful.
Free fast 24/7 internet, tea and coffee is highlighted.
The English tour guide we asked from the hotel was excellent.
Rooms are big and quiet.
We would certainly stay again if we come back.",5,2019,12,07
61,The Best Hotel We’ve  ever stayed in,"Check in easy and fast.  Plus a suggestion if you‘d like some sparkling wine.  Why not!  We were there with our two son’s and their families.  The hotel put us all right next to each other without us even requesting it.  Beautiful rooms, the best beds we’ve ever slept in, in a hotel. The babies room had a special bassinet for the baby and the 3 year old had a special bed as well.  Crayons on the room for the 3 year old.  Who else does this?  No one in my personal and business travels has ever done this.  If you go to Barcelona, stay here.  ",5,2019,12,04
61,Front staffs including the manager are hopeless,"I would recommend at least a hotel with standard level of hospitality.

After breakfast I dropped in the front desk and asked for checking the safety box in my room since it seemed out of order.

The staff asked me if I was going directly back to my room and I said Yes.   He said he would send their technician later on, but he did not show up for 2 hours.

Then when I talked to the front staff, he looked clearly forget and said “can I help you?”

After I explained to him he seemed just remembered and again said when were you in your room?.  Even I asked how long it will take, he just said he would check.

When he noticed I was upset, he said he would come.  Just 5 seconds to fix the security box using like a master key with no apology.

He insisted he was just waiting a call when I went back to my room : )   Terrible lie. He was watching me getting on the elevator after breakfast and it was him asking if I was going back to my room so that he could send his technician.

The manager has been just repeating excuses from him even if his terrible lie which even elementary school kids cannot believe was logically failed.  

Acting like robots with lies. It is the worst. Worse than just lack of hospitality.  Just dishonest.

The owner and the directors should check the recruitment process and learn what are hospitalities.

PS:  The staff said to me in the elevator “tell me if you want me to fix or not”.   I could just laugh. It was totally a joke. : )",1,2019,12,04
61,Perfect place to stay in Barcelona,"What a treat to arrive in Barcelona and to be greeted with a glass of cava and a friendly front office girl. Everything about our stay was fantastic.  We got 2 drink coupons which we used at the rooftop bar.  The view from there was incredible and the pool was clean and warm.  Our room was so comfortable and spacious (it was a corner room).  Everything about this hotel from the kind, friendly and professional staff to the comfort of the room was everything we could have asked for in a hotel. ",5,2019,12,02
61,The best customer service ever!  5-STAR," I arrived early (11am) for a one night stay and my room was immediately available.  Complimentary glass Champagne and beverages offered at check in.   Due to my own mix up, the hotel has been holding for over three weeks a suitcase I had advanced - and it was located straight away

Following morning I missed breakfast because I left very early for Black Friday sales.  Altho the restaurant was closed when I returned, the staff there offered me pastries and coffee at no charge.   Additionally the front desk provides complimentary postage stamps for all outgoing letters/postcards, as well as printing of documents and boarding passes, etc.

I left my laundry that afternoon and departed for a three-night stay in Florence.  Upon (again, early return) my laundry and the bags I had left in order to travel light were waiting for me in my room.  Check out is at noon- super convenient .   Excellent location and every possible wish fulfilled.

Only one criticism.  Rooftop dining offers “nachos” which I, and another American party both ordered.   Unfortunate these are not “nachos” as we know them.  Simply good tortilla chips with a mediocre guacamole.- margueritas somewhat so-so as well  but overall a fabulous experience.  Only wish a bathtub was availablev",5,2019,12,02
61,Gorgeous Hotel,"This hotel is beautiful, with spacious rooms and friendly staff. They went above and beyond to accommodate our needs. The hotel is centrally located and had an incredible view. It added to our incredible time in Barcelona.",5,2019,11,29
61,We will be back !!!,"So this was a last minute trip to Barcelona for the 1st time and we picked this hotel after reading all the great reviews.

ITS all true , great staff , great location, great rooftop with pool it was so good , the small parts I did not like was the price off drink at the bar and rooms where a bit small , big plus was the free cava at the front door , thanks again h10",4,2019,11,27
61,Great Hotel,"The H10 Madison has a great location in the center of Barcelona.  It’s very walkable.  The lobby is not large, but it is well appointed.  There is a restaurant and bar off the lobby and a rooftop bar and lounge area with an excellent view of the cathedral and skyline.  The Gaudi cathedral is also visible in the distance.  We stayed in room 704, a junior suite, that was very comfortable.  The bathroom has a 2 person double rainwater shower that was very mych appreciated.  You won’t go wrong staying here.",5,2019,11,27
61,AWESOME boutique hotel with amazing staff & lovely rooftop bar!,We absolutely loved our stay at the H10 Madison Hotel in Barcelona! We traveled with an 18-month-old and the staff could not have been more friendly or accommodating! The room set up was perfect for our needs and we loved hanging out on the rooftop bar. It is in a perfect location - walkable to so much of what Barcelona has to offer.,5,2019,11,22
61,Perfection,"Everything about our stay at the H10 Madison was perfect. The location, the styling and decor, the extremely friendly and efficient staff, the comfortable accommodation, the rooftop bar with view of the Cathedral, the delicious breakfast .... we loved staying here.  ",5,2019,11,20
61,Fabulous small hotel,"Great area, near everything.  Walk to the cathedral.
Great staff, helpful and accommodating.   Rooms were spotless and bathrooms were great. (Waterfall showers etc.).   The rooftop patio has wonderful view and has a pools as well as a dining area.  Great place for evening drinks.
Could not be happier with this choice of hotel.
Congratulation to the management for maintaining such a high level hotel.   Try to get the rooms on the second floor with the Juliette balconies with the view of the cathedral.",5,2019,11,19
61,Great everything ,Super convenient location just inside the Gothic Quarter. Hotel was very clean. Staff super friendly & helpful. They made a great impression by remembering both mine & my Mom’s birthday. I would definitely stay here again. ,5,2019,11,17
61,The Best Hotel Experience in Years,"We were greeted in the lobby with champagne both when we arrived and also when we checked out. The staff at the front desk are wonderful, helpful, cheerful and enjoyable. We stayed here one night before a cruise and 2 nights after the cruise. We mentioned that we liked our last room so they offered the same room for our second visit. The hotel is spotless, the shower is huge, modern and spacious and the rooftop bar and staff are wonderful. It was chilly so they seated us next to a heater and brought cozy blankets to keep us warm. It did the trick and we had a lovely time. It was the best service I've had in 30 years of travelling.",5,2019,11,14
61,Delightful boutique hotel in the Gothic Quarter,"We very much enjoyed our stay at the H10 Madison, one of the newer hotels in the H10 chain. The room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. Drinks at the rooftop bar was a wonderful way to unwind after checking in following a long travel day. The staff was delightful and helpful, with plenty of recommendations for places to eat and things to see. The hotel's central location, just one block from the Catedral de Barcelona and a short 7 minutes to Place de Catalunya, made it easy for us to explore the back alleys and passageways of the Gothic Quarter. We can't wait to return.",5,2019,11,12
61,High-Touch Hospitality,"I usually stick with larger “chain” hotels for consistency-even though they may not always be the best. I’ve never stayed at an H10 but this was a great experience. It felt like a boutique hotel with large scale accoutrements. The staff was outstanding in every sense-making dinner reservations, serving cava at arrival, a phenomenal roof top bar, and even high marks for cleaning the room. For sure, H10 is on my new list of hotel chains. ",5,2019,11,11
61,Ideally situated hotel,"Four of us stayed for three nights  weekend.   location, a lot of popular areas of notoriety in walking distance and plenty of eateries locally.

We loved he rooftop bar which had heaters and lovely soft blankets to keep you warm.  

Our room was small but well equipped.  Lovely large bath towels and nice toiletries.  Also plenty of fresh water replaced every day.  We used housekeeping a few times and the service was prompt and efficient.

Breakfast was superb.  Plenty of selection for everyone and could be washed down with a nice glass of Cava.  The Cava and sparkling water was also in reception during the day.

One slight disappointment was that we asked for a double room but had two single beds pushed together, which is not so easy to sleep in.

The staff were very helpful and we would definitely consider staying here again.",4,2019,11,11
61,"Comfortable, classy location in the heart of Barcelona","I stayed at the H10 Madison for 2 nights, and found the property to be pleasantly stylish, modern, and comfortable. They greeted us with a welcome glass of cava when we arrived, and check-in was really easy. We proceeded to our hotel room, which had a small balcony overlooking the street with a nice view of the cathedral. The bathroom had an awesome double shower and convenient amenities (robes, slippers, etc.)

Be sure to check out the bar on the roof! ",5,2019,11,11
61,Wonderful Hotel,"We have just completed a two day stay at the H10 Madison.  We decided to stay here between a river cruise and sea cruise because of all the wonderful reviews.  We were not disappointed as the hotel lived up to everything we read in the reviews. The staff was welcoming, friendly and helpful.  Our room was on the first floor (2nd floor for Americans).  It was spacious and quiet with a comfortable bed.  Great shower and amenities.  There was a zippered “comfort bag” with razor, toothpaste and toothbrushes etc).  There were also plush robes and slippers.  A Nespresso machine with little cookies was a treat!  On arrival there were some sweet treats in our room and the following day 2 pieces of chocolate.  Also there was “help yourself” cava, water and little candies in the well appointed reception area.  The hotel is located in a great location, only a block from the historic Barcelona Cathedral. The best feature, however, was the wonderful view from the rooftop bar.  It was chilly, but not to worry as the hotel supplied plush blankets you could wrap yourself in as you watched the beautiful sky at sunset.  We highly recommend this hotel and will stay here again if we are ever in Barcelona!",5,2019,11,09
61,Very convenient location and a very nice hotel,"This hotel was perfect and I wish we could have stayed longer!   The location was great, very near everything.  The room was perfect as well.   Beautifully appointed with a very comfortable bed.   Would definitely stay here again when in Barcelona.",5,2019,11,05
61,Awesome hotel,"Our 3 families stayed here for one night before our cruise.  Can’t say enough good things about this hotel - lovely rooms, perfect location and fantastic service.  My 10 yr-old daughter really appreciated the birthday treats delivered to the room.  Recommend without hesitation!",5,2019,11,03
61,Excellent location,"Stayed here last weekend fabulous hotel staff so welcoming and obliging
Room comfortable with really nice bed and pillows for once
Rooftop bar is a welcome distraction from the current troubles and again staff there excellentoverall would definitely recommend and return 
Breakfast included and wide choice    Cooked options great",5,2019,10,31
61,Excellent Hotel and Location,"We stayed here 4 nights and loved the location in the heart of the Gothic Quarter. When we arrived our room was ready and we were offered a glass of cava as we checked in. The room was quiet, with good black out shades, comfortable linens, fluffy towels, robes and nice toiletries. The rooftop bar was a perfect place to relax with a coffee or drink and enjoy the view. We stayed in late October, when there were some marches/protests but never felt uncomfortable or unsafe. We would stay here again in a heartbeat the next time we are in Barcelona.",5,2019,10,30
61,"Very fine hotel, good value.","My wife and I spent five nights at the H10 after completing 120 kilometers of hiking on the north coast.  Getting there from the airport was easy (Aerobus then a short walk) and the location was exceptionally convenient to multiple metro stops as well as walking distance to a number of important attractions.  There are hundreds of restaurants in walking distance, including some truly fine ones in the Gothic quarter.  Bets were exceptionally comfortable, the multilingual staff was warm and very helpful (mostly making restaurant reservations), and the rooftop bar was a lovey place to unwind.  A bottle of Cava on ice at the front door  provide a pleasant touch.  Sound insulation is good; it's worth adding that we stayed during some tumultuous but peaceful demonstrations centered about  25 meters from the hotel, but the sound insulation was such that we were not bothered and the entrance is located just around the corner from the main street so that if you wanted you could come and go without even encountering the events.  (We didn't do that, but walked alongside to try to understand better the sociopolitical events of the time--no problem).",5,2019,10,29
61,Great location ,"We really enjoyed being in the heart of the Gothic Quarter.  So many great restaurants and bars within walking distance.  The staff is lovely and always there to assist.  The rooftop bar is a nice place to have a drink with beautiful views over the city.  The breakfast was pretty good.  There’s continental available as well as cooked items for order.  
We stayed in a junior suite, which is a bit of a misnomer.  The size was really more of a studio even by European standards.  The room was very clean and the bathroom modern.  The couch in the room looked worn and was extremely uncomfortable.  But overall, a nice stay and would recommend this hotel.  ",4,2019,10,25
61,Wow,"When we were trying to select a hotel in Barcelona, H10 Madison always came up in many different travel sites as an excellent hotel. We were a little sceptical, could this hotel really be that good? The short answer is yes!

Our room was ready when we arrived, it was clean, attractively decorated, had robes and slippers and even delicious welcome cookies. In the lobby, we were offered flutes of sparkling wine. This hotel really understands customer service. 

The location of the hotel is fabulous. There is great shopping nearby and most attractions are within walking distance. Every staff member at this hotel was knowledgeable, helpful and kind. 

While we were waiting for our taxi in the lobby of the hotel to connect with our cruise ship, Mathieu, grabbed our suitcases and told us to follow him to the street. There was a protest going on and a large police presence that was causing traffic disruptions. Mathieu made sure we were able to flag down a taxi and make it to the terminal on time. Thank you, Mathieu!

What a terrific stay!

61,Perfect place to stay in Barcelona!,"Stayed an entire week.  Most of the compliments given by other reviewers were true.  It is in an excellent and safe location.  We walked everywhere during the day and in the evening.  The room is small when compared to American hotels but I've been in smaller.  We had a very small balcony with views of the Cathedral which was quite nice.  The street noise was extremely loud when the door was open, but we were surprised at how well the door was insulated (when it was closed you could not hear any of the outside noise).  The bed was comfortable and there were plenty of pillows.  They did have a small coffee maker in the room which we used daily.  We did not eat in their restaurant but did enjoy their rooftop bar and small menu almost every day.  There is a wait for drinks since sometimes everyone seemed to show up at once, but the views and atmosphere make it a pleasant wait.  We would definitely return to this hotel.",5,2019,10,19
61,Great location & accommodation,"Very helpful staff, booking sightseeing trips, recommending great restaurants. The location of the hotel was excellent, walking to many of the sights & shopping.
Hotel is located in a beautiful building in the Gothic area!",5,2019,10,18
61,Fanastic Place,"Five day break so four nights staying here and we would not have been more impressed. Room not ready as we were early and they were so courteous. Looked after our luggage, which was then placed in the room, and we had a first rate late lunch at the roof top bar ably looked after by Jesus - who was so friendly. The room was excellent - big beds, double shower, water every day, espresso machine and a well stocked fridge that we did not need to use. The hotel has a superb location near the gothic cathedral and easy walking distance to the water front. Probably the best hotel I have stayed in.",5,2019,10,18
61,Great Hotel - Fabulous Location,"We stayed at the Madison for 2nights pre-cruise. The hotel is new and modern. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped and had plenty of room.  The hotel staff were welcoming and very helpful. The roof deck with the bar and plunge pool was a bonus. And the breakfasts, which included a buffet and made-to-order breakfast items, were great. The location in the gothic quarter could not be beat. We were steps from the cathedral and good restaurants, and walking distance to La Rambla, the waterfront and other sights of interest. We highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2019,10,14
61,Top 1 per cent in Barcelona for a reason,"We were welcomed for our anniversary celebration with chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of sparking wine . Thank you. On the beautiful outdoor  roof top bar ,  the staff were special,  and became our buddies for the 4 days we were there.  The location was perfect , block from Barcelona Cathedral. This is an upscale hotel, in a subtle low
key manner though.  The lobby has that feel right when you walk in. Very nice rooms.  Bottom line there are 500 hotels in Barcelona and this hotel well deserved its top one per cent ranking.",5,2019,10,12
61,"Beautiful hotel, perfect location!","This hotel was awesome! Loved our room, especially the ceiling fan, I loved that thing! The hotel is an a perfect location, everything is close by and in walking distance (15-20 mins) to most sights. The roof top bar was beautiful, private and just a perfect place to wind down after a long day of sightseeing. The pool is quite small but nonetheless very nice. They also gave us a free bottle of Cava along with chocolate covered strawberries and cake in honor of our 5 year anniversary, which was very nice of them. If I find myself in Barcelona, I will definitely be staying in this hotel again!",5,2019,10,09
61,"Ok, not great.","I recently stayed at this hotel, it is clean, the rooftop pool area is great and the room was a decent size. 

I've reduced the rating as I think the property is poorly managed. My husband and I were booked for a one night stay - we booked over a month in advance giving the property ample time to notify us via email or phone about any issues with entering or exiting the hotel due to a major event. They did not do this. A major event was taking place shutting down several roads in the city - this is by no means the hotel's fault and there is nothing they could have done to prevent it however, they could have planned/managed supporting guests getting their bags into/out of the hotel. Instead, we were told that if we did not leave by 2PM the day we checked out that we would have to walk, with all of our luggage, over 25 minutes to a square to meet a taxi and that all arriving guests had to do the same thing to get to the hotel. They said they would not call a taxi to meet in this spot and that no member of their team would assist with transporting luggage. We found out via a printed letter on the door hours after checkin.  I've worked dozens of major events with hotel partners in Toronto (TIFF, Fashion Week etc.) and have never heard of a hotel not making some type of arrangement to support guests entering or leaving the property. 

I would imagine their management team will comment on this denying not offering assistance or saying it was out of their control. But please do keep this in mind when booking there - they won't inform you of things like this in advance and they will provide support once there. I have stayed at several other properties in Barcelona and would recommend them over this hotel.",2,2019,10,07
61,"Perfect location, wonderful staff","We loved our stay at the H10 Madison near the old cathedral in Barcelona. The rooms were spacious and modern. The roof top bar was private for hotel guests only, which meant that we could always find a spot to sit and drink our wine or have one of their tasty tapas snacks. The pool was lovely and the view was terrific-although I wish it faced the sunset:) I would stay at the hotel again for sure.",5,2019,10,07
61,Wonderful hotel,"We spent a couple of nights here on a city break and could not fault the hotel. The staff were so welcoming and helpful, giving a really personal service. The hotel is superbly situated in the Gothic quarter so wandering out and exploring was so easy. It's also close to the main city square making it easy to explore the rest of the city by metro or the hop-on / hop-off buses. 

The decor of the hotel is very stylish, contemporary and yet comfortable. We had a standard room overlooking the street with a small balcony. Really well appointed with a good bathroom and large shower. 

On the roof can be found a bar, sun loungers and a plunge pool, the perfect place for an afternoon in the sun, or early evening pre-dinner drinks, with great views over the city. 

This is a fantastic city hotel and I would have no hesitation in recommending it. ",5,2019,10,06
61,Great location and value for what we paid,"Located right by the Gothic Quarter you can't beat the location. We are greeted with champagne and friendly reception staff. Lobby is very small but hotel is very nice. The room is small but layout is excellent and spacious.
Bathroom is tight for two people but well appointed.

Pros:
Location
Clean
Nice room and okay for two people

Cons:
small bathroom
little pricey compared to similar hotels we've stayed in",4,2019,10,05
61,Loved our Stay- Triple Room,"My family of 3 which included a 9 year old stayed 2 days before a cruise. We took a taxi here from the airport and check in was easy. Check in is not until 3 pm but our room was ready on arrival which was around noon. Perfect! The bed was comfortable and my daughter loved the size of the 3rd bed. We tried the rooftop bar for a drink but most of our time was spend visiting the many cafes nearby. If you need recommendations the front desk is your best option. We used them a couple of times for recommendations for places to eat. Also, when we checked out they called a taxi for us to get to to the cruise port. The taxi came in about 10 minutes. Location is perfect. We walked to Las Ramblas which took about 10-15 minutes and hailed a taxi to go to Sagrada Família from Las Ramblas as well. Would definitely stay again.",5,2019,10,04
61,Lovely hotel in convenient location,"The H10 Madison Hotel is well situated on the edge of the Gothic Quarter, very near La Seu cathedral.  It is within easy reach of two metro stations, bus stops and a taxi rank.

The hotel is new and modern.  The reception area is attractive and the reception staff very helpful and friendly.  Our room was beautifully decorated in modern style and there was a huge bathroom with double shower.  Everything was sparkling clean.  The bed was large and comfortable and the towels were changed every day.  There was a little balcony but with only a view of the back of an apartment  building.  There was a coffee making machine and complimentary bottles of water were provided every day.  There is a roof terrace with bar and a small swimming pool.  The service here was very good and there are stunning views over the roof-tops to the nearby La Seu and to the more distant Sagrada Familia.

We did not have breakfast in the hotel as this was rather expensive, but there were several good cafes nearby.

One little complaint: one day our room was not made up until 4pm which was rather inconvenient, but apart from that everything was perfect.",5,2019,10,02
61,Will Definitely Return,"For starters , we received unexpected upgrade to largest room type in the hotel. Bright contemporary decor with lots of room including dual head shower. Breakfast menu offered very wide selection in a very attractive setting. Quite a few guests were enjoying the rooftop patio bar. Will definitely stay here again!!!",5,2019,10,02
61,Great location in the Gothic quarter,"This hotel is very conveniently located in the gothic quarter.  It’s within walking distance of most sites and close to restaurants and shops.  The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly.  

The pool is on roof so it gets very hot during the day.  I didn’t actually use the pool for this reason but others seemed to enjoy the area.

Room service was great for a quick bite before or between site seeing.  The rooms and bathroom were a good size and very clean.

I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2019,10,02
61,Excellent,"Wonderful room perfectly located in Gothic district. Best part is the excellent rooftop bar and small pool. Great drinks and snacks, we spent a lot of time there as the views are stunning. Hotel staff excellent. We did not take breakfast as it was very expensive and there are many excellent options close. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,10,01
61,Convenient location!,"Convenient location, clean and fresh rooms. They are on the smaller side although. Excellent breakfast and breakfast personal, they were very attentive!Excellent terrace with beautiful views.
Reception OK. Polite in answering questions. I have two different bookings for two consecutive nights, got an upgrade for one so I did not have to switch rooms. This was my 4th time staying at the hotel and the forth time that I have to ask for my welcome glass of champagne/drink. I saw being offered to other guest but for some reason it escaped me several times. It is not important but nevertheless no so pleasant, as a guest you love to be welcome and treated as other guests!",5,2019,09,25
61,Vibe of Barcelona,The location of the Hotel meant you were able to access many of the attractions from the port area (Barceloneta) to the Place de Catalunya. The hotel has a rooftop bar with a small but delicious food restaurant and the views are great especially at night. Our room was basic but offered everything we required for our short stay and staff was friendly and helpful. From this location it was an easy walk to the 2 main markets in Santa Catarina and La Boqueria(the busy and touristy one and great for lunch) and also the famous pedestrian street La Ramblas and the equally elegant street Portal de L’angel leading to the basilica of Barcelona.,5,2019,09,24
61,Excellent hotel,We stayed at this amazing hotel for one night pre-cruise. It is situated in a great area with lots of shopping and easy access to other nearby sights. We took advantage of the warm summer evening and had some snacks and drinks up on the rooftop which has a great view. The beds were very comfortable and the room was very clean. The bathroom was also very nice with a great shower. We were given complimentary bottled water in our room. We asked for a quiet room and weren’t disappointed. There were double doors in our room that opened and overlooked a small patio space for the apartments around the hotel. It didn’t bother us at all and added to the charm. The staff were also very friendly and helpful. We asked to leave our luggage while we killed some time in the Gothic Quarter before leaving for our cruise the next morning and the staff were very accommodating. They were also very helpful with suggestions about where to shop and eat. Tickets are also sold at the front desk for the Sagrada Familia cathedral if you’re looking for some although you can only purchase them once you are at the hotel. We wished we could have had a longer stay at this hotel. We hope to return again and would highly recommend this lovely hotel.,5,2019,09,23
61,"Lives Up To Its Billing, Delightful Place To Stay","The quality of the accommodations here fully lived up to their billing, the staff were very responsive and helpful, the breakfasts were excellent & the location in the Gothic District central & convenient for enjoying Barcelona.  The small pool on the roof and the bar that overlooked the Cathedral were a very nice addition to the experience.  I would recommend with no qualifications.",5,2019,09,21
61,Fantastic hotel in great location,"Recently enjoyed staying at this wonderful hotel, could not fault in any way, amazing, friendly, helpful courteous staff, and great location very close to the cathedral.  Cava on arrival :-)   Fantastic breakfasts.  I would definitely stay here again.  A special thank you to the extremely friendly and helpful concierge (sorry, I do not know his name but he was working on the morning of 19th Sept '19) who assisted us with our taxi to the airport.  I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,09,21
61,"Pleasant Stay, Perfect Staff!","We had a lovely stay at H10 MADISON!

We were greeted by Oriol with a cup of champagne and was the best and smooooooth check-in ever had! 

Our room wasn't ready but he made the effort to call us when It was. 

We stayed In the Clasic Barcelona which was fine!

The hotel is in such a great location, next to the Gothic Catedral and within walking distance from all the major attractions!

We'll be back if we visit Barcelona again.",5,2019,09,20
61,Wonderful hotel wonderful location,We found this hotel to have the best location in Barcelona for walking tours of the Gothic Quarter. The Hotel was very comfortable and the staff friendly and accommodating to my needs as a wheelchair user.,5,2019,09,20
61,Beautiful boutique hotel with grand views from the rooftop,"Hotel 10, Madison. We had booked this online a while back after looking at various options in the City. I was so glad we did. What a wonderful smaller, upscale hotel in the heart of the City. Our room was not ready, so we dropped our luggage off and headed to the rooftop bar/restaurant that had a pool and views of almost everything a tourist would want to see in Barcelona - the “bullet”; the Cathedral; the port (with our cruise ship still docked there - strange feeling); and other churches and historical buildings (o.k., I do not know the names of everything we saw but it was amazing).

We were hungry, so we ordered a burger at the rooftop café which we split along with water and a local beer. The view was great, the breeze was better and the lounging was the best. The food was fine - filled a necessary void - and the local beer was acceptable. Soon one of the hotel assistants brought us our key and said that our bags were all in our room - 312. Down to the room which was very nice - large king bed, big screen t.v., a little sitting area, a rather large bathroom with a rain-type shower (much the size of ours at home), and a balcony overlooking a little alleyway between our hotel and the office building/apartments next door. However, if you looked to the right off of our balcony, down the alleyway, one of the many Cathedrals housed in Barcelona was beautifully framed - like one would see in a painting.

Very helpful and nice staff.  Great overnight stay in this wonderful city.  Would recommend.",5,2019,09,19
61,"Great location, lovely staff","Our room was spacious and the pool area just perfect for relaxing. The location couldn’t have been better. We walked to the beach, Segrada Familia and we were a stone’s throw from Las Ramblas. Highly recommend ",5,2019,09,17
61,Awesome hotel!,"Everything from check in to check out was absolutely perfect! The sparking wine, chocolates and sweets on check in was a very nice touch. Our room even though was on the smaller size was light, bright and cheery with a nice view of the cathedral and a small balcony. The bed was the most comfortable bed we’ve slept in. The bathroom was beautifully tiled in marble with an amazing rain shower. And the rooftop bar and pool have the most beautiful view of the city. The hotel is located in a great location close to all the tourist sites. But what I was most impressed with is how attentive and professional the staff is. A day after checking out, I realized I had forgotten some souvenir bracelets I had purchased as gifts. I emailed the hotel and they immediately replied that they had found my bracelets in a bag I had left behind. Everything about H10 Madison was fantastic! We will definitely be staying on our next stay in Barcelona.",5,2019,09,16
61,Great Location,"Good location in the Gothic quarter very close to the Cathedral. Recently renovated building. Very clean room and common areas. Nice roof top patio area with small plunge pool. Very professional (and friendly) staff. Good main floor restaurant, which included breakfast (hot and cold items). The room was fairly spacious and our room included a small sitting area. Our hotel room was very nice; however, our hotel room had very limited closet and very limited storage space. Adequate size room safe in closet. The room was very quiet. Free bottled water in the room each day. We will return!!",5,2019,09,14
61,Superb Excellence in the Centre of Barcelona Gothic District,"The H10 Madison is a superb hotel in an absolutely great district. The front lobby is beautiful with examples of Picasso and great design. Front desk staff is excellent. Naime was super friendly and helpful, 10 gold stars for her The room we had was beautiful with great amenities and a deck out onto the street. The hotel has a terrace bar with a pool and looks out to the gothic cathedral and views to the Sagrada. Absolute calm and beauty up there. This is a stunning place to be. 5 star.",5,2019,09,13
61,Perfect location,"Stayed 3 nights with my adult daughter. The location is perfect, close to shops and the gothic quarter. The room was one of the more basic ones but it was fine and the rooftop bar and pool area was lovely. Would happily return. ",5,2019,09,13
61,A Great Choice in Barcelona,"This is a very well situated hotel that definitely deserves its lofty ratings. Rooms are well appointed and the staff definitely go the extra mile. Champagne and candies in the lobby are a nice touch.
Highly recommended!",5,2019,09,11
61,Extremely well located,"The location is ideal.  The staff are well trained and extremely friendly.  
The breakfast is overpriced.  The rooms although comfortable are also quite small.
The rooftop bar for a nightcap shouldn't be missed. ",5,2019,09,11
61,Great hotel Great location,"Highly recommend this quality 4 star. New and modern rooms in a beautiful old building. Very convenient location with easy walking distance to everything. Has shutters, quality windows and good blinds so you can shut the world out and get some rest after a long journey. Food and service was impeccable with the exception of the waiter at the pool. What a jerk. Enjoy!",5,2019,09,10
61,Great hotel and friendly staff ,"We are 3 generations of family travelling pre cruise on our first trip to Barcelona. 
This hotel did not disappoint. On arrival we were made very welcome as we were every time we passed reception, I honestly cannot remember the last time I experienced this in a hotel! With a smile and a hello. 
It’s a great location near the stunning gothic quarter, our balcony had a view of the cathedral. We walked to the marina, Ramblas and found taxis cheap when we went a little further. 
The breakfast is excellent and a great start to the day too. 
Highly recommend this hotel and hope to return again. ",5,2019,09,10
61,Very nice hotel and staff,"We stayed a 3 day weekend. Reception staff was very professional, friendly and helpful. The hotel is spotless and beds are very comfortable. I had only 2 items that could be improved. More hangers; there were only 5 for 2 people and the maid service timing could be improved upon. Our 2nd day we were gone from 8 am to 2:50 pm. The maid showed up at 3 pm and we asked her to come back at 3:30 because we would be gone. We left came back at 6 pm and the room was still not made up. The maid came at 7 pm but by that time she came back we were in for the night. No big deal for us but that could be improved. Would I stay at this hotel again?  Yes, definitely. The location is very central and although you can’t possibly walk to everything in Barcelona it was close to the main plaza, the cathedral etc. ",4,2019,09,10
61,Great location and good service,"In the heart of the gothic quarter, literally a stone’s throw from Barcelona Cathedral. Could not have been more central. Accommodation was comfortable and well appointed albeit appreciably a little cramped (given age, size and location of the buildings in the area). If I was lucky enough to go back to Barcelona I would gladly stay here again.",4,2019,09,10
61,Amazing Hotel and Friendly Staff,"We stayed here for just one night after our cruise. I expected a very good hotel based on the reviews I read but instead we got a great hotel! 
We arrived around 9:30 am and planned on dropping off our luggage before we headed off touring the city. We were surprised to find that our room was ready. We were treated by very happy and helpful staff and that continued for the duration of our stay. 
The hotel is very clean and our room was very spacious with a very comfortable bed. We enjoyed the rooftop terrace which has a great view of the Gothic Church. They make a very nice sangria as well! 
Later in the evening, we visited the lobby bar where Valentina and Miguel served us drinks and entertained us with their very friendly banter. What started out as a quick drink before bed, ended up with a much later evening with us socializing with people from around the world because Valentina and Miguel were so friendly and enjoyable to be around. When we returned to our room for the night, we found a special delivery of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries delivered to our room as my husband was celebrating a birthday. 
Checkout was easy and again we were met with more friendly staff. This was our third visit to Barcelona, each time staying at a different hotel. The next time we visit, we will definitely return to H10 Madison!",5,2019,09,08
61,Perfect hotel in the center of Barcelona,"Exceptional good food. Loved the Madison Burger 🤤
Super breakfast. The rooms are new and luxurious.
Best service from Valentina, Carla, Miguel, Andrea and Mingo!!!
Perfect location in the center of Barcelona.
Reception is very competent.",5,2019,09,08
61,"Great hotel, friendly staff","From the moment you drive up and the bellman is shuttling your luggage to the front desk, to the friendly and courteous front staff this is a super hotel.  

The hotel is centrally located and walking distance to just about everything.  

We had a corner room on the 6th floor and it was quite large. Nice small balcony and large bathroom.  Very clean and well maintained.  

This was one of the quietest hotels we have ever stayed at.  Although there is a lot street noise you could not hear any of it with the doors and windows closed.  AC worked great. 

Worth a stay if you are looking for a very nice hotel.  ",5,2019,09,08
61,An amazing stay to remember!,"We had a wonderful stay at the H10 Madison in mid August. The staff were all so welcoming and friendly and could not do enough for us during our 6 night stay. I must give a mention to Pedro who pulled off a special request involving an engagement proposal, the biggest surprise of my stay! The breakfast was plentiful, the Madison Porridge being our particular favourite. The rooftop pool and loungers are an added bonus as you can escape from the bustle of the city and the views are wonderful. We were really pleased with our room which was cleaned to a high standard everyday. We will not hesitate to stay at this hotel again and it has made us want to visit other hotels in the H10 chain. Thank you again for a wonderful stay, one we will remember for many reasons!",5,2019,09,07
61,Very satisfied with H10 Madison in Barcelona,"Every aspect of H10 Madison was excellent. We were there 8 nights (vacation) and I loved every minute of it. No criticism - constructive or otherwise.The rooms are large and the mattresses are very comfortable. The furnishings and decor is very attractive. The showers were great. The rooms were cleaned every day. I appreciated the lighting very much - made it great for reading and whatever else. The food in the restaurant for breakfast was excellent every day. The relaxing atmosphere on the roof was ideal for reading and relaxing. All of the staff were personable and helpful. I couldn't have been happier and would love to go back.
I would stay in another H10 hotel, no question.",5,2019,09,06
61,Great Hotel,"This is a great hotel if you are visiting Barcelona.  It's location is perfect and the staff friendly.
Room and bathroom were clean and fresh, although room service was a little late (after 4pm) the day after we arrived.  
Loved the rooftop views and pool but was disappointed by the service provided by the staff on the evening my friend and I decided to have a drink end our day.
There was lots of choice for breakfast and the staff friendly and attentive.
The hotel is within walking distance of lots of good places to eat, drink or just people watch.
Would definitely go back.",5,2019,09,05
61,A fabulous horel,"Stayed for two nights and had a great time. The hotel is lovely - clean with excellent amenities.  The staff are amazing, the roof top bar is just fabulous with amazing views.

61,Fantastic Hotel,"Extremely well located.   Modern yet classic hotel.  A retreat from the hustle of exciting Barcelona.  Easy checking with professional pleasant personnel.

61,The only place to stay in Barcelona. ,"I love this hotel. It’s the best one to stay in Barcelona.  Really safe area, great rooftop view and pool.  Beautiful balcony and views, including the Barcelona Cathedral.  The staff here is incredible, kind, helpful abd accommodating.  From the front desk  to the amazing staff at breakfast, they make you feel special, all wonderful people and service. We were welcomed with Champagne and water all day, everyday. Chocolates every night has been perfectly decadent. Beautiful clean rooms and clean marble bathrooms. Rooftop is one of the best parts.  Absolutely glorious!  We almost stayed at a large US style restaurant for our family size but it was off on its own on a peninsula.  Over here, everything is close by. Good food, shopping, entertainment (flamenco show at Palau de la Musica) , sites and views. ",5,2019,09,03

61,Great location and hotel.,"Fab hotel. Roof terrace a real bonus. 
Breakfast too pricey but so central that far better to have breakfast out anyway. Lovely views. Staff very helpful and friendly. 
Loved the double shower. 
Large comfy beds- even sofa bed wad a double. ",5,2019,08,31
61,Excellent Stay,"Spent six nights at this hotel.  100% satisfied.  Excellent location, professional and friendly staff, nice rooms, perfect breakfast.  Due to a flight cancellation we arrived a day late, but we had communicated with the hotel staff and they had the rooms available when we arrived very early the next morning. This is clearly a well managed hotel that has selected and trained an excellent staff.  The front desk staff and the breakfast room staff were all helpful and cheerful.  Highly recommend..",5,2019,08,29
61,One of the best hotels I have stayed in,"This is a fairly recently refurbished hotel in the heart of the Gothic quarter in Barcelona.
The location is ideal for exploring the city and the hotel is excellent.
we were greeted at reception with a free glass of ""champagne"" and this was available in the foyer permanently along with sweets and soft drinks.  The rooms were well furnished and hot drink facilities, water and chocolates include free of charge.  The bed was very comfortable, air conditioning and ceiling fan worked well in 30 degree temperatures.   Excellent bathroom with quality toiletries.
Reception staff were very friendly and helpful, booking taxis and advising on the city sights.
Overall one of the best affordable hotels we have stayed in.",5,2019,08,28
61,Pleasant surprise!,"We stayed here for 3 nights post-cruise and could not have been happier.  The check in was flawless and the desk staff all spoke excellent English and were so nice.  There was water, snacks, and Cava (Spanish ""sparkling wine"") at check in so such a good start!  I joined the FREE H10 club prior to arrival so I received free drinks (1 each for 2 of us) in the pool bar.  Our room was huge by European standards and the bathroom was great.  The shower had a dual head and could easily fit a basketball team in there.  The water pressure was great and the complimentary robes and slippers were a nice touch.  There were Nespresso machines in the room with complimentary coffee.  The bellman explained how to use it when he walked us to the room as well as mentioning that the bottled water was free and we could call for more. There was a mini-fridge with mini-bar but he specifically pointed out that this was an extra charge.  The toiletries were first class and abundant.  There was a nice small bag with extras such as sewing kit and razor.  This hotel was within easy walking distance of the Aerobus and the Cathedral.  La Ramblas was close as well.  The rooftop pool and bar were incredible.  The bar food menu was somewhat limited but the service and provided towels made up for it.  I would love to stay here again and will do so if I return to Barcelona.",5,2019,08,28
61,It's all true!,"All the great reviews I read about this hotel are not just hype. It is one of the best hotels my family and I have ever stayed in (2 rooms for 3 nights), and we are very picky. First, the reception staff who, to a person, were welcoming, friendly, and knowledgeable. Special thanks go to Pedro and a young woman with a light brown ponytail whose name started with N (sorry I didn't get her full name). They were patient with endless questions, funny, offered great suggestions for sightseeing and dining, and were just plain delightful. The standard room was a good size, clean, and had the most comfortable bed I've ever had in a hotel. The H10 Madison's location is perfect, literally down the block from the Cathedral and the concert hall, walking distance to many of the major attractions, and a two-block walk to the metro that takes you to virtually every other one. In mid-afternoon, after a full round of sightseeing, the rooftop bar and pool area is a welcome respite with a great view. While only a plunge pool, it is refreshing, the atmosphere is relaxing, bar service is prompt and friendly, and we never had a problem finding clean towels. Prior to this trip, we had never heard of the H10 brand, but given the experience the Madison offered us, I will always look for H10 first in my future travels. Thank you for a great start to a wonderful trip.",5,2019,08,27
61,"Great staff, super clean and fresh, rooftop adds a lot, super central","I stayed with my son in an interior room with a pullout couch. It was large and very comfortable for us to share. I'm a very light sleeper and we were on the 6th floor- I was worried noise would travel from above but it did not. It was super quiet. If you are sensitive to noise I recommend the interior rooms, as the main street would be pretty noisy to face. This hotel worked to delight us and the staff were really nice, all of them-- thank you Pedro as check in, but really everyone. Hardworking  and attentive. The rooftop is really nice to go up to-- great views but also quiet and peaceful, even when crowded, at least for us. Wait staff on the roof also super nice and hardworking.  Location is fantastic. I was worried about staying in a hotel chain I was unfamiliar with, but they were great and I'd definitely stay with them again here or at another one. Perfect stylish, clean and calm base for exploring the city.",5,2019,08,24
61,Great hotel in perfect location,"My husband, son and I stayed in the hotel for 3 nights and were really impressed. We booked a junior suite which was fine for us with our 13 year old sleeping on a sofa bed which he said was really comfortable. The bathroom was huge with a double shower and the towels and bathrobes were of really good quality as was the shower gel etc.  The complementary water and the coffee machine were very welcome and the mini bat was well stocked although we didn’t use it. The staff were so friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble and they made our time there more enjoyable as a result. We didn’t have breakfast as we prefer going to local cafes but we did go to the rooftop bar in the evening which was lovely. We got a taxi to and from the hotel which cost €40 and was worth it as the Aerobus would have cost nearly €20 for the 3 of us and it was a good 10 minute walk from where it would have dropped us off. Normally this would have been ok but we had large suitcases with us as we’d been on holiday the previous 10 nights and we would have struggled in the heat. We bought 2 day tickets for the hop on hop off bus from the hotel at €40 each which was a great way to see the city although if you know where you want to go/what you want to see, taxis are really reasonable and much quicker. There are lots of brilliant  restaurants in Barcelona and every meal we had was fantastic. We went to the Clubhaus (a modern mexican) which was a short cab ride away, the Sapporo Ramen (simple Japanese) and Arcano (more traditional Spanish) both within walking distance. We also went to the local market for tapas at lunch which was delicious. All in all we had a great time and would definitely stay in this hotel again and would now look to book with H10 when we go away in the future. ",5,2019,08,24
61,"Great Location, Beautiful Hotel, Service a Little Spotty","The location is very central and has a great view and access to Cathedral Square.  

The staff for check-in were very nice and helpful.  However, after check-in, only one time the rest of our entire stay ever say hello or welcome back when we came into the hotel.  The housekeeping staff on the other hand were extremely friendly and always said good morning and asked if everything was ok.  

The rooms are really wonderful - great size and amenties.  Comfy beds, large bathrooms (esp by European standards), bottled water and coffee.  Ceiling fans are a really nice touch and helps with keeping AC down.  We had a room with a small balcony which was great so you could sit and listen to the city. If you lean out you can see the cathedral. 

The rooftop pool is one of the main reasons we booked this hotel.  The view is amazing and the setting is beautiful and modern.  

The pool area does seems a little neglected as far as attention as there was only one time we went when they weren't out of towels..  Additionally, know that the bar/cafe is NYC priced which is not unexpected but the service there was extremely hit or miss.  I sat by the pool for and hour and 45 minutes one afternoon while my son was swimming and no one ever approached to see if I needed anything, and our last night when it was raining a little so it was very empty the waitress would look our way and turn around.  We finally went to the bar where everyone was just standing talking and asked if we could get drinks.  Also, the day we got food, the waiter kept bringing us chips even after we asked not to which would normally be great but not when they are charging 2 euros a pop - so watch for that.  

The breakfast at the hotel is ridiculously expensive but right across the street are no less than three cafes where you can get breakfast and coffee for significantly less money.  Cafe 365 and Cappuccino were our favorites - we could breakfast for 4 for the cost of breakfast for 1 at the hotel.

I would still fully recommend this hotel as even with these bumps, it was an extremely postive experience.",5,2019,08,23
61,Fantastic Hotel,"Thoroughly recommend this hotel.  Exceptional service from the reception staff.  Our room had a slight view of the Cathedral and was absolutely spotless.  We loved having the pool to cool down in after long hours sightseeing and loved the proximity to the Cathedral but felt we were away from the crowds.  We walked everywhere, even back from Sagrada, however perhaps not again on such a hot day! Close to the Picasso Museum which I loved. Close to Born and great Tapas.  Hired scooters one morning, check out the Reby app and went up to the Olympic village, well worth it.
I spent hours researching hotels and Airbnb’s for Barcelona, this one came out top and it didn’t disappoint, we would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,08,23
61,Lovely hotel in Gothic Quarter,"My boyfriend and I were very much looking forward to staying in the H10 Madison and it didn’t disappoint. We received an amenity for booking directly, and they even surprised us with chocolate covered strawberries and rosé cava to make our trip even more romantic. The service was excellent, and the breakfast was amazing. I will definitely try other H10 hotels because of our experience!

Thank you!",5,2019,08,23
61,Excellent hotel/room/service in a perfect location,Great hotel in an awesome location. You can walk 5-10 minutes to tons of gothic quarter restaurants and 15 min up to the Passeig de Gracia and 10 minutes to Las Ramblas. Really central location to hit up all the main Barcelona sites. Rooms were very nice and air conditioning super strong even in the very hot August weather. Great service from the staff all around and a great view from the upstairs terrace and pool area. Would definitely stay here again.,5,2019,08,19
61,Excellent Hotel,We stayed at the H10 Madison for one night while in Barcelona. We were extremely satisfied with this hotel. It was absolutely beautiful and so clean. The staff was so friendly and so helpful with any questions we had. ,5,2019,08,19
61,Wonderful place to stay in Barcelona!,"We just returned from Spain having spent five nights at this lovely hotel. The staff are amazing, the rooftop bar and pool are was a perfect way to relax at the end of our day and the views are stunning. The first look out our room was one I will never forget. The view of the Cathedral was unbelievable! The rooms are clean and modern. The bathroom is a bit tight for two people. We can’t say enough about this lovely choice of hotel as the staff, views and location made it fabulous! The breakfast option is a bit pricey and in hindsight I wouldn’t have chosen it all five mornings. Don’t think twice about booking. You will love it!",5,2019,08,16
61,"Very nice hotel, would recommend","I stayed here for two nights in August with my husband and two children, ages 12 and 15. We had connecting rooms. We have stayed in several hotels in Barcelona, and I would return to this one because of the value. The rooms are large and comfortable, and the bathrooms are good (the hotel supplies hair conditioner, which I appreciate). The location is central. The rooftop deck and pool area are very nice, although the area could use more loungers. Service is very friendly, particularly from the front desk staff, which provided excellent restaurant tips. The rooftop bar staff is also friendly. The room itself could have been a little bit cleaner - there were dust balls on the floor. Also the bathroom needs a towel rack (instead of a large picture). The rooms were pretty quiet, although we could hear a bit of noise from the room upstairs. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay due to the friendly staff, the comfort, and the value provided.",4,2019,08,12
61,Amazing hotel ,"This hotel was right opposite the Cathedral and close to everything. It was modern, friendly service and great facilities. The rooftop bar is great with small pool that wasn’t too busy. So comfortable and just like home. Great views too! ",5,2019,08,11
61,Great Location in the Gothic Quarter,"H10 Madison is located a block from the cathedral in the Gothic Quarter.  We were able to walk to most places easily.  Taxis are readily available on the street near the hotel for further locations.  The hotel bar/restaurant near the pool was a great respite after each days sightseeing.  Cava, water and candy was available in the lobby for guests.  The view from the rooftop can't be beat!",5,2019,08,09
61,"Great location, very nice room, friendly staff","We spent two nights at H10 Madison. We had a king bed and a pull out for our daughter. The beds were very comfortable. There was free water in the room each day. There was also a mini-fridge stocked with drinks and snacks (for purchase) in the room. We visited the rooftop bar one evening for dessert to enjoy the view, which was excellent (but we were a little too late for the live music.) There was also a small pool on the roof, although we did not take advantage of it.",5,2019,08,08
61,A fantastic hotel,"What a great hotel. Check in was efficient and friendly. All staff were very helpful. Our room was clean and comfortable. I slept so well - the air conditioning was excellent, the room was quiet and the blackout curtains ensured late waking. Highly recommended and I hope to return on my next visit to my favourite city. Thank you / Diolch",5,2019,08,08
61,"Wonderful Rooms, Great Hotel","This hotel had great rooms.  Nice, clean, and nicely decorated.  Very good customer service staff.  We enjoyed your two night stay here.  The location is good, in the Gothic Quarter. A couple of blocks from the Basilica.  Also, convenient to the Metro Station. There are only a few places to eat in the area and the hotel restaurant is a little pricey for the average tourist.  The hotel breakfast was NOT included and it was like 26 Euros extra. We had a quick pastry for breakfast at a coffee shop just down the street",5,2019,08,07
61,Great Place to stay in Barceona,"We loved this hotel. It was in a good location, very clean and the staff was all very friendly and helpful.
It is not close to the Gaudi La Familia. Really need to take a taxi if you are planning on going there.",5,2019,08,07
61,Exceptional Hotel,"We needed to find a hotel in Barcelona at the last minute and utilized tripadvisors.   This hotel is located in our favorite area of Barcelona to explore by foot (Gothic Quarter) so we chose it after looking at the photos.  We could not be happier.  The staff, the rooms, the food, and the rooftop bar are all exceptional.  For being in central Barcelona the room is whisper quiet and beautifully appointed.  We were able to upgrade from a Classic to a Superior room after one day and now have a view of the Cathedral.  As good as it gets!",5,2019,08,07
61,We will be back!,"Beautiful surroundings, great location in the city, welcoming staff, great service, clean and tidy, beautiful rooms, cozy bar and pool area with a nice view. The breakfast was delicios and gave us a good start of the day. We will definatly be back!",5,2019,08,07
61,Great location great breakfast!,"My wife booked this hotel based on the location and the roof top pool. Neither have disappointed. The views from the pool are stunning and the service is very good.

The room is spacious and comfortable. 

The bonus is the breakfast. We had it included as part of our rate. There is an expansive buffet and in addition you can order off the menu. Far and away the best European breakfast I have ever had. Great way to start your day of site seeing. ",5,2019,08,04
61,A Spanish Gem,"From Check In to Check Out this Hotel is faultless. Our greeting from Pedro with a welcoming champagne started our Spanish experience.Our room was gorgeous with a lovely bed and great pillows (a must). Breakfast served in the Restaurant by Manuel was a treat - even having a Rose Cava! The food was delightful and the atmosphere friendly - ready to steady ourselves to hit the streets and shops nearby. Advice from the Front Desk staff was invaluable as this was our first visit to Barcelona. Ecaterina was very helpful with directions. 
Back home for a Sangria and swim at the Rooftop Bar and Pool with an amazing view topped off our day - and Manuel was there to serve us again! 
Spotlessly clean and the friendliest most helpful staff with a beautiful ambiance - can't wait to go back.",5,2019,08,04
61,excellent hotel,"the team was excellent, the breakfast was excellent, the room was amazing. overall we really did enjoy it so much. but so make sure to go to the top bar and enjoy the view of the cathedral; it is totally mesmerizing",5,2019,08,04
61,Perfection,"Loved this hotel. Very warm and genuine greeting from the front desk upon arrival. Welcome drink provided of champagne and water.
Tasteful rooms with adorable little balconies (we had a regular room with King bed) in a great area of Barcelona right outside the heart of the Gothic Quarter. Right outside the Cathedral of Barcelona, walking distance to many attractions like La Rambla, Boquiera market, La Pedrera and Casa Batllo. Hop on and Hop off stop very close by.

Excellent staff, service and well managed hotel. Highly recommend to anyone visiting the city.

The only negative was no gym which was unfortunate.",5,2019,08,03
61,Did not meet the bill,"We stayed here for 5 nights in July. We went by the reviews but unfortunately the only view you have from this hotel is from the rooftop. There are rooms available with the views of the roadside but only if you choose smaller rooms. Our room had absolutely no views. When we asked about other category rooms but with views they informed none of the rooms with a view can fit more than 2 people.

Service was decent, room was good and clean. Walking distance to the Cathedral in the Gothic Quarters. Too pricey for that room was the only issue.",3,2019,08,02
61,"""Fantastic place to stay""","This is a fantastic hotel in a fantastic location, the terrace on the top floor has amazing views there is a lovely plunge pool, bar and tapas service. Our room on the fourth floor   was lovely i feel it had not long been refurnished we were over looking a busy road but with windows shut there was NO noise and had wonderful blackout curtains and the room was kept wonderfully clean. The staff are a credit to this hotel very friendly and helpful from the front desk staff, breakfast staff and also up on the terrace.
I was celebrating my birthday while there so at breakfast i had a nice surprise from the staff and when returning to our room that evening another nice surprise,[not saying what it was so not to spoil for others] its those touches that help make a memorable stay and we would not hesitate to return.",5,2019,08,01

61,My time at H10 Madison ,"H10 Madison was the perfect hotel for my trip to Barcelona! The location is beautiful and located in the gothic area, the staff is friendly, the breakfast is yummy, and the rooftop area is fun to hang out at. Join the H10 club so you get free drinks! 
(I recommend the Mojitos)",5,2019,07,31
61,Amazing hotel and great location!,"We absolutely loved our stay at the H10 Madison - a beautiful hotel, friendly staff and truly a great, walkable location.  The bathroom was gorgeous and the towels are so thick and decadent.  The rooftop has amazing views and we had drinks there many nights.  We never took a taxi once on our trip and the hotel is easy access to some great restaurants.  We loved the Mexican restaurant across the street and had omlettes each morning at the place right next door.  You walk out the door and theres the Barcelona cathedral and then a quick walk to Las Rambles.    10/10!",5,2019,07,31
61,Fantastic Hotel !,"My husband & I recently stayed 4 nights at this H10 ( there are many throughout Barcelona) and absolutely loved it! It is the newest of them all so very fresh and beautiful decor throughout. 
We had a basic room with a little balcony which we love...not a great view but the rooftop terrace gives you all you need.
The room was clean ,modern, fresh, soundproof and had a fabulously luxurious double shower & all the amenities from soaps to lush gowns and slippers.
The staff throughout the hotel are extremely friendly and helpful...especially front desk staff. This really set the tone for us.
The rooftop pool and bar was an absolute haven in the heat and it was literally an essential aspect of the hotel. Done with beautiful Spanish tiled floors and green shutters..and not to mention the Gothic Cathedral as your view on one side and most of the city and the Sagrada in the distance on the other side.
The staff on the rooftop were stunning and on the ball but they needed extra help with such a full hotel. This said it was still very enjoyable and we loved swimming and cooling off till late in the evening.
The hotels location is excellent!! Having walked & bused Barcelona flat I would never stay anywhere else. Its right on the edge of the Gothic quarter , across the road from Le Born and a few minutes walk to Las Ramblas.
Well done H10 !",5,2019,07,31
61,2 days in Barcelona,"We stayed in a basic room on the second floor and it was great, comfortable and good temperature control.  Solid water pressure.  Customer service at the hotel was spectacular, pool bar staff were so friendly.  Highly recommend ",5,2019,07,30
61,Beautiful hotel,"Really fantastic hotel located just at the edge of the Gothic neighborhood.  Very stylist with great attention to detail.  Looks vintage but I think it is actually quite new.  Spotlessly clean (and I am super picky) and with great double pane windows to keep out any outside noise.  Despite being right in the city center this is one of the quietest hotels I've stayed in.  Rooftop bar and plunge pool are very nice (and the staff are FANTASTIC), however, be aware that the plunge pool is just that - for a quick dip and not really for swimming.  Also it is sometimes taken over by rambunctious children, which is rather out of keeping with the otherwise posh vibe of the space.  But the rooftop is large enough that if you sit away from the pool it isn't bothersome and I suspect this happens at just about all hotels with pools in the summer.  Highly recommended.",5,2019,07,29
61,Incredible Staff in our time of need,"Our family vacation took an unexpected turn when my husband had to have emergency surgery almost immediately after our flight landed in Barcelona.  Rodolphe Pottier, the Front Desk Manager, and his team were amazing. They helped us navigate the Spanish medical/hospital system, got a doctor to our hotel room at midnight, helped with translating and were so kind, gentle and helpful.  My daughter and I were taken exceptional care of while my husband was in the hospital.  We cannot say enough about everyone at the hotel.  Truly kind and gracious people!  The hotel is also stunning and perfectly located.  We will be back next year and will hopefully have better luck!",5,2019,07,28
61,Favourite Barcelona Hotel,"This place is pretty faultless.It's very smart, well located with friendly staff and great facilities.

Rooms are recently refurbished, and nicely finished. Beds and bedding are luxurious and comfortable and sound insulation was excellent with no road noise.

Rooftop bar and pool are lovely and never seem to be too crowded. 

Staff can't do enough for you and regularly seek feedback. 

Would stay again without hesitation. Great.",5,2019,07,28
61,a perfect hotel in a prefect location,"This was a great, super-comfortable, well-located hotel. The rooftop pool/terrace/bar/restaurant was fabulous.

61,GREAT PLACE TO STAY!,"This hotel is centrally located within the few (5') min of cab ride to Sagrada Familia, Park Guell, Cam Nou, and other popular spots. The streets around it are full of charm with plenty of restaurants, shops, live entertainment.  This hotel is simply AMAZING! The property is very nice, beautiful views from the terrace, clean, modern, but the staff is what makes this property exceptional and very enjoyable! All I've met with no exception was simply great in every way. I will most certainly go back to this property as it has all one can need while exploring this beautiful city!",5,2019,07,23
61,Absolutely loved our experience!,"We stayed here during our honeymoon and they took fantastic care of us! The property is clean, updated, and the rooms are large and comfortable with great amenities. The rooftop pool and bar area can’t be beat. The location is also perfect. It’s walking distance to many sights, awesome bars and restaurants and the beach! Don’t hesitate. Book this hotel!",5,2019,07,23
61,Quiet hotel near cathedral and gothic quarter ,"First time in an H10 hotel. I will look for this chain again while traveling. 
Booking was easy
Checkin was easy. Front desk staff very helpful and accommodating for my partner who had to do a job interview remotely at 12 am. They found him a space in the lobby and turned off the overhead music for him. Excellent customer service! 
We stayed 3 nights and I could have spent a week here. 
Room was clean
Beds are very comfortable and we always slept too late because the blackout curtains and sound-proofing work really well! The air conditioning worked well too. 
We had a “family room”, which was a queen size bed and full size sofa bed. Both are very comfortable. 
Bathroom was also clean with plenty of towels and soft robes. 
My only critical comment about the room is that there were not enough hooks to hang towels, the hand held shower wand wouldn’t turn on, and the seal at the bottom of the shower wasn’t tight and let water leak out to the floor. I didn’t tell the hotel about these things as they seemed really minor. 
The rooftop bar is good sized with friendly waitstaff. The plunge pool is relatively small but perfect for a plunge. There is plenty of seating with both tables and lounge chairs. 
There is a complimentary drink if you are a member of their “club”. Food seemed a little overpriced for what us was and there are lots of places to eat nearby so we didn’t eat there. 
The cathedral and gothic quarter are less than a block away. It’s a perfect location from which to explore the city!",5,2019,07,22
61,Perfection . . .,"We stayed one night pre-cruise.  The hotel was perfect in every way - new and beautiful, lovely staff, outstanding location, awesome toiletries, champagne in the lobby, charming rooftop with a bar  . . .

61,"Stay at H10, but don’t rent your car at Hertz/Dollar Thrifty on Barcelona airport!","Stay at H10, but don’t rent your car at Hertz/Dollar Thrifty on Barcelona airport, unless you really want to ruin your vacation.
H10 has clean, comfortable rooms, helpful staff and is situated close to the cathedral. The pool on the eighth floor has an amazing view of the city. Just go!
Dollar on the other hand (in fact the same company as Hertz and Thrifty) on Barcelona airport is a disaster, it has terrible customer service, it was hard to find among Burger King restaurants and shops, hardly if any signs, we had to wait a looong time in line, the person behind the counter was on the phone half the time even when he asked us to come forward. I had prebooked my car, but he said it was still being washed and was not ready. First he wouldn’t let me rent at all because my driver’s licence was slightly bent from being in my back pocket. I asked my wife to rent. He asked if I wanted to be a codriver, then all of a sudden my driver’s licence was OK for being a codriver, but we had to pay extra. We also had to pay extra for insurance, since I had my insurance through my creditcard and that didn’t apply with her being the main driver. We finally got another car with a brand I had never seen before, and it was not a good car. (We had also wandered several parkinglots with suitcases because Hertz had the cars in several spots, before we finally found the car). The trunk wouldnt open, there was no button inside the car, outside on the trunk, and the button on the car key didn’t work. When I delivered the car the two people at Hertz/Dollar/Thrifty couldnt open the trunk or find any buttons other than the nonworking key, and the Hertz-people had never heard of the car brand. A terrible experience. 
My advice is to definitely book a room at H10, It’s a great hotel, but to find another car rental than Hertz/Dollar/Thrifty on Barcelona airport.

61,Best Hotel and Service I Experienced in Spain,"I arrived at the hotel late at almost 10pm because our flight was delayed. I regret not remembering her name, but the hotel staff at the front desk received us above and beyond. She completed the check in very swiftly with positive attitude and suggested we catch our breath in the lobby seating area. When we were going for the water in the lobby area, she asked if we wanted champagne instead which we delightfully agreed. She had one hotel staff to open new champagne bottle for us while she arrange our luggage. 

The hotel has beautiful modern decorations with local influence and very bright. The hotel elevator has a lot of room so both my husband and I could fit with our two big luggage without problems.

We stayed at a double bed room which was spacious overlooking an alley. The decor is again beautiful and very comfortable. Everything seems new and in great condition. There were small chocolates as a welcome gift. 

The hotel also has beautiful restaurant, rooftop bar, and rooftop pool. The view from the rooftop area is not to be missed. You can see (and hear) the cathedral and basically the whole Gothic area view.

We booked our room to include breakfast and the selection was phenomenal. When we were seated down, we were first given a menu for selection of eggs, sides, and sweets (waffle, crepe, etc). We were also offered different types of coffee or tea. But other than the menu, we also had access to the buffet area that had wide array of deli cheese/meat, juices, sweets, fruits, etc. And they were all arranged beautifully.

The hotel location is also perfect for us. We enjoyed our short walk to the Gothic neighborhood, Picasso Museum, and Ciutadella Park. There were tons of bakeries, restaurants and artist shops in Gothic area. I will definitely come back to this hotel.
",5,2019,07,21
61,Everything I expected,"Everything at H10 Madison met expectations. The location can not be beat. You have the beautiful cathedral right behind you and easy walking access to the beautiful Gothic area in Barcelona. Upon arrival the staff was really accommodating and offered us water and cava. Very nice. The room wa small but located with a window to an inner courtyard. This was a magical surprise because of how quiet and relaxing the room was. I was prepared with earplugs, Barcelona being a big city but didn’t have to use them at all. The bathroom shower was large and had two shower heads, plenty of room for 2. 
Now to the rooftop. I selected this hotel because of the view and it does not disappoint. The rooftop is clean and beautiful and you can take the best photos of the Barcelona Cathedral from the pool area. 
My only complaint was that the loungers by the pool are few and on a hot day there is only room for about 8 guests. Unfortunately during my stay there were a few families and the kids were running amok in the area. 
Please make sure to have a cocktail during sunset time, it was lovely and the lounge area quite comfortable. 
We really enjoyed our stay at H10 Madison and will be back. Keep up with training of the staff as unparalleled service was key for me. All friendly and accommodating. 

Lastly, people if you are traveling with children please be considerate of others specially while staying at a hotel that is clearly not designed for kids. The pool is small and meant to be a relaxing area. I understand that kids will be kids.... but when you let them run and scream like wild animals for 2.5 hours so that everyone else has to leave the area I draw a line.",5,2019,07,21
61,Amazing Service & Location,"We absolutely loved our stay at the H10 Madison Hotel.  From the welcome glass of champagne to the attentive and friendly staff to the perfectly appointed room - every part of our stay far exceeded our expectations.  It is in a great location right in the middle of the Barri Gotic, with all of the narrow winding streets to get lost in.  We will stay here again! ",5,2019,07,19
61,Great hotel. Perfect location,"Really enjoyed our stay.
The front desk staff were efficient and friendly.
The location was great for exploring the city.
The rooms were spacious and the beds very comfortable.
I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,07,18
61,Perfection,"Just perfect. Staff second to none. First trip to Barcelona so only this experience but hard to image a better location. The room was a good size with a little balcony, bed and shower great. With the roof top bar with pool as cherry on top. ",5,2019,07,18
61,Top notch hotel and nicest staff ever. Great food!,"Warm greeting from our hostess Naima when we checked in made us feel welcome right away! Mathieu poured us champagne and took our bags as we checked in.. what a great start to vacation! We loved the room with the big showers, comfy bed, and the roof with drinks and a pool. Everyone who works there is incredibly kind. This ranks as one of the best hotels, if not the best, that we’ve ever been to. Oh yea, it’s a no brainer location too!",5,2019,07,17
61,Awesome place,"I found H10 Madison in Barcelona on TripAdvisor and I knew the place would be great and it was . Our room was really beautiful with a king size bed, and the shower was big enough for three people. The room had great lighting and the bed was spectacular, so comfortable. Now the people who work there did everything they could do  to make our stay pleasurable. They went above and beyond their duties. So Arnau, Pedro, Naima, and all the other staff members my wife and I can't thank you enough. One more thing, free champagne through out the day.",5,2019,07,16
61,WONDERFUL HOTEL + STAFF,"From the moment we walked in, I knew I was in heaven at H10 Madison. Greeted with a glass of Cava and a smile. Room is spotless, comfortable (not as small as you'd expect), bathroom is gorgeous and the rooftop is perfect at the end of the day for a cocktail and gorgeous views of Barri Gotic. Great place. ***** (5 stars!)",5,2019,07,14
61,Didnt wanna come home!,"Brilliant location, near metro which is super easy to use. We got a 3 day HOLA card which allows you to use on bus & metro & the metro even takes you to the airport so you’re all set for 18 euros each. Bargain. Citymapper helped lots, could use on our EE normal data package. The hotel was comfortable, so clean, little luxury details from bathroom range to treats by lobby. Service was always friendly they held our luggage after checkout as we had time to explore before return flight. As it was over Valentines Day we came back to a champagne bottle & chocolates on day 2. So sweet. Rooftop terrace has pool & views of city with a bar! Beds are so comfortable, balcony a bonus with city views. I would defo return! Got this on a deal via booking.com otherwise h10s can be pricey!
We went to so many delicious food spots there is so much choice! From Paella, Tapas to Brunch & Churros! Bakeries are yum!
Best bakery near beach: baluard
Best brunches: MILK in Gothic Quarter & MARMALADE in Raval great decor food coffee & live dj

We had tapas from La Pepita & its a tiny spot gotta squeeze in. Prob better for drinks!
There are cute places everywhere so go for a wander! I also went to see Sagrada Familla catherdral and had a lovely coffee about a 7 min walk up the hill. 

Sunny although Feb! Cant wait to return!",5,2019,07,12
61,Immaculate hotel in perfect location,"Was very excited to check into this hotel due to the photos and other reviews. It lived up to every expectation plus more! The rooms all feel brand new and have such divine decor. The whole hotel is beautiful and has a lovely feel to it. Beds are very comfortable, rooms can be made pitch black and bathrooms are large with double showers. Staff are very helpful and attentive for taxis and restaurant bookings. The roof top is a beautiful place for pre dinner drinks and sunbaking. An easy lovely 10 minute walk to las ramblas and surrounded by little cafes. 
Only recommendation would be to have space/stand in the room for large bags to be rested on.",5,2019,07,11
61,"Nice Hotel, Nice Location, Great Staff","Very short walk into the Gothic Quarter, in the shadow of the Barcelona Cathedral. The rooms were very nice, and the staff was exceptionally helpful. Making restaurant recommendations and reservations. Calling a taxi when needed. I hope to return to Barcelona for a stay at the H10 Madison.",5,2019,07,10
61,INCREDIBLE STAY AT H10 MADISON,"I just got back from Barcelona where we stayed at the H10 Madison for two nights prior to our cruise.  This beautiful boutique hotel is located in the Barri Gotic section of the city and exactly 1 block from the Barcelona Cathedral.  The amazing location, gorgeous lobby, spotless, large room and enormous bathroom (we stayed in a junior suite), rooftop pool & bar with breathtaking views of this magical city are just a few things I wanted to mention.  It is the perfect place to stay.  However, the real gem is the friendly staff and impeccable service this hotel provides.  Pedro and Naima went ABOVE AND BEYOND for us....before, during and even after our stay.  They are two of the loveliest people I have ever met.  My daughter had accidentally left a pair of new Nike Air Force One sneakers in the room after we checked out.  I had called the hotel after boarding the cruise to see if they found them, which they had and Naima told me they would be happy to hold the sneakers for me to pick up upon our return from our cruise.  When we went back to get the sneakers, hauling all of our luggage with us, they were kind enough to hold our bags until we needed to depart for the airport so that we could go out and explore the city, shop, eat lunch...all without having to lug our bags around.  Pedro offered us refreshments, allowed us to relax in the air conditioned lobby, called a taxi to take us to the airport and helped bring our bags to the cab when it arrived.  They welcomed us back with open arms, even though we weren't checking in again and this was an enormous kindness we will never forget.   Please know that a hotel is NOTHING without its staff and your employees are THE BEST people I have ever encountered in the hospitality business.  Bravo H10 Madison!!",5,2019,07,09
61,Excellent 2 night stay before cruise ,"My husband, our 2 boys age 9 and 12, and I stayed here for 2 nights before a cruise out of Barcelona. This hotel was perfect. It’s more of a boutique hotel and very modern. Didn’t feel like a chain. Perfect location. You can walk to a bunch of sights and just wander around the Gothic Quarter and La Rambla during the day and  night. We hailed a taxi right in front of the hotel to take us to Sagrada Família (book your tickets online). The front desk staff helped us book tickets to the FCA Barca Camp Nau (which my son wanted to see) and they also helped us get a taxi to the cruise port, and booked our hotel transfer from the airport. The staff spoke English which was helpful. We stayed in a suite, which worked for us. I emailed the hotel ahead of time and they helped me book it. Our view was of an alley and residential balconies, seemed pretty quiet. Surprisingly, however, at 11:45 pm on Friday night a local neighbor set of fireworks off the rooftop right next to our room window. Kind of interesting/cool/festive. It was LGTBQ pride parade weekend so maybe it was just celebratory fireworks, not sure if it’s the norm. My son went in the rooftop pool while husband and I had a drink up there. They provide bathrobes in the rooms, which my son wore up to the roof, so the experience had a spa-like feel. Pool is small but a good place to rest and relax for about an hour or so. Awesome photo opp of the cathedral. My only complaint is the rooftop drink/food service was awkwardly slow. Breakfast was excellent, and the food service was top notch. Complimentary water and espresso machine in the room was nice, too. it was really a great way to start our vacation. I wish we had stayed there in Barcelona a couple more nights. ",5,2019,07,09
61,Great hotel and impeccable servicw,Wonderful stay at the hotel for 4 nights in July. From the moment we arrived the service was great and the facilities faultless. We’ll definitely be visiting again in the future. Also lovely view from the pool terrace and bar!,5,2019,07,07
61,Fabulous City Hotel,"Can’t recommend this place enough - excellent and prompt check in and gorgeous new rooms . The hotel is close to Plaza Catalunya and shops as well as la ramblas and bouqueria market with everything in walking distance. Special mention and thanks to staff : Guillermo, Judith, Carla and Jesus.

Excellent breakfast, roof top pool deck and lunch was fabulous. This is the Place to stay.
",5,2019,07,06
61,"Excellent service, location and super clean","We had a 4 night stay at H10 Maddison with our twin teenagers. The hotel is located just 10 mins from La Rambla and 3 mins from Court D’Anglais—the best shopping area, 10 mins from Paseo De Garcia. Ample cabs are located across from the hotel. The hotel is very clean and modern with plenty of free bottled water and amenities. The buffet breakfast is wonderful. Loved the creeps, gluten free bread and desserts.  Folks complained about the elevator and frankly it was no problem at all! 
We enjoyed taking the trains to the near by town of Sitges which had a great beach. Overall a great trip at a great location. Special shout out to the front desk crew Asier who always had a smile and great ideas for places to visit. Silvia who was new was wonderful as well. The breakfast team was fantastic as well—Ravinder and her colleagues. ",5,2019,07,06
61,Great boutique hotel with unbelievable views from the roof top pool area !!!!!!,Found this hotel while searching online ... booked it for the price and location in the Gothic quarter .  I can’t tell you the views from the roof top pool/ lounge eating area is indescribable !  The hotel staff so professional and even corresponded to my inquiries via email timely ! You are in the heart of the Gothic district and that’s a plus .  The cathedral views of the 500 yrs old church was unbelievable !!!!! What a great find ... lucky us!!!   The breakfast and roof top tapas style eating was wonderful we just ate here frequently .  Look these are my photos from the roof and street !!!  I would come back here anytime!!! It’s so charming ... I usually stay in high end hotels but this was great !!!!  The front desk guy even remembered my name from emails 12 months ago lol,5,2019,07,05
61,Loved it!,"My daughter and I have thoroughly enjoyed the location, service, and spacious roomhere. Super location by the cathedral and lovely rooftop terrace and pool. Only caution (and a small one), is the only night we asked the front desk to recommend a restaurant, it was terrible (mediocre food and poor service).",5,2019,07,02
61,Great location!,"We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in end of june. Asked for a quiet room and got just that away from busy street and elevator. A nice room facing st philip cathedral. Big spacios rooms with big comfortable beds. Also there was a big bathroom. Neatly cleaned when you got back at night. Frendly and helpful staff at front desk. There is a nice poolbar/restaurant at the top serving tasty food. I found the staff serving very friendly and willing to serve. There are only a few sunbeds and the pool is clean and cool but very small.
The location is perfect. Walking distance to beach, Las Ramblas and Gothic old block.
I can highly recommend this hotel",5,2019,07,02
61,Great staff in a great hotel at a great location,"It’s always tricky selecting a hotel, but we nailed this one.

Firstly, the staff are just terrific and nothing is a problem.  Special mention to Pedro!

Secondly, the rooms are spacious and well equipped and have excellent beds.

Thirdly, on hot days the roof top pool is a godsend.  And remember to take your camera when you go for a swim – there are excellent views of the city’s landmarks.

Fourthly, the breakfast is a treat and a dining experience each morning.  Maybe a glass of champagne with your breakfast? 

Finally, the hotel is in a great location.  Just minutes to walk to many of the tourist attractions, and then just far enough away to enjoy quiet and peaceful evenings.

",5,2019,06,30
61,Excellent location!,"We spent 2 nights here pre cruise. 
The hotel is in an excellent location. It only takes a few minutes walk and you're in the main areas of Barcelona. 
The hotel is immaculate, the rainfall shower was really good. 
The staff were very attentive and the breakfast was amazing!
The only negative was there was only a coffee pod machine in the room, so I couldn't make tea. But thats just a personal thing. I have already recommended this hotel to others. . Would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,06,29
61,Absolutely loved our stay here.,"Rooms were good, breakfast nice.  Really loved the decor in the public areas, light & welcoming.
Staff were delightful.  Looked like they were genuinely happy working there.  Lots of chill seating in the foyer with complimentary bubbles in the afternoon.
Really nice rooftop area to relax, comfy seating.  Would stay again in a heartbeat.",5,2019,06,27
61,Highly recommend ,"Haven’t got a negative thing to say about this hotel. We loved the location, the stylish decor, the staff, the breakfast, our room. We stayed in a junior suite which had space for a pull out bed for our son and a lovely huge bathroom. Our view was of a neighbourhood courtyard which was lovely and quiet. My parents were in a king room with two balconies overlooking the street and up to the cathedral. Absolutely stunning view and atmosphere as people walked by. My husband is in a wheelchair and all parts of the hotel were accessible. The roof top area is incredible and the perfect place to meet friends for sangria at the end of the evening and enjoy the city lights, which we did. Just as beautiful during the day. The breakfast room is gorgeous and the staff very welcoming and the food very good. A buffet as well as a cooked to order menu. Would definitely stay again. ",5,2019,06,25
61,Spectacular roof deck,"We stayed at the H10 Madison for three nights and could not have been more happy with the choice. Modern, clean and convenient to the Gothic Quarter. The staff is super friendly and helpful. The rooms are classic smaller European style hotel rooms. The roof deck was very memorable. We sat out each night and dusk. Spectacular views, nice staff and great food.",5,2019,06,24
61,"Comfort, Beauty and Superb Hospitality",Spent three days in Barcelona on recent European holiday.  This is the hotel we stayed in while in Barcelona.  Was such a wonderful stay.  Everyone so nice and accommodating.  Buffet breakfast magnificent.  Roof top bar with most fabulous views.  Bed so comfortable and shower amazing!  Wish this hotel line was in the United States as well.,5,2019,06,21
61,Top notch stay,"The previous reviews say it all. Beautiful and very well-run hotel. My room had a cute balcony with nice view and the bathroom was well appointed. I often saw a senior staff/supervisior on the ground, making sure everything was operating well. Highly recommend.",5,2019,06,21
61,"Wonderful place, centrally located","This is the first time I've stayed at an H10 hotel and it was a great introduction.  The room was very comfortable.  Can't beat two bottles of complimentary water a day!  I like my room freezing cold and I was not disappointed.  The rooftop pool and bar area with the views of Barcelona Cathedral nearby is the perfect place to hang out after a day of sightseeing in Barcelona.  The staff was wonderful and accommodating.  All in all, I had a great time in Barcelona because of the staff at the hotel.",5,2019,06,20
61,Beautiful & Extremely Hi End Clean!,"LOved this hotel so much!!! Made our stay in BCN fabulous! Location was perfectly set in my favorite Gothic Qtr. Immaculately clean. Customer service was great. Those bath towels!... 10 inches thick (a lil exaggeration, but definitely the thickest I've ever had at a hotel) and that shower!!! Breakfast was fantastic. We couldn't get enough of the gorgeous roof top bar, pool, & views! We also, really enjoyed our complimentary champagne everyday w those marshmallows. It was an outstanding way to end our long trip abroad!!! We felt pampered & rested for our long haul home to reality!!! 
I will be sending my clients to this hotel when booking BCN. ❤️

61,A lovely hotel . . .,"This is a really lovely hotel.  The young men and women working at the front desk were gracious and welcoming.  Our room was beautifully appointed with Nespresso coffee machine, robes, slippers, and delicious complementary cookies!  The rooftop bar and pool was fantastic . . . great view.  Would like to have eaten breakfast in the hotel, but the 23Euro was a bit steep for me . . .  not on an expense account!! ",5,2019,06,18
61,Great Hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"This is a first-rate hotel in every sense. The staff was exceptional. The rooms were nice, spacious, and comfortable. The breakfast was very good with many options. The cathedral and the Gothic Quarter are a few minutes walk away.",5,2019,06,18
61,DISAPOINTED TREATMENT,"We researched this Hotel before booking and all the indications from previous reviews was this was a top hotel to stay before taking a cruise. We are experienced cruisers and were about to start our 76th cruise.
We booked the superior city view room.
When we checked in I said that I hoped we would be given a nice room as we were celebrating our 48th wedding anniversary that day. We were given room105.I said that we would not get much of a view on the first floor but was told that room had been allocated to us and could not be changed.
The next morning we went to breakfast in the Restaurant at 8.45
We placed our hot order within a few minutes and within about 10 minutes an order arrived--the only problem was that it was not our order! We then had a long wait and kept asking where our order was  At 9.45 after an hour we cancelled the order and walked out.The Restaurant Manager came chasing after us with the order but we told her we had lost interest.
When we checked out Reception said they were aware of our problem. We said that she should report the matter to the General Manger as the Restaurant Manager and the Chef needed their heads banged together for the appalling service..
Going on a cruise meant that we had a reasonable amount of luggage but no offer of help was offered on arrival nor when we left.
Out of all our travel experiences this must amount to our worst breakfast experience!
It is a shame as we could have had a pleasant stay!",3,2019,06,18
61,FABULOUS HOTEL,"My husband and I spent 6 nights at H10Madison and loved every minute.  Perfectly located near Cathedral in Barri Gothic neighborhood and within easy walking distance of everything.  The staff was so friendly and cordial - we had a great King size room with lots of amenities and the Continental Breakfast was excellent.  Our favorite part of our experience was the roof top terrace and pool where we found ourselves almost every afternoon - enjoying the sun, the poolside cocktails and snacks and relaxing after a day of sightseeing.   We highly recommend this little gem of a hotel!",5,2019,06,17
61,Disappointed ,Had 3 rooms here and got treated like children from the staff who was very impatient for some reason. WiFi was down for days and they did not seem to care at all. Not even a suggestion where to get WiFi or anything or even an apology for the inconvenience. For all the good reviews this was a huge disappointment and would never recommend a place that can’t just answer questions in pleasant manner. ,2,2019,06,17
61,"Boutique gem in the heart of Barcelona, great decor, service and location!","4.5 out of 5.  Our family of four embarked on a 2 week European vacation and H10 Madison was our first hotel. After a long flight, it was such a relief to see the gorgeous entry, friendly greetings and of course, champagne and chocolates/cookies. It’s not a huge lobby, but with plenty of chic chairs, and big enough for 2 active boys to lounge around and play games.

The room was very clean and had a tiny balcony with a great view.  It has a very modern decor.  The room was a bit tight for us but that’s my fault for not upgrading to a suite like I did for our other hotels. With the pull out bed setup, we barely had space to walk or open our luggage.

Breakfast room was large and quite nice, with decent cold and hot selections. Best part was the cappuccino.  The service was a bit sloppy to be honest...no immediate refills, no clearing of plates. 

Overall, it was a great experience!  I’d stay there again although I’ll opt for a larger room.  The location was walkable to Gothic Quarters and La Rambla, and it is close to a Hop on Hop off stop too.  

Excellent front desk staff!  
",5,2019,06,16
61,Beautiful hotel and great post-stay customer service,"The H10 Madison is a nearly brand-new hotel in a perfect location, with to-die-for views from its rooftop bar/restaurant. The rooms are large by European standards, and the rainfall shower was so enveloping I might have stayed under it all day and missed all the delicious jamon (luckily I extricated myself from the shower eventually). Staff at the restaurant is terrific - efficient and friendly.  

I did have two issues at the hotel.  The first was a smaller issue with the cleanliness of the bathroom.  The second was a significant customer service issue upon our departure.  However, after I reported this issue to the hotel, I was contacted by the front desk manager, Rodolphe Pottier, who was extremely kind and accommodating, assuring me the employee at issue had been made aware of the issue and that they were working to improve the service.  My interactions with Mr. Pottier were very positive and have caused me to rewrite my review to upgrade it to five stars.  Given his response to this issue, I have no hesitation in recommending H10 Madison for your Barcelona stay.  It really is an amazing, beautiful place in an incredible location!",5,2019,06,16
61,Exceptional Hotel,"Hotel was located in the Old City, close to the Cathedral and several cafes and restaurants. Easy to wander the old cobblestone streets and alleyways. Staff was exceptional, room was clean and modern, and there was a restaurant on site as well as a delightful rooftop bar, lounge and pool. Definitely would stay there again.",5,2019,06,16
61,Beautiful and Memorable 4-Night Visit,"This was a very carefully planned land/cruise/land family vacation that was unfortunately cut short due to an unexpected medical issue. As a result, we had the pleasure of staying 4 nights at this beautiful restored and perfectly-located property within the Gothic Quarter. My allegiance is typically with Marriott, however, the H10 Madison exceeded expectations and both day and night staff at the front desk could not have been more thoughtful and helpful to my family.  We reserved a triple and the room was easily spacious enough for the three of us. French doors in rm 704 open to a view of the City, an amazing double rain shower, in-room fridge, espresso maker and comfortable bedding and absolutely clean. The rooftop bar and lounge area (our favorite) were an absolute delight, along with fabulous views of the nearby Cathedral, the Quarter’s many alleyways and all of the impressive and gorgeous architecture. Short walking distance to the best restaurants, shops and La Rambla. Would definitely stay here again. In fact, we are reserving for another visit at H10 Madison next June. Highly recommend this hotel. H10 has character, surrounded by history and is a pleasant break from the large, homogenous hotels we have become so used to here in the States. You will certainly enjoy your visit to H10 Madison in Barcelona.",5,2019,06,15
61,Well designed and appointed rooms in the Gothic Quarter,It is a very nicely designed and furnished small hotel in the gothic quarter. The rooms are comfortable and well lit.

61,Beyond Great,"Did this hotel prior to our cruise and were glad we chose it. Even prior to our stay they kept in touch with us via email for any info we needed. The staff was great, reception seamless, help with the bags, car service etc. Can't say enough about the staff. The breakfast was great and the service outstanding. The rooftop bar was great and good snacks. The staff was very accommodating to our grandchildren. Great location near the old city and not far from the port. Restaurants nearby. Modern décor and comfortable firm beds. One of the best I have stayed in.",5,2019,06,13
61,Great hotel and great location ,"We can’t say enough about this hotel. The personnel were all so pleasant, always greeting us with a smile.
The breakfast buffet was excellent, not to mention, we could also order cappuccino. 
The location is awesome as well. We took a taxi to Park Guell one morning and 10 miles later, we found ourselves back at the hotel; that’s how easy it was to find.

They are in a great spot, not too busy, but, less than 5 minutes to all the action. ",5,2019,06,12
61,Great Location!!,"Wonderful hotel, highly recommend. Centrally located near La Rambla, Food/ Restaurants, Gothic Area. Hotel staff are friendly and helpful. Convenient to the Hop On - Hop Off Bus Stop, rooftop view was amazing!!",5,2019,06,11
61,Lovely hotel and great friendly staff,"My sister and I just returned from staying at this hotel for the weekend. The hotel is beautiful. The rooms are well equipped and the bathrooms are nice and spacious. Complimentary shampoo and conditioner provided. We did not chose to have breakfast here as was way too expensive (23 euros per person)

We was welcomed on arrival with a nice glass of cava each. The room wasn't ready although we did ask for an earlier check in (we arrived at the hotel at 1:30 PM)

The rooftop area is GORGEOUS with a lovely pool and sunloungers. The waiter was very slow and we found we sat waiting a very long time before we then asked if we could order a drink. The views from the rooftop were beautiful, right next to the cathedral and only a 10 min walk to Las Ramblas and about a 15 min walk to the beach.

Definitely would stay here again",5,2019,06,11
61,Amazing hotel!,"This is hotel has it all!  The location is fantastic, just near the Cathedral, in the centre of Barcelona.  The room, beds, shower and balcony were perfect with and we even had a  very nice view at the Cathedral.  But the thing that makes this hotel different from a lots of other hotels is the service!  For the service I would say 11/10, each one of them gives you the perfect feeling, from the manager to the waiter to the cleaning lady to ...  They were all unbelievable competent.",5,2019,06,10

61,Friendly staff & great location ,"I highly recommend this hotel!

All the staff were so helpful and friendly. Upon check in we got two complimentary cocktails which were divine. We had these while waiting for our room to be ready.

The terrace was a great place to relax and catch some sun. 

In the lobby there was always water and cava avaliable.. Not to mention the chocolate covered peanuts! 

Special mention to Jesus, Arnau,Naima and unfortunately I didn't catch one of their names but he was able to give me a few chocolates on the way out- thank you so much and you are all a credit to the team. 

Now when travelling we will look out for the H10 Hotels.

61,Beautiful hotel in fantastic location,"We thoroughly enjoyed the H10 Madison in Barcelona. The rooms were exceptionally clean and lovely, the lobby is very tastefully done with the perfect touch of elegance and the rooftop bar is mind-blowing thanks to the views and service. And the location was absolutely perfect for us, close to restaurants and away from them hustle. We would definitely return.",5,2019,06,04
61,What can I say about this lovely hotel that's not been said before????,"Yes, H10 may be a chain, and that often leads to a purely commercial approach to the hospitality product - but not here - this is a hotel with personality, as well as world class quality.  

Reception - fab, room - fab, breakfast - fab, location - fab, rooftop terrace - fab, housekeeping - fab.  

But ultimately its the staff who make or break a hotel - and here the staff are absolutely splendid - always smiling, always willing to talk and to listen, always helpful.  

Loved our stay.  WE WILL BE BACK!  (and that's a promise).",5,2019,06,04
61,Excellent Location in the Barri Gotic,"Great location,within walking distance of main sites in the Barri Gotic area. Situated in a side street just off  the Via Laietana, so traffic noise at a minimum. Nice roof top bar with a small swimming pool. We found all the staff friendly and helpful, rooms modern and clean. The only drawback we found was that the lifts were very slow, but  that is the our only criticism.",5,2019,06,03
61,Outstanding Hotel / Outstanding service,"Everything was outstanding.  Great location in the Gothic Quarter - great service upon check in.  Room was absolutely beautiful.

Location is amazing, and the staff should be proud of their service, we would recommend in a heartbeat.

61,Great Hotel,"Had a wonderful stay at this cute hotel. Great rooms, close distance to most everything and a very nice rooftop view, bar, pool. Walking distance to some great food options. Right in the Gothic Quarter which is our favorite place to shop and people watch. ",5,2019,06,01
61,Almost a Five ........But Sadly Some Spoilers,"Stayed in a Junior Suite for a week.Arrival was excellent - porter attended as soon as we got out the taxi and took luggage.Bubbly or water on arrival and staff were all excellent during our stay and very friendly.
Room was very nice.I like to see the surroundings from any room i stay in and when i drew the nets back i was shocked at the disgusting ugly view of in your face scruffy terraces from apartments next door.Not good.We also had quite a lot of noise from Spanish kids out on their balconies which ruined a few afternoons rest.
No drawers in the room.This is bad and needs putting right.I have stayed in 1 Star hotels and had ample drawers.Lovely large bathroom and rain forest shower,
Room was serviced very well by staff.Air conditioning was a nuisance as it kept turning off due to the French door not closing properly.You had to get it just right before it worked or bang and push the door firmly shut.
Some noise a few nights from the room above.Footsteps for over an hour ! maybe they were line dancing ? sounded like it.Free safe in the room .
Two lifts in the hotel both very small and seem to have a mind of their own.Very slow.
Lovely rooftop terrace and small pool.Great views.
It rained for a few days which wets the seats so even when the sun has come out and they look dry they are not !
Main restaurant was shut most nights which was a shame.I do not like sitting outside to eat when the weathers not great so i feel that facility was not there.
Breakfast was very nice.Plenty of choice and they do wait on you at the table.
I dont like eating off black plates ! white ones would be better and no lettuce garnish with egg and bacon ! 
One morning service was very bad.Over 30 mins wait for my order and no croissants either.Waitress said 5 minutes in oven.Half an hour later i asked again and was told 5 minutes more in oven ! They eventually were served and were cold ! so i dont think they had been in any oven.
My breakfast order was wrong so after a 30 min wait i had to wait again for the correct order to be served.Pity this happened.
Hotel is a lovely building and been open a year.
Last night when we went back to the room there was a bottle of bubbly on ice and a plate of strawberries dipped in chocolate.We had not ordered this so rang reception just to make sure what it was and we were told its for us on the house so a lovely gesture.The female receptionist had arranged this so many thanks.Sorry i didnt get her name.All i know is that she is from the Philippines.
So despite the spoilers i would fully recommend staying here.",4,2019,05,31
61,"Wonderful, magical hotel and service.",The staff are so kind and always went out of their way to make us comfortable. Above and beyond our expectations. The rooftop bar and pool make for a perfect way to spend the evening away from the hustle and bustle of the city - but we were within walking distance to all of the history of Barcelona. ,5,2019,05,31
61,Superb Hotel,"A superb hotel.  Central location; rooms spacious, well decorated & stocked with all kinds of needments.  One of the best hotel breakfasts I’ve ever had.   But, more than anything else, it’s the service provided by the staff which goes above & beyond the call of duty.  I was unfortunate enough to have a serious fall in a neighbouring restaurant, cracking two ribs [the doctor thinks].  Their care & kindness were outstanding, just amazing.  I could go on for ages but I won’t, I’ll just say that I would recommend the H10 Madison to anyone.  [And the staff for a Hotel Oscar, if there is such a thing!]",5,2019,05,30
61,Highly Recommend,This hotel was perfect!  Very quaint and comfortable.  The staff was more than accommodating and friendly.  The location was perfect - right in middle of the Gothic Quarter.  I highly recommend this hotel!,5,2019,05,29
61,Excellent Stay,"This hotel is the top of the line. Our room was large with king size bed & large bathroom with shower. Very quiet & very clean.  The hotel had all the amenities you could ask for,a restaurant, bar, near local sites. Very helpful staff. Nice lobby to sit & relax with a glass of complimentary champagne. We highly recommend & would stay there again.",5,2019,05,28
61,Beautiful Hotel in the Gothic Quarter,"This is a gem in the area with lots of pastry shops and restaurants within walking distance.  The Cathedral is a short walk away at the end of the street.  The hotel sports a rooftop pool, restaurant and bar. Would definitely stay again if in Barcelona!  ",5,2019,05,28
61,Beautiful Property & Wonderful Service Recovery,"Four of us (two couples) booked a two night stay at the H10 Madison  in May. The hotel is a newer hotel, absolutely beautiful, with great attention to detail. Upon check in you're greeted with a glass of sparkling wine similar to Prosecco. The front desk couldn't be nicer nor the bell staff.

One of the things that drew us to H10 Madison was the rooftop bar. The rooftop has picturesque views of the cathedral and city. Absolutely stunning. You can imagine our disappointment when on the first night we couldn't get service. It turns out that the hotel had an influx of visitors to the bar that evening that they just couldn't keep up with. After waiting and asking for service for about 45 minutes we left and had some wine at the bar across the street.

We've traveled a lot, and things will always happen. What separates the good from the great is how they recover from it. Before leaving for the bar out of the hotel we expressed our frustration to hotel staff. We returned to our room that evening to find sparkling wine in both of our rooms. In addition, when we returned to the rooftop bar the next evening we were all individually apologized to while they explained what happened. In addition, a round of drinks was on the house.

So, although there was a concern at the hotel they corrected it. The service at the property is upbeat and professional. The attention to detail is exquisite. Even little things...for example, I went to the front desk asking to purchase stamps for my 12 postcards going to the States. The front desk agent just simply took the cards stating it would be his pleasure to send them free of charge.

We loved this hotel. Really wished they had a gym, but knew that going in, so my review is stellar.",5,2019,05,26
61,Weekend to remember,"We spent the weekend of the 17th to 20th May in Barcelona, having visited once before on a Cruise stop off we wanted to explore this beautiful city.  Having spent many hours searching through lists of hotels online, we kept coming back to the H10 Madison and decided this was the one for us.

What a fabulous choice!  The staff are extremely pleasant and nothing is to much trouble, there is coffee machine provided in the room, but being a typical Brit I just wanted a cup of tea, no problem, a kettle and tea were provided without any issue.

The rooms are lovely, nice big comfortable beds with high quality products supplied, even a small bag containing toothbrush and shaver are supplied for those who do not want to carry toiletries through the airport. 

Cleanliness of the whole hotel is to a high level and maintained at that standard 24/7.

We did have a couple of nights of rain whilst in Barcelona, umbrellas were available from reception if you chose to brave the weather.  I can however highly recommend the hotel bar for a great night with wonderful staff who can make any cocktail you desire, or even ones you have never tried before.  We were entertained with these skills by the wonderful Andrea and Miguel, very talented and professional team H10, we hope to see them both there next time we visit.

We are really looking forward to a return visit and hope to spend more time on the rooftop pool area, to enjoy the stunning views, weather permitting.",5,2019,05,26
61,Would have been 5 out of 5 but...........,"Just returned from a week at the H10 Madison. It is a well appointed hotel that is just over a year old. The staff are its main asset. On arrival the reception staff were most helpful and that included the welcome drink of cava or water. We had a junior suite which was quite spacious with a large bathroom and double shower. Good ritual toiletries. What was missing from the room were drawers - none to be had other than 2 small ones in the bedside tables. Also the air conditioning was tempremental on the 2 window doors being closed tightly - something that was difficult to achieve. We asked for a kettle and cups and this was provided. Room service was good and a nice surprise on the last evening was a bottle of cava and chocolate strawberries left in the room.

The rooftop terrace was pleasant but was open for food and drinks when the restaurant was closed. Never were the 2 open at the same time (staff shortages?). If the restaurant had been open more in  the evenings then we would have ate there more often. The breakfasts were substantial and varied but service on our last 2 days was slow with the hot food order taking over 20  minutes to arrive (5-10  minutes on the other days).

The 2 lifts are too small for the high turnover of guests at this hotel. Often had to wait 5 minutes or more for a lift!!!!

All staff were pleasant and attentive. Special mention for the girl on reception from the Phillipines (sorry, forgot her name).",4,2019,05,24
61,City break ,"Best hotel I have stayed in!

We have just returned from a 2 night stay in the H10 Madison, what can I say other than the staff make this the best hotel my husband has ever stayed in, and he spends 20 weeks of the year in them around the world. Everyone we have come into contact with has been exceptional, from check in, to the bar on the roof, breakfast and the pool guy, we couldn’t have asked for more! The hotel is very central, easy access to everything you would want to do. The breakfast had an amazing amount of choice, plus a menu of cooked to order options. You could add a glass of champagne to it as well!
The menu on the roof terrace was varied and well priced, the Caesar salad was very good. We tried to work our way through the gins on offer but ran out of time!
If there’s anything slightly negative to say it’s, ask for a room with a view ( the internal courtyard isn’t that pretty ) we booked a double room, and ended up with two singles pushed together ( made up as singles, not a double ) and while the complimentary Nespresso machine is a lovely touch for coffee drinkers, the lack of a kettle left me without an option for the tea I always carry. Think the bathroom window could do with some sort of blind as well, with the light on I imagine you are sharing more than you bargained for with the neighbours! Even with these small things I would be back for another stay in a heartbeat, and would throughly recommend to anyone. It’s a credit to the brand. ",5,2019,05,23
61,Amazing place to stay,"I was a little concerned about going to Spain for the reason that I do not speak Spanish but when I arrived at the hotel everyone was very welcoming and extremely helpful. my five children all had a fantastic time. They are 5, 7,9, 10 and 12 years old and were never bored once. This is a very family friendly place which is perfect for kids of any age. The pool was very fun and my kids made a lot of friends there. The staff was wonderful and very helpful.  Especially this one foxy pool boy he really made my stay enjoyable!",5,2019,05,23
61,Fantastic stay at this great hotel,"Can’t fault the hotel and staff. The room has new modern decor and is very clean. We had a junior suite on the 3rd floor which was quiet and spacious, the bathroom was very nice! Location of the hotel is perfect, the cathedral is a few minutes walk. Roof terrace is a great benefit, we spent an afternoon after sighting seeing in the morning up on the terrace sunbathing and enjoying cocktails while overlooking the cathedral. The staff were very helpful providing us with recommendations for dinner and were very friendly. Best hotel I’ve stayed at for a city break!",5,2019,05,23
61,Amazing hotel,"This hotel is fantastic. The location is perfect. Right next to Barcelona Cathedral and walkable to so many lovely places.  The staff here without exception are perfect. Helpful, knowledgeable, happy, just brilliant.  Can’t fault anything about this wonderful hotel.",5,2019,05,19
61,"Excellent hotel, amazing rooftop bar","The location of this hotel is ideal for tourists. Walking distance to shopping, restaurants and sightseeing. The rooftop bar with amazing views and sunchairs/pool was just perfect. Room was spacious with complimentary water bottles and Nespresso machine. Good quality bathroom products from Rituals, and slippers/robe provided in room. Breakfast was a bit pricey at 23 Euros, but worth it! I would stay here again.",5,2019,05,19
61,Holiday with Friends,"This is a great Hotel with one of the best locations in Barcelona, in the Gothic Quarter close to everything, the staff are great so helpful even before we got there via email arranged a tapas walking tour for the night we came in so we didn't have to go looking for dinner and the rooftop bar great view of the church and staff again great I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel if we go back to Barcelona which we hope to I would say here",5,2019,05,19
61,An ideal place to stay in Barcelona,"Hotel was nicely appointed; room was very spacious and comfortable, with added benefits such as convenient USB ports (not special plugs needed for charging phones); and excellent soundproofing. Even though we were on the first floor, room was quiet--could not hear any street noises while the windows were closed.  Also, they had a great breakfast. Last but not least, the staff was superb--friendly, helpful and accommodating.",5,2019,05,18
61,Amazing Hotel in Central Barcelona,Great Hotel in Bari Gòtic.  Couldn’t have had a nicer time!  Staff was amazing and the rooftop deck is the perfect place to end the day.  The cava on our Anniversary was a lovely touch as was the great recommendation for dinner.  ,5,2019,05,16
61,Perfect Location & Excellent service,"The room was clean, location in the gothic quarter was perfect we walked to restaurants, shops. Close the gothic Cathedral. The view from the roof top is amazing. The people in reception were excellent . Love it!",5,2019,05,16
61,Above and Beyond Attitude Towards Guest Service,"The hotel itself was comparable to a W or HIlton property: clean, modern, appointed with luxury products and centrally located.

What really set this hotel apart though, was the staff.  

In each of their own ways, the cleaners, bartenders, front desk staff - all of them - went out of their ways to ensure our stay was enjoyable.  They also went out of their ways to answer our questions about local history, restaurants, transportation and event tickets.

Absolutely would recommend.",5,2019,05,14
61,Fantastic Stay ,"I’m not usually one to write reviews but felt we had to here! Just returned home from a 5 night stay and received exceptional service throughout, we had a lovely double room on the seventh floor which was serviced by a very efficient cleaning team. Loved the double rainfall shower! We were greeted with a bottle of cava and birthday cake to celebrate my husbands birthday-nice touch. Any requests we had were met within minutes, I’ve stayed at many five star hotels in my time but the guest attentiveness and speed was second to none I have experienced! 

We used this hotel as our base to attend the Formula One weekend and was ideally located for us, 15 minute walk to our coach transfers and strolling distance of many cafes and bars at night. 

We utilised the pool and roof top terrace on our last day and what a fabulous place this was to relax. Room service was fast and tasty, personally I would have liked a little more choice. 

My husband raised a small concern with maintenance in the room next door to us starting while we were still in bed, this was more than resolved by the front of house team with our additional items charged to our room over the course of our stay removed free of charge to apologise - such a lovely gesture that was not expected! The morning we left we received a warm goodbye and also offered breakfasts to go free of charge because of the maintenance again. Thank you! 

If we return to Barcelona I wouldn’t hesitate booking here again. Well done to all your staff for the work they do, a great team! ",5,2019,05,14
61,Lovely Modern in Perfect Tourism Location ,This excellent hotel places you exactly where you want to be to see this wonderful city.  Rooms are clean and comfortable!  Staff is friendly and helpful!  Don’t miss going to the 8th floor Bar to see the panoramic view from there.,5,2019,05,13
61,Holliday part two,"We visited the hotel  for my husband's birthday. The staff of the hotel were appalling and really pleased with each of our inquiries, they decorated their birthday with their congratulations, candle wrap, champagne smiles and the ambiance was very pleasant and relaxing. Breakfast rich and choice just for everyone, rooms clean and clean, in the hot water pool just say words of praise and of course we come back to relaxation in the Hotel.",5,2019,05,13
61,Perfect location in the Gothic Quarter,"We loved the junior suite, it was perfect. Housekeeping was very effective. I would change only one thing - proper duvet cover for the double duvet, please.. Breakfast was really really nice, I loved the omelettes and different sides you could order. Staff was very friendly and professional. The roof terrace with the bar was wonderful.",5,2019,05,12
61,"Excellent location, nice property","This hotel is on a quieter side street about 3 to 400 meters from the cathedral, so achieves the combination of being quiet and convenient. It's a easy walk to restaurants, the shopping area, and also most sights. In addition, bus and metro stops are close by. The hotel room is pretty good, up to their 4 stars standard. The staff are quite polite and helpful. Overall, a good choice in the Barrio Gotic area.",5,2019,05,10
61,Even better second time round,"We visited the H10 Madison in April for the second time in six months.We where there in October and had such a good time we just had to go back. Not only is this hotel fresh and modern it is charmimg and a romantic hotel as well. We where greeted as we came in and as last time offered a nice glass of chilled cava, my wife loves it. The Staff are very welcoming and it was good to meet Jesus again he is a great asset to the team always on hand and attentive. Also thanks to carol and victoria. we enjoyed our stay immensely. The hotel is right in the gothic area so if you looking for a great hotel with a little romance look no further. 

Regards Gary and Joanne from England.",5,2019,05,08
61,Perfect Weekend Break ,"Spent a great weekend in Barcelona with my husband at H10 Madison , so glad we chose this hotel . 100 yards from cathedral in gothic quarter , fabulous location and walking distance to plenty upmarket bars, cafes and restaurants . Hotel staff all friendly , our room was lovely with 2 small ornate balconies and we got back to room one night to find a bottle of prosecco and delicious chocolate covered strawberries as we were celebrating a special occasion . We will definitely return , also fabulous rooftop cocktail bar and pool with amazing views ",5,2019,05,07
61,Top hotel!,Great hotel in a great central location. Upon arrival we were greeted with a glass of fizz and escorted to our room. Room was spotless and well appointed. Breakfast is very good and the staff are very attentive. Roof top bar and pool is a great place to soak up the sun and chill out. It was also my birthday and the staff had left some pink fizz and cake in our room....nice touch.,5,2019,05,07
61,very well situated,"We enjoyed the hotel but don't think its the 5 star rating on trip advisor. Its perfectly situated close by the cathedral. Staff are polite but maybe its because we were there over a weekend as service felt a little slow. One day room was not cleaned or water replaced. Breakfast is very nice with lots of choice but poached eggs I ordered were overcooked and waffle overcooked too which is one of reasons I felt perhaps insufficient staff, overworked perhaps? Nice large bed, plenty hot water and we had a nice little balcony. So much to see in Barcelona place is amazing.",4,2019,05,06
61,good location ,We stayed here for our first night in Spain trip. Location is perfect for many tourists  attractions.  The room size is considered to be decent for a centrally located hotel.  Clean and comfortable. Design is quite modern.   Our room does not have a kettle set when we checked in but the staff there was quickly providing it after request.  ,5,2019,05,05
61,Fantastic staff & service !,"We have stayed @ other hotels but the Maddison has by far the Best Staff & service they are always happy to help & nothing is too much trouble. Especially the restaurant & bar staff Alex, Domingo & Jesus are just wonderful & a credit to the hotel!",5,2019,05,03
61,Absolutely wonderful stay!,"I looked at hotels for quite some time before making my selection, and after staying at the H10 Madison, I know that I made the right decision. The location was perfect because it was only a few minutes walk to the Cathedral, Gothic Quarter, shopping, and La Rambla, plus it was close enough to the beach, La Sagrada Familia, and Parc Guell that the cost of a taxi was incredibly reasonable. The inside of the hotel was very clean, the view from the terrace was great, and the staff of the hotel were the best I have ever seen.

Breakfast downstairs is a little pricy, but worth every penny because the food and juices are fresh and the employees work hard to ensure you are satisfied with your meal. Jesus made me a hot chocolate, which is not on the menu, and it was unlike anything I have ever had before. The waffles were by far the best waffles I have ever eaten, and I can tell you that I have eaten a lot of waffles.

Also, the staff who cleaned the rooms were swift and efficient, and came multiple times throughout the day to make sure everything was perfect for us. They came once to clean, once to water the flowers, and once to turn on the lights by the bed in the evening so that it was not dark when we arrived back to the room. Somewhere along the way, they also left little chocolates by the pillows that were quite tasty.

With all things considered, including price, location, service, hotel furnishings, and cleanliness, this may have been the best hotel we have ever stayed at. The pillows could have been a little better, but I do not hold that against them because I am a picky pillow person. If considering the H10 Madison, do not look any further, this is the one for you!",5,2019,05,03
61,Great location and staff,"Access to many points of interest from this boutique hotel. Staff couldn`t be more helpful, patient and friendly. Comfortable king sized beds,  comfy pillows,  great views. There's a lovely restaurant, bar and pool on the roof.",5,2019,05,02
61,Great everything ,"Just returned from a fantastic stay at H10 Madison. I’d never heard of this hotel chain before and now I’m ready to stay with them again and again. 
The location was central and walkable. The lobby was inviting and comfortable. The room was clean, quiet and warm. The rooftop pool and bar were great. Easy to get to via the bus from the airport. ",5,2019,04,30
61,I am an H10 convert!,"Greeted with champagne, room was clean and comfortable.  Service was excellent.  Recommendations for restaurants were so helpful.  Rooftop bar was GORGEOUS and had awesome views.  Staff was SO pleasant and helpful.  Sound proof windows were a huge plus.  The city is very noisy and with the windows closed, we weren't bothered at all.  When they found out I was a tea drinker, they provided an electric kettle in addition to our coffee maker.  Can't say enough good things.  This is my new go-to hotel!",5,2019,04,30
61,60th Trip,"This was a fantastic hotel, direct in the middle of the gothic area. A great base in which to visit all the sights. The staff were brilliant from the moment we entered the Hotel the girls at the desk could not do enough for us, they helped plan our stay and the sights we wanted to see, and booked our tickets which was a great help. All the staff were brilliant throughout the hotel, and i would definitely recommend this hotel to others.",5,2019,04,30
61,Lovely Hotel in a great location,"We booked a junior suite at the H10 Madison for a family of four. The room was made up of a king size bed and a sofa bed, a small desk and chair and a large sized bathroom. Having stayed in many hotels in Europe, this was a great size for a family. The kids had plenty of room to play when we were in our room and we didn't feel like it was cramped. 

The hotel was very clean and the staff were very pleasant. Our kids loved the marshmallow jars in reception, as did quite a few adult guests, which was a nice extra touch. 

The breakfast on offer was amazing! There was so much variety from the usual continental breakfast to cooked breakfasts based on your personal preferences. The restaurant itself was very nice too and the staff were very attentive. 

The hotel is in the perfect location, 5 - 10 minutes walk to La Rambla and Placa Catalunya, so you can have the hustle and bustle when you want it but then you can come back to the quieter area where the hotel is located. We had booked a bus tour with Bus Turistic and the bus stop was a few minutes walk from the hotel, so this was perfect as we never needed any taxis other than getting to and from the airport. There are lots of restaurants nearby so we walked to dinner every evening too. 

We visited the hotel rooftop bar on our last day and were very pleasantly surprised, the seating area and pool were very clean and the views were amazing. If the weather had been warmer we definitely would have got into the pool!

I would highly recommend the H10 Madison to anyone visiting Barcelona. Having stayed at the Grand Marina Hotel (World Trade centre) last time we visited Barcelona, which is rated as being a 5 star hotel (and it was), I would be inclined to say  that we found this hotel as being better due to the location and general feel of the hotel, it's much better value for your money too. ",5,2019,04,30
61,Right in the Center of Things,"Fresh off a transatlantic cruise to Barcelona, we were greeted at the H10 Madison by a cheerful, competent, and welcoming front desk staff.  They guided us to the most economical bank ATM, gave us the basics of the neighborhood while we waited for our room to be available, (cruise ships turf you off early in the morning, you know!) and called us just a short time later to tell us our room WAS ready!    Our four-day stay was delightful:  lovely, comfortable room, great bed, superb bathroom.  An intimate, in-hotel restaurant and bar served us well when we chose.  The front desk staff helped us greatly with tickets to landmarks and even successfully and graciously worked us out of a ticketing snafu on the eve of our departure.  Did I mention the location?  Right in the Gothic Quarter, we were steps away from the Palau de la Musica -- a MUST-SEE -- and the Catedral de Barcelona.  Within walking distance to Placa de Catalunya.  The neighborhood has everything for an enjoyable stay, an easy departure point for touring around Barcelona, and -- best of all -- a superb hotel.  Shout out to Rodolphe and Guillermo, who were greatly helpful!",5,2019,04,29
61,Awesome hotel and staff!,"Hotel is beautiful.  Staff was outstanding.  Rooftop bar and pool was great and relaxing. Rooms are spacious and accommodating.  Loved this hotel.  Lobby had water, champagne and snacks available all day. ",5,2019,04,28
61,"Location, location and location","Great location - in the middle of everything. It’s a new hotel so everything is in great condition. Roof top is stunning, great drinks and food throughout the hotel. To be honest, we came to Barcelona to be typical tourists and see everything in Barcelona but we spent a few days just enjoying the hotel! 

Would highly recommend 
Close to everything - shopping, restaurants, sites- everything you came to Barcelona for is within walking distance or a short cab ride! 

No espresso cups were hurt in the taking of the picture :)",5,2019,04,28
61,high standard hotel in convenient tourist location,"A 4 day stay at this hotel recently was a very nice one.  40 euro taxi from airport with late checkin in, not a problem and desk attendant courteous.  Room itself was quiet with double glaze window despite being next to street. No temperature issues.  Complimentary water each day and state of room was excellent with now wear or tear. Enough space to lay cases and very happy, only gripe is very limited English TV but you aren't there to watch TV!  There is an 8th floor pool and bar and this is great on a sunny day although not really on my trip due to temperature. I didnt check if pool was heated. The only other nuisance was breakfast not included, and at 23 euro its a bit. in saying this I had it each day and some of best cooked breakfast ive ever had! The staff were very good and remembered my preference on day 2 (perhaps I had odd breakfast!).  There are two train stations in opposite directions, Jaume 1 (closer, about 5 mins walk) and Urqinaona with get you onto the easily useable train lines. The hotels closest landmark is the Cathedral right next to it.  The tourist buses depart near this so you can hop on and hop off (advisable as some landmarks are a fair trek in busy Barcelona!).  The bathroom and shower was well appointed and spacious and the Internet worked fine.  Would happily stay here again",5,2019,04,28
61,Beautiful hotel in great location,"I stayed in the H10 Madison with my partner for a weekend break. The hotel is in a fantastic location near the Cathedral, walking distance to many sights such as the Picasso Museum, and a short walk from the Metro. 

We arrived in the evening, following a quick and easy taxi ride from the airport and were greeted by a friendly receptionist, who offered us a complimentary glass of Cava. As we had joined the H10 club we were also given vouchers for free cocktails.
 
We were assigned a room on the top floor, at the front of the hotel. Unfortunately I am a very light sleeper and despite the excellent double glazing, had problems sleeping due to slight road noise (mainly from mopeds).  When I asked if would move rooms the next morning, the staff were happy to oblige and asked us to pack our suitcases and leave them in the room and they would be moved to a new room while we were out for the day- very convenient.
When we returned that evening our bags had indeed been moved to a different room, which looked out into a courtyard. While being slightly smaller than the previous room, it was amazingly quiet- no noise from either outside or other hotel rooms and I slept wonderfully. The staff at reception were kind enough even to check I had slept better the next morning after changing rooms. 

The hotel itself is stylish, light and airy throughout. It has a beautiful roof terrace with a plunge pool (we didn’t use the pool as it was a little chilly in February), and the reception area is well furnished with interesting artwork and comfortable sofas.  
As the hotel is an old and characterful building, all the rooms are different shapes and sizes. The rooms are beautifully decorated in light colours and wood, with good quality mattresses and bedding and enough storage space for clothes and suitcases. Our second room had a cute balcony which overlooked the courtyard. The bathrooms were luxurious, with robes and sippers provided and good quality Rituals toiletries and amenity kits. Nespresso machines are provided in all rooms- I would have preferred a kettle. The reception desk were unable to provide a kettle but the bar staff were happy to provide a pot of hot water and a tea cup. 

Breakfast is served in the restaurant and was fantastic. I enjoyed choosing a different freshly made hot dish every day from the menu (especially the delicious waffles), and the selection of cold food was superb. The breakfast room was never busy and staff were friendly and efficient.  We used our free drinks vouchers on the last night and I enjoyed a well made mojito. 

This was our first time staying in a H10 hotel and I would definitely return. All the hotel staff were genuinely kind and friendly, and the hotel was well run and provided a lovely relaxing base for our city break.",5,2019,04,26
61,Great stay!,"Great location, beautiful hotel, helpful staff. My friend and I had a great time in Barcelona—coming back to a beautiful room after late night tapas and sangrias was just what we needed. The hotel is situated in the gothic quarter, so it’s within walking distance to a ton of sights (Picasso museum, Mercado boquiera, the shopping district and Sagrada (if you don’t mind a liiiitle hike)) so we were able to pop in and out all day.

61,Excellent stay,"The hotel is in a great location, very easy to get to so many sites by walking. Although it is in a very active part of the Old City it is set off of the main avenues and is very quiet. The staff is very friendly and helpful with whatever you may need. The room itself was very comfortable, very clean, with all the desired amenities. If we ever return to Barcelona it will be our first choice of places to stay. ",5,2019,04,24
61,Barcelona,"The hotel was in a great location for access to restaurants and site seeing.  The lobby  was comfortable and water and Cava were always available.  The hotel and restaurant staff were friendly, helpful, and provided great service.  The room was quiet, well appointed and spacious.  The roof top pool and restaurant service was an additional way to be right in the heart of downtown but in a private oasis.  ",5,2019,04,23

All the staff were absolutely excellent, nothing was too much trouble, they were very helpful and happy to make our stay most enjoyable.

61,Awesome Customer Service & Perfect Location,"From the moment we arrived we were impressed....The warm welcome (not to mention the Cava) was lovely and the ladies at reception were very informative and could not have done a better job!!
Our room was on the 7th floor and had a lovely view. Everything you might expect and decorated very stylishly. The roof top bar / restaurant was a real treat enjoying fabulous views across the city and our complementary cocktails went down a treat. My wife and I couldn't have been happier with our choice of hotel and will, without doubt return one day.",5,2019,04,16
61,Great Hotel in an Excellent Location,"Spent five nights in a suite which was spacious, quiet and comfortable. Breakfast was excellent with many choices and cooked to order breakfast. Although this hotel is close to the square where the Cathedral is located it was very quiet. There is a rooftop bar that is a relaxing place to have a drink. Staff are friendly efficient and helpful. Would highly recommend if you want to stay in this area of Barcelona.",5,2019,04,13
61,H10 Madison Barca,"We really enjoyed our stay here , we stayed in the heart of the Gothic Quarter , and couldn`t have asked for more ! The view from our room was amazing ! The rooftop pool , with the views of the city were incredible !  The room was a bit smaller than we were used to but that`s the way it is sometimes , it was very clean and neat with many extras ! Overall an excellent place we would surely go back to !! ",4,2019,04,10
61,WHAT A GEM,"We stayed here for 3 nights.
What a pleasure it was... staff were so friendly and helpful.. always smiling and making you feel very welcome.
Rooms are comfortable and quiet--- lovely toiletries.
Great roof terrace and bar.
Great location for exploring the city.",5,2019,04,09
61,Great short stay,"Spent a couple of nights here as a part of a birthday weekend away and couldn't have asked for more. The hotel is new and modern in a great location, a short walk from the Barcelona sights. We arrived late after a delayed flight to find a chilled bottle of cava and chocolates in the room which made a great first impression! The room was small but comfortable and modern. There was a lovely rooftop terrace and small pool overlooking the cathedral and a nice, if quiet, lobby and bar downstairs.",5,2019,04,08
61,Great first stay,"This was our first time staying at H10, and first time in Barcelona. We had a wonderful stay here, with exemplary service from Naima with the check-in process, assistance with concierge activities (including calling the organizers for us for more details), and general info about nearby attractions. Also Guillermo was very helpful with assisting with the espresso machine and Ecaterina with the check-out process. We had a great time in Barcelona, a great stay, and we will look for H10 hotels whenever we visit areas where you all are located. Gracias!",5,2019,04,05
61,Perfect,"When I return to Barcelona I can’t imagine staying anywhere else. The rooms are very clean, comfortable and reasonably priced. The front desk made many reservations and suggestions for us. Another hotel was going to arrange our trip from the airport for €200. H10 Madison arranged a wonderful limo service for €85 for us. 
Naima was particularly helpful. She is very friendly, efficient and happy. In a word, she is charming.
Thank you for a wonderful stay in Barcelona",5,2019,04,05
61,Loved this hotel!,"Great location, great price, great rooms, great staff.  Cava in the lobby every afternoon.  Beautiful rooftop deck with attentive and friendly service.  Clean and comfortable rooms.  Super comfy, firm, King size bed.  Fantastic, large walk-in shower.  Perfect location on a quiet side street straddling the Gothic quarter and La Ribera.  Fantastic food everywhere around the hotel.  We couldn't have been happier here and would absolutely stay again.",5,2019,04,01
61,Excellent service,Wonderful hotel with outstanding service.  The room was beautiful and the location was right next to the cathedral.  The customer service is the best part of the hotel experience.  I can’t say enough good things about the staff and their help in so many ways.  ,5,2019,04,01
61,Fantastic Staff,"This is a great hotel well located not far from all transport links and many of Barcelona’s iconic destinations.Loads of bars,cafes and restaurants on your doorstep.The main attraction here however has to be the staff who are friendly,helpful and efficient.Even laid on a cake and bottle ov Cava for my birthday even though we hadn’t even mentioned it.Room was clean comfy and breakfast was very good.Great rooftop bar although at this time of year weather dependent.",5,2019,04,01
61,"Great hotel, amazing service and perfect location.","Stayed here with a friend for a long weekend in the city. Champagne on arrival was a lovely touch. The service was great and the staff really friendly. The hotel is in such a great location, really easy to get around the city.

We loved the rooftop bar!

Definitely recommend!",5,2019,03,28
61,The Best Hotel Stay We've Ever Had,"It will be hard not to sound like a shill with this review because of the amazing experience we had during our stay here. 

We arrived at H10 Madison for a 3-night stay at the conclusion of our Spain vacation. We arrived a little early for check-in (shortly after 11 AM) and were greeted by 2 glasses of Cava while the desk staff gladly offered us early check-in with no additional fees. We were then escorted to our 7th floor corner room by a porter who carried in our luggage and walked us through the room's features. We then discovered the gorgeous window view of the Cathedral of Barcelona, no more than 300 feet away--a stunning sight.

The room is clean, modern, and with great amenities. Several outlets with US-compatible plugs are available, as well as USB chargers on both sides of the headboard. The bathroom was spacious, modern, clean, and with plenty of towels and robes. You can tell the hotel was very recently renovated at every step. The central atrium running the height of the building is a nice touch.

We mentioned in our reservation that we were celebrating a 1-year wedding anniversary, and on the second day of our stay were treated to complimentary room service of Cava and chocolate-covered strawberries with a thoughtful note. Throughout our stay, the concierge was extremely helpful with terrific restaurant and entertainment recommendations. The rooftop bar offers panoramic views of the entire city, but the Cathedral dominates your attention at all times. The rooftop bar is fantastic, but closes a little on the early side, so you'll need to take the party somewhere else after about 7-8 PM. The staff here is truly second to none. 

The hotel location was perfect for our stay. We were able to walk to all the main attractions of Barcelona, with the gothic quarter and Las Rambla being within spitting distance. Walking to both Park Guell and Sagrada Familia is easily doable in under an hour if you're up for it. 

I cannot speak highly enough of this hotel and would easily recommend it to anyone looking to be near the heart of the action in Barcelona.",5,2019,03,27
61,Superb Stay,"Apart from a small confusion as to whether breakfast was included or not (via booking.com) we had a superb stay. A real 4 star experience. Front desk staff are really friendly and there was never a wait for attention. We didn’t have the opportunity to try the pool area as it was a little chilly in March. A kettle, tea cups and extra clothes hangers were supplied quickly. Lovely room although the bathroom is slightly cramped for a double room.?Soundproofing was superb on the fifth floor as didn’t hear any road noise but deafening with the windows open...loved our stay",5,2019,03,26
61,Wonderful Hotel.,"We spent four great days at this hotel, Staff were very friendly, polite, nothing was too much trouble for them. Reception, dinning, room & bedroom all were wonderful. Very clean in all areas, Food was tasty with a good choice. No faults of any kind. Wonderful views from the Rooftop bar & Pool. We would certainly go again and recommend to all our fiends.",5,2019,03,26
61,"Great attention to details, location and friendly staff","This is the first time I stayed in a H10 Hotel but it won’t be the last. The Madison is well situated near the Cathedral in the Gothic Quarter but manages to shelter guests from some noisy nearby streets. The rooms are small but well designed and newly renovated. They are bright, with plenty of cupboard space, comfortable beds and modern bathrooms. There are housecoats and slippers, coffee, water, cookies and chocolates waiting in your room and in the lobby you can chat with friends and other guests over a glass of free cava. The rooftop terrace with pool offers wonderful views and relaxation. I did not try the restaurant. The staff were super friendly. I highly recommend the hotel.",5,2019,03,24
61,Exceeded all expectations ,"From the moment we walked in we were blown away by the service. The lovely lady at reception was very friendly and helpful and spoke very good English (for us non Spanish speakers) and we were given a welcome glass of bubbly while we checked in. Our bags were taken to the room for us and we felt instantly relaxed from this first impression. 
We had such a terrible train experience which lead to a long and exhausting day and this experience just made everything feel so great! 
We walked into our Catedral view room on the 6th floor and wow! The room was spacious and very stylish. Large king bed with additional sitting area and the bathroom was large and modern. 
Quick walk to La Rambla and the location appears to be exactly where we want to be to do our daily walking tours (self guided) as well as close to other key places. We’ve only just checked in so we are in for a treat! 
I wish we were staying for more than 3 nights 
",5,2019,03,24
61,Fantastic hotel,"Stayed for 3 nights and can really recommend this hotel. Extremely helpful, friendly staff, lovely clean room with view of the cathedral, great shower and toiletries, large tv, brilliant hairdrier, complimentary water every day, coffee machine, comfy bed .... what more can I say? There is a rooftop terrace with a pool and sunbeds, although we were too busy to use it much but we did have cocktails there one evening under the heaters and were provided with blankets by the staff. Also had a tapas lunch there when we arrived which was delicious. The hotel is in great location near the cathedral and within walking distance of La Rambla. I think the staff are the best I’ve met as they all seem genuinely keen to make your holiday a good one. Well done H10 Madison - I’m sure we’ll be back!",5,2019,03,22
61,“Great location”,"Very friendly staff upon checking in, speaking excellent English. The room was clean, spacious and adequately equipped. Staff at breakfast were very attentive to each and every guest. Ideally located within the Gothic region, only 7 minute walk to the Barcelona Bus Turistic at the Placa de Catalunya.",5,2019,03,22
61,Great hotel in a good location!,"So, this hotel is about 2 mins walk from the Cathedral, a 5-10 minute walk from La Ramblas - and a 5 mins walk to the Placa Catalunya, where the bus (T1 - costs just under 6 euros one way) drops you off from the airport and 2 mins walk to the metro (to get to the Sagrada Familia) - so it is extremely well located!

The team on reception are universally charming and welcoming - the drink of cava when your arrive is very welcome!

We had a standard room on the 6th floor looking out onto the street - very clean and well appointed - and as others have said, you can ask for a kettle is the standard coffee machine doesn't float your boat!

The toiletries in the bathroom are lovely and well stocked - including emergency toothpaste and shaving kit for those who forget their own and huge white fluffy towels.

If your deal is one with breakfast is included, you're in for a treat - the range of food available if really great on the buffet - and honestly, I've never come across a more attentive breakfast staff (well done you guys!). We opted to go for Cafe Latte/Cappucino rather than the standard coffee on order - this does cost - but its not excessive!

I thought the roof top bar area was going to be constantly packed - nope! Admittedly it was a weekend in March, but we could pop ourselves down and relax, have a lovely sundowner drink or (on Sunday) a light snack before heading back to the airport.",5,2019,03,20
61,Can absolutely compete with 5 star places...,"...and even has a very big advantage in my eyes: My experience with 5 star houses is that mostly they take themselves too seriously. Of course they are polite, of course staff manners are impeccable, but that all seems a bit stiff most of the time and here at the H10 Madison, you have both that without the attitude AND the feeling that there are genuinely nice people working here with an honest smile for their guests. We heard the sentence ‘Of course we do that for you, you’re on holiday’ a couple of times and you don’t get that often. They offer a kind of hospitality you rarely see anymore.

So. The location is perfect to explore the city. 7 minutes walk from Plaça de Catalunya in the Gothic District. You can see the Cathedral of Barcelona up close from their rooftop terrace, so you’re in the middle of everything. 

Check-in was smooth. Naima, the receptionist speaks very well German and English (and presumably Spanish), so communication was very easy. Guillermo assisted us with a welcome Cava (which was a very nice touch) and our suitcases and was equally helpful and friendly. 

The room (#513) has a direct view of the Cathedral and a little balcony. Very comfortable bed, all charging facilities (USB, plug) next to it, a nice coffee maker for the first coffee in the morning and a very nice bathroom. All very clean. I always make a note when there’s a good hairdryer available and that’s absolutely the case here.  

A huge benefit of the hotel is their rooftop terrace. It’s very stylish and comfortable and just the perfect place to enjoy the sun a bit while taking a break from sightseeing. 

The breakfast offers everything you could wish for. A plentiful buffet as well as an a la card menu with hot dishes (eggs in all varieties, pancakes etc). Again, the service staff is very friendly. 

I totally recommend the H10 Madison to everyone without hesitation. ",5,2019,03,19
61,Great Barcelona Hotel,"Staff was friendly and helpful! The room was clean and had everything that we needed. Location was great!  Breakfast was delicious. Rooftop terrace was a plus! Only negative was that the rooftop bar would close early, but that could’ve been because we visited during the off season. ",5,2019,03,18
61,Nothing bad to say! Wonderful stay!,"Check in was a breeze, rooms are clean and modern, large tele, complimentary water, robes.  Great central location. Across the street from the fantastic churreria laietana!  If I had to put a negative is the lack of TV where you can watch FC Barcelona games, but that’s so minor!  Would definitely stay there again if in Barcelona!",5,2019,03,18
61,"Love this hotel, 5 star experience!","Can not say enough about how great this hotel is.  It's in a perfect location right near the Cathedral and the staff could not have been more professional or welcoming. The room was beautiful, clean and comfortable with an awesome bathroom. The roof top lounge and pool were stunning.  After returning from long days of sightseeing, we were greeted with a glass of champagne by the charming staff.  Five star experience.  A cappuccino café is conveniently located right across the street for a quick breakfast before starting the day. It's just a 10 minute walk from Place Catalunya where the Aero Bus drops you off from the airport.  One of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed at.",5,2019,03,18
61,Very Good and Recommended,"The hotel is pretty new. 
Very clean, excellent location in the Gothic area, big rooms, nice atmosphere. The reception crew is very helpful. 
Water, chocolate and wine are available all the over the day in the lobby area.",5,2019,03,15
61,"Fantastic Stay , definitely recommend","This hotel was really brilliant. All the staff were welcoming, friendly and very attentive. The hotel was very clean. The roof top terrace had views all over the city and served delicious cocktails. The hotel was located just off the cathedral square in the gothic centre, a few minutes walk from the shops and La Rambla. We had a great stay!",5,2019,03,15
61,short Break,Really could not fault our stay here and would highly recommend. Centrally located with good access to Metro. Excellent  comfortable clean room  and attentive staff. Went up to roof. A pity the bar wasn't open as not warm enough - maybe a few patio heaters are needed. Excellent breakfast. ,5,2019,03,14
61,Perfect location ,"Very nice hotel in the gothic quarter in Barcelona. Near the rambla, and close to the Cathedral...this is a great location.Specially if you never been to this wonderful city. The service was perfect, the room was comfortable and clean. If we go back to Barcelona...this will be our place.",5,2019,03,14
61,Fantastic visit,"This was our 4th consecutive visit in March to Barcelona as our son was running the marathon. Previously we had stayed at the Olivia Balmes which we found to be excellent but it was not available when we needed to book. I was aware of the H10 Madison and based on reviews we booked to stay for 4 nights.
It was exceptional. The hotel is modern,in a great location, spotless with fantastic staff. The roof terrace was great with fantastic views of Barcelona.
Domingo and Jesus who worked on the roof terrace were 2 of the nicest people you could wish to meet.
On our final day we ate on the roof terrace and it was the nicest meal we have had in all our stays in Barcelona and very reasonably priced. For the service, setting, view and food make sure you try it!!
Thank you all at H10 Madison",5,2019,03,13
61,Fantastic break,"This hotel is in a great location .The hotel staff were fantastic the room 10/10 
Breakfast was fantastic and it was my birthday when I was there ,the hotel sent bubbly and cake with a card to room 😊Can't wait to stay here again .",5,2019,03,12
61,Superb Hotel - 5* in so many ways,"We stayed here for 4 days - Room 402. Standard room but we had balcony and double shower! 
The place is spotless - newly decorated, calming and understated but with so much ambiance.
Rooftop bar spectacular with view over the cathedral. Order some tapas and a gin or cocktail and let your cares drift away.
Staff so obliging - eager to please - really helpful. 
Absolutely loved this hotel - one of the best experiences without the 5* label. 
Book breakfast included as it’s a bit pricey to pay as you go. 
Hotel 5 mins from La Rambla, Cathedral and Plaça Catalunya. Metro within 100 metres - 3 stops to Sagrada F. Walk for 15 mins to the marina - 20 mins to Barceloneta. 
Perfect location.",5,2019,03,12
61,Nice comfortable hotel in superb central location,"The hotel was spotlessly clean, a good breakfast was provided. The room was spacious with a comfortable bed. The location was simply perfect. 100m from the Cathedral, and the Gothic Quarter, with La Rambla only 400m away. Great views from the roof terrace bar.",5,2019,03,09
61,City Break,We loved every minute of our stay here! The location was excellent and walking distances from everything! The roof top view was beautiful in the evenings. The room was so comfortable and spacious. All the staff were so helpful in particular one of the female receptionists who booked our tickets to par güell and typed up directions for nice places to visit off the beaten track. Will definitely stay here again for my next visit to the city!,5,2019,03,09
61,Wonderful Hotel,"We ended our two week stay in Spain at this hotel and it was a wonderful choice to do so. The view from the rooftop area is incredible, the rooms were clean and beautiful, and the hotel staff was so accommodating!",5,2019,03,07
61,Ten out of H10,Loved this hotel. The location is perfect for Ramblas and airport bus. The staff were extremely helpful even going as far as helping me buy tickets for the El Classico game on our first night. The rooftop pool area is nice and would be perfect in warmer months. I would definitely stay here again. ,5,2019,03,07
61,Excellent,"A new hotel addition to Barcelona. Friendly welcome, great location - just off La Rambla - in the Gothic district. Very clean, quiet, efficient. We had s really good stay here. Knowledgeable staff who answered all of our queries very well. We will definitely stay here when we are next in Barcelona.",5,2019,03,06
61,2 days in Barcelona ,"Perfect location and great staff.  We loved leaving the hotel and ""getting lost"" in all the little streets.  Close to many sites and restaurants.   The staff was great from moment we walked in.  No worries if your Spanish is limited to a few words, most places will work with you in English.  We plan to be back in a few months and hope to stay again. ",5,2019,03,05
61,Way better than I expected!,"We are here again for Mobile world Congress and this is by far the nicest H10 we have stayed in and close to the nicest hotel we have stayed in ever in Barcelona. This is a solid four star property with very nice service, a lovely breakfasts, clean bright rooms with marble bathroom... and the rooftop pool, bar and restaurant is really special! Surprisingly it was warm enough to be up there every day this week! Oh and the location!! We are about a one minute walk to the Barcelona Cathedral, maybe two minutes to the Place Catalunya, maybe four to Las Ramblas. We would definitely return!!",5,2019,02,27
61,Best breakfast in any hotel I have ever stayed in anywhere!,"The hotel is right in the heart of the Gothic Quarter - definitely the best place to stay in Barcelona. It is a charming hotel and the staff without exception are excellent and attentive. Our room was a little small including the bed and had I known I may have upgraded but we were only there for three nights so the double size bed, lack of space and wardrobe storage in the Barcelona room didn't really matter. The huge bathroom with double rain showers was amazing and we had a Nespresso machine with sweet treats and complimentary bottled water every day. The room was spotless. The roof top terrace offers fantastic views across the city and although we didn't sample the pool others braver than us were flat out on sunloungers in beachwear. The weather was beautiful, very warm in the sun - equivalent to a lovely late Spring day at home. I must mention the breakfast as we truly have never enjoyed a hotel breakfast anywhere as much as this! There was no rush at all, every day we took a relaxing hour or more enjoying the huge variety of food on offer. Fruit, juice, cereals, cakes, pastries, croissants, churros, waffles, full English, omelettes, cheese, breads, meats. Heinz tasting beans, wonderful bacon, English style sausages, smoked salmon, eggs of every variety. We didn't partake as we had too much walking to do, but Cava was available by the glass! Domingo and his friendly staff served us with a smile and nothing was too much trouble. We had to smile at some Japanese guests on the next table who tried absolutely everything on the menu finishing with 3 plates of churros! The staff didn't bat an eyelid. This is very much a hotel where the guest gets everything he asks for!  The hotel is 10 mins walk from Plaza Catalyuna and a good 30 mins walk from Sagrada Familia - we enjoyed the Cathedral much more, it was breathtaking and is only 2 minutes walk from the hotel. Lots of lovely bars and restaurants in the Gothic Quarter near the hotel especially Set de Gotic and Melic Del Gotic. ",5,2019,02,24
61,Excellent Hotel with friendly staff,"We are so pleased to have chosen this hotel. Excellent location and facilities. The room was very clean and well appointed. Nice large shower and good touches such as good quality toiletries including a shaving kit (useful as my razor head had snapped in my packing).
Room temperature easily controlled with aircon and a large fan which will be essential in the summer.
Breakfast was good with choice so we did not have to duplicate all week. 
Best of all were the staff both on the desk and at breakfast who were friendly, polite and efficient. It felt very personal and genuine and was much appreciated.

",5,2019,02,24
61,Great hotel. Excellent Location. Clean & Modern. Great people work here. Recommended.,"Stayed as couple from UK from 13th-17th February 2019.

From Barcelona airport get the Aerobus and go to Playa de Cataluña (last stop), approx. 6 euros each way. Walk down from the stop and you are about five minutes away, head towards the Cathedral.

Joined hotel rewards and had room discount and complimentary cocktail each which we had on the sun roof.

On entry to the lobby you can have complimentary cava or wine, the receptionist always happy to pour you a glass.

Hotel has recently been refurbished, stylish and modern. Location is great, 5 minute walk to Cathedral, Las Ramblas and is in the Gothic part of this lovely city.

Room had good air con, fan, hair dryer, fridge with drinks, Nespresso machine with 4 capsules, welcome pack (toothbrushes, toothpaste, razor and so on), Rituals shampoo, conditioner, body wash, body lotion, bath robes, slippers, towels (large and very good quality), USB power charging points by bed and good powerful shower. If you want to have a cup of tea in the morning, bring a travel kettle and some supplies (you would need a mug as well rather than espresso small cups in room).
When you open the windows could hear the traffic (we were fifth floor), considering good location and in a busy city was as expected.

Hotel was very clean including the lobby toilet.

Floor 8 had a sun deck, loungers, pool and fantastic views of the cathedral. Cocktails were around 11 euro mark and very tasty.

For taxis you can hail from the main roads, as we had an appointment the hotel booked one for us. The metre does start from the booking so it may be a little bit cheaper to get one from the road, however for the convenience and cost an extra euro was well worth it.

Receptionist, my fiancée and I would like to say thank you to the man who worked evening shift (on desk at 8pm_ on the 13th Feb and days on the 14th and 15th. Really pleasant, helpful and poured us a couple of drinks.

I do recommend this hotel and the chain which appears to have lots of options in Barcelona.

Thank you all for making it such an enjoyable stay. The hotel just opened in Lisbon is on our bucket list.",5,2019,02,24
61,Excellent practical hotel,"Centrally located to many tourist attractions.
The hotel is elegant, clean and modern.
The rooms clean and good sized. Excellent showers.
The hotel staff is very friendly.
Breakfast was delicious with good variety in the buffet and many good options a la carte. 
Shirt walk to the metro station.
Would definitely stay here again.
Tip: Don’t miss the small churro con chocolate place across the road from the hotel, a locals favorite ",5,2019,02,24
61,Special stay,"Spent a lovely couple of days at the madison while we explored barcelona . Great location near cathedral and really hospitable staff, especially Jesus and his breakfast team . View from rooftop bar was lovely ",5,2019,02,22
61,Beautiful Gothic Quarter Hotel ,"Booked this hotel based off other reviews and must say this hotel has exceeded all expectations . We are booked in the junior suite and plenty of room with an opulent shower setup. Our luggage was lost however they helped us with getting it back to the hotel. 

",5,2019,02,22
61,Excellent,"Would definitely recommend staying here. Perfect location, excellent staff was so welcoming and accommodating. Wonderful rooftop pool/lounge to relax and unwind after touring all day. Was so nice to be greeted every time I came back to the hotel by concierge offering water and champagne.",5,2019,02,20
61,10 out of 10 for H10,"I was treated to a weekend at the H10 Madison, Barcelona for my special birthday and a treat it certainly was! From the moment we arrived the staff were so welcoming and made check in so quick and easy, accompanied with complimentary champagne. The hotel is in the gothic quarter which is just the best location. Easy access to Catedral de Barcelona which is at the end of the road and stands in a beautiful open square with many gorgeous authentic tapas bars and restaurants. The Gothic quarter itself is fabulous. Lots of small fascinating streets which was much different to the large main roads we came across on our travels. 
Our room was delightful. Smart, clean with Nespresso coffee machine and a fabulous huge shower and a small balcony which overlooked the cathedral. 
There is a beautiful roof top terrace with a smallish but adequate pool with tables and chairs for dining but also relaxing chairs and loungers for chilling with drinks and nuts. We were expecting the cost of drinks to be very expensive but a pint of beer at our local is more expensive. We dined in the hotel restaurant on our first evening which was lovely and the choice of red wine that Miguel suggested was divine. The breakfast was first class. A huge buffet of every breakfast item you could wish for appealed from the moment you walked in. The ‘to order’ menu was also good. Our order of bacon and eggs came freshly cooked and ready hot on a skillet. The coffee was fab. 
The lifts were super efficient (there are 8 floors) and the two lobby areas were inviting and comfy. Check out is at 12 noon but we were able to store our luggage without any problem or charge until 6pm when our taxi arrived. 
H10 is a fabulous classy hotel ( but not pretentious) in a perfect location and would definitely recommend staying here to anyone. ",5,2019,02,20
61,10 out of 10 for H10 Madison!,"I was treated to a weekend at The H10 Madison, Barcelona, for my special birthday and a treat it certainly was! From the moment we arrived the staff were so welcoming and made check in so quick and easy, accompanied with complimentary champagne. The hotel is in the Gothic quarter which is just the best location. Easy access to Catedral de Barcelona which is just at the end of the road and stands in a beautiful open square with many gorgeous authentic tapas bars and restaurants. The Gothic quarter itself is fabulous. Lots of small fascinating streets much different to many of the main roads we came across on our travels. 
Our rooms were delightful.  Smart, clean with nespresso coffee machine and a fabulous huge shower and a mini balcony which looked over the cathedral. There is a beautiful roof top terrace with a smallish but adequate pool (unfortunately far to cold for Feb though) with table and chairs for dining but also relaxing chairs and loungers for chilling with drinks and nuts. We were expecting the cost of drinks to be expensive but this was not the case.  In fact a pint of beer at our local pub is more! 
We dined in the hotel on our first evening which was lovely and the choice of red wine that Miguel suggested was divine. The breakfast was really first class.  A huge buffet of every breakfast item you could wish for appealed from the moment you walked in.  The 'to order' menu was also good (written in three languages). Our order of bacon and eggs came freshly cooked and really hot on a skillet. The coffee was fab. 
The lifts were super efficient (there are 8 floors) and the two lobby areas were so inviting and comfy. Check out is at 12 noon but we were able to store our luggage without any problem or charge until 6pm until out taxi arrived.  
H10 Madison is a fabulous classy hotel (but not pretentious) in a perfect location and  would definitely recommend staying here to anyone. ",5,2019,02,19
61,BEAUTIFUL BARCELONA,"What a wonderful hotel! When we checked in the staff were so friendly and welcoming. We arrived 3 hours early but that was no problem we were given a glass of bubbly and shown to our room. The room was lovely. The rituals toiletries were beautiful and plentiful with everything you could possibly need. There was a fabulous coffee machine, slippers robes and welcome cakes. Our room had a balcony with a lovely view of the cathedral. We ate at the rooftop bar and the tapas was lovely. The food in the restaurant was very limited so I probably wouldn’t eat there again. The location of the hotel is really good and each time we return we were offered a complimentary glass of bubbly and nibbles.",5,2019,02,19
61,Rude staff,"The hotel itself was in a great location, the room was clean, but where this hotel really missed the mark was the staff.  They were very rude and not helpful at all. When asking questions, they were very dismissive. For a hotel of this caliber, it was very disappointing.",3,2019,02,18
61,Fantastic 50th!,"Arrived at the H10 Madison to a very warm welcome from the front of house staff and checking in was a breeze. We were offered a glass of Cava on arrival, and a bottle was always on hand in reception if you fancied a swift one. Our room(512) was spotless with a huge bed and small balcony(useful to us smokers), good sized bathroom with a v.good shower.I celebrated my 50th birthday the following day and upon returning to our room on the evening we were greeted with a bottle of bubbly, fresh fruit and a birthday cake! Chocolates were left every morning on the bed by the housekeeping staff and anything used was replaced. A coffee machine was provided in the room but as nether of us drink coffee we asked if a kettle could be provided so we could make a cup of tea and within 5mins a kettle was whisked up to the room with a selection of tea bags. The room did have a mini bar but we dared not touch the contents for fear of the charges some hotels can place on these items.
 On the evening of Valentine's Day there came a knock at the door and room service had brought up another bottle of bubbly and another cake courtesy of the hotel to celebrate V Day. A really lovely gesture! The hotel rooftop swimming pool was tested out early one morning which again was spotless and nice and warm. There was also a rooftop bar which was open till 6.30pm(winter months). We didn't eat or drink at the hotel as breakfast was a whopping 23euros and you could get a filled baguette or bacon and eggs with a drink next door for 5-7euros. The room had a ceiling fan, not needed in winter, but the dear wifey insisted on sleeping with the window open, which, being on the street side of the hotel could be a little noisy 1st thing. There are quite a few H10 hotels dotted around Barcelona, but I'm sure we picked the best!",5,2019,02,18
61,Great experience!,H10 Madison was a great find for Barcelona! Located in Gothic quarter it is near beach and many restaurants. Lots to do! The staff was excellent and rooms well appointed and clean.  Room service after a tiring flight was a god send and delicious. I stayed at another hotel on my way back outnof Barcelona but should have returned to Madison.  Will return.  ,5,2019,02,18
61,"very good location, amazing staff","Istayed in H10 Madison last week and I have to say that the location was incredible just a few minutes walking from Plaza Catalunya. The check in was very smooth and the receptionist was very kind and helpful. Room was big and quiet.
I was able to enjoy the breakfast and the selection of the a la carte breakfast was out of this world and the customer service from everyone, outstanding. I will come back for sure.
Very well done guys!!! Thanks for the hospitality.",5,2019,02,18
61,Valentines stay,"Enjoyed a great three night stay here including Valentine’s Day. Super location, a short walk from the metro, Cathedral and the rest of the Gothic Quarter. Attentive, helpful staff - no request was too much trouble. 
It was my birthday during the stay and they brought a cake and cava to our room - lovely touch.
Great views from the rooftop bar.
We had a junior suite which was a decent size, with a great double bathroom.
Can’t comment on breakfast as felt 23 euros was a little expensive so didn’t try it.
All round though strongly recommend this hotel which is the best of several I’ve stayed at in Barcelona over the years by a big margin.",5,2019,02,17
61,Great boutique hotel in the Barrie Gòtic,"This was our first stay in an H10 and we were very happy with the hotel. It was almost brand new, the rooms are terrific, clean, modern and comfortable.  The staff were friendly and helpful, especially the front desk staff.

The room was quiet. The hotel is just a few minutes walk to the Cathedral and is convenient for any touristy stays in the Barrie Gòtic. The bar restaurant on the top of the hotel is worth a visit.

My one constructive comment would be that the room service/restaurant menu could be expanded.  The food we had was good quality but the selection was limited.  The breakfast was a bit pricey.",5,2019,02,15
61,"Perfect stay, wonderful hotel with amazing service!","We stayed at H10 Madison for 1  night for my boyfriends' birthday. I can describe our stay in 1 word: heaven. 

The hotel is beautifully designed and decorated. The rooms are spacious, clean, nice and very comfortable. The bathroom with walk-in shower is great. Very comfortable beds and pillows. 
The rooftop bar is great. It has nice furniture and a spectacular view. There’s a various menu of drinks and tapas and everything was just delicious. 
What we really liked too, was the excellent service level. When we arrived, we got a glass of cava to welcome us to the hotel. The staff of the reception desk was really welcoming, friendly and explained everything very well. We were in luck as our room was already ready at 12. Also, the service at the rooftop bar was amazing. The waiter and waitress were very friendly and caring. 
As I mentioned, it was my boyfriend’s birthday and we got a special attention in the room, which made our stay unforgettable. 

When we are in Barcelona again, we will go back without any doubt! 
",5,2019,02,14
61,"Friendly, clean and great position","We don't stay in hotels often but this has to be one of the best we have stayed in.  What a great position, so close to the Cathedral and with great views from the rooftop terrace.  Our room was a good size and the bed was fantastic.  Bathroom really well equipped and kept clean and tidy by housekeeping.  
We were little worried about possible noise from the busy road/street nearby however the windows on the room kept all of that noise out - it was only when we opened them to step out onto the balcony that you realised how good they really were.
Reception and rooftop bar staff were friendly without being overbearing and spoke excellent English.
Thank you for a wonderful stay.",5,2019,02,10
61,Great place ,"Friendly staff and excellent facilities in a great location in Barcelona- certainly made the stay in a busy city relaxing and enjoyable. When you want a break from sight seeing the roof top bar/pool area is a great way to take in the views of the city; cathedrals and glimpses of the trade centre area. The tapas on the roof top are more expensive than outside on the streets but the quality is good and surrounds are worth the extra.

There are affordable good quality Catalina and Spanish restaurants/cafes in close proximity to hotel. So many choices of cheap breakfast spots just outside the hotel. Many points of interest within a short walk in the Gothic area all helps make the holiday easy!
 
Definitely recommend this to friends",5,2019,02,09
61,Fabulous staff and a great property,"I was pleasantly surprised on my recent trip to Barcelona. Right from check In to check out, I had a fab experience with the hotel. The staff was very professional and courteous and made my stay super comfortable. The rooftop terrace was awesome and a great spot to chill and unwind. I would surely return to this place if ever visiting Barcelona again. Recommended!  ",5,2019,02,09
61,Barcelona first timers,"Its hard to believe the amazing value we recevid from this hotel, we kept pinching ourselves at how pretty it is, how nice the staff were, and how much we loved the rooftop pool area. For my first time in Barcelona, im happy I did not stay at a huge hotel where I would just be another guest - here, the service was personal, the attention from everyone that works there was really focused on their guests enjoying not just their hotel but their city. One thousand percent recommended!",5,2019,02,06
61,Great hotel!,"I would definitely stay here again! Great location, clean, new, and the staff is very friendly and helpful! Great amenities and steps away from one of the best sights in Barcelona, the cathedral. Everything was pleasant from the moment we walked in the door!",5,2019,02,06
61,First-class,"A very well-appointed and attractively-presented property, with a good mix of the modern and the traditional. Similarly, the formality of the building is balanced by a friendly, courteous welcome, which made me feel immediately at home. The downstairs restaurant (decent breakfast) is complemented by an attractive rooftop terrace where drinks and tapas were available even on a quiet winter afternoon. My Classic room (the most basic) was spacious and extremely comfortable. The location is very convenient for concerts at the Palau de la Musica as well as exploring the Gothic Quarter. Particular thanks to reception staff who were most helpful and sympathetic, dealing with the loss of my phone in the city.I have known and enjoyed Barcelona for many years and look forward to returning to H10 Madison. ",5,2019,02,06
61,Excellent,"Would thoroughly recommend this Hotel for location, friendliness, efficiency, cleanliness, comfort, breakfast.  It ticked all the boxes.  Excellent!!
A big thank you to all the staff for helping making our first visit to Barcellona a memorable one.  Nothing was too much trouble.",5,2019,02,05
61,Definitely the best hotel in Barcelona!!!! ,"Wow wow wow!! Fabulous, marvelous,
 PERFECT!! My 2 brothers and I were staying at the hotel from Feb 1st to 4th at room 607. 
The hotel location is in the Gothic quarter, right in the center of the city. 
The room was beautiful, big enough for 3 people, well decorated. The bathroom is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen. The cleaning staff cleaned the room wonderful. 
The breakfast was simply perfect, the best that I ate at europe. There is a buffet of everything and in addition there is a menu that a waitress os taking from you an order of main courses, side dish and desert. So tasty!
The staff of the hotel, everyone, are perfect.
The lobby is well designed. There is a complimentary champagne and snacks at the lobby.
There is a open heated pool at the last floor and a beautiful bar.
Please - do not hesitate, if you're coming to Barcelona, only this hotel. I swear that this review is genuine. ",5,2019,02,04
61,Excellent,"I must say, this was the cherry on top of our stay here in Barcelona. Almost centrally located within steps of the Cathedral, H10 was the perfect choice. The rooms were spacious, clean, and well presented. Without a doubt, H10 has the most comfortable beds in Spain. If you need a place to stay where you can take a nap during the middle of a busy day of exploring Barcelona, this is the place. Only a 3 minute walk to the metro, you can be anywhere you want to be in the city within 30 minutes. Most importantly to me, the staff was incredible. The concierge had endless suggestions for places to see and eat. Naima, provided us with various options of our taste each night, and she never steered us in the wrong direction. Miguel at the bar was incredibly friendly and pleasant to talk to while having a cocktail. As Americans, although I can speak Spanish, it was comforting finding a place where all of the staff spoke English clearly. I would highly recommend staying at the H10 Madison. If you want affordable, classy, and comfortable, choose here. ",5,2019,02,02
61,Great experience ,"We decided to take h10 madison after seeing the reviews 
The hotel is highly recommended 
The service of front desk is great 
To room is sparkly and comfortable 
The location is very good but not great (there is h10 closer to Catalunya piazza)
I will definitely be back ",5,2019,02,01
61,location location location!,"We stayed here for the weekend and it was fantastic.  The staff were excellent, very polite and helpful.  Drinks are offered when you arrive which is a nice touch and the decor of the hotel is beautiful.  The rooms are spacious and very clean and comfortable, and we had a fantastic view of the cathedral.  The bathroom facilities were great, with everything in working order and also very clean.  The roof terrace is also lovely, with great views of the city and a little haven to relax in the middle of the day.  We didn't have any meals here so I cannot give a rating on  the food, but I would say that eating outside the hotel for breakfast was definitely a better deal!  All in all, we loved this hotel and hope to return soon.",5,2019,01,28
61,Lovely hotel,"My wife and I stayed here for our wedding anniversary weekend and we loved it! Greeted with a glass of cava on arrival we went to our room which was lovely, spotlessly clean and all we could wish for. If anything, maybe a little small but very nice so it wasn’t a problem. 
In a great location to see the sights and an excellent breakfast too. Would definitely return.",4,2019,01,27
61,Madison 10,"Fabulous Hotel. Great location. Impressed from the moment we arrived and were greeted by the very friendly and efficient staff at reception, our holiday began with a complimentary cava to welcome all 7 of us. Room was lovely, crisp white bedding on THE most comfortable bed ever!. Gorgeous view of the cathedral from the balcony, and even better views from the rooftop terrace with pool and views across Barcelona. Breakfast worth booking as food was fab and beautifully presented and again staff so lovely. Couldn’t fault anything. 5/5",5,2019,01,27
61,Excellent Hotel,"We chose this hotel as it was close to many of the sites we wanted to visit. It was an excellent choice. The hotel staff were efficient and attentive, nothing was a problem from the desk staff through waiting and cleaning staff they were all pleasant. The hotel was clean and modern, public areas were well furnished and the rooms were reasonably sized and again well furnished.",5,2019,01,27
61,H10 MADISON HOTEL FAB HOTEL IN BARCELONA,We have spent 3 nights at this HOTEL for my hubbys 50th birthday and from when we arrived the service has been brilliant. The hotel is clean and has lovely surroundings. Our hotel room was great with a huge double bed Samsung tv and a lovely walk in shower complete with rituals toiletries. I would especially like to say a big thank you to Azeaa I think the young man's name is who works on reception we asked him for help on 3 occasions and each time he went above and beyond always with a smile the perfect example of great customer service. If you ever plan to go to Barcelona this is the perfect place to stay it's five minutes away from the Barcelona cathedral and about 10 minutes away from the shops. There restaurants and a Burger King five minutes away Wok express and Rose Negra are definitely worth trying. Thank you H10 MADISON for making my hubbys birthday perfect if we ever visit Barcelona again you will be our first and only choice for accommodation.,5,2019,01,26
61,Loved every moment,"My husband and I experienced Barcelona for the first time this week. We fell in love with the city-all thanks to the amazing people at H10 Madison! We were greeted warmly and treated wonderfully from the moment we stepped through the door to the moment we had to tear ourselves away! We cannot wait to return. Our room (junior suite) was clean, comfortable and everything we could have asked for. The roof top terrace is awe inspiring! Do not hesitate to book your stay here!",5,2019,01,25
61,Love the location!,"Close proximity to all the major sites and Metro station, right in the Gothic quarter. The hotel is just off of the major streets but not ""lost"" in the labyrinth of Gothic quarter, makes it a nice quiet location. Friendly staff. Clean facilities. Beautiful patio view. WIFI could be faster.",4,2019,01,25
61,Great base camp,"We explored Barcelona and surrounds while based centrally in this hotel for a week. It is in a truly excellent location, part of the classic old Gothic Quarter district. 

The rooms were clean, modern and in the right room, quiet. The pool area on the roof is open during daylight hours but it was usually too cold to sit outdoors - I guess that’s winter. Still, it was a great place to take in the views of Barcelona stretching out. Unfortunately the pool water was not heated enough during the week we stayed. Other minor downsides were the complementary champagne was pretty average, and the hotel restaurant overpriced for breakfast at €25 per adult. There were plenty of upsides to the 4 star hotel which made it better than some of the 5 star places we stayed in during the same holiday. Central location is absolutely fantastic, rooms were always well cleaned, all staff were very helpful, and the room size is pretty good. We swapped rooms to get a quieter one, higher up with windows overlooking the Carrer del Doctor Joaquim Pou road (this hotel is located on a corner). 

Tips: Get a room with windows or inward facing on the 6th or 7th floors, away from the main street Laietana - which is a bit noisy even in the night. Use nearby cafes rather than hotel restaurant for better value, more local breakfasts. Don’t drink too much house champagne - it’s a bit rough. Ask for tea/cups/kettles, they’re not a problem but a coffee machine is the default room device.

Hope this helps!

61,Fantastic Hotel,"Very helpful staff at reception and bar, spacious and clean room, great views from rooftop area, and free cava at reception area while waiting. Great perks in room too - chocolates delivered each day, Nespesso machine and quality Rituals toiletries. Would happily return! ",5,2019,01,23
61,Excellent hotel in great location with super friendly staff.,"What a great hotel this is.   The location is literally minutes from the gothic quarter and not a lot further to Las Ramblas.    The room was incredible, being modern, clean, comfortable and in incredibly good condition. The rooftop bar was a lovely spot where we actually sat in short sleeve shirts in January enjoying the sun.   The stand out part though was the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. We had conversations with at least 7 or 8 of them and every single one could not of been more friendly or helpful.  We would happily recommend this hotel to any of our friends and would100% definitely stayed here again.",5,2019,01,21
61,"Fantastic Hotel, Top Marks!","Fantastic hotel, top marks in every area!

Location is perfect, just on the edge of the Gothic Quarter and  Yeah easily walkable to all of the main attractions, bars and restaurants etc. (A few mins from Las Rambla) 

Staff were very friendly and couldn’t have been more accommodating. We came for a 30th birthday and they arranged for a bottle of champagne and a cake to be sent to our room (completely unprompted). A really nice gesture that made our stay even better. 

Rooms were great, really nice balcony with a great view of the street and cathedral. Comfy big beds, great shower, and spotlessly clean. 

Certainly one of the best city hotels I’ve ever stayed in (probably the best!). 

Thank you - a very happy customer!
",5,2019,01,20
61,Best hotel dver,"We stayed here twice within a month during our Barcelona trip because it was so good! Staff was so kind and helpful, concierge was lovely when I had to receive a parcel. The rooms are so new and clean, we got a wonderful balcony view of the Cathedral and I’m obsessed with the luxury brand they use for the shampoos/soaps. It’s the small details that matter: yummy chocolates every day from housekeeping, blankets for when the weather was a bit chilly up on the rooftop, welcoming cocktails etc. Location couldn’t be better, walking distance to everything, Pl. Catalunya for airport bus connection and great restaurants/tapas nearby. Thankyou for a spectacular stay, one of the best hotels we’ve ever stayed in! Customer service is just phenomenal here. ",5,2019,01,20
61,Great hotel in Barcelona thats close to sights,"We stayed here for a few nights in December and were very pleased with this hotel. It was located such that it was easy to walk to the sights in the central part of the city, close to the metro, and Casa Batilo /La Sagrada / Park Guell. From the hotel we actually walked to both La Sagrad (about 30 minutes) and also from their to Park Guell(another 30 minutes). The hotel was not busy when we were there - felt like we had the whole place to ourselves. We got there early in the morning, jet lagged and expecting we would have to wait for the room to be ready, but because of the low occupancy our room was available. So we had the opportunity for a quick refresh before we hit the streets and started walking into  the Barri Gothic area. Room was to the quality we expected, not any nosier then you would expect for a hotel in the middle of the city. It is just off a main road so shelters from that traffic but also then readily accessible to Taxi, bus, etc. We did not eat at the hotel - instead we walk up the street and found a pastry shop a block away so if you are a lite eater and want a quick bite there are several options in the area.",5,2019,01,19
61,Possibly the best hotel we have ever stayed in,"We would definitely recommend this hotel. Great location in the gothic quarter, Barcelona Cathedral right at the end of the street & Picasso museum & Las Ramblas 10 mins walk. Very friendly staff, extremely comfortable room. Extra facilities in the room, breakfast amazing! ",5,2019,01,19
61,Short stay in Barcelona,"We needed a hotel after attending a concert.  H10 Madison was only a 5 minute walk to the venue.  We were very pleased with the service we received from the staff.  The room, bed and linens were very good.",5,2019,01,18
61,Perfect,"I am a traveller for 40 years, it is pitty that i met this hotel first time.
Excellent location, excellent service , excellent checkin excellent checkout, team was perfect too.
Price performance is very good too.
So H10 is one of my favorite now very suggestible.",5,2019,01,18
61,Excellent hotel - great location near the cathedral without all the noise!,"Stopped in for a drink on our way back to our hotel and we were very impressed by the staff - both at the front desk and in the bar.  When our plans changed, we decided to stay at H10 Madison instead of our usual hotel around the corner.  The rooms are lovely, modern and comfortable.  The manager, Rudolph, helped us with our new reservations and he was very accommodating as was all of the staff.  When we came back through Barcelona, we stayed for 5 additional nights.  Suffice it to say - we now have a new favorite hotel!",5,2019,01,15

Would defiantly stay here again!",5,2019,01,14
61,Only 4 useful tips ,"The location is good, but Street side can be noisy. Ask for the far side.

Wifi ask for password of the visitor not guest to avoid disconnection. 

Other than that clean, great team several good restaurant around.

61,Great Christmas break,"We stayed for a week over Christmas and found everything to be really lovely. A great breakfast choice, friendly staff, fab bathrooms, an excellent location for sightseeing as only a few mins from the cathedral but on a quiet street, and the rooftop pool was heated and open - a bonus",5,2019,01,10
61,Excellent Stay,"Was only here one night before flying out after a cruise, but the rooms are clean, modern, and spacious even for 3 of us.  The staff was very friendly and helpful and we had no problems storing our bags both before we checked in and the next day while we were out and about.  They offered water and champagne upon arrival, and had some coffee and snacks available as well.  I'd say one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at.  Very centrally located to many sites and shops.",5,2019,01,10
61,Nice hotel,My husband booked this and we were pleased. The rooms were clean and updated. We liked the location. I would only have two things to mention. There is no concierge to help with reservations for restaurants or tours. The front desk staff try to be helpful but they are not all knowledgeable. The other thing I always notice is if the rooms are well equipped with toiletries. The housekeeping staff did not replenish the body cream. We ran out by the third day. It is a little thing but it can be bothersome. Other than that we were pleased.,4,2019,01,07
61,Perfect!,"Perfect location in the gothic quarter, several major attractions in walking distance and good access to public transport. Well appointed interior design. Breakfast has a wide variety of choices not only the buffet but also cooked to order menu (eggs, bacons, sausages, churros, waffles, pancakes etc).",5,2019,01,06
61,top hotel,"for 4 star standard very good everything, very good location for all activities in barcelona, for all what we need. breakfaST very nice and colorful, tasty, many ingredients. i have no problem o come at this hotel back soon again",5,2019,01,05
61,Mixed Feelings,"Stayed here for 3 nights in summer with my mum, aunt and cousin. Hotel was lovely, rooms were clean and spacious and terrace with pool, albeit small, had a fantastic view. The location was great and the breakfast was well worth the money. 

The service was great except for one member of staff, and unfortunately it has left me feeling unsure as to whether I would return to the hotel. 

On arrival, we waited behind two ladies who were being checked in & told details about breakfast, the roof terrace, a free cocktail each when signing up to the rewards programme & the water and Cava available at the entrance (which I was aware of from past reviews). They were then both given a glass each of Cava, told to enjoy their stay and they proceeded upstairs. Of course, having been standing directly behind them, I expected the same service however I received absolutely nothing. I simply got asked for credit card for incidentals and given our room keys and a thank you. Not being given these drinks etc was not the issue - however it didn't sit well with me as to why she was treating us so differently and perhaps what the reason for this could have been. 

Almost every time we passed reception during our stay this lady was there & we never once were greeted with a smile or hello by her (like I said, we actually had great service otherwise and other members of staff were always being friendly) however we saw her numerous times be friendly to others. I didn't feel comfortable addressing her directly and didn't see an opportunity to speak to anyone when she was not present and so I left a note about the issue in a feedback card they asked me to fill out on check out. I never heard anything from H10 Madison regarding this. 

For me it was a strange experience having loved the hotel itself but as I was made to feel so uncomfortable by this one staff member, I simply would not recommend.",3,2019,01,02
61,Luxurious hotel in the MIDDLE of Barri Gotic,"It is a gorgeous new hotel right in the middle of Barri Gotic.  Reception was warm, inviting, and so fast- they hook you up with fresh water and cava the minute we walked in.  We got settled into our rooms within 10 minutes and startted exploring.  We easily got around all of Garri Gotic, Born and Eixample on foot.  The only time we took a cab was to Sagrada Familia and Park Guell because we had timed tickets.

We had the Junior suite and it was very spacious.  The king bed was smaller than I remember but the beds were very comfortable.   But, oh my!  That bathroom is just amazing.  There are double rainshowers and the water pressure was just incredible.   AND the water stayed in the shower instead of splashing out all over the place that seems to happen at all modern hotels.  The thermostat allows you to control your room and there's an extra overhead fan for those that like a fresh breeze and a slow overhead fanning it.  Closet space and luggage space was also immense.  
The only thing missing was a small kettle for tea-people.  
Windows look out to a regular neighborhood- alleyway.  But the view on the top floor bar/pool is incredible- towards the cathedral.  

The location is UNBEATABLE- bar none.",5,2019,01,01
61,Beautiful hotel in a fantastic location,You cannot beat the location for access to sights of central Barcelona. The hotel is beautifully decorated and very comfortable. Breakfast was absolutely wonderful. I would highly recommend this property.,5,2018,12,31

61,Magical Christmas,"Our family of four had an outstanding Christmas at H10 Madison!  Great location and exceptional service the entire time we were there and breakfast was always a highlight. The staff went above and beyond to make sure we had a special holiday, delivering special gifts and helpful hints. Special thanks to Ecaterina for all her help. Thanks H10 Madison. ",5,2018,12,27
61,Amazing stay!,"Great hotel with amazing staff! Was surprised at breakfast when staff gave my husband a birthday cake! I didnt tell hotel this information. I guess they must have seen it in the ID i submitted at check in.To top it off, after spending the day touring Barcelona, 5 minutes after arriving in our room, someone knocked.. Present from the hotel, a cake with a bottle of Champagne!! Wow, we were really surprised by this nice gesture. Kudos to all the staff! Thank you very much!Hotel is nice. Good and clean rooms. Nearby to most of the attactions. And good breakfast! Couldnt complain.. ",5,2018,12,17
61,Excellent stay at H10 Madison,We had a great stay at the hotel. The location was walking only few steps away from Gothic Cathedral where they also hold the Christmas market. The hotel room was clean and the staff was amazing. I will recommend this hotel to my friends. ,5,2018,12,14
61,Excellent ,"We couldn’t decided between h10 madison or h10 Montacarda but I am so glad we went for the Madison as it is off the main road with absolutely stunning views of the cathedral we had room in the photos which had a direct view of the cathedral. We went here for my wife’s birthday and the room was amazing with drink and chocolates to welcome us. The room was very spacious with an absolutely massive bed and huge bathroom with all the toiletries supplied free of charge. The roof top terrace was absolutely stunning with amazing views in all directions, we went in November which was a bit cooler in the evening but not a problem as we were enjoying our drinks the waiter came round with some nice trows to keep you comfortable as you watch the sun go down over the city. The reception staff were brilliant answering any questions and giving good advice on where to go , we did not have breakfast at the madion as were preferred to walk and find places. This hotel is perfectly placed in a brilliant location we only used a taxi once which was to visit the fountains everywhere else was a nice walk. 
The only bit of advice I would give to everyone is that most of the shops close Sunday so I you want to see the sights do that in a Sunday as they are open when the shops aren’t ",5,2018,12,14
61,The stay was just ok,"Was given a room with faulty air conditioner. Informed the reception about it but the technician can't fix it due to the part not available so I didn't have a good sleep for two nights. I managed to change room on the following night. Unfortunately, I encountered second incident in the new room, the room attendant broke the bathroom glass door while cleaning the room. The manager told me they have cleared the broken glasses but he still offered me an upgrade to another room, but, I decided to stay in this room as he said they have cleaned up the mess. Unfortunately, I still found broken glasses on the bathroom floor and carpet. Overall, the staff were friendly and attentive. The location is very convenience, walking distance to a lot of main attractions.",3,2018,12,14
61,Excellent,"Can not fault anything about this hotel.  Staff, decor & location all excellent   Rooftop bar with great views is a nice bonus. Can’t really comment on the restaurant as I only had the breakfast buffet, which was good but a bit pricey at €24.",5,2018,12,13
61,A wonderful stay,It is the best hotel I have ever stayed on. It is luxury but you feel like you are visiting a friend. So nice staff all over. The breakfast was outstanding. On my birhday I got cava and cake on the room. It has a great location just 5 minutes walk from Placa Catalunya.,5,2018,12,13
61,Such wonderful hospitality!,"From entering the hotel to leaving- everything was amazing. A glass of Cava upon arrival is very nice after a long journey. No problem checking in early as our room was luckily available. The rooftop is such an amazing spot to check out (a beautiful sunset behind the church). Great staff, great rooms, great experience.",5,2018,12,11
61,The best Hotel EVER!!!,"My husband and I stayed here at the beginning of December. On our arrival we were treated very warmly with a glass of Sparkling Prosecco, Juice or water. Our bags were taken to our room were we were shown how to use everything including the free safe. 
Our room was on the corner of the 4th floor and was absolutely beautiful, very clean and spacious. The added extras in the room, coffee machine mini bar and toiletries were fabulous. The staff were all very polite and helpful. We did ask one day about visiting Camp Nou as it was fully booked on the website. The young man behind reception was amazing and told us about a game that was happening the day after and all the tickets were being sold very cheap, within 5 minutes he had booked us tickets for 20 euros each. And the seats were amazing. Breakfast was beautiful everyday, there was a great selection to help yourself to and also fresh cooked hot breakfast of your choice. You could not ask for a more perfect setting the hotel was in the middle of it all and we walked to everything.",5,2018,12,11
61,Has everything ,"This hotel has everything. 
Location: right in front of the Cathedral, in fact you see the Cathedral from your window. You are right in the middle of the Gothic quarters.
Shopping: La Rambla is a short walk away. Need I say more.
Food: You are spoilt for choice with so many different cuisines available within a 200m radius. Plus those pastry shops on the way to La Rambla.
Transportation: again, it’s your choice and the Airport is 30/35 minutes away.
Entertainment: starts right from the square in front of the Cathedral and on to venues all around the neighborhood. 

The hotel itself is quite modern and the rooms have all the comforts you’ll expect. Clean, spacious with a fantastic bathroom & very comfortable bed. Staff are also very friendly and attentive. . . & most of them speak English.

I will certainly stay here again whenever I return to Barcelona. 

Overall 4.5 stars. ",4,2018,12,11
61,"Great Location, Great Experience","We stayed at the Madison for 4 nights in November. This was our first stop on our first trip to Spain. Our first encounter at the front desk was with Ecaterina and she is just lovely. She gave us a recommendation for a restaurant on our arrival which we really appreciated and enjoyed. Domingo who was a server in the breakfast room was especially sweet and just dedicated to giving good service. We really loved this location in the Gothic Quarter which is two minutes from the Cathedral. Our room (junior suite) was quiet with a spacious bathroom and clean. Super comfortable bed and free flowing Cava all day and into the night, which was especially convenient on one particular day when we got drenched from an unexpected downpour. The lobby was packed with guests escaping the heavy rain. We really appreciated having a place to decompress with a complimentary glass of bubbly after getting caught in the storm. On the whole the staff was lovely and the breakfast was off the hook. Yes, there are lots of places to get your breakfast outside the hotel, but we loved the convenience and quality and didn't regret spending the extra money.Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,12,11
61,Amazing from Start to Finish,"Today is our last night at this wonderful hotel!

The location - great for tourists! Just far enough from the main tourist road, 10 mins walk to the pier and really close to the beautiful cathedral! Of which you get an amazing view of from the hotel! 

The Staff - could not do enough for us, from when we arrived to every single question being answered and every request being responded promptly too!

The room - lovely and clean! Beautiful bathroom! 

I can not wait to come back and stay here again! A new fan of the H10 chain! ",5,2018,12,09
61,An amazing hotel!!!,"We stayed here for a recent visit to Barcelona. The hotel is in an ideal location to walk to all the local sights. The hotel itself is immaculate inside, very clean and well looked after. The staff are all very eager to help and very efficient!You even get a glass of cava on arrival!!! ",5,2018,12,01
61,Nicely renovated and quiet hotel in Gothic Quarter,"This hotel has a few great aspects. It's quiet, even though it's located near a busy street in a busy part of town. Whoever designed the renovations really paid attention to detail. It's walking distance to metro, as well as several tourist sites like the cathedral. Breakfast in hotel is expensive and time consuming (and formal) , but there are a dozen places within 5 minute walk which charge 1/3 of the hotel breakfast price. There's no fitness center in the hotel, but I used the free vouchers to get to an excellent health club, which is about 5 minutes away. I even took a yoga class there in Spanish. Beds are comfortable and rooms are good sized for Europe. My only complaint is around the front desk staff. They weren't knowledgeable about where to go to catch trains, and gave me incorrect information more than once. For example, we decided to go to Girona for a day, and were directed to the wrong rail station by staff. We were told to go to Clot station but AVE high speed trains leave from Plaza Espana. As another example, we went to Montserrat for a day trip, and were directed to go to Plaza Catalunia to catch the R5 train instead of the correct Plaza Espana. We were given incorrect times about commuter trains to Montserrat (called Rodiales). In addition, the front desk staff had no info about hiking trails in Montserrat, which is a popular tourist destination for a day trip, and they weren't willing to help find the most basic info on-line, such as where trails start from and how long they are.",4,2018,11,30
61,"Perfect location, clean, friendly, very safe","You cant find better location! It is in a very center, but on a quiet street. Taxi in one block, bus -green line -one block, Palace of Music - 1 min walk.... Once we had to ask for extra shampoo, and it was in our room, when we returned. Roof very cool. 2 elevators , we didnt have problem with them. We didnt have buffet, We had a breakfast a cross a street and in one block from the Hotel. Market- a few minutes walk ...",5,2018,11,27
61,"Perfect location, Perfect hotel, Perfect Service","From the moment we arrived in the spotless lobby greeted by the welcoming staff and offered a glass of champagne, until we left the hotel 4 days later, our stay at the H10 Madison was flawless in every way.  The rooms are well appointed. The marble bathrooms gorgeous.  We had two rooms next to each other that did not adjoin by a common door but were able to become a private suite by closing an exterior door creating a small hallway between the rooms.   This was a perfect arrangement in that one could have complete privacy or just leave both doors open into the private hallway.  The breakfasts were plentiful, both the assorted buffet and the large selection of items one could order from the menu, which were included as part of the breakfast.   The dining room staff could not have been nicer.   The hotel location in the Gothic quarter was perfectly located to walk everywhere except the very far Gaudi structures.  The hotel is a gem and I look forward to returning.",5,2018,11,27
61,Fantastic Place!,The best location. Next door to Barcelona Cathedral. Tons of stores and restaurants around. Clean and tidy place. Friendly staff. Very affordable. Loved the decor and choice of materials. Super comfy bed and soft sheets. Extra blankets and pillows. Safe in the room. Just a really really good deal!,5,2018,11,27
61,Lovely hotel with perfect location and excellent service !,"After recently having stayed at the H10 Cubik and the H10 Art Gallery, we decided to give the brand new Madison a try. And we certainly didn't regret it ! 
Staff is super friendly, welcoming and helps you out with any query you might have.  The room was spacious and modern. Although we did feel like our junior suite wasn't a real suite, more like a luxury room: it didn't have a sitting area where you can enjoy a drink and watch some tv, the lay-out of the room doesn't quite allow this. 
Our bathroom was very modern, well equipped and perfectly clean, maybe a little bit on the small side for a junior suite. The double shower is a nice touch, although we didn't use this feature (as I was traveling with my mother this time) but maybe newly weds will highly appreciate it ... 
Breakfast is perfect: lots of choices of cold cuts, cheese, marmelades, fruits, yogurts, juices and an a la carte choice of eggs, pancakes, waffles, churros, ... 
Great roof top terrace as well, as soon as there's some sun this is the place to be !
Located close to the Ramblas (which we actually avoided), plaza de Catalunya, Passeig de Gracia but also just about 15 mins away from the marina, you can walk from the hotel to about anywhere you want to go. 
Staff recommended some good restaurants close to the hotel. 
All by all a perfect stay and we will definitely consider coming back !",4,2018,11,26
61,"Amazing hotel, great location, fantastic staff","We really loved everything about the hotel, from the moment we are arrived until we had to depart.  The staff were friendly and super helpful.  The rooms were very modern and great, the bed was very comfortable and the hotel location was perfect.  Right in the heart of the Gothic Quarter and walking distance to everything.",5,2018,11,26
61,"A MUST FOR ROOM, SERVICE AND LOCATION IN BARCELONA","Wow Wow Wow
Thank you to Naima at the front desk ( who was in her first week of working at Maddison and we would never have guessed) for incredible attention to detail and such friendly service. 
Nothing was a problem for her
The room is large, very clean and they use Rituals as shower gel and shampoo etc.
A lovely goody bag in the bathroom with all the essentials (1x toothbrush, razor toothpaste shaving cream comb...sewing kit etc...)
The best part: a huge quuen size bed and super double glazing that made the room (in the centre of Barcelona) very very quiet. We literally had the best night's sleep! We slept in room 209 right by the lift. 
Hotel was very comfortable and super relaxed. 
The roof terrace was out of this world with a heated pool (not too heated) and gorgeous views of the city (from the 8th floor)
Situated 2 blocks from Las Rambles (horrid) one would never say that this area felt luxurious and welcoming
We did really good shopping and walked everywhere from here (including to Sagrada Familia and the marina) 
very good location for shopping breakfast and getting anywhere as the Metro is literally a stone throw away (3 min walk)
Highly recommend
We will return!",5,2018,11,25
61,Little Hidden Gem,"We were here in Barcelona just for 3 days. My husband picked the hotel without knowing much about the hotel chain.  We were greeted immediately by friendly front desk employees! Everyone has been absolutely amazing! From the front desk,  the valet, restaurant staff and housekeeping.  We will definitely be back and recommend to everyone!!!   Thank you for making our first time in Barcelona so memorable!",5,2018,11,24
61,Lovely hotel,"We’ve recently returned from a stay at this hotel and would highly recommend. The location is great literally 2 minute walk to the cathedral and the gothic quarter. Our room was well equipped and the bed was so comfortable we slept so well, worth noting that there is hardly any noise despite being next to a main road. We didn’t have breakfast in the hotel as at 23 euro each we are not big breakfast eaters so a waste of money for us, instead we grabbed a bite to eat on the go  at the coffee shop opposite the hotel. We did have a drink in the rooftop bar and the views are fantastic. It was too cold to sunbathe! The staff on the front desk were very welcoming and helpful.  If we were to visit Barcelona again we would come back to this hotel as we really could not fault it. Enjoy your stay! ",5,2018,11,22
61,Gorgeous!,"Fabulous place, couldn’t recommend it enough. The view we had was gorgeous and the staff were all exceptional. We couldn’t have asked for a better trip! The staff were extra helpful and went above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable as possible, they had lots of info about the surrounding areas. Definitely will revisit at some stage.",5,2018,11,21
61,One of the best hotels inBarcelona,"Arrived late in the night because of a delayed flight. Checked in by a very friendly host. Very Nice boutique hotel style rooms. Everything looks stil brand new. Breakfast is delicious, especially with the choice of omeletten, fried eggs and churro’s. Very friendly staff during breakfast. A hotel we Will come back in the near future.

61,"Perfect location, Great stay in Barcelona","H10 Madison opened in February 2018.  It's a lovely boutique hotel one block from the Cathedral.  The property is immaculate, with a lovely roof top pool and bar, quiet corners in the lobby area and an elegant restaurant.  You're welcomed in the lobby, not only by a glass of champagne, but by the wonderful front desk staff.  They couldn't be more helpful, pleasant and efficient.  They gave us great tips on restaurants and sites.  You can buy your tickets to La Sagrada Familia right at the desk and avoid the ticket lines on site.  The rooms are smallish by American standards but fitted out with high end toiletries and amenity kits, big soft towels, an expresso machine and a rain shower/handheld combination.  As it is brand new, the windows are double glazed and cut out any noise from the busy neighborhood.  There's an ATM across the street.  And did I mention that the staff members were wonderful? We would definitely recommend Madison and would definitely return.  ",5,2018,11,18
61,Great location in Barcelona with excellent staff,We visited Barcelona for the first time on a personal family trip to Spain.  H10 Madison was recommended by a family friend.  Great location.  Helpful staff.  Hotel was newly opened and was quite nice.  We elected to include the breakfast and was a great way to start the day.  Wait staff was very accommodating and helpful.,5,2018,11,16
61,Excellent,"A wonderful hotel, ideally situated.The decor is beautiful, rooms comfortable and clean and after a long day sightseeing, the shower is an oasis in the desert!  The team at the hotel are friendly and always available to help. Oh, and the glass of cava upon arrival was a welcome surprise too. I can't fault the hotel, and certainly when we visit Barca again, we'll be planning to stay at the H10 Madison.",5,2018,11,13
61,Nice Hotel,"We had some really nice days at this little hotel - placed perfectly close to everything. Friendly staff in reception even tough it took a while to check in. We had our room and they were really nice and clean.
The hotel has a roof top bar and it is really nice and the view is fantastic. Breakfast at hotel is also good - but there is a but:

The evening kitchen do have an issue. We experienced that in the evening where we stayed at the hotel (because of the rain)  we decided to dine at the restaurant - we were in for a light meal. We got a little concerned when we discovered we were the only guests. Well, we thought that it was because of our very early entry and that you normally dine out in Barcelona. Anyway, it was catastrophic  - no one in the kitchen was capable to handle a simple dinner like salat, tapas, omelet, noodles, tomato bread etc. My recommendation is; if the chef is not at work that evening, do not open up for guests. And do not blame the guests for being frustrated when the dinner lasted more than 2 hours and the meals weren't cooked properly and the tomato bread was still frozen and it was not served so we could eat at the same time. Not good enough. The worst part was when the waiter and the kitchen-helper got more than frustrated (of corse they did) and made us feel, it was our own fault.   My advice is; close the restaurant in the evening if the chef is not at work. Much better for every one - this was not the fault of the kitchen staff - no it is a management problem.
Do I need to say that we dined out the other evenings? ;-) 
Check-out went smoothly and all in all; we liked the hotel - but not the evening restaurant. Would I come back? Yes I would.",3,2018,11,12
61,"Beautiful Decor, 100% clean, 100% quiet, location absolutely ideal","When we arrived there was a little construction on the street (laying sidewalk stones).
No problem, without hesitation, they upgraded us to a beautiful room on the sixth floor
with a great view of the Cathedral and 100% quiet.  The room and the entire hotel  has a kind of modern art deco style that gives a crisp clean feeling throughout.  The interior decor really harmonized with the artistic spirit of Barcelona.  The H10 Madison could not be better located.  A few minutes walk to La Rambla and a few meters to the Barcelona Cathedral.  We even walked from the Gaudi Cathedral back to the hotel although I would not recommend this unless you would enjoy a  long walk through the neighborhoods of Barcelona.  Barcelona's other top attraction, Palau de la Musica, is about 100 yards from the hotel.  We attended a concert there but if you aren't able to get tickets, at least go on a daytime tour.  The interior of the Palau de la Musica should not be missed.  The service is superb and the staff always seemed to be in a wonderful mood.  John G. Kailua, Hawaii",5,2018,11,11
61,Barcelona beauty,"We stayed here for three nights in a wheelchair accessible room in September. The Hotel organised for us to be picked up from the airport From the moment we entered this wonderful hotel to the day we left we were welcomed and supported by very helpful and welcoming staff. We were greeted with champagne as you entered the hotel.
Our classic room was excellent. Our bathroom was fully wheelchair accessible with wheelchair roll in double shower with fold down seat and rails.It was a luxurious bathroom .
The buffet breakfast was substantial and very generous. The breakfast room was lovely.
The location was fantastic. Right in the heart of Barcelona near the Cathedral. On top of the hotel there is a rooftop bar and pool overlooking the Cathedral.The view is spectacular. 
We absolutely loved our stay here and if and when we return to Barcelona this will certainly be our hotel of choice.An absolute delight.",5,2018,11,06
61,This hotel is excellent and the staff is exceptional,"We had an excellent stay at H10 Madison.  The decor in the lobby area had a mix of modern and traditional making for a relaxing place to sit and wait for a taxi.  The room was large and comfortable, again with a very nice decor.  It had a nice sized bathroom compared to others we experienced during our trip.  It also is located in a part of town that is fun to explore.  

The staff could not have been more helpful.  They arranged a taxi to the airport, helped us with our luggage and even rescued us when we ended up in the Cathedral parking lot because GPS couldn't figure out how to get to the hotel. 

It's very tricky finding the hotel when you are driving a car.  The way to go looks like you are driving down a pedestrian street that you shouldn't be driving on at all.  Plus it takes about four turns to get in front of the hotel.  Map it out well before arriving at the hotel and call them if you have issues.

Unfortunately for us it was too cold to enjoy the rooftop lounge and pool. We went up to check it out and would definitely spend time there in warmer weather.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,11,06
61,Superb hotel,"Stayed here for 3 nights at the end of Oct 18 with husband and teenage daughter in a deluxe room for 3.
Arrived early at the hotel (1pm) but check in was officially 3 pm but room was ready, so we checked in early and went straight to the room with no waiting around. Room was reasonable size, but the lay out with the TV cabinet in the middle of the room did make it feel a bit cluttered. The huge king size bed was really comfortable and both me and my husband had a fantastic night sleep and my daughter said the extra bed was also very comfy. The bathroom is large and well lit with a huge shower and the toilet is closed off with another door - so really useful in terms of privacy. There are plenty of toiletries provided, bath shower gel, soap, shampoo and conditioner etc - everything you need. A powerful hairdryer is also provided (you really don't need to bring your own). The room also had a fridge and coffee machine for use in the wardrobe. The wardrobe was a bit small for all of our things but not too bad and we managed. We asked reception for an iron and ironing board and this was delivered to our room quickly and they left it for us to use for all of our stay. The room at night was very quiet and peaceful, we never heard a sound from anyone else or any noise from outside.
Breakfast was provided in the restaurant downstairs and this was really lovely, orders taken from waitress staff for cooked breakfast and then help yourself buffet service to the rest - croissants, pastries, cooked meats, fruit, yoghurts, bread, toast, juice, cake etc - the atmosphere and décor in the restaurant was elegant and very relaxing.
At the top of the hotel on the 8th floor is a snack bar with a small dipping pool and sunbeds. We absolutely loved this part of the hotel the end of the afternoon - just to chill out with a drink and look at the fab views over Barcelona - we were very fortunate that we had absolutely amazing weather whilst we were there, blue skies, 24 degrees - totally perfect.
The hotel location for us was the best part, turn right out of the hotel and along the road and you are right in front of Barcelona Cathedral, just a few minutes walk from Las Ramblas and all of the shops and restaurants ( of which there are loads- with all prices and food tastes catered for).
Across the road from the hotel is a really great Mexican which I highly recommend and a perfect little patisserie shop that sold fresh Churro and Porras - 2 euros each and they tasted fantastic.
All in all this is a great hotel, the staff and customer service was excellent, fantastic restaurant and pool area, lovely quiet rooms and a great location - it is worth booking you won't be disappointed. Barcelona is a fab city with loads to see and do, take the cable cars across the city, do the red bus tour, visit the Nou camp, go the Guell Park and finally don't miss the jewel in the crown Sagrada Familla - which is totally stunning. Enjoy yourself in Barcelona !!!!

Offered a glass of cava or water, checked us in, but because we arrived early in the morning, our room would not be ready till the afternoon. Nevertheless, they took care of our luggage while we started our tour of the city. Upon our return, our luggage awaited us in the room. The room was inviting, bed was comfortable and everything was maintained beautifully! The bathroom was large with an ample shower that had two rain shower heads. Our visit to the terrace was pleasant and the views were second to none. This hotel is steps away from some of the major sites worth visiting in Barcelona and we'd absolutely go back!",5,2018,10,30

61,Real luxury,"This hotel has real elegance and is perfectly positioned to walk to key tourist sites and great restaurants. 

We stayed in a triple room with our 11 year old son. The sofa bed he slept on was large and very comfortable. The room was cleverly laid out and very well equipped with robes, coffee machine, and a large and powerful shower. 

We enjoyed the roof top pool and bar - one of the best margaritas I’ve had in a long time.  The breakfast is fabulous too.  

The general calm luxury of hotel and the helpfulness of the staff really made this a long weekend to remember. ",5,2018,10,29

All necessary toiletries, coffee machine, mini bar, room safe. Bath robes etc. Lovely extra touches of chocolates on the pillow and boxes of chocolates delivered to our room each afternoon too. The staff were very helpful especially up in the rooftop bar. My sone enjoyed the pool too. Hotel is close to the port and Las Ramblas. Nearby metro stations to get around the city. We will certainly stay here again when we come back to the beautiful city of Barcelona. Top class ",5,2018,10,27
61,"Perfect location, fab hotel ☀️","Just returned from a fantastic break in Barcelona, made extra special because of this hotel. 
Spotlessly clean, turned down, turf and fresh towels everyday. All staff were lovely and couldn’t really fault anything. Well if I was being picky unfortunately we were never offered a glass of cava and stayed five nights, however it was available in reception and I’m sure if we asked we could have. Breakfast was lovely, great choice, great staff and great service. A little pricey maybe but worth it. Highly recommend the hotel and we would definitely stay again. ",5,2018,10,27

As everyone notes, its location is perfect, right in the middle of everything you'd need. We particularly liked the bathrooms with its modern design, large stall, and waterfall shower. We were also very impressed with their breakfast buffet spread and fresh cooked eggs and meat. The staff was efficient and friendly. We would definitely stay here again when we return.",5,2018,10,26
61,Fantastic Stay for Family of 4!,"We stayed 4 nights at H10 Madison, with 2 adults and 2 children (5 and 3). The location is fantastic, close to everything. There are cava and water bottles at reception for their guests. Room is nice and clean, great bathroom with Ritual skincare range. On our first night, we noticed that the shower drainage was blocked, spoke to the reception in the morning and it was fixed by the time we returned. Reception staffs are all very friendly and helpful, in particular Araub, who was very helpful giving us restaurant recommendations, directions, etc. Breakfast is somehow expensive at 24€ for adults and 12€ for children under 12, however they have a great selection on everything, also hot churros are available for breakfast! Breakfast opens till 11am, so if you eat late, you can have a scrumptious Champaign brunch there (yes, cava is available for breakfast too!) On that note, 24€ seemed a reasonable price to pay. There are a few bakeries and cafes nearby if you want to have breakfast outside.We came to Barcelona to celebrate my birthday, When we returned to our room, there was a bottle of Cava, cakes and strawberries with chocolate waiting on the table, they even provided candle, what a lovely surprise! Our kids also loved the plunge pool up on the terrace, which has panoramic views of the cathedral and surround. Cocktails were nice too. On our date of departure, the hotel gave two plush toys to our girls, they were thrilled and carried them all the way home themselves.All in all, a fantastic hotel to stay in Barcelona. Will definitely come back!",5,2018,10,25
61,Beautiful Hotel and extremely friendly staff.,"The Madison Hotel has left me with me wishing I could have stayed longer. From the arrival to leaving the staff were extremely friendly & informative. We really appreciated the extra little touches such as a welcome drink , birthday / anniversary treats which were sent to our room. The room was spotless clean and the bed was very comfortable . The roof top pool/ bar & loungers  offers a wonderful ambience in the evening after a long day of sight seeing. Would defintely return and would highly recommend to everyone who wishes for a central location , comfort and friendliness . ",5,2018,10,24
61,Best in Barcelona!,"Great hotel, fabulous staff! Modern, chic, great rooftop view of Barcelona Cathedral, very close to Palau de la Musica, in walking distance of many attractions. Perfect, quiet, well designed room on 7th floor with wood-panelled headboard, lighting choices, comfortable bed, double sink and modern shower. Refreshing complimentary water and Cava in lobby. Best front desk staff we ever experienced thanks to Gemm, Arno, Ekaterina, Felipe, Marina, and more!Would highly recommend.",5,2018,10,24
61,Great stay in this fabulous city 😘,"Just returned from this hotel  in a great location for getting to see many of the famous attractions.  We were in a 'classic' room on the first floor that  was good but a bit on the small side but pleased they had managed to squeeze a very comfortable queen sized bed into.  The bathroom also was on the small size and didn't have a shelf for personal toiletries but we managed.  The large TV did not have any English speaking stations which we found annoying as our hotel in the Canary Islands got BBC1&2 and ITV. Many visitors to Barcelona come from English speaking countries and would appreciate the additional choices. Of course not much time to view but useful when the weather is not great.
The breakfast choices were excellent, hot food is cooked to order.  They need to check the recipe for porridge though as their version was muesli with warm milk?? 🤔. The staff are all wonderful and friendly, some of the nicest we have encountered on our travels. We would return to this hotel without hesitation and hopefully try one of the larger rooms. ",4,2018,10,23
61,Pleasant experience and a great location.,"Excellent location, very helpful and friendly staff, absolutely fantastic breakfast, very fresh and varied and lots of it.  On the edge of Old Town, so it is close to many of Barcelona's attractions.  The room we stayed in was very clean and well maintained, my only criticism was lack of space for luggage and clothing, we basically had to live out of our cases, not an issue really - just an observation.  If we had thought about asking we could have upgraded to a larger room for about 20 Euro a night.  Large bathroom with a double shower also very clean and well maintained, our room had a balcony which was more than adequate for 2 people to relax and enjoy.  A rooftop bar with views, comfortable seating and a small swimming pool area off to one side of the roof to give it privacy from the bar area.  All in all a very comfortable experience for the last 4 days of a 4 and a 1/2 week holiday.  Would I stay there again - most definately, but in the larger room.",4,2018,10,22
61,Excellent Hotel in Barcelona !,"We stayed in this hotel one week in october 2018.   At check in we were welcomed by smiling employees, and they even offered Cava while waiting for our bags to be carried to our room .The room was very nice and clean.  We also had a small balcony . At the top of the building we visited the bar and restaurant and we experienced excellent service from the serviceminded personell . The pool on roof was used several times. The breakfast had everything we wanted, and they were very serviceminded here too.   All in all a very pleasant stay in this hotel.     ",5,2018,10,21
61,3 Day stay,"We stayed in the H10 Madison during a short trip to Barcelona. I  really can’t fault the hotel. Superb, central location, really clean with fantastic staff. We stayed on the 7th floor, the room was a reasonable size, bathroom and shower superb. The room was really quiet, we had a great sleep. There are roadworks outside the hotel at time of writing but they didn’t start until 9am so didn’t impact. 

Roof top bar and pool with stunning views. Worth a trip both during the day and at night. 

Would recommend the breakfast, amazing choice, the sweet stuff super tempting! Have to say, the staff were fantastic. So friendly and helpful but not in a forced, contrived way. Really made our stay and we will be back!",5,2018,10,17
61,Great way to start a vacation in Europe,"Small but comfortable. Perfect location in the center of the Gothic quarter. Lots of good bars and restaurants within a tenth of a mile.  Subway station was a couple minutes on foot.  We could walk to the waterfront, La Rambla, plaza Catalunya, Picasso Museum, and many more.  Very helpful staff. They got us into the Sagrada Familia when we thought it wasn’t possible. Rooftop bar and swimming pool was a great place to wind down in the evening.  We’d stay there again, maybe in 2026 when the Sagrada Família is finished.",5,2018,10,16
61,Excellent stay,"We had a quite short trip to Barcelona, but the H10 Madison gave us the opportunity to make the best time out of it. The hotel is located in the centre and this is really important if you don't want to lose time. Our room was just perfect. The bathroom was on another level. The whole style of the hotel was classy and modern at the same time. The staff was always very friendly and booked tickets for us for the tourbus and the Park Güell. I would definitely come back again to H10 Madison for an unforgettable trip.",5,2018,10,16
61,Highly recommend!,"Sophisticated, comfortable, and professional staff during our stay.  The ambience was spot on, with art, light, music, and a great breakfast.  The rooftop bar and pool area was a favorable reprieve from the city. Location perfect!",5,2018,10,16
61,Excellent hotel with a great team,"My wife and i have just returned from a six day stay at the maddison and we had great time. The hotel is great, the morning breakfast is the best we have had on holiday and we have been all over the world. The top floor has a place to eat and drink taking in the vista, you can see sagrada familiar in the distance it is a very romantic spot. Jesus and the team up on the 8th floor made our holiday joining in conversation and making us feel very welcome be sure to try his new cocktail the cointreau politan Thanks to you all. ps thanks for the cava always on hand when you when you come in from your day out very nice touch.

61,10 daiys of JOY,Spent t8 wonderful night and 2 days of travel in BARCELONA at the H10 MADISON.  Close to the heart of town and great staffMake breakfast to pick items and pay rather than one price.THANKS FOR THE  GREAT TIME!!!!,5,2018,10,15
61,Flashed by the view,"We stayed for two nights in this superb H10 hotel. As a frequent Barcelona traveller I know a few Hotels in town, but this I liked most so far. You are so close to the Cathedral and the rooftop terrace is just awesome. I definitely come back to this spot.",5,2018,10,13
61,One of the best hotels I have stayed in!  Definitely consider if you are going to Barcelona.,"My wife and I went to Barcelona for 9 days.  After research and checking with a colleague who is a Barcelona native, we chose the H10 Madison.  From the moment we arrived everything was excellent.  The staff is very helpful often going beyond expectations (responding to info requests, restaurant recommendations and booking, general advice about the city).  We stayed in room 711 which was modern and elegant, comfortable, and immaculately serviced by housekeeping.   The European building standards result in a very quiet and comfortable room (I wish my home had the same windows and doors).  The breakfast buffet looked great but we opted for the coffee shop or Ibirico ham shop right across Carrer Laietana from the hotel.  The Madison has an incredibly beautiful rooftop with both dining and casual seating, bar service, a small pool, and great views of the Catedral, the neighborhood, and Sagrada Familia in the distance.",5,2018,10,13
61,Excellent hotel with first-class service!,"We loved the H10 Madison hotel!  From the moment we arrived, we were treated like royalty.  Our room was very clean, spacious, and welcoming.  You can walk to Las Ramblas and other parts of the Gothic district, including a beautiful cathedral a block away.  The rooftop bar is amazing--you can look over a lot of the Gothic district while you eat wonderfully prepared Tapas and have drinks.  Our server, Silvana, deserves special praise--she's very personable and a fabulous server.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,10,10
61,Superb! Good service. Fantastic breakfast. Wonderful terrace!,"Superb! Good service. Friendly staff.  Fantastic breakfast. Wonderful Terrace! Good bedt. Clean. Dobbel shower! Close by shops, taxis, busses, the Cathedral. We give the hotel our best recommendations! We enjoyed every moment. ",5,2018,10,09
61,Fantastic hotel,"Well, what can we say?We booked this hotel as part of a package city break, and boy were we pleasantly surprised by what we got!The hotel itself is gorgeous, the staff very friendly and helpful and the breakfast just awesome.Our room was very nicely appointed and the Hotel provided a complimentary bottle of cava and some chocolate dipped strawberries as we were celebrating a significant wedding anniversary. Lovely touch.We will definitely return to this gem, right in the heart of the Gothic Quarter",5,2018,10,09
61,will definitely return,"Excellent hotel with quality care.
I loved this hotel- the room, bed quality, linen and towel quality, amenities etc compared to other comparable hotels I stayed in Spain.

lighting is good compared to other hotels. 
coffee machine with cookie was an additional caring touch, which I enjoyed every day.

Hotel staff are very kind, hotel facilities pay attention to details.

Rooftop snack bar serve good night snack with beer.

Location very good, easy access to various tour meeting points plus visiting spots.",5,2018,10,08
61,Great hotel with Great staff,"I cannot express enough how amazing this hotel is! First of all the hotel itself is so clean with beautiful design. The staff were so good to us! We were greeted with champagne and they made us feel home. Matthieu at the door was always so helpful and kind and Jesus at the rooftop is exceptional! We have a one year old baby, Dean and they took the time to say hi to him! Again, we had a great stay and will only be booking this hotel when we return! It should be rated a 5 star hotel!",5,2018,10,07
61,"Best service, centrally located, worth every penny!","H10 madison staffs were professional and their service is commendable.The room is spacious  and has the best view of the cathedral. Our room had 2 balconies! Yes 2! Thank you for the hospitality, H10 madison ",5,2018,10,06
61,Lovely hotel with great location,"I stayed here in Sept 2018. What a fine hotel with friendly helpful staff. It is in an excellent location to walk throughout the center city area and convenient to the metro. It was close to the cathedral and only a short walk to the wonderful El Born neighborhood. It was off a major street on a side street. My room did not face the street and it was quiet. I stayed in a Classic Barcelona room. It was modern,air conditioned with a good bed and modern bathroom facilities. The inroom espresso was a special treat. The breakfast menu was varied and extensive. The rooftop terrace bar was wonderful. I would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2018,10,05
61,A gem,"We stayed here for a 4 night break and the size of the hotel, lovely room, friendly staff, location, breakfast and pool area to relax at after sightseeing made our trip to Barcelona really special. Thanks to all the staff. We will return.",5,2018,10,05
61,Great location as a base to explore Barcelona,"We stayed at H10 for five nights as part of our trip to Spain and really enjoyed our stay.
This was out first time with the H10 hotel chain, and I was very impressed with their pre-stay response to some questions we had. They were very prompt in replying to our questions on the location and on updating our reservation.

The location is great close to metro stations and it's very easy to hail a cab. We took the Aerobus in from the airport, and the hotel is a short walk from Plaça de Catalunya. We dropped our bags off in the morning, and the front desk gave us some good locations to stroll to until our room was ready.

We booked a junior suite and were very happy with it. The double suites overlooked a courtyard of other buildings which was mentioned on the website. You won't get an expansive city view but it  was very quiet which is what we were looking for. The size was very good by European standards  and there was more then enough room for us.

Front staff and rooftop terrace staff were great. We would usually go up to the terrace for a drink before heading out for dinner.The view of the cathedral at sunset was amazing. The tapas and drinks were very good and the stand suggested some tapas for us to try.

Thanks agin to the wonderful staff for helping to make our first (but not last) trip to Barcelona enjoyable.",5,2018,10,05
61,Fantastic Hotel very central ,This hotel was a real gem. Well placed as by cathedral so easy to find! When I arrived I was greeted with a smile and a glass of fizz which was very welcoming. My room was lovely overlooking the busy road but could not hear once door shut. Step out onto the Balcony and could see the cathedral 😊The roof terrace is a bonus with amazing views all round Barcelona staff friendly and pool area lovely. Breakfast good with lots of variety. Would definitely stay here again if returning to Barcelona which I am sure I will do as such a vibrant city. ,5,2018,10,04
61,Nice h otel,"We stayed for 4 nights after our Med Cruise.  I booked a Jr Suite and was a little dissa[ointed with the view as I was told I would have a cathedral or Gothic section view.  Well what I got was Walls and balconies of apts. with clothes hanging out to dry.  But the room was spacious, great bathroom and bed was average.  As a H10 member we got free water everyday and candies on our turndown at night.  It is located in a good location for walking and the roof top bar is amazing at night.  Servers are very good there.  But while we were there the restaurant was only open for breakfast and the menu up top was very limited.  If beer drinker only one beer served up at top.  There is a convenience store near the hotel if you go out left and walk to the nearest crosswalk and there are two together there.  HOHO bus picks up very close to th e cathedral which is only a block behind the hotel.  Only real complaint is that I booked my skip the line tix for Sagrada and they screwed my times up so we did not get entry there.  They did refund my money so gave them credit for that.  But would recommend the hotel.",4,2018,10,04
61,Solid 5 Star hotel- you can’t do better than this,"There isn’t much I can add about how wonderful this hotel is except that not only is it smack In the middle of where you want to be but the customer service is amazing. The people at the front desk, Felipe, Asier and a lovely woman that I failed to get her name- all went out of their way to help facilitate our needs. Of course who doesn’t love a hotel that offers you a glass of Cava as you check in?
We were unfamiliar with the hotel group and I must say that they really have got it ! They have anticipated your every need from big fluffy towels to the live music on the rooftop pool- an amazing shower  head and I could just go on and on- they helped us get a room at the Marina H10 when we asked to stay another night and they were full. It was completely different in every way but equally as efficient - love this hotel group!",5,2018,10,04
61,Excellent hotel ,"This hotel has a great location and easy to navigate around the city with it as your base.  Lovely clean room with modern decor.  The staff were very helpful & we particularly enjoyed the views from the terrace.

Only criticism was that there was not enough room to unpack all our luggage ",5,2018,10,04

61,"Perfect Location, Excellent Service","This is a lovely hotel. We stayed in a Classic Barcelona size room and it was great. The coffee machine was a nice amenity...better than anywhere we had stayed in 2 weeks of travels through Spain. And a hotel with a magnifying make-up mirror?  5 stars for that alone.  Nothing special about the room...but that's not a negative. Most of the hotels in Spain I found to be rather plain in their modernish decor. But the bed was comfortable and the A/C worked very well. A nice respite to return to after miles and miles of walking.  The location is excellent. An easy walk to everywhere.  I also need to mention the employees at the front desk. They were all friendly and helpful. They helped us to find a restaurant that was open after we discovered that 10PM on an August weeknight is actually late in Barcelona to eat at a good place.  Special thanks goes to Adrian who helped us to reserve a taxi in the town of Figueres to take us for the day to Dali's house.  With our limited/non-existent Spanish, nevermind Catalan, that wouldn't have been possible. So thank you to all at the H10 Madison. We will recommend you to anyone visiting Barcelona. And we will not hesitate to try another H10.",5,2018,10,03
61,A lovely place to stay and relax,"A lovely hotel with modern, spacious clean rooms with everything you need for a comfortable stay. All the staff were excellent - very friendly and helpful. We were able to leave our luggage there for the day after checking out - which allowed us to explore Barcelona before getting our flight in the evening.",5,2018,10,03
61,Amazing,"The hotel was one of the most amazing hotel’s I’ve stayed in. The staff were wonderful and the whole hotel was brilliant. Would definitely highly recommended this hotel to everyone.

The rooms where well decorated but could do with more room to put your clothes. The bathroom was also of a very high standard. The freebie were a nice touch.

The rooftop pool and bar were lovely, very clean but need more sun beds. The drinks were reasonable and the food was very nice.",5,2018,10,02
61,Love this place.,"Great location walking distance to many attractions in Barcelona.  The staff is super friendly offered us water and champagne during our checkin.
The rooms are excellent, complementary Nespresso in the room is a great touch, the bathrooms are trendy and super clean.
Well come back again for sure.",5,2018,10,02

The breakfast is a must and the Cava that’s at your discretion as u come in the hotel is nice , overall i had a great holiday there , for sure i’ll pass by in the future , kudos to you guys . ",5,2018,10,01
61,Loved it!,"Loved this hotel, loved the location, loved the big comfy bed and pillows and loved the great breakfast. When booking we hadn’t realised that the weekend we were staying was La Merce so it was great to be in such a central location with everything going on very near us. We used the rooftop bar a couple of times which was a lovely area to have a couple of drinks after a day of sightseeing. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and after our experience would definitely look to book with the H10 brand again.

61,A Gem in the heart of the city!,1 block from the Barcelona Cathedral in the heart of the city. Small but well planned rooms. Roof top Bar and pool. I was not familiar with H10 hotels but would definitely stay at other if they are as great. The service staff was very attentive and wonderful to interact with.,5,2018,09,30

61,Amazing. Brilliant. Superb.,"Just perfect. It was a perfect day in Barcelona. The sun was shining. People were smiling. The sights. The sounds.

Check in was fantastic, including a glass of bubbly which I hadn't finished so I took it up to the room with me. 

Really nice room. So modern and comfortable. The pool/bar area with a view of the Cathedral is spectacular. Had a nice drink in the sun before exploring more of Barcelona.

So much fun. What a great hotel!! A must do!",5,2018,09,23
61,"Nice Hotel, Lack of Consistency | H10 Madison","4.5

This hotel is located in the old town “Gotic Barri” on a fairly busy street, however thanks to the sound proof rooms you barely hear anything from your room. Beautifully designed rooms/bathrooms with fairly high quality furniture and a nice rooftop bar/lounge area with a tiny pool that overlooks the old town. We were given a complimentary upgrade to a larger room for our honeymoon followed by a bottle of sparkly wine and a tray of pastries upon arrival which was very kind and sweet! Location and quality wise this building is great! But it is only fair to point out a couple of things that I personally think need improvements: 
1.	Although the rooms are sound proof, we were located on the 7th floor (right below the terrace/pool area) and could hear chairs moving around in the morning which felt a bit strange, especially since heavy high quality doors were used for even the bathroom door which made it hard to hear my partner’s voice from the bedroom if the bathroom’s door was closed, so the fact that we could hear furniture moving upstairs was a bit disappointing. I think for high traffic areas such as a rooftop terrace the flooring material was not carefully selected. 
2.	Upon arrival the room was spotless, however this was not consistent, and as the days went by our sink area was not touched at all, certain parts of the bathroom (the flush button) which is a large surface still had finger prints on it, and on the very last evening bathrobe replacement, and espresso capsule replacement was not done which were replaced after we asked. Not a big deal, but I believe in order to keep the rates high for a 4star hotel at this price (average 350/night) consistency in cleaning is a must. 
3.	This hotel is less than one year old, and I totally understand that it is still gaining experience in hospitality and/or dealing with customer service, however being a part of the H10s and for its price, certain expectations are built. On our last night the terrace/pool area was shut down to the guests of the hotel due to a private event that was happening from early afternoon to late evening (around 9:30pm) and once we tried using the area we were told by the staff that the rooftop was shut down for the whole night, but when we asked the front desk’s evening receptionist he said it will reopen to the residents around 9pm. (Which technically ended up reopening around 10pm) we went back up while staff were still cleaning after the event and we could tell that they were frustrated as the hotel’s guests were coming up to relax while they were still cleaning. This incident was very disappointing, because the lack of communication between the terrace/bar staff and hotel’s front desk on when to reopen made us (and other guests) confused. But the biggest issue I have with this is lack of respect for the guests of the hotel for not being notified in advance that a service they paid for was not going to be available for the majority of their day/evening. At least we were not notified in advance! Not to mention that this was the most expensive night of our stay. 
4.	Last but not least, I think it is important to be asked about the experience and stay upon check-out which we weren’t. I did fill out a survey that was left in our room 2 nights earlier but checking out greetings is as important as the check-in greetings. Check-in/out hours could be very hectic for the staff, but after five nights of stay I think any guest would expect to be asked about their stay and would appreciate voicing their opinion and suggestions. 

Overall our stay here was good, we enjoyed the beautiful common areas, intimate rooftop and the very helpful front desk gentleman that checked us in and helped us book Casa Mila’s tickets. I would recommend this hotel to friends and family for its location and high quality rooms, and polite staff. But I highly recommend improvement in practicing consistency in services as it is crucial to keeping a reputation amongst visitors in the future.",4,2018,09,23
61,Staff is exceptional.,"I want to publicly acknowledge Mr. Asier M. for his translation assistance as we were trying to work through a medical equipment failure. He tried multiple contacts, did some google lookups and sought additional input from colleagues. There was no resolution but not for Asier's lack of trying. The hotel itself is lovely, nice clean rooms. I hope we are fortunate enough to return to Barcelona someday and I will stay here again without hesitation.",5,2018,09,22
61,Hidden Gem,"Beautiful romantic little hideaway hotel, in a fantastic central location in the stunning Gothic quarter. Absolutely everything is accessible and it is easy to stroll through the little streets and walk to the beach. The hotel is perfect, clean, and a great rooftop bar/pool.",5,2018,09,20
61,Disappointing,"I booked the hotel to use the terrace, today the use of the terrace will not be possible because of a private event! I paid a lot for the room and as a hotel guest I will use all the facilities! The hotel is nice, but at 5 o clock I want see the sunset!",3,2018,09,20
61,Hidden but close,"A great hub for the city, close to the main streets. We were fortunate enough to secure this, as it is easily accessible to la Ramba through short alley ways, and close to the city of Gaudi...10 minutes walk to Casa Battlo. The cathedral is a great backdrop to the upstairs bar for afternoon drinks. We arranged our tours to Sagadra Familia and Casa Battlo to avoid the hassle of tickets at the venues. Both are reasonable walks to take in the beauty of this gem of Europe. Would definitely stay again as reception are great..great people with a sense humour. Lastly, the breakfast is up there with anywhere!",5,2018,09,19
61,Great Place,We stayed here for four nights in September. Great location right in the Gothic Quarter within walking distance of many restaurants and group tour meeting points. Hotel staff was friendly and quick with service. AC worked great and shower was perfect. Would recommend and would stay again.,5,2018,09,19
61,First class hotel in a great central location. ,Highly rate this hotel for their customer service. The hotel room was spotless (only 12 months old) and the bathroom one of the best I have enjoyed for some time. Great rooftop pool with views of the cathedral was also a highlight. ,5,2018,09,18
61,Barcelona Bliss,"Fantastic setting and location (a couple of hundred metres from the cathedral), upstairs pool area and bar very spacious with a good option of snacks from the kitchen. Staff super attentive. Breakfast options wide and varied with several hot options cooked on the spot. Big comfy bed, we had a wonderful 6 nights there.",5,2018,09,16
61,Perfect stay in fantastic Barcelona,"This hotel was perfect from check in to check out. The room is really lovely with a little balcony. Beds are comfy and room is really quiet. The pool is small but has a great view and lovely lounges. Breakfast was great - many choices, beautifully presented and really fresh.

Location is wonderful - walking distance to everywhere. Barcelona is one of the great cities of the world and H10 Madison is one of the best places to stay. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,09,16
61,Lovely hotel for weekend break,"We stayed here for 2 nights on a weekend break without the children. The room was lovely and spacious with a small balcony with sideways view of the cathedral. The bathroom was lovely, decent hairdryer and waterfall shower. The bed was comfortable with chocolates on the bed, nice touch. My only small issue would be there was nowhere to hang things up as the hangers were directly above the coffee machine rather bizarrely. And I would have liked the option of having tea facilities rather than just coffee. The rooftop terrace was lovely, we had drinks up there, we didn’t use the pool. The location was fantastic for sightseeing. Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Barcelona",5,2018,09,16
61,Great location,Great location for exploring the Gothic Quarter. Clean room and a nicely appointed lobby with cava and water if needed.  Overall the staff was friendly and very quick to respond to any request we had.  Pleasant stay and we will be sure to return.,5,2018,09,10
61,"Great location, rooms, rooftop terrace/pool, and service","After doing quite a bit of research for our post-cruise hotel stay in Barcelona, I settled on H10 Madison for the location, the rooms and the fact that it is only less than a year old.  We weren't disappointed.  Each time we arrived, we were greeted with a refreshing complimentary glass of Cava.  The room was spacious by European standards, with a modern bathroom (double sinks, a large double shower with both rain shower head and wands - 4 total).  I was not too impressed with the atmosphere of the restaurant, but we did not eat there.  The location was perfect to walk most of the important features of the city.  The rooftop terrace was awesome, with a pool, lounge seating groups, dining tables, and a bar, all overlooking the Cathedral nearby.  While neither highest end or low end, with prices that are reasonable for European hotels, it would be considered a little pricey for the U.S.  But in comparison to other hotels we considered, the value was great.  This was our first stay in an H10, but I will certainly check them out on our next visit to a city where they exist.",5,2018,09,05
61,Best location,"A good & clean hotel with very helpful staff, best location for sightseeing, bus, underground, eating around, opera! Very satisfied! Also like its restaurant’s atmosphere, worth to try breakfast there. Thank you!",5,2018,09,04
61,Nice hotel,"Nice hotel, clean, friendly staff, quiet. Upon arrival we were offered a glass of cava. ( we did not drink it so cannot comment on the quality but it is a nice touch).
we booked a room with a view, 2nd floor, you are predominantly facing a building but once you step outside on a little balcony, you can see the cathedral on your right.
Room was ok, there is a coffee machine and complimentary bottles of water. 
Whilst the room was of a decent size, there is not a lot of room to put your clothes away besides a couple of drawers.
There is a hanging rail but if you have a dress, long shirts etc ...  it falls right on the coffee machine. A tad strange for a 4*
For the price we paid, I definitely preferred other hotels I stayed in in Barcelona.",4,2018,09,03
61,Great option for families,"I was initially skeptical of this hotel, since I haven’t heard of the H10 brand before. It definitely exceeded our expectations. The rooms are large and very clean. The hotel is quiet but within a 3 minute walk to the best attractions and restaurants. 

Like other reviewers, I would only comment on the staff being slightly distracted. They were nice but had to be prodded every time. We had to constantly ask for coffee at breakfast and both days the waiters weren’t there when we showed up. Please try to match service to the quality of the hotel. Otherwise it is excellent. ",5,2018,09,03
61,Amazing in all aspects,"I was there for 3 days with my family and extended family as well. Top quality service , clean , tidy , centrally located and the most friendly staff I’ve ever seen in Europe . You don’t have to ask twice, in most cases they are proactive and you don’t even have to ask at all . It’s definitely worth every penny . ",5,2018,09,01
61,"Good Hotel, Affordable","We stayed here in the summer and liked it. Location was prime. Service could have improved, but I think that is just Europe. Rooms are on the smaller side. Staff had difficulty speaking English but they did their best to help us. Super affordable during prime time summer and would stay here again.",4,2018,08,31
61,"Lovely Hotel, Great Location","We stayed for 3 nights in June whilst visiting for the MotoGP. The hotel is located next to the Cathedral which is a great location. We checked in and the staff were very friendly and helpful. In our room we had a large king sized bed and sofa bed, I think it was a deluxe room. We were overlooking the front of the hotel which was an ok view. The room was nice and spacious and clean. The bathroom was nice and very clean with a good shower, nice toiletries and a decent hairdryer.
We had bottled water everyday. The roof top bar was great. We liked this hotel so much we have booked again for December, can't wait!",5,2018,08,31
61,Wonderful hotel great location,"Hotel staff was extremely friendly! Hotel itself was very clean and very stylish! Location was right in the gothic quarter which hosts lots of tapas bars, also located right by subway so very easy to get around. Rooftop bar was beautiful and not to badly priced.Breakfast was very nice can no fault. Our room had everything you would expect, a/c, balcony, hairdryer, fresh towels and toiletries, fridge and robes and slippers.Would 100% recommend and will stop again! ",5,2018,08,31
61,Excellent Hotel!,"H10 Madison is a wonderful place to stay in Barcelona. We spent 3 nights here and I would definitely return. Staff were very friendly, rooms were spacious, clean and had lots of extra little touches. Roof top terrace was a lovely place to unwind after a busy day walking. The best thing is the location! Definitely worth spending extra to be in this location. Only a minute walk to the cathedral and the gothic quarter. ",5,2018,08,31
61,Everything new and great location!,Love the hotel! Everything was brand new. Concierge bell boy was super nice! The younger front desk boy was also nice too. Only the older ones are a bit arrogants. But over all good experience and lovely room! Great location!,5,2018,08,30
61,Had a great time,Was here with my girlfriend in late August. First of all it was a perfect location. It had friendly and helpful reseptionists. Smiling and service minded people working the beautiful rooftop terrasse. Fantastic and super organizing house keepers. ,5,2018,08,30
61,1st Class Experience with lovely personal touches,"The photos don't lie, this is a lovely hotel and the only thing better than the view from the roof top was the front desk staff.  We were greeted with smiles and a glass of Cava, with a quick check in to the twin bed room we requested.
After getting settled and some sight seeing we were treated to a surprise bottle of Cava and cake in our room for my birthday.  One look at Aisher at the front test when we came down stairs for dinner reveled who was behind the special treat. He was quick to offer his birthday wishes and help in making reservations at what turned out to be the best meal we had while we were in Barcelona.  Ecaterina (who speaks 6 languages),helped us plan our sightseeing around the busiest times, got us taxis and made great recommendations for shopping and dinning. 
The location of the hotel is very central and easy to get to most things by walking.  The facility is clean, comfortable, stylish and well care for.  
I booked this hotel with points from my credit card, even paid extra and chose it over a hotel that I have gold status with - base on the photos and reviews I read on Trip Advisor and it was the best decision of the entire trip. My friend who lives in Sweden is already planning a trip back with her daughter and said without a doubt she will return to the hotel.  I wouldn't hesitate in doing the same.",5,2018,08,29
61,Great rooftop bar,On arriving here we were greeted with Cava a nice starter. The roof top bar was delightful with a great view. The only hing was that gin was super expensive €15 with tonic but other spirits €8_9 didn’t make sense. Our rooms were comfortable clean and functional.The bathroom looked great but the shower leaked all over the floor no matter what we did to prevent it. The rooms are nice and quiet too.the breakfast was good with a cooked menu which food from it was beautifully presented.,4,2018,08,29
61,Pretty much flawless,"We stayed here for four nights in August and had a great time. The rooms are lovely and all of the staff were great. We stayed in a room facing the street so were a bit worried about noise but it was well blocked out with the windows closed and we slept very well throughout.

The pool on the roof is small but a great place to spend a few hours on a warm day. A few more vegan food options on the menu would be great to see but the drinks were top notch and fairly priced. 

We didn't have breakfast in the hotel so can't comment on that. 

The location is perfect for exploring the sites, the beach, or the nightlife and the cava in reception is also a lovely touch. It was my first time in a H10 hotel and I wouldn't hesitate to stay in them again as the standard was superb.",5,2018,08,28
61,Wonderful Stay and Location,"We loved this hotel.  The location is excellent, between the Gothic Quarter and Born.  Every morning we ate breakfast at the less touristy market in Born.  The room was immaculate and perfect for our family.  Also, it was quite hot during our stay and it was so nice to walk in and have  still water,  water con gas,  or some cold wine.  My daughter loved the candy jar!  The roof top pool was beautiful.  Enough seating available for everyone that went up there.  The front desk staff was very helpful and friendly.  Book this place!  ",5,2018,08,27
61,AWESOME HOTEL IN THE HEART OF BARCELONA,"First of all I should mention the very friendly personnel and their great service offered , cozy lounge , AMAZING  breakfast , great cleaning service, comfortable bed and room. Nice roof garden with a small pool and great city view. All this combined you're in the heart of Barcelona next to the Cathedral and the shopping area.",5,2018,08,24
61,Lovely location. Clean rooms,"This hotel is situated in a location that allows for convenient access to all of Barcelona's tourist attractions, the beach and port are a short walk from the hotel. It is located within walking distance of the Sagrada Familia. The amenities in the hotel are what you would expect the rooms are clean and everything works, the reception staff are very lovely and help you with any problems you have during your stay. The only problem that I had with the hotel, was the rooftop pool, it is very lovely and provides stunning views of the city, however, the bar staff seem to love to ignore you. And drinks are served with as little care and attention as possible. However, I would say that overall this hotel has:
Good Amenities;
Lovely staff ;
A good location
I would recommend this as a hotel to stay in whilst you are in Barcelona",4,2018,08,22
61,Amazing hotel ,"Absolutely fantastic hotel ! In a great location.... very close to everything , the staff are very accommodating and helpful.... and the hotel is spotless , we booked bed and breakfast for 4 nights and the breakfast is defiantly worth a little extra ... , the only slight downside to this hotel is the price of the spirits and cocktails , with an amazing rooftop bar it’s very expensive for drinks 11-14 Euro 💶 a cocktail and spirits anywhere between 12-15 euros 💶 a drink ... the rooftop bar has amazing views ... very small pool with very limited space for sunbathing .... get up really early if you want to do that ...but away from that the hotel is fabulous and very central ..... hopefully making your trip to Barcelona very enjoyable..... I’ve fallen in love with this place ...  it has something for everyone , make sure you visit the Camp Nou the home of Barcelona FC .... even if your not a football ⚽️ fan you’d still think it was amazing , also the segrada familia .... these two are a must on your trip and both can be done in one day ... purchase the one day open top bus 🚌 tour at 30 plans you can hop on and off at both destinations .... with both being on the blue line it’s so easy !!!! I hope you enjoy Barcelona as much as I have !!! ❤️",5,2018,08,22
61,Few days chill,"This hotel is great the staff are friendly and helpful from reception to the bar and breakfast 
The roof terrace is an oasis albeit small and the pool only a plunge 
The rooms are comfortable and stylish service great 
I’m not sure what we all expect from a 4 star but this hotel definitely deserves it will recommend 
👍",5,2018,08,20
61,"Lovely small hotel, great service","We stayed here in August as a base for sightseeing and it was a haven to come back to after a busy day. Our request for adjoining rooms was granted meaning the kids were safe. Rooms were clean, air conditioned and spacious. Breakfast was excellent but there were no evening meals served as such - just bar snacks and room service. Great location, very central and the rooftop pool was a definite bonus. Staff were all excellent, but particularly Ima whose attention to detail was second to none. My son wears a brace but loves apples and Ima arranged for his apples to be cut up at breakfast every day after asking once on the first day. Thank you for a great stay in your beautiful city!",5,2018,08,19
61,Fantastic Hotel in superb location,"We stayed here for three nights, we asked for a balcony and the hotel accommodated our request.  The rooftop bar is stunning, with incredible views of the City.  The pool area can get busy, however it is a plunge pool! Breakfast was lovely, I only ate the continental breakfast, but hubby ordered hot food.  The reception staff were fantastic, greeting us with Cava and water, while we waited to check-in.

I cannot fault this hotel and would highly recommend.",5,2018,08,19
61,Hotel in great location but staff were not accommodating!!,"I stayed here for 4 nights in July.  The hotel is in a great location in the Gothic quarter and walking distance to El Born for great night-life.  The hotel features a nice rooftop terrace with a pool overlooking the cathedral.  
However, I was incredibly disappointed with the staff at the hotel as they were unwilling to accommodate the customer.  I had elected to extend my stay for another evening and had inadvertently booked the wrong hotel via the Hotels Tonight app.  The hotel I booked was in fact their sister property at Hotel H10 Metropolitan.  I found it appalling that the staff were unwilling to assist me in switching out the rooms which proved to be a terrible inconvenience as I was ultimately forced to move locations.  
Given that I had already stayed at H10 Madison for 4 nights and that both properties were run by the same company, it should have been very easy to switch out the rooms??? Again, I was very disappointed with the professionalism of the front desk staff and their unwillingness to accommodate a valued customer.  I will not be staying at this location again.",3,2018,08,18
61,Wonderful,"Booked hotel for a four night stay at beginning of August.  Had a classic double room overlooking the street, with beautiful Juliet balcony.  Although I must say the street noise was extremely loud with window open, this was not an issue as it was so hot outside so with the window closed the air con worked fabulously.  The room was immaculate, and the bed wonderfully comfy with more than enough pillows and crisp white sheets.  The bathroom too was immaculate, with lovely double shower and a whole range of complementary toiletries which were replenished daily.  A lovely nespresso coffee machine and bottled water (again topped up daily), were also lovely touches, and a great mini bar.  My only slight niggle (and it is slight) was that there was no literature in the room regarding its facilities,  such as how to use the coffee machine and other bits and bobs or services the hotel may have had available.  Also some easy to read literature on recommended visits in the city, places to eat, how to get around etc would have been useful.  The breakfast was to die for, and you could easily eat enough to keep you going all day!!  The roof top bar and plunge pool was absolutely stunning and I must confess to spending far too much time there!  My only criticism of the pool was that toward the end of our stay it did start to get overrun with small children - it really is just a plunge pool and not a swimming/paddling pool fit for younger ones to jump in to.  The location of the hotel is great, and within a good stroll of lovely shops and eateries and the marina.   All in all I genuinely could not recommend the hotel enough.  Finally, if I could add a word of warning to anyone thinking of travelling to Barcelona in September … we arrived at the time of a taxi strike.  We were virtually stranded at the airport on arrival late at night with no knowledge of how to get to hotel and no help from holiday booking site.  The strike caused major difficulties getting around.  The taxis have threatened to resume their strikes in September so if you are thinking of travelling then please make sure you research alternative methods of transport in advance - just in case.  The bus drivers and staff at the metro stations spoke very little English and even with our map it was very hard to find hotel late at night so please check and double check before you go.",5,2018,08,17
61,Great boutique hotel,"We booked for 4 nights due to being in the baric Gòtic area. 

The hotel is small but ample for our sightseeing needs in BCN. 

The location was perfect for us as first time visitors to Spain. It was conveniently located to bus and train lines and easily walkable to the beach and restaurants nearby. 

We were pleasantly surprised by how clean the facilities were. The complimentary cava, sweets and water in the lobby were a nice touch. 

Our room, 605, had a very cute standing balcony where you could see bits of cathedral. I booked the Classic Room. It is a small room with not a lot of space around the bed but that wasn’t an issue for us. 

The bathroom was so clean and bright. We loved the bath ammenities by Rituals. The water pressure is spot on and I adored the petite black tap wear. 

Our king bed was just the right firmness for us. 

They also have lots of electrical sockets, some EU and some US ports. Just make sure your equipment is dual voltage to prevent damage to anything expensive. All good technological items will already have a built in transformer. 

There’s also an international socket inside the safe! So handy! 

Turn down with sweets on the first two nights was something special to come back to but not sure why it wasn’t offered on the last two nights. 

Housekeeping was a little random at times. We found dirty glasses and bins weren’t always cleared. 

Towels and toiletries were replenished though. 

The box of tissues were never replaced or that full to begin with. 

Water is replenished whenever you need more. I understand the water in BCN isn’t the tastiest or safest so this service was appreciated. 

We also enjoyed complimentary cocktails on the rooftop one evening. 

Though we didn’t utilise the pool during the day, I think it would be adequate for a cool down after sightseeing. 

Wifi was fast and steady. 

They did note and accomodate my bedding configuration request and for a quiet room. 

I would recommend this hotel to fellow travellers! 
",5,2018,08,15
61,Great location,"Fabulous breakfast included in your room rate, a welcome drink on arrival. The staff were extremely helpful and the rooftop pool and bar perfect after a day out. Little touches like chocolates on your pillows really makes you feel welcome. ",5,2018,08,15
61,H10 Madison,"Fantastic service, fantastic location. This hotel has the best breakfast and offers a welcoming drink upon arrival. Close to the beach and the city centre. Absolutely perfect! Nice pool area a service minded staff. ",5,2018,08,14
61,Great stay in Barcelona,"Such a great experience my wife and I had this past week.  We had a one night stay at H10 Madison as we were setting sail on a cruise the next day.   We requested an early check-in as we were traveling from over seas-GRANTED.   THE HOTEL has been open for about  one year.  The hotel is in a classic Barcelona building.  Clean and well appointed.  The hotel staff went  above and beyond my expectations.  Great location for touring all the highlights in Barcelona.  Excellent restaraunts all around.  For those that want to save a little $$ and you are arriving from Barcelona airport,  I would highly recommend the aurobus.  Super easy to use and literally a 10-15 minute walk from the drop-off site to the H10 Madison.  For all you ""researchers"" out there(including me)-STOP.  Go to the H10 website directly, sign up for their loyalty club (free and your receive a 5% discount) and book this hotel.  When my wife an I return to Barcelona, we will stay at the MADISON.  Thanks for a  great start to our vacation.  ",5,2018,08,13
61,Lovely boutique hotel,We had a 5 night holiday in BCN. H10 is a lovely hotel. Rooms were great with a great bathroom and bed. Kids had a little floor level bed / lounge sofa thing which they loved. Roof top pool was great to chill out around but pool was a little cold for the kids. Conveniently located and lots to eat nearby. Easy to get to las ramblas or get a tourist bus too.,4,2018,08,13
61,"Huge rooms, Clean and good breakfast","We stayed in the hotel for one night only, it was wonderful. The beds were very comfortable, the room was tidy and the breakfast had all we need. The bar-restaurant and the pool on the rooftop was very nice but the pool was a bit small. The staff were very friendly and helpful and they seemed to know what they were doing. I will definitely come back to one of their hotels!",5,2018,08,12
61,"Great location, excellent room, lovely breakfast, attentive staff.","We spent four nights at the H10 Madison and was the initial impression was great, the location was ideal, the cleanliness of the rooms was good, the friendliness of all the staff was very professional and impressive. The breakfast area is superb, the range and choice of food is fantastic and shoukd suit all tastes. We are already considering a return. Highly recommended.",5,2018,08,11
61,Central Hotel in Barcelona,"This hotel exceeded our expectations. 

Very Central for going to Port, Beach, Las Ramblas, Shopping or general sightseeing. With easy access to the Metro. You have ease of access to central Barcelona and more.  

The Room we had was a Double Deluxe and was quite large for a hotel room, had no issues with the room whatsoever. They have thought of everything that would be needed, if you need an Iron though this has to be requested from Reception but they brought it to the room within minutes. 

As it was our honeymoon we even got a complimentary bottle of Champagne and some cake. 

Nice to chill out on the Roof Terrace once it cools down in the evenings, we had some snacks one night and must say the Guacamole with the nachos was perfect, would have been better to have offered a increased food offering as we would have eaten more on the Roof as there main Restaurant on ground floor isn't open at night.

Drinks are expensive compared to the 6 nights we just stayed in Sitges at another 4 star hotel and generally what we have paid elsewhere. We had quite a few coffees on the roof terrace as what is provided in the room isn't much. Our coffees came with White Chocolates each time which was a nice touch. 

Overall a pleasant stay and would highly recommend staying at H10 Madison.  ",5,2018,08,11
61,Gorgrous hotel in a great location.,"A fantastic hotel. Excellent location, very clean with the most amazingly helpful and friendly staff. The rooftop pool and bar area is lovely and a great way to unwind after sightseeing. I can totally recommend this hotel.",5,2018,08,09
61,"Fantastic location, lovely well equipped room, amazing breakfast & worth the extra! Only let down poor reception staff","The location is fantastic and the hotel was only let down by the poor reception service and lack of iron. We stayed for 2 nights and each evening requested the use of an iron which was promised by the reception staff.  On both occasions after half an hour we had to re-request. The first time we were told that there was a problem and so we said we would leave it as we had other items to wear. On the second evening they told us that no iron existed so we not only had wasted 30 minutes waiting (twice) but also were left with un-ironed clothes to wear, both times after having been told that an iron was being sought and would be with us ‘shortly’.  Poor for a 4* hotel. Apart from that the hotel, room, location and breakfast were fantastic.",4,2018,08,08
61,Amazing hotel and location,"Situated right in the centre of the gothic quarter, m10 Madison was a short walk from the beaches shops and restaurants. Hotel was beautiful with a lovely roof top pool and friendly helpful staff. Rooms were stunning and very spacious, beds were super comfortable. ",5,2018,08,07

61,Mini city break,"Hotel
Location fantastic 5 mins walk to
Las ramblas and 10 minute walk to port and marina , loads to see and do with pool being a godsend !  Lovely ambience and friendly helpful staff !! Only negative which reduced my score was maid took my own personnel face flannel by mistake and when I mentioned it the reception were not bothered they said she prob took it because she thought it belonged to hotel but it was different shape and size and even after I mentioned it nothing was done about so came home minus my new extra thick face flannel ",4,2018,08,06

The service you get when you arrive is great and the rooms and location are brilliant. 
Highly recommend this accommodation. 
It’s right in the heart of Barcelona yet incredibly quiet",5,2018,08,06
61,Great location but a bit overpriced ,"Great location for people who like to shop around the Gòtic Barri old town area. Travelled here with my parents, the room was a bit small for Spanish standard and could only fit in one chair and desk in addition to the bed. Not sure if that is Spanish practice, no bottled water was complimentary in the room so I found it a bit weird for a 4-Star hotel. Staff here was not particularly friendly either. 
",3,2018,08,06
61,"Wonderful location, wonderful staff","A smart, welcoming hotel in the centre of many attractions.  In the heat of the Barcelona summer, the rooftop pool and bar is a refreshing place to relax after a hot day exploring the surrounding laneways and sights of this unique part of the city.
Only criticism is the lack of wardrobe space but easily overshadowed by the helpful and kind staff.  What a joy in the middle of such a bustling city.",5,2018,08,04
61,Fabulous hotel. ,"Great location, staff wonderfully helpful. Accommodation very comfortable. Glass of cava at the ready when we returned from sightseeing.

Really enjoyed the Sangria.  Close to everything. Would definitely stay here again.

61,FAMILY OF 5 FROM CANADA,"Best Hotel we stayed in during our Europe trip. There was 5 of us so we booked 2 rooms.  Location, decor  and staff are excellent and very accommodating. Everything is in close proximity.  after we checked out, we wanted to explore some more and the staff kept our luggage in storage for us and even offered use of the pool if we wanted.  If i ever visit Barcelona again, H10 Madison is where i will stay! Highly recommended.",5,2018,07,24
61,Very disappointing,"I do not like leaving negative reviews but unfortunately our experience at this hotel was very disappointing. It started when we checked in, I had e-mailed the hotel to tell them we would be arriving late and to re-iterate my request for twin beds, something I had requested on 3 separate occasions. They could not have been more unhelpful and told me they did not have twin rooms as we had checked in so late! When I explained that my 74 year old mother could not share a bed with her 18 year old daughter they could not have cared less and said there was nothing they could do.
The following day we returned to the hotel mid-afternoon and were told we could not go to our rooms as there was no power! So we had to sit in Reception for 30 mins. That night my mother got a call to her room at 10pm to say they needed to come and check the water in the shower! 
Also I had a margarita at the pool bar and had the worst case of food poisoning in my life! I know that it was from this because we had all eaten the same food at a tapas bar that evening and that was the only think that I had different to everyone else.
I had high hopes for this hotel but I am staggered at the attitude of the staff, who just said, not my problem, I am just a receptionist!
H10 Madison, you need to look at the attitudes of your staff.",1,2018,07,24
61,Wonderful Barcelona Hotel,"This was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at! It was not the fanciest by any means, but it could not have been more perfect. It was in a great location, we would not have wanted to stay anywhere else. Centrally located. The staff was extremely friendly. We had an amazing view and our room was just lovely, comfortable beds, plenty of space, and the bathrooms were luxurious. I honestly do not think I will ever stay anywhere else in Barcelona. On top of this, the cutest rooftop bar with pool and an amazing view. It was a great place to grab a drink and watch the sunset between our tourist days and going out at night. ",5,2018,07,23
61,An Amazing Experience,"To begin, we were always greeted by front desk staff with a warm smile (as well as complimentary goodies and cold water).  The room was perfect!  AC was just right.  Ceiling fan added to comfort.  The bed had crisp, clean linens.  The mattress was high end.  Room 504 was pin-drop quiet.  We all slept like babies!  The bathroom was luxurious and immaculate.  Double shower, huge white marble tiles, double sink, etc.  Our room was tidied-up every day before noon; beds made and bathroom cleaned with towels replaced.  On our first night a lovely box of chocolate was left as a gift.  Our girls made sure to accept the gift!  The following day a staff member knocked on door and gave us another box of chocolates!  Very nice.  The roof deck was a perfect place to relax, especially after walking around the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona.  We could order food and drinks, relax by the pool or just enjoy the beautiful view.  The hotel's location is perfect.  Steps from the heart of the Gothic Quarter.  
The entire hotel was designed with taste and elegance.  We had a fabulous experience.  Will definitely recommend H10 Madison to friends.   ",5,2018,07,22
61,Excellent Hotel - Highly Recommend,"Very pleasant greeting in the lobby, clean and very nice rooms, great locations and no mixups on billings.  The concierge came over as we were waiting for our room and gave us dinner recommendations.  Really made us feel welcomed after our long flight.  

Loved their pool and gathering spot at the top floor - overlooking Barcelona's old town.  Also loved being able to step out on our small balcony.  ",5,2018,07,21
61,Great location,"There are many H10 hotels in Barcelona, but this H10 has a great location. It is rated 4 1/2 stars. It is in walking distance to the marina and the gothic quarters. The rooms are small but clean. It has great free WiFi. It also has a small roof top swimming pool with a bar and lounge. There is no onsite gym, but they will provide a voucher for a gym close by. There is no room service. Also housekeeping does not get to your room until 5 or 6 pm. They usually do not clean the room, the only make the beds and replace the towels.",4,2018,07,21
61,"Great location, excellent food","We spent a week in the H10 Madison in Barcelona. Perfect location for a city trip - both close to the beaches and just adjacent to the old town in Barcelona. The roof top bar with a 360 degree view of the city and the (albeit small) pool are the icing on the cake. The hotel has only be openend recently and the staff was very friendly and customer-oriented. Breakfast and dinner are excellent, as is their wine cellar. The only negative is the lift which is painfully slow at times and not really suited to adequate serve a hotel that is fully booked.",5,2018,07,21
61,4 night stay was awesome,"My daughter and I have just returned from our holiday and we had a brilliant stay at Hotel Madison. The hotel is easy to get to from the aerobus stop at Plaça catalunya and is conveniently located for the Gothic Cathedral. Our room was clean, nice amenities such as the coffee machine. Breakfasts were great! Loved the cooked to order eggs. But what made it for me was the friendly team of staff. Very approachable. ",5,2018,07,21

61,Awesome stay at the H10!,"My husband and I stayed here for a few days in July 2018 and had a great time.  The hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating.  The rooms were very clean and we even had a cute balcony overlooking the street.  The rooftop pool was great and the view of the cathedral was even better.  Could have used a few more pool chairs because they filled up pretty quickly in the morning, but all in all it was great.  Location was excellent.  It was away from La Ramblas which was super packed and touristy, it was in walking distance of pretty much everything, and the neighborhood was very safe.  I would highly recommend this place!",5,2018,07,17
61,"great hotel, perfect location and wonderful breakfast","overall the hotel was excellent. the location, for my opinion, is probably the best there is - at the end of the gothic quarter, next to all historic sites and el born, and 5 min walk from placa catalunya. 
The room was quiet and very spacious (we were 3 ppl), the interior design was beautiful, and the breakfast was absolutely fabulous. the one thing we had a problem with, was that they could not supply us an extra blanket in the evening (maintenance was unavailable)... weird... ",5,2018,07,17
61,Fantastic hotel ,"The staff in the hotel are very friendly and professional. The room was modern and well appointed. Not large, but enough space. The decor modern and of good quality. The bathroom was equally well appointed with a large walk-in shower. 
The pool area on the roof was beautiful with excellent views acros the city. The pool was quite small, but still nice. The bar was nice and staff again very friendly. Prices were also reasonable for a four star hotel.
It is also well located in the city and would definitely consider H10 in the future and the Madison in particular when I am next in Barcelona. ",5,2018,07,13
61,Great Location,"Very nice new hotel. I thought the breakfast was a little overpriced but there are lots of options for food around. The photo from the roof pool shown is the Barcelona Cathedral not the Sagrada Famlia. The walking tour guide (Brendan from Sandman) tells a great story about the geese inside. The roof top area is great, pool is small but big enough.. The olive dips are yum. rooms are on the small side if you have a family of 4 with bags but we made it work. Bathroom is large and very modern. overall great hotel would visit again.",5,2018,07,12
61,"Great Hotel, Staff and Location!","We really enjoyed our stay here! We were early so had to wait for our rooms to come available but the staff was great and helpful while we waited!  We were given two rooms on the corner and were very pleased with the size!  Quality and cleanliness was great!  The pool was great for an afternoon dip, and we loved the view.  We also tried the rooftop bar for snacks and drinks both were great!  The water and cava in the lobby was always available and a great touch.  We would absolutely stay here again!",5,2018,07,12
61,WONDERFUL hotel!,"H10 Madison is a wonderful hotel!  I highly recommend it for many reason.  I travel a lot and this hotel ranks at the very top of my list.  The facility is new and chic and immaculately clean.  The rooms are attractive and very comfortable, with all amenities you may need.  The staff is friendly, professional, extremely helpful, and very accommodating to those of us who haven’t mastered Spanish yet.  (Meaning - they speak English quite well.)  Complimentary cava (champagne) and water in the lobby all day.  Ask the staff for dining recommendations - they gave us excellent recommendations and assisted with reservations if needed.  The location is extremely close to the Cathedral and the Palau de la Musica Catalana, and easy walking distance from many wonderful sites and restaurants.  The hotel will gladly assist with any transportation needs you may have as well.  We had breakfast in the hotel each morning - they have buffet and menu options, and everything was delicious.  The rooftop bar and pool is a must-see.  Gorgeous views of Barcelona, small but lovely pool, and bar service.  They had live music on the roof one night which really made it special.  Be sure to go up during sunset, and take a light jacket even in summer as it can be a little cool (which is a nice break from the summer heat). I highly recommend H10 Madison, without reservation. ",5,2018,07,12
61,Wonderful Staff—Convenient Location,"Every hotel staff person we came in contact with was wonderful and helpful, from holding our bags to making reservations to giving directions (work map) and advice. It’s 2:30 PM and I’ve checked out, they are holding my bags, but I have about an hour before I have to head to airport so I’m chilling in the lobby. Speaking of the lobby, they not only have many places to sit, but they have a lovely bathroom and champagne and cold water to greet you.

The rooms were not that big, but the bathroom was nice and big and lovely. There’s bathrobes and slippers as well as toiletries at your disposal. And the rooftop terrace is a nice place to see the city and chill out with a drink or cool off in the pool.",5,2018,07,12
61,A great place to stay,This was our second stay at this Hotel and it was better than the first. A large room with double shower and double basins. A glass of bubbles on arrival. Coffee machine in the room. Great location with plenty of bars and cafes nearby. Good shopping and walking distance to major tourist attractions. The staff was friendly and helpful. We would return to this Hotel,5,2018,07,11
61,Lovely hotel in fantastic location,"We really enjoyed our stay at the H10 Madison hotel and would definitely recommend it to others. It’s the second time we’ve stayed in Barcelona (the first time we stayed in H10 Port Vell).

The rooms were clean, the decor nice and the staff very helpful and friendly.

We found the bed super comfortable to sleep in and had a lovely nights rest after all the walking we did exploring Barcelona. We chose not to have the breakfast included as we wanted to eat out as much as possible but had some nachos off the pool bar menu which were very nice.

The hotel is in a great location with views of the Cathedral and is in walking distance to most things, with transport links nearby to anywhere else you may want to visit.

All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here but did feel there were a couple of slight disappointments we had;

1) After spending our first afternoon and evening by the rooftop pool and bar drinking sangria and cocktails we were looking forward to doing it again our next 2 nights. Unfortunately we came up on the second day to find the bar was being renovated and they were only serving bottled beer and wine, no sangria, cocktails etc (which were very nice the day before!). Although this wasn’t the end of the world the noise from the work wasn’t great and the hotel closed half of the seating area off all day, even after the workmen had finished, so in an already busy hotel decent seating and sun beds were hard to get (only 10 sun beds were available). It also seemed slightly odd that we weren’t told about it before hand as talking to the staff it sounded like it’d been planned for a while and was likely to take 3/4 days which went right through our trip. We just didn’t expect this in a newly renovated hotel and would’ve been nice to been given the heads up.

2) We came as a couple and were very much looking forward to just relaxing by the pool and this was one of the main reasons we chose the Madison. Although we knew it was a family friendly place the 2nd and 3rd days seemed to have more young children by the pool than adults. We really usually don’t mind this but it just didn’t seem like the kind of hotel to teach kids to swim and throw them about so much whilst there were clearly quite a few other people trying to get some R&R. 

Those bits aside we had a fantastic stay in Barcelona and would very likely return to H10 Madison or H10 Port Vell again.",5,2018,07,11
61,Just enough ..,"Great welcome, amazing staff, super friendly and helpful team, very clean hotel and not to forget in an excellent location. Just enough of everything to make it a “not to miss hotel”. If you are visiting Barcelona it’s just the place to stay and it will offer you enough of everything you need. Go for it. ",5,2018,07,11
61,Fantastic Hotel in a Perfect Location,"We really enjoyed our stay at the H10 Madison located in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona.  It is perfectly situated with views of the cathedral and walking distance to great restaurants, the beach and many historic sites.  

The hotel is beautifully decorated.  The decor is very modern, with tasteful art and sculptures throughout.  It has a wonderful rooftop terrace with a pool that overlooks the cathedral and has a fantastic views of the city.  The restaurant at which we enjoyed our breakfast is very chic and breakfast is first class!  There is a fantastic selection of yogurts, juices, cold cuts and cheeses as well as baked good.  You are also given a chance to order from the menu (eggs, pancakes, waffles, crapes, sausages etc.).  The food was delicious and made with the freshest ingredients.

The service at the hotel was also very good.  The front staff were very friendly and helpful.  We were greeted with a glass of champagne when we first checked in.

We look forward to another Barcelona trip and would love to come back to H10 Madison! ",5,2018,07,10

Close to shopping area, Restaurnat’s and ocean. It has a roof top pool with a beautiful view of Cathedral. All staff are nice and welcoming. We been there end of June until first week of July.

61,"Great location, Great Breakfast and Helpful Staff","Great location of the Hotel in the middle of Gothic quarters. Short walk to Ramblas and all of the best eateries of the town. Nicely furnished rooms and great breakfast. The staff is helpful, kind and accommodating. ",4,2018,07,06
61,Great modern hotel,"We stayed three nights at the H10 Madison. The hotel is located in the heart of Barcelona’s Gothic quarter so it is close to the a number of notable sights including the Picasso Museum, Cathedral, Basilica of Santa Maria Del Mar. It’s location is amazing also as it near a number of great restaurants and cafes. The hotel is modern and has great amenities including a great shower, comfortable bed, large TV and USB charging ports. It also has a great pool and bar on the rooftop. The pool is not large but good enough to cool off after a hot day sightseeing. Our kids enjoyed the hotel. Service was good and the reception staff were kind and helpful. Highly recommend this hotel given its location, modern amenities, cleanliness, and service.",5,2018,07,06
61,"Excellent, great value hotel in historic Barcelona","Great location in the old part of Barcelona. Renovations recently completed at the hotel, which were done beautifully, transforming the hotel. Staff were most courteous and helpful.  Breakfast of course was also good.  Very reasonable, given everything, and would certainly stay there again, and recommend. ",5,2018,07,04
61,Amazing Staff,"What a wonderful hotel & a privilege to be one of it's earliest guests. Smiles & amazing service from start to finish. We had a problem with the heating in room on arrival . No problem, maintenance sent to repair it pronto. Didn't work so upgraded. Beautiful stylish rooms, wonderful toiletries & yes ladies a great shower and hairdryer. Large fluffy towels, slippers and robes.",5,2018,07,03
61,Unwined After Spanish Grand Prix,"After spending the last few days at the Grand Prix, this was a taste of luxury, this hotel is a real gem we could not have picked anywhere better.

The hotel is perfectly located for all the sights and amenities, the Les Rambles is only a 15-20 minute easy stroll, there are numerous restaurants and shops close by certainly within a 5 minute walk or less.

The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful, the rooms are excellent, spotlessly clean, air conditions with a huge fan directly above the bed for those really sticky nights to keep you cool, there is even a Nespresso coffee machine what more could you ask for.

The breakfast id one of the best we have had on the continent just a bit disappointed that the restaurant did not open muck at night.

However this will be the first point of call for our next trip to Barcelona

Defiantly would have no problem recommended  this hotel",5,2018,07,03
61,Excellent,"What a lovely stay we had at H10 Madison, Barcelona. Very central, only 5 mins walk from Las Rambla. Beautiful roof top terrace with swimming pool and stunning views of the city. The staff were very friendly and helpful and breakfast was delicious. Definitely worth a visit. ",5,2018,07,02
61,Family week-end,"We love the H10 hotels as they always offer  a very good quality/price ratio. 
This one is no exception: the rooms have a good size, are practice and clean. 
The rooftop is great as is the breakfast room. 
The breakfast was excellent and the staff always helpful and nice. 

The only problem was that one day, the cleaning staff came at 5:30pm to do the room albeit we were out from 10am until 5:00pm... and then she just wanted to leave a note that she couldn’t do the room because we were there. 
We notify the reception and they took note of our remark. 

The location is prime and we would definitely go back there next time.",5,2018,07,01
61,Fantastic service.  Great location,"Top notch staff!  Wonderful roof top pool with great area to eat and relax.  Complimentary cava, water and sweets available in the lobby.  Would stay there again.  Rooms surprisingly quiet because the street is noisy.",5,2018,06,30
61,First Class Hotel,"Upon arrival, we were offered something to drink and then given a voucher for free drinks from the rooftop bar (this is something that is offered to H10 members and you can join for free on the website).  Our room was awesome - very spacious with a sofa and nice tv on the wall.  The double shower and separate toilet area were nice.  The towels were soft and thick and robes were available.  The rooftop bar had a small pool and plenty of seating.  The view of the cathedral was breath-taking.  This hotel is located right next to the cathedral and is in a great place for sightseeing.  Breakfast was good with a buffet for breads, cheese, and fruit and a made to-order menu for eggs, omelets, or meats.  The lobby area was decorated very nicely. This was a very chic hotel and I highly recommend it.",5,2018,06,30
61,Great hotel in a quiet location,"Booked this hotel after reading reviews on Trip advisor.  We weren't disappointed.  It is situated in a quiet area in the gothic quartet.  It's a good location to reach most places very easily. On arrival we received a very warm welcome from the staff on reception.  All staff whether on reception or in the restaurant at breakfast were friendly and helpful at all times.  Our room was large, very clean and comfortable. The bathroom had a double shower with good water pressure considering we were on one of the higher floors.  However, it was hard to control the water temperature.  Towels and robe were of very good quality.  Unfortunately the drawers in the bedroom wardrobe were badly designed.  They couldn't be fully opened as they were restricted by the wardrobe door.  The carpet made a very annoying noise when you walked on it!. However the bed was exceptional comfortable and both my husband and I slept well throughout our four night stay. Breakfast was wide spread containing everything you could want from the buffet from fresh fruits to pastries and much more. Cooked to order food was delicious and well presented However it seemed the staff/hotel made life difficult for themselves. Instead of individual pots of tea or coffee, servers kept coming round to refil cups. Whilst this is a nice personal touch, the result was that you sometimes waited ages for a coffee refil especially during busy times. Apart from these minor things,  we really enjoyed our stay. There is also a generous check out time of 12noon. I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.",4,2018,06,29
61,Everything about this hotel is first class. Location. Service. Food.,"Could not ask for friendlier more knowledgeable staff. Thank you. Your attentiveness made our stay at H10 Madison an absolute pleasure. Location of course is superb. As is the service and the delightful breakfast. Thoroughly recommend a stay here for anyone looking to locate right in central Barcelona. Most of Barcelona's highlights are within walking distance. Will be back, definitely. Thank you. ",5,2018,06,27
61,Fabulous New Hotel,"We loved the H10 Madison we stayed 2 nights in before heading to Granada.
This hotel is beautiful we upgraded to a junior suite and the service in the hotel was excellent.  The hotel is in a great area for sightseeing.  Highly recommend.",5,2018,06,26
61,"Good hotel, nice view ","We spent a total 3 nights in this hotel, the lobby is super nice and there’s always free champagne and snacks (not that we got served any like everyone else). Our hotel room was nice and spacious with a double shower and a nice deck to have coffee on in the morning. My favorite part about this hotel is the roof top, it’s a bit hard to get a lounging chair by the pool but the view of the Barcelona Cathedral is outstanding! ",4,2018,06,25
61,Perfect location,"This hotel is located perfectly to reach the most important touristic sites. The bus stop and also a metro station are very close. 
The breakfast was excellent and would not liked to miss it. This was a prefect start of the day. The reception staff is very friendly and willing to help you including purchases of the tickets for touristic sites. 
Room was very clean and was all what you need including a bottle of water. 
I would definetly return to this hotel.",5,2018,06,23
61,"Fantastic hotel, fantastic location","Room was lovely and spacious, bathroom and shower were 10/10 and balcony was nice. Rooftop was stunning, great views and great service. Staff were friednly and very helpful, would 1000% come back. Amazing",5,2018,06,23
61,"Best hotel ever, take me back now!","As soon as we stepped into the hotel we were blown away! Such a a lovely receptionist called Susanna welcomed us with a huge smile. There was ice cold champagne that we could help ourselves to (and we did) what more could you want. We went up to our room and again so happy with how nice it was. The bed was huge and comfortable, the bathroom so clean and modern with a huge shower head. We had complimentary water and a cute dish with some cookies. We were lucky enough to have a room with a balcony which had an amazing view of the Gothic Cathedral and the most beautiful tree with vivid purple blossom. 
The roof top was also a delight with a fantastic pool and seating area which served drinks and food. The cocktails were delicious! This also included an even better view of the Cathedral. 
I would absolutely stay here again, there is not one thing I would change. The gothic district is a great location with so many beautiful things to see. 
Thank you so much for making mine and my friends trip to Barcelona so memorable.",5,2018,06,22
61,Awesome Hotel,"Awesome Hotel right in the Gothic Quarter. Rooms are clean and spacious. Bathroom was nice. Beds comfortable. Staff was extremely helpful. (Thank you Josef). Roof top pool and bar to relax. Close to shops, The Cathedral, restaurants, Picasso Museum, tons of boutiques, a metro, a bus stop and the La Rambla. Definitely a hotel to consider when in the beautiful city of Barcelona. ",5,2018,06,18
61,Perfect base for exploring a fantastic city,"I recently stayed at H10 Madison for 4 nights in a classic room. I had expected it to be small but it was really well lasted out with plenty of room and helpful inclusions like bottled water replenished daily. 
The bed was comfortable and you couldn’t hear any noise from outside (level 3) with the windows shut. The rooftop pool and bar were lovely but most of all the friendly staff and the super convenient location made this place a welcome retreat to return to after a day of sightseeing. I would definitely stay again. 
Hasta pronto H10!",5,2018,06,18
61,Lovely hotel,"Only in Barca for one evening before a cruise so picked a hotel close to the city and port. Clean rooms with good sized sofa bed, cool rooftop bar and even complimentary champers in reception. only down point would be a dodgy lift",4,2018,06,16
61,Great location and great staff,"My wife and I stayed here for 8 nights at the beginning of June. From the moment we arrived the staff were great - very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. The location is perfect for walking pretty much anywhere you would want to go. The rooms are not large but have everything you would want and are very comfortable, albeit noisy if you open the windows. For me there was only one real negative - I booked tickets to visit the Sagrada Familia through the front desk, and only discovered when I queried the charge on my bank statement that the hotel had added a 20% commission, without telling me. Had I known I would have booked the tickets myself. Everything else, though, was very good.",4,2018,06,14
61,Superb Trip,"Spent 5 nights at this hotel. First time I have used the H10 group and it will certainly not be the last. The hotel was clean, staff friendly and it was a great location for touring the city. The rooms are spacious and modern although the inside rooms overlooking the atrium lacked air flow and light. The roof top bar was an excellent venue for a drink although prices were typical hotel rates.Overall an excellent experience will certainly revisit.",5,2018,06,14
61,Great Hotel!!,"We stayed at the H10 madison and was pleasantly pleased with the experience.  The hotel is very clean, modern and the rooftop pool/bar have an amazing view of the cathedral.

What made the stay perfect was the hotel staff; especially the front desk team. They were very kind and accommodating as well as very gracious with their help and recommendations on booking our day excursions.  

This hotel is a must for your stay in Barcelona.",5,2018,06,13
61,incredible hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the H10 Madison late April and really enjoyed our stay.  The staff were extremely polite and helpful, the rooms were clean and our view over the streets of Barcelona was lovely.  The hotel is close to many attractions.  The food was delightful.  I would definitely recommend this hotel and would also go back given the opportunity.",5,2018,06,12
61,Barcelona experience,H10 Madison was a great location for seeing Barcelona for the first time. The hotel arranged our airport transfer to the hotel. The hotel staff were all very courteous and the room was very comfortable. The roof top terrace offered excellent views with a roof top bar and heated swimming pool.Breakfast was excellent with loads of fresh food catering to all tastes. It was only a short walk to the bus stop to take advantage of the Hop on Hop off bus.,5,2018,06,09
61,The name alone is enough for me,"After trawling the internet for places to stay in Barcelona i came across the H10 'range'.  Boom i've struck gold.  All the hotels looked great and offered all that we wanted but I opted for the H10 Madison in the end, tough choice i know with a 4star superior to go too.  We stayed at the end of May, the location is top notch, off the beaten track to be quiet but right in the thick of places to go and visit.  Down the road is the Cathedral, round the corner is the Picasso Museum and up the road is the Pederare and the Casa's.  The entrance is lovely recepionists great, very welcoming and offered up a nice glass of something cold on arrival. Check in was swift with no messing and up to the room. The room is great sized and had all that we needed. Bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom well equipped with all that you need. Note to self, next time don't bother with toilteries as they provide a great selection.  Water and coffee are included as well as a good and easy to use safe.  Overall a great room, a balcony to boot with a great view of the catherdral. Breakfast was a delight, great selection and catered for the gluten free in you, the display and the presentation of the layout was sublime, well done.  Staff we always welcoming and exteremly attentive but not overbearing, never was  my glass empty of coffee and orange juice during our sitting.  I would suggest to people staying here to opt for the breakfast rather than venture out to get coffee and croissants. It opens from 7am to 11am to you have lots of time, the busiest time was around 9am.  We did go to the top bar for a view and drink, again the layout is just heavenly and the staff great.  Even when asked for a cocktail they did not recoil away or say no, they took the ingredients and made a damn good Mule, thank you.  The checkout was swift with no iseues or squabbles, the stay went too quick, but the hotel and the stff and facilities just made it so. Overall a great place to stay and the price was well on the money and worth every euro.  My tip for people looking to stay here is opt for the breakfast if you can when you book the hotel. I would also heavilty suggest that you use the conceirge/reception to book tickets for the places you wish to go to like Parc Guell or the Sagrada Familee as if like us you don't an just turn up you will not get in.  Make sure you plan yourself. Ooh and would i stay here again - si!",5,2018,06,07
61,All great!,"Nice deco.  Room good size. Very clean.  Staff amazingly friendly.  Check in process was efficient.  Best of all is the location. Whichever direction you headed, you would end up in a landmark within 15 mind walking.  Metro and buses were less than 5 minutes from hotel.  You can easily go back to hotel to rest a bit before starting the second part of the tour.  ",5,2018,06,07
61,Ideally situated,"Excellent hotel, ideally situated to get to everywhere. 
Short walk to main centre with lots of shops, City Bus tours which are a great way to get around and lots of restaurants/bars nearby.
Museu Picasso only short walking distance away from hotel.
Lovely to sit on roof top during day or evening as there is a bar and a small outdoor pool.",5,2018,06,05
61,Wonderful,"This is a lovely hotel. Sound proofing on the windows is excellent, the bed was large and comfortable, so clean everywhere and the staff really polite and friendly.  No kettle in the room but there is a Nespresso machine and fridge so we bought more capsules and milk. Amazing walk in shower and the toiletries actually smelt nice  ",5,2018,06,05
61,"Nice hotel, perfect location","Brand new, pretty, clean rooms. Not large, but big enough and comfortable King sized bed! Our favorite of our 5 night stay (and reason to return) was the rooftop pool bar that overlooked much of Barcelona with great cathedral views (also great 5 euro or less Rioja wines on the roof and nice staff!). Room service also very reasonably priced. Obviously great location, walking distance to beach/port, Las Ramblas, La Boqueria, Picasso museum, El Born neighborhood, and great proximity to the Cathedral with a big open square. Only problem for me was that I had a hard time getting my husband to explore Barcelona because he wanted to hang out on the rooftop! Also, all front desk staff were exceptionally helpful and always friendly- thanks for the great tips, Susana!",5,2018,06,02
61,Lovely hotel. Great staff. Great location.,"If wondering where to stay when in Barcelona, look no further than here. Great value, immaculate rooms, spotlessly clean, and lovely view from the roof top bar/pool area.. And so close to Gothic Quarter. It's a real pleasure to recommend this place.",5,2018,06,01
61,Holà Madison ,"Lovely hotel close to the cathedral with great views from up top of roof bar and swimming pool. Staff were really nice, very helpful and always made sure that we were always ok. Rooms were well appointed and spacious. Location was also spot on, just out enough of the hustle and bustle but a nice walk to all the shops,  restaurants with always something to see either on our way to or from dinner. Thanks guys hope to come back soon. ",5,2018,05,31
61,"Great hotel, Ideal position ","As a launching point for touring Barcelona, the H10 Madison is perfect. Situated beside the Gothic Quarter, many of the city’s major attractions are close by. The hotel itself is lovely with very attentive and helpful staff, modern, clean rooms, very nice breakfast bar and a lounge bar upstairs that we haven’t tried yet. Very impressive!",5,2018,05,29
61,Great Location In Barcelona's Gothic Quarter,"This hotel is new for 2018 in Barcelona and is very nicely appointed. The location is excellent in the Gothic Quarter.
We had a standard double room which had a comfortable large bed and, from the small balcony, a partial view of Barcelona Cathedral at the end of the street.  The modern bathroom had a great shower.
The reception staff and breakfast staff were both very efficient and friendly.
Breakfast was very enjoyable each day with a good selection of fruit, pastries, juices and yoghurt.  The best thing was that cooked items such as scrambled or poached eggs, porridge, bacon and sausages are all made to order instead of sitting out in a buffet.  These items from the menu are not only freshly prepared but beautifully presented by the friendly staff.  As well as tea and coffee. it is also possible to get cappucino or latte from the bar in the breakfast room at no extra cost.
This hotel has a lovely roof terrace bar on the 8th floor, accessible by lift.  There is a small pool and lots of tables from which to enjoy the views across to the cathedral.  The rooftop bar serves wine, cocktails and tapas.
One general note about Barcelona is, to enjoy this magnificent city to the full, one should not carry much cash around as there are pickpockets in most areas.  Everywhere takes cards.  The rooms at H10 Madison have a safe so leave anything of value in the safe when going out.
We would definitely return to this hotel the next time we visit Barcelona. ",5,2018,05,27
61,Great Hotel,"Myself and my partner recently stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and found it to be perfect. 

We got the Aerobus straight from Barcelona airport to Placa Catalunya (30 mins can buy tickets in advance online) and from here it was an easy 5 - 10min walk to the hotel. The hotel is in a fantastic location, easy walking distance to the marina, the gothic / jewish old town and Las Ramblas. You're spoilt for choice for places to eat and drink on your doorstep. 

The hotel itself was lovely, clean and modern with helpful and polite staff. The rooms were tastefully decorated, with a spacious modern bathroom with lovely towels, bathrobes and toiletries. There was even an Nespresso machine for an early morning espresso! 

As an added bonus, up on the roof was a lovely bar and terrace area with stunning views and a plunge pool. Such a great way to come and relax and enjoy the sun. We had a great chilled out couple of hours with a bottle of Sangria. 

Theres nothing I could suggest to this hotel that would make it any better. It met all our needs and exceeded our expectations. If I return to Barcelona, it will be to this hotel without hesitation. ",5,2018,05,26
61,Fantastic hotel,"Me and my friends had brilliant time in this hotel. The staf was very friendly, helpful, proffesional and always smile . Breakfast was absolutely amazing choice. Pool area was lovely with spectacular view . I will definitely be back :)",5,2018,05,22
61,Very comfortable (except the bed),"Nice rooms, well appointed. The location in the Gothic quarter is very convenient. The street corner is a little noisy, but the double windows are very soundproof so not a problem, even for a light sleeper like me. Everything in the rooms is new and works very well. There is a lovely ceiling fan and nice rain shower and bathroom in general. The pool is just an unheated dunk tank, but the roof does have a great view of the cathedral. I'd have given the H10 Madison five starts except for the hard bed,",4,2018,05,17
61,Beautiful and centrally located,"The H10 Madison is a fabulous new addition to this top-notch collection of hotels — one that on par with Marriott’s AC hotels. Our spacious junior suite had a large marble bathroom as well as all the creature comforts we demand for a good night’s rest: a firm, but comfortable king sized bed, windows that open to the cool of a courtyard (unless you prefer the air conditioner) and a mammoth ceiling fan. I love that we were greeted upon arrival with a glass of cava and a friendly staff that’s always smiling and willing to offer advice.  Although we chose to eat on the run during our stay, the attractive breakfast room was so appealing it temped me to reconsider my decision to pass on a formal breakfast. Schedule time on the roof for a drink and a spectacular view of Barcelona’s gothic cathedral. It’s time well spent.",5,2018,05,16
61,F1 Trip Barcelona,"We stayed at the H10 Madison during the F1 weekend. The hotel is very beautiful and I would like to recommend it to everyone planning to visit Barcelona. Located next to the Cathedral and near the Ramblas, the hotel is a perfect start for a city trip.

The rooms are very good (although not big) and the service is outstanding: from the reception with a complimentary glass of Cava till breakfast with an incredible offering of fresh food and cooking on demand (eggs, wafles, pancakes).

Great staff!

Thank you

61,Amazing stay in Barcelona,"We loved our stay in this new hotel. The facilities are beautiful, the staff couldn’t be more helpful and the breakfast was amazing. It is in a perfect area to explore Barcelona. The shower was amazing.",5,2018,05,13
61,Highly recommend,"I stayed here for 4 nights.  The reception staff were exceptional, nothing was too much trouble.  They even managed to secure a football ticket for us for Real Madrid v Barcelona at a very reasonable price.  The hotel is modern and very clean.  Our room which was a junior suite was spacious and very well equipped.  It had a safe, coffee machine, water and the usual toiletries.  We did not have a bath in our room but a double rain shower!!!  The view from our room was not great - a wall and a courtyard but it was quiet.   it is located in a great area , close to shops and bars   I wouldn't hesitate to recommend a stay here and I would definitely return if I stayed in Barcelona again.  Thank you to all the staff at H10 Madison.",5,2018,05,10
61,Beautiful hotel - excellent service.  Highly recommend.,"Loved this beautiful hotel.  Newly opened -  so still working out a few things, but loved it.  Very clean.  Staff was very cordial and always helpful.  I would recommend the breakfast.  It was truly amazing and so many choices.  Linens and bath towels were very high quality. Also the terrace and rooftop bar are not to be missed.  Beautiful views and so peaceful. Bartender was excellent and extremely helpful.   Would definitely recommend this hotel.  Very convenient location.",5,2018,05,08
61,A good choice in Barcelona,"A new hotel in a great location. Fantastic rooftop pool and deck area. Our studio room was spacious and well appointed. It was at the back of the property on the 5th floor, no problem with noise from outside or other rooms at all. They had the most amazing towels. Staff were always helpful and friendly. Would highly recommend. ",5,2018,05,05
61,Great Hotel in a Great Location!,"Spectacular service, extremely clean, comfortable rooms.  Spacious, clean bathrooms.  Breakfast buffet that we purchased with the room had an excellent selection, superior service, and very good food. The hotel is in a great location, within walking distance to many areas.  We were allowed to check in early, and we were very thankful as we had an early international flight arrival time.  Really made our experience in Barcelona perfect! We will definitely recommend to friends traveling to Barcelona.",5,2018,05,04
61,Rivers Of Champagne But No Tea,"We stayed two nights and booked the hotel on the basis of its location, it was the most expensive hotel on our 30 day trip of France, Spain and Germany

The room was comfortable and the breakfast was ample and varied.

However during our stay we experienced several problems which we attributed to inadequate and / or inexperienced staff 

While there may be unlimited sparkling wine in the foyer for guest to enjoy, a thermos of hot water promised at checked in failed to appear after two hours and two phone calls. We were finally told at 9.30 pm we could not have hot sent to our room as there was only one staff member in the hotel",2,2018,04,30
61,"Great location, great hotel","Stayed here on business but would definitely come back with family... Rooms were great, very high standard, breakfast was great and the staff were great too... The only thing I would change is to stay longer !",5,2018,04,29
61,New hotel in a great location ,"This was a great place to stay in the Gothic section of Barcelona. The Barcelona cathedral is just up the block. There are plenty of restaurants in the area and 2 subway entrances close by. The rooms are spacious including a nespresso maker, refrigerator, closets, 3 draws, large bed and large bathroom. We had a junior suite in the back of the building which was quiet. The roof has a small pool with a bar which closes early. The restaurant on the first floor  is open for breakfast and the roof bar is open for lunch. Food at lunch was great but the smoothies amazing. The AC didn’t work very well when we got there so we were moved to another room and given a meal for free for our troubles. Everyone was super nice and we would recommend this hotel. ",5,2018,04,27
61,"Fantastic Location, Modern Rooms, Great Staff",Title says it all. Stayed in the hotel at the end of April 2018 while on holiday in Barcelona. The staff were absolutely wonderful. They were as professional and courteous as any guest could expect and more. The hotel itself has a very cozy feeling while being in a old building. The rooms were very modern and extremely clean and were a very good size for the location. The hotel still had that new building smell as if it was only completed yesterday. I would definitely recommend anyone visiting Barcelona to stay at this hotel as you are in walking distance of almost everything you need to see within Barcelona. The roof top bar and small pool were a plus for the location as well! Pool is small and shallow but I did not expect a pool at all so that was great and the views from the room are absolutely amazing. 10/10 amazing job by management and the hotel chain.,5,2018,04,24
61,"Absolutely fantastic hotel in perfect location. Service, breakfast and rooms superb!","We stayed at the H10 Madison for five nights. The staff were friendly, attentive, informative and couldn’t do enough for us in order to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. Breakfast was absolutely superb. Everything was top quality from the fresh pastries, meats, cheeses and fruit. There was also an a la carte menu which included eggs, waffles, pancakes and the most amazing porridge with fruits. The presentation of all the food and quality of cooking was exceptional. The architecture and bespoke furniture gave the hotel a warm, luxurious and contemporary feel. A lovely touch was the champagne and bottled water available for guests in the foyer and at breakfast. The location perfect. Right in the heart of the gothic quarter so you could walk everywhere.",5,2018,04,22
61,Great location and helpful staff,Stayed here for a 3 night break in April. Great location for exploring the city and the rooftop view and small pool great for relaxing and enjoying the sunshine. The rooms were clean and well designed with lovely large TV for watching when the day had ended. What struck me the most was how friendly and helpful all the staff were during the stay. Always smiling and there to answer questions/book restaurants etc. Would definitely stay again.,5,2018,04,22
61,"Location, Location, Location","We stayed at the H10 Madison for 2 nights after coming off a cruise ship.  Wonderful experience.  It's newly renovated and very nice.  Typical small European room with 2 beds together, but nice bathroom and French type balcony overlooking a local courtyard. The meowing cat could have been a problem but she stopped at night.  Coffee machine and fridge.  Fantastic breakfast, great view from the roof deck, very accommodating and helpful staff.  The hotels is steps from the cathedral, 3 minute walk to the Hop On Hop Off Redline bus, and 10 minutes walk from Las Ramblas.  We highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,04,21
61,Fabulous Hotel located in an Excellent location,"I stayed for a long weekend at the hotel. 
Was greeted with helpful staff & a cold glass of Cava. 
The hotel located in a great location in the Gothic quarter & in walking distance of many bars & resturants.
The interior fabulous - clean lines & well thought out.
Rooms a good size, comfortable beds & pillows.Very quiet - so slept well.
Great bathroom with a wonderful shower. Very large bath towels & well stocked tolietries .Proper powerful hairdryer.
Fabulous rooftop bar & Terrace.
Faultless & helpful staff.
10 out of 10 
A great staff & fully recommend this hotel",5,2018,04,18
61,great hotel but shy of perfect,"Booked this hotel through the BA package and it was great.
Good location - the Barcelona Cathedral is 2 minutes down the road and about 5-10 mins  from one of the main squares (the name escapes me) where the shuttle buses stop.
Views not the best. Either main street or other buildings.

When my mum and I arrived at the hotel it was around 3-4pm and was surprised we couldn't check in; apparently internet was down and they couldn't issue key cards. I was disappointed at first as it was so hot compared to UK and I just wanted to freshen up. They directed us to the bar and say we could order anything so yay free lunch. I ordered the spanish omelette and it was lovely. My mum ordered the burger and ti was nicely presented. Big portions and obviously everything taste better free.

We were upgrade to a bigger room but my lovely mum didn't want to share a bed with me :P and i think we were given our original room which was hilarious! It was still a decent room size and had everything we needed in the room. Having hooks in the bathroom would have made it better. Beds were big (i think it was single and not twin sized so lots of space)

Staff were lovely and helpful. They gave restaurant recommendations and helped us book aquarium. I have been to hotels where they'd say you can look/book online ourselves (Holiday inn alexanderplatz- i'm looking at you!)

The only reason I couldn't give 5 star was because of the breakfast. I'm a big breakfast fan and for the continental there was a lot of selections and that was cute and tasty but the cooked breakfast was poor. I ordered scrambled eggs but it didn't come out fluffy and light - it was liquidly and omelette like, the bacon was cooked until it was charred and sausages were undercooked. Baked beans wasn't warm and was presented in a big bowl so that was the biggest portion on the plate i felt.
Second day i ordered the omelette thinking it was the nice spanish omelette but it came out looking like the scrambled eggs the previous day. i found it funny. 
We had churros which was freshly made and yummy!
First place I have been to where the continental breakfast trumped the cooked breakfast. 

Highly recommended and would stay here if I were to come back to Barcelona.",4,2018,04,18
61,Excellent 5 stars,"The hotel is excellent. Staff are friendly and helpful. Restaurant and food are lovely. Room and hotel are clean and modern. 
Rooftop pool area is amazing with wonderful views of the area.
Location is perfect aswell, in the Gothic area.
Would definitely recommend to any couple who want a break to Barcelona",5,2018,04,16
61,Great Escape,"Took my wife for her birthday and stayed for 5 days. This is a brand new hotel with a lot of charm and centrally located. The staff is outstanding at the front desk, the restaurant and throughout. Oriol made all of our reservations for the tablao and the Sacred Family. The breakfast Buffett is very good and omelette are made a la carte. We will return, the rooms were ample and had it all. A nice Cava bottle to welcome us was a great surprise.",5,2018,04,09
61,Excellent,Selected this hotel because of its location and we were not disappointed.  Right next to the Cathedral and a great base for a weekend of exploring.  The welcome on arrival was second to none and we were made to feel really welcome.  We were given an upgraded room as well so ended up with a balcony overlooking a courtyard.  The room was superb.  The bathroom was huge and a massive walk in shower with two shower heads was amazing.  The room was spotless and housekeeping kept it that way all weekend.  Breakfast was great.  Huge selection from the buffet and you can order all sorts of hot food.  All the staff were smiling and really helpful.  Will definitely stay here again the next time we are in Barcelona.,5,2018,04,09
61,Great hotel stay,"Booked this back when it was just opened and no reviews available, so a bit unsure of what to expect. But turned out to be a really great experience. 

Welcoming staff, our room was available even though we turned up already at 10 in the morning - great. Really enjoyed the room and decor as well, size worked out well for our family of four. Storage could perhaps been slightly bigger but it was okay. Good with safe for storing valuables. Great with Nespresso machine which we used every day. Had read up on breakfast price before and decided for alternate options so never tried. Great roof top area and a with a small plunge pool - basically my only downside, it was not heated so we never used it.

Brilliant location of the hotel, just in Barri Gothic area and really close to subway and other key areas. We had a room on 1st floor and felt room was really sound proof as well, especially from other rooms which you couldn't hear anything of, but not much from the road either, nothing that disturbed us at least.

61,Fantastic location!! Amazing hospitality!! Great stay!!!,Thank you so much H10 Madison! The stay was amazing!!! And an extra special thanks to Adrià who was a great help to my fiancé and I on her birthday!! We appreciate all of the advice on Barcelona!! ¡¡Hasta luego!!,5,2018,04,02
61,Lovely place to stay,"We stayed here for 4 nights with 2 young children. The hotel is in a brilliant location just by the Gothic Quarter; walking distance to lots shops and restaurants and close by to public transport to get out a bit further. We arrived early and our room was ready. The staff at the front desk were very helpful and provided all the necessary tips for staying in Barcelona. The beds are super comfy and we all had a great sleep with no fussing from the boys! The room also has a coffee machine which I felt was a great addition! Although we didn’t use it, the hotel has a small but lovely terrace pool and bar with views overlooking the Cathedral. The breakfast rate is quite steep when travelling with small children for 23€ per person, so we opted to have breakfast at the many cafes close by. There’s so much to see and do in Barcelona we will be returning and will most certainly book to stay here again. We’ve had a really lovely stay. Thank you!",5,2018,03,30
61,"Great Hotel , Great Location Great Staff","We stayed in the Hotel for 3 nights for my wife’s 60th Birthday. 

On check in we were welcomed with a nice cold glass of Cava . Water was an option!  Check in  was faultless. 

Throughout the stay all of the staff were superb and it seems wrong to single out one person based on this but I have to call out one – Alicia. She was simply great. 
 
The hotel has only been open for about 6 weeks, so as expected everything was pristine.  Whilst décor is always an individual taste, we could not fault it. 

On my wife’s birthday, we returned to the room to be greeted with a nice cold bottle of Cava and birthday cake. 

The bathroom had a large double walk in shower and was well equipped with good quality toiletries. And – which is not alas typical – proper bath towels. As well as slippers and dressing gowns.

One really nice touch was the safe – it had a power point inside. Including a UK plug. So you could charge your devices whilst you were out for the day. 

There is a roof top terrace, pool and bar. The bar itself was not open but they were happy to provide service from the ground floor bar.

Breakfast was offered as ‘Continental’. All I can say is it was the best continental breakfast I have had.  

One complaint – storage. The wardrobe did not have enough hangers. And draw space was limited. 2 draws could not be used unless you opened the bedroom door.  We could not open the right wardrobe door enough without doing so. Swapping the hanging space and draw space would solve this issue.

We also asked for a kettle (we Brits like our tea). We got a new one -  the wires were still wrapped. Alas the switch would not stay on without holding it down.

That said we would highly recommend this hotel without question.

It is just off las Ramblas and about 200 m from the cathedral with lots of choice for food and drink, whatever your taste close by.

Simply put - first class.",5,2018,03,29
61,Excellent hotel in a fantastic location,"I visited this hotel for a short break on March 25th - 28th 2018 with my partner. The hotel was recently refurbished in February 2018 and our room was very clean and comfortable and the breakfast was exceptional.The hotel is in a great location of the city only 200 metres from the Cathedral, good restaurants and other places of interest. It is well worth taking the City Bus Tours to see more of this fabulous city. However, the most important part of any good hotel is the staff that work there and the staff at this hotel were excellent, at reception, in the restaurant. in the bar and everywhere. I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely visit Barcelona again and use the same hotel . Alan Wright",5,2018,03,28
61,Great hotel,"We arrived a few hours before check in. Upon arrival we were greeted by the friendly reception team who were really helpful. Our room was ready and our bags were taken to the room.
The room was super clean and really comfortable. The only thing we would change would be to add some hooks inside the bathrooms as there is no where to hang damp towels. That is a real minor point and clearly we managed to get by! 
The location is spot on. Really close to Barcelona cathedral.....the other one! It’s right in the heart of the gothic quarter and most places are accessible on foot. However public transport is easy to use. 
Lovely hotel that we would recommend to anyone travelling to Barcelona. Beautiful room, lovely roof terrace, welcoming reception area and friendly staff! ",5,2018,03,24
61,Fantastic Hotel in perfect location.,"This very newly renovated hotel located located in the Gothic quarter is 2 minutes from the Gaudí Cathedral on de la Catedral. We were greeted by warm smiles from the friendly staff. The rooms are spacious and have all modern facilities. I mentioned it was my wife’s birthday and after our breakfast and walk around the markets there was a bottle of Cava awaiting us upon our return. Breakfast was really good, we ate way too much. The location is perfect with access to most of the sites, bars & restaurants in the Gothic quarter. It’s also a short walk to the Metro. We loved our short stay and highly recommend this hotel. It’s also worthwhile checking out their rooftop terrace with amazing views of the city, particularly at sunset. All in all we had a great time and would definitely stay again. ",5,2018,03,18
61,"Nice hotel, helpful friendly staff, great location","I stayed here four nights while attending Mobile World Congress. The hotel has been newly renovated and overall is very pleasant. I was greeted in the lobby and offered a drink upon entry, definitely a nice touch.

Throughout my stay, the front desk and the restaurant staff were always helpful, pleasant and strove to please. For a newly opened hotel, it was great to see how well the team appeared to have jelled.

There were only two points that I would call out as needing improvement. First, was a small nit - the room only had two hangars in the entire closet. When catering to business travelers for a conference that requires 3 night minimum stays, having 4 hangars is not going to break the bank. 

The second point was a bit more annoying. Unless extreme care is taken, a simple shower leaves the bathroom floor swamped. Both I, and a colleague in another room had the same experience. The shower doors swing out, so unless closed properly (and you avoid budging them with an elbow) the floor gets soaked. Even if you take care, opening the shower door leaves water dripping down. Poor design. After this happened once, I took extra care to close the door solidly and still found that water leaking around door seams. I needed to reduce the flow of water and tilt the shower head away to keep the floor dry.",4,2018,03,03
61,"Fabulous, Friendly Hotel ","We booked into this hotel as a last minute booking. It has exceeded all of our expectations. It is very comfortable and ideally situated for all sightseeing.

61,Unfortunately not recommended anymore,"As we liked the hotel so far very much, we booked it for a stay in October the third time. Unfortunately it has become very expensive; in 2023 we paid about 350.00 EUR per night for a junior suite. In 2024, a standard room will be charged around EUR 400.00 per night (each incl. Breakfast is offered for an extra charge of EUR 50.00 per day). At these prices we booked a standard room this time.  The room was quite neat and clean, but the price was not justified. Breakfast was very good and varied last year, but this year it was a big disappointment. No variety in tapas, the cheese from the discount store.
Breakfast is served until 11.00 am; at 10.10 am more than once much was already gone and was only refilled after a hint.
The biggest outrage at this price and a 4StarS hotel was the water on offer. It is highly chlorinated tap water that has been bubbled up. This one is inedible. The water from the tap actually tastes the same. Last year there was still ""real"" mineral water, this year only after some long discussions with the staff. 
We expect a house of this category to be of a corresponding quality that was not provided here.",3,2024,10,14

61,Bad view from a junior suite,"We had booked a junior suite and were totally disappointed. The room was upstairs but at the back. We looked out onto backyards and hanging clotheslines.
The furnishings, apart from the bathroom, were also old-fashioned. Behind our bed there was a screen that ran the entire width of the room, and you would press your head against the hinges.
Totally overpriced in terms of price.
Then it was high season and there was only one elevator. Nothing changed during our entire stay.",3,2024,06,18

Tornati in hotel abbiamo constatato che i bagagli erano già in camera. Camera super pulita e abbastanza grande, tutto moderno, elegante con parquet e doccia immensa. In camera si trova tutto il necessario per doccia e toilette, shampoo balsamo crema, accappatoio ciabatte, spazzolino dentifricio addirittura ago e filo.
All’ottavo piano si trova una stupenda terrazza con vista, un bar dove prendere l’aperitivo e una piscina riscaldata che i miei figli hanno adorato. Noi a novembre siamo riusciti ancora a fare il bagno.
Dopo una lunga giornata in giro a visitare Barcellona era stupendo potersi rilassare sui lettini mentre i bambini giocano in acqua contenti.
La mattina invece scendevamo a fare colazione e possiamo dire di aver trovato di tutto è più. C’era un buffet super fornito e inoltre in carta c’erano omlette, crêpes, becon uova,…
Personale super disponibile sorridente e gentile.
Davvero un hotel stupendo lo consiglio a tutti.",5,2021,11,05
61,10 von 10 Punkten,Wir sind sehr zufrieden gewesen. Super tolles Hotel. Sehr schöne Aussicht von der Dachterasse mit Pool auf die Catedral de Barcelona. Der Service war der absolute Hammer. An der Rezeption haben wir Ruben F. Vargas kennen gelernt. Seine Tipps waren absolut perfekt und sind sehr zu empfehlen. Des Weiteren sehr gute Lage. Mit 10 -20 Minuten zu Fuß erreicht man alles sehr gut. Preis Leistung ebenfalls top.,5,2021,10,18
61,"Schönes Hotel, zentral gelegen","Schönes Hotel, modern eingerichtet. Die Ausstattung ist in sehr gutem Zustand und es ist alles da, was man so braucht. Alles sehr sauber und trotz der sehr zentralen Lage auch sehr ruhig. 
Das Frühstück war super und sehr abwechslungsreich. Auch der Kaffee war für ein Hotel sehr gut. 
Die Cocktail-Bar auf dem Dach kann man ohne weiteres empfehlen, auch wenn das Personal hier manchmal ein wenig länger gebraucht hat. Dafür waren aber alle immer super-freundlich und zuvorkommend. 
Wie schon gesagt ist das Hotel zentral gelegen und wenn man gut zu Fuß ist, kann man die meisten Sehenswürdigkeiten auch gut zu Fuß erreichen, ebenso wie den Hafen und Stadt-Strand. 
Alles in allem für einen Städte-Trip eine klare Empfehlung.",5,2021,09,19
61,MUY AGRADECIDA POR EL EXCELENTE SERVICIO EN EL H10 MADISON,"Escribo este email para expresar mi más profundo agradecimiento por una magnífica atención y excelente servicio, durante los días que estuve hospedada junto con mis padres, esposo y tres menores hijos, en el H10 Madison Barcelona para celebrar el 50 Aniversario de Bodas de mis padres y cumpleaños de mi madre.

Durante los siete días que estuvimos hospedados en el hotel, pudimos gozar de seguridad, paz y tranquilidad en todos los ambientes. La atención servicial que recibimos de todo el personal fue de primera calidad y nos permitió relajarnos por completo y disfrutar de nuestras vacaciones. Las instalaciones del hotel fueron muy cómodas, en especial la terraza del último piso y la piscina. La calidad y variedad del desayuno realmente de primera, pensando en cada detalle y variedad para todos los gustos.

Quisiera agradecer especialmente a Bruno, por  haber estado pendiente de nuestros requerimientos. Desde la impresión de la tarjeta de 50 Aniversario de Bodas de mis padres para acompañar la botella de champagne solicitada; así como las fresas con chocolate y la botella de champagne de cortesía brindadas. Todos estos detalles contribuyeron al bienestar y alegría de mis padres y lograron que nuestra estadía sea inolvidable.

Asímismo, el personal de recepción estuvo atento a todos nuestros requerimientos cuando necesitamos información de la ciudad y diligentes al imprimir los documentos de viaje QR y exámenes de COVID para el viaje de regreso a Inglaterra.

No puedo dejar de agradecer a todo el personal del desayuno el cual cada mañana nos recibía con una sonrisa y trato cordial. También el personal de la terraza, bar y piscina quienes nos atendían con deliciosos cocktails y tapas. Así como el personal de limpieza que mantenía nuestras habitaciones inmaculadas todos los días.

Solo me queda decirles gracias una vez más y estoy segura que al regresar a esta ciudad, acudiremos nuevamente a ustedes.",5,2021,09,01
61,Volveremos,"Somos clientes de h10, siempre que vamos a diferentes lugares si hay vamos. En esta ocasión todo muy bien, ubicación, habitaciones amplias y limpias. Muy tranquilo todo y estar tan céntrico. Desayuno muy correcto y variado, servicio muy atento. Para poner una pega quisimos ir a tomar algo en la terraza que tienen arriba en la piscina y no pudimos por la peste a porro que havia de unos de los clientes que allí estaban, eso los trabajadores tenía que haver dicho a semejante persona que parara. Ya que a muchos nos molesta es ilegal y mas si vamos con niños. Fuera eso el hotel de 10.",5,2021,08,24
61,Top Hotel in top Lage,"Sehr feines, kleines Hotel in Toplage in der Altstadt, Metrostation in unmittelbarer Nähe, nahezu alles ist bequem fussläufig erreichbar, top Frühstück, sehr kleiner Pool mit sehr wenigen Liegen, wir konnten in 5 Tagen nie eine ergattern, aber wir wollten ohnehin Sightseeing machen",5,2021,07,09
61,¡Un hotel excelente!,"Desde la primera llamada todo fue genial, ya que Pedro fue muy amable y gracias a que el hotel me encantaba por su ubicación y a su atención, me decidí a realizar la reserva. Considero muy importante conectar con el cliente y ofrecerle una atención profesional y cercana.
Los chicos y las chicas han sido muy simpáticos/as, cercanos/as y profesionales. La mejor experiencia que he tenido nunca en todos los hoteles en los que he estado. 

Habitación: nos hospedamos en una habitación Classic Catedral, desde el balcón se veía la espectacular Catedral de Barcelona, lo cual es todo un lujo. Habitación impoluta, amplia y con una excelente distribución (la televisión muy grande y enfrente de la cama) y nada ruidosas para estar en un sitio tan céntrico.

Restauración: Sin duda, lo mejor de la estancia. Tenía el desayuno buffet incluido al reservar por Internet y estaba todo extraordinariamente bueno. Un 10 para el desayuno y para el personal de restauración, especialmente Judith que fue super atenta, simpática y cercana. Un lujazo de profesionales tienen en su hotel. Me hicieron sentir como en casa, cosa que no es fácil. 

Ubicación: a 6 minutos andando de Plaça Catalunya.

En definitiva, podría estar horas escribiendo cosas buenas sobre este hotel. Lo mejor para mí el personal, la calidad del desayuno y la limpieza y amplitud de las habitaciones. Una valoración de 10 se me queda corta para la excelente experiencia que he tenido. Sin duda, repetiré. 
¡Muchas gracias!",5,2021,05,27
61,Empfehlenswert,"Sehr sauberes, schönes Hotel. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich, zuvorkommend und erfüllt alle Wünsche. Hatten ein Doppelzimmer mit Frühstück. Ein sehr reichhaltiges Buffet. Da findet jeder was. Rooftop pool und Bar sind empfehlenswert. Blick auf die Cathedral de Barcelona. Der Pool ist klein, aber beheitzt. Bei windigem Wetter brachten sie uns sogar Decken, dass wir trotzdem etwas sonnen konnten.
Wir würden das Hotel allen empfehlen, die einen Städtetrip machen möchten. Es ist sehr zentral gelegen. Diverse Einkaufsmöglichkeiten und öffentlicher Verkehr in wenigen Gehminuten erreichbar.
Auch zahlreiche gute Restaurants findet man in der Nähe.",5,2020,02,08

61,Che frio!!!!,"precioso hotel, vista única, la única nota discordante el frío que tuve que pasar en esta terraza, no muy bien equipado para la calefacción, me dio una manta para ponerme las piernas en noviembre y el frío se siente bastante ...  ¡Recomiendo esta terraza solo en verano y no en invierno porque es imposible tomar un aperitivo en el frío!  a pesar de este defecto personal fabulosa terraza muy competente y agradable!",3,2019,11,19
61,En el corazón del barrio Gótico,"Jornada de trabajo en la ciudad. Por localización elegimos el H10 Madison. Muy buena atención de todo el personal, amable y atento. Impecable estado de las instalaciones, limpieza permanente. Hermosa terraza y vista a principales puntos de interés. Excelente ubicación claro. Buena calidad de descanso. Lo negativo: habitaciones pequeñas para dos personas, muy estrechas. Precio: elevado como toda la hotelería centrica, más si tomo en cuenta que ni siquiera desayuno incluye. ",4,2019,10,11
61,Super Hotel in toller Lage,"Wir waren zu dritt für vier Nächte in dem Hotel und haben uns rund um wohl gefühlt. Schönes Zimmer, tolle Dachterrasse mit kleinem Pool und nettem Restaurant.

La ubicación es excelente, al lado de la catedral y muy cerca de muchos lugares para visitar.

61,Hotel muy bien Ubicado,"El hotel está muy bien ubicado para hacer turismo en Barcelona a dos cuadras de la Catedral en el Barrio Gótico. Las instalaciones buenas y el servicio de desayuno también es bueno, aunque sugiero ofrecer jugo de naranja natural y no de caja. La habitación con vista a la catedral es realmente una vista parcial, ya que es una habitación de esquina y el hotel no está ubicado frente a la catedral. Los amenities Rituals son muy buenos. El personal de recepción atento, aunque durante nuestra estancia hubo un problema con el servicio de internet y nos enviaron a otro h10 para hacer una impresión que necesitábamos.",4,2019,07,19
61,MARAVILLOSO,"Maravilloso hotel a escasos metros de la Catedral de Barcelona donde puedes ir andando a todas partes. La decoración del hotel es preciosa, moderna pero acogedora.

Das ganze Design und Ambiente diese gerade einmal ein Jahr alten Hotel ist sehr geschmackvoll und hochwertig gestaltet. An der Reception gratis Wasser und Cava (Sekt). Sehr gutes Frühstück, freundliches Personal. Wir konnten schon um 10 Uhr morgens einchecken, der Zimmerwunsch (ruhiges Zimmer zum Innenhof und zwei Einzelbetten) wurde erfüllt.

61,"Bonito, céntrico  y acogedor. Servicio de lujo.","Este hotel es una belleza. 
Está ubicado en el corazón de Barcelona, muy cerca de la Catedral y el Barrio Gótico. Su decoración es muy elegante y acogedora, te hace sentir como si estuvieras en un lugar de la primera mitad del siglo pasado.
Desde que cruzas la puerta, el personal del hotel hace su trabajo de manera tan eficiente que no hay detalle que no sea cubierto, Además, es muy lindo que te ofrezcan una copa de vino espumoso o un vaso de agua justo cuando llegas cansado del viaje. 
Una vez que estás en tu habitación la sensación de confort no se hace esperar. El ambiente es sumamente acogedor, lo que te hace relajarte y cargar pilas para visitar la ciudad. Además, todo el equipamiento de la habitación está cuidadosamente planeado para hacerte sentir como en casa.
Su ubicación es un plus pues desde aquí puedes acceder fácilmente a algunos de los lugares más icónicos de la ciudad, como la Catedral, el Barrio Gótico, la Plaza Cataluña, Las Ramblas, la sede del gobierno y el bellísimo Palacio de la Casa de la Música.
El desayuno continental es muy sabroso y el servicio en el restaurante es muy, muy bueno: todo el personal es super amable y está al pendiente de todo lo que necesites. Por si fuera poco, este hotel cuenta con una bella terraza que  tiene una pequeña alberca y desde la que  se puede apreciar la ciudad desde lo alto.

61,Muy recomendable,"Estuvimos un fin de semana y la experiencia ha sido muy buena. Desde qe llegamos el personal de recepción muy atento en todo momento. Teníamos dos habitaciones reservadas. Nos dieron las que daban a la calle del hotel con balcón. Habitaciones estupendas muy agradables, con todo lo necesario y sobre todo muy silenciosas. La decoración merece una mención así el mismo hotel, destacar la terraza con vistas de Barcelona.No cogimos la opción de desayuno ya que somos de desayunar poco y nos pareció elevado el precio. Sin duda un hotel súper recomendable.",5,2019,02,17
61,zentrales Hotel,"Schöne Zimmer mit ausreichender Grösse, auch für 3 Personen. Zimmer war sauber, von der Dachterrasse hat man einen tollen Ausblick. Leider wurde uns beim CheckIn eine falsche Karte, für ein bereits belegtes Zimmer, gegeben.",3,2019,02,17
61,Deludente !!,"Abbiamo soggiornato, io, mia moglie e i miei due figli,  in questo albergo durante le festività di fine anno. Con nostro rammarico ci hanno assegnato due camere doppie nello  stesso piano mentre noi avevamo riservato due camere comunicanti. Alle mie rimostranze, alla reception mi hanno risposto che la nostra richiesta non era vincolante e che non potevano fare nulla in quanto l'albergo era pieno. Potete immaginare la scomodità di tale situazione. 
Abbiamo trovato le lenzuola sporche e anche il resto della biancheria non era pulitissimo.
Con fatica in quanto alla reception la ragazza faceva fatica ad esprimersi in inglese, siamo riusciti a farci cambiare le lenzuola il giorno dopo.
Per il resto, colazione nella normalità, punto a favore la posizione ottimale dell'albergo vicino alla Cattedrale, ma 4 stelle superior neanche nei film di fantascienza. Non ci tornerò.",2,2019,01,19
61,Fin de semana en el Barrio Gótico,"Ubicación en la Barcelona antigua muy cerca de la Catedral.
Establecimiento con pocos meses de antiguedad, diseño elegante. La habitación con doble ducha muy fácil de usar a diferencia de algunos hoteles que es necesario tener un master en ingenieria.
Terraza con buenas vistas para tomar algún coctel o simplemente un café.
A unos 500 metros de Plaza Catalunya y a igual distancia de la zona de Port Vell, 
Cenamos una muy buena ensalada Cesar.
No solemos desayunar en los hoteles a poca distancia establecimientos que ofrecen diversidad de opciones a mitad de precio.",5,2019,01,04

61,Un ottimo soggiorno.,"Abbiamo pernottato in questo meraviglioso hotel per tre notti. Situato praticamente in zona centrale, ci ha permesso di raggiungerlo in qualsiasi momento della giornata per qualsivoglia necessità. Tranquillo, silenzioso, particolarmente curato, personale attento alle esigenze della clientela, delizia gli ospiti alla mattina con una colazione impagabile. Stupendo anche il bar situato all’ottavo piano, che offre uno sguardo panoramico sulla città, molto suggestivo al tramonto. ",5,2018,12,02
61,Che dormita!,"Questo sì che è un hotel come si deve. Tutto al massimo livello di accoglienza, comodità, pulizia. Partiamo dal letto, ampio, caldo, con 3 cuscini tra cui scegliere. In bagno c’è tutto, dagli asciugamani morbidi e nuovi, agli accappatoi con ciabatte; la doccia è grande e funziona benissimo. Accessori a profusione. Manca il bidet, come dappertutto fuori dall’Italia. Un televisore immenso completa la comodità della stanza, non grande ma per due persone va bene. Colazione ottima, varia e senza limiti. L’hotel è in posizione ottimale per visitare Barcellona, in centro, intorno ci sono infiniti locali per pranzi cene o pause. Fa parte di una catena di hotel, soprattutto in Spagna, buono a sapersi. ",5,2018,12,01
61,"Schickes Hotel in sehr zentraler Lage, coole Dachterrasse","Wir haben als Gruppe mit 13 Personen Barcelona besucht. Eigentlich wollten wir ins Cubik,doch das war schon ausgebucht. Die Dame der Reservierungsabteilung war schon sehr nett und wir führten einen regen Emailkontakt. So gut konnte unsere Reise beginnen.
Wir wurden sehr freundlich im Hotel empfangen, man bot uns direkt beim Check.in etwas zu trinken an, egal ob Cava oder Wasser. Sehr sympathisch.
Unser Zimmer war ein Traum: sehr stylisch eingerichtet mit Blick auf die Kathedrale. Im Bad standen Duschgel, Creme und Shampoo von Rituals, sehr schön!
Das einzige Manko ist der doch etwas kleine Schrank, aber für uns als Städtereisende okay.
Beim Frühstück war das Personal sehr aufmerksam und stellte uns eine lange Tafel, so dass wir alle zusammen sitzen konnten. Der Kaffe war sehr lecker, Cafe con leche, latte Macchiato oder Capuccino, kein Problem für die freundlichen Damen.
Das Büffet ließ keine Wünsche offen: Obst, Müsli, Joghurt, süße Teilchen, Wurst, Käse, Schinken verschiedene Brotsorten und süße Teilchen. Herz,was begehrst du.
Croissants wurden an den Tisch gebracht.
Für Eierspeisen oder Süßes wie Pfannekuchen konnte man aus der Karte wählen. Echt toll!

Die Dachterrasse lädt zum Verweilen ein: Ein kleiner Pool, super Ausblick und eine Bar mit kleinen Snacks. Alles prima. Schade war nur, dass Anfang November die Sonne nachmittags nicht mehr die Kraft hatte, sie war hinter den Häusern verschwunden, das war im Cubik besser.

Uns hat es allen sehr gut gefallen, ICh würde jedem empfehlen über die Homepage zu buchen. Mit der Loyalty Card gibt es noch 5% Nachlass.

Wir wurden nicht enttäuscht und kommen gerne wieder",5,2018,11,21

61,H10 ist einfach super,"Ich war schon oft in Barcelona und habe in vielen guten Hotels gewohnt.
Meine beiden Lieblingshotels sind das H10 Port Vell und das wunderschöne Madison.
Die Lage ist super und die meisten Sehenswürdigkeiten sind zu Fuß erreichbar.
Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und äußerst kompetent.
Die Einrichtung des Hotels ist teuer und gediegen, man fühlt sich einfach wohl.
Sehr schöne wohnliche Zimmer mit hervorragenden Betten erzeugen sofort ein Wohlfühlklima.
Das Bad ist modern und alles funktioniert wie auch das gute WLAN.
Der Hammer ist die Rooftopbar mit unschlagbaren Ausblick.
Ein Tipp noch bitte zum Abendessen ins Flax & Kale gehen ca. 15 Minuten.
So gut habe ich noch selten gegessen, alles Bio und vorwiegend vegetarisch und Fisch.",5,2018,10,06

61,Rundum empfehlenswert,"Dieses Hotel ist für eine Stadt-Tour nach Barcelona sehr zu empfehlen. Die Mitarbeiter, das Haus als solches, das Frühstück, die Dachterrasse...einfach alles top. 
Leider war das Restaurant nicht geöffnet; dieses hätten wir gerne aufgesucht. 
Ein kleines Manko gab es auf der Dach-Terrasse: Nach der Karte gab es 0,5 l -Flaschen Mineralwasser. Zur Verfügung standen jedoch nur 0,25 l-Flaschen, die totzdem zum 0,5 l-Preis berechnet wurden. Nach Diskussionen mit der Bedienung wurde dies zwar bereinigt, doch sollte in einem Haus mit diesen Ansprüchen so etwas nicht passieren.",5,2018,10,05
61,Ubicación perfecta para visitar la ciudad,"El hotel está en pleno barrio gótico de Barcelona, cercano a la catedral y otros puntos turísticos de interés.

61,Terraza con buenas vistas a la Catedral,"Fuimos a este hotel a tomar unas tapas con cerveza -Vespres Inedit-, que se realitzan en las terrazas de hoteles de prestigio de Barcelona.

61,Gran apertura y areanwue,"Mi primera vez en este hotel, y después de conocer varios H10 donde la verdad es que había tenido todo tipo de experiencias. Un gran acierto haber reservado en este hotel.

Ubicación al lado de la catedral, céntrico a más no poder. La renovación del edificio para hacerlo hotel con mucho gusto y ha quedado un hotel con encanto. La recepción fue la mejor que he tenido en Barcelona los últimos 10 años. Estaban una pareja de señorita y señor en recepción y llegamos 3 compañeros juntos, de verdad que agradables a tope.

Las habitaciones muy bien insonorizadas aunque mi consejo es pedirlas en pisos altos para oír pocos ruidos. El tamaño es medio pero tiene buena decoración, gran cama con varias clases de almohada, buenas amenidades en el baño, albornoz y zapatillas a tu disposición, una ducha estupenda, un juego de luz bueno y excelente aire acondicionado

Total, que vuelvo en junio... para ver si conseguimos darle la máxima puntuación. Un hotel de un precio aceptable para la calidad que está dando. Aconsejo conocerlo",4,2018,05,29
61,Excelente,"Ubicación inmejorable para visitar el barrio gótico, el Born y el Palau de la Música Catalana. La terraza del ático tiene unas vistas impresionantes de la ciudad. Habitaciones muy cómodas y personal de recepción muy competente y amable. Volveremos. ",5,2018,05,16

Las habitaciones son muy confortables y cuentan con todo tipo de detalles, nunca habiamos probado una cama tan cómoda. Destaca el desayuno que es simplemente exquisito, puedes pedir los platos calientes y ¡te los hacen al momento!  Y, además, el personal es super atento y profesional.

Sin duda, ¡volveremos!",5,2018,05,16
61,Der ideale Standort für eine Städtetrip nach Barcelona,"Das Hotel war die ideale Unterkunft während eines Städtetrips nach Barcelona.

In dem neuen Hotel war alles perfekt. Das Team war eingespielt, netter, aufmerksamer und unaufdringlicher Service machten den Aufenthalt rundum angenehm. Das Zimmer war ausreichend groß, bestens eingerichtet, tolles Bad usw. usw.. 

Das Frühstück einzigartig. Was nicht auf dem Buffet vorrätig war konnte man aus der Frühstückskarte bestellen und wurde frisch und schmackhaft zubereitet serviert.",5,2018,04,21
61,Assolutamente da evitare,"Siamo stati tre notti in questo albergo, visibilmente nuovo. Tutto si è svolto discretamente fino alla mattina della partenza. Dovevamo lasciare la stanza alle 12, e quindi siamo tornati in camera verso le 11. Nella camera dei miei due figli di 12 e 17 anni, la cameriera aveva buttato/fatto sparire una grande serie di oggetti, tra cui due libri di scuola, gli spazzolini, i caricatori dei cellulari e molti fili elettrici. Alle nostre rimostranze li ha recuperati (secondo noi dall'immondizia, i due libri erano bagnati in parte), e ce li ha riconsegnati dentro un sacchetto nero dell'immondizia vuoto. La reception, durante il soggiorno ineccepibile, non ha battuto ciglio, e il manager dell'albergo era ""in riunione"". Abbiamo preso il taxi per l'aeroporto verso le 16, e prima di partire nessuno ci ha dato spiegazioni. Dopo vari giorni, nessun contatto dall'albergo. Una mancanza di professionalità inaudita. E' nei momenti negativi in cui si vede la qualità di un gruppo di lavoro. Albergo e staff assolutamente da evitare.",1,2018,04,08
61,Sehr schöner Aufenthalt,"Wir haben das Hotel für eine Städtereise genutzt. Die Lage ist einzigartig. Das Hotel liegt mitten in der Altstadt mit Blick auf die Kathedrale. Zur Rambla, zum Hafen und zum Place de la Catalunya ist es nicht weit. Das Hotel selbst ist neu. Überall riecht es noch neu. Absolutes Highlight ist die Dachterrasse. Das Frühstück schmeckt sehr sehr lecker. Hier findet garantiert jeder etwas. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Die Zimmer sind schön eingerichtet und auch die Größe ist für eine Städtereise absolut o. k. einziges kleines Manko: die Sauberkeit im Hotelzimmer stellte uns nicht ganz zufrieden. Auf dem Teppich im Zimmer waren während des ganzen Aufenthalts Brösel. Der Boden im Bad wurde am ersten Tag gar nicht gereinigt. Meine langen dunklen Haare lagen noch so da wie wird das Zimmer verlassen hatten. Am zweiten Tag wurde zwar das Bad gewischt, allerdings nicht gründlich genug. Es waren immer noch Haare da. Für ein vier Sterne Superior Hotel kann ich hier mehr Sauberkeit erwarten.",5,2018,04,05
61,Ottimo,"Siamo appena tornati da Barcellona dove abbiamo soggiornato per tre giorni in questo hotel. La posizione e' fantastica : a 100 metri dalla Cattedrale , nel cuore del Barrio Gotico, ma tranquillo . Le camere ed i bagni sono belle e pulite , il personale gentile e disponibile , l'atmosfera piacevole e familiare. Unica piccola pecca e' il bar : non hanno quasi mai quello che chiedi, l'hanno sempre finito. In ogni caso e' un indirizzo da tenere presente.",4,2018,03,21
61,Excelente,"Semana de trabajo de un equipo de 15 personas. Todo, absolutamente todo perfecto. Personal atento, delicado, detallista, a un nivel excelente.
La comida exquisita! Sólo hay que felicitarlos por estar a un nivel muy pocas veces alcanzable.
Enhorabuena! ",5,2018,03,20
61,Einfach nur schön,"Das Hotel ist einfach super! Sehr zentrale Lage, 15min zum Hafen, 5min zu deb berühmten Springbrunnen, halbe std. vom Flughafen. Für 6€ kann man vom Flughafen mit dem Bus zu den Springbrunnen und dann 5-10min Fußweg zum Hotel je nach Tempo.
Das Frühstück ist super, Bedienung auch und immer 1a sauber. Für ein city trip hat es die beste Lage!",5,2018,03,04

Volveremos!",5,2018,02,21
